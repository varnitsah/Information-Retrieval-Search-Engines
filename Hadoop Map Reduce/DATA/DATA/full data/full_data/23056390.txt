23056390	post haste by rm ballantyne  preface  this tale is founded chiefly on facts furnished by the postmastergenerals annual reports and gathered during personal intercourse and investigation at the general postoffice of london and its branches  it is intended to illustratenot by any means to exhaustthe subject of postal work communication and incident throughout the kingdom  i have to render my grateful acknowledgments to sir arthur blackwood his private secretary charles eden esquire and those other officers of the various departments who have most kindly afforded me every facility for investigation and assisted me to much of the information used in the construction of the tale  if it does not greatly enlighten i hope that it will at all events interest and amuse the reader  rm ballantyne    chapter one  a hero and his worshipper  once upon a timeonly once observe she did not do it twicea widow of the name of maylands went in a fit of moderate insanity and took up her abode in a lonely tumbledown cottage in the west of ireland  mrs maylands was very poor  she was the widow of an english clergyman who had left her with a small family and the smallest income that was compatible with that familys maintenance  hence the migration to ireland where she had been born and where she hoped to live economically  the tumbledown cottage was near the sea not far from a little bay named howlin cove  though little it was a tremendous bay with mighty cliffs landward and jutting ledges on either side and forbidding rocks at the entrance which waged continual warfare with the great atlantic billows that rolled into it  the whole place suggested shipwreck and smugglers  the small family of mrs maylands consisted of three babesso their mother styled them  the eldest babe marybetter known as maywas seventeen years of age and dwelt in london to which great city she had been tempted by an elderly english cousin miss sarah lillycrop who held out as baits a possible situation and a hearty welcome  the second babe philip was verging on fifteen  having kicked crashed and smashed his way though an uproarious infancy and a stormy childhood he had become a sedate earnest energetic boy with a slight dash of humour in his spirit and more than a dash of determination  the third babe was still a baby  as it plays little or no part in our tale we dismiss it with the remark that it was of the male sex and was at once the hope fear joy and anxiety of its distracted mother  so too we may dismiss miss madge stevens a poor relation who was worth her weight in gold to the widow inasmuch as she acted the part of general servant nurse mender of the household garments and recipient of joys and sorrows all of which duties she fulfilled for love and for just shelter and sustenance sufficient to keep her affectionate spirit within her rather thin but wellfavoured body  phil maylands was a heroworshipper  at the time when our tale opens he worshipped a youththe son of a retired naval officerwho possessed at least some of the qualities that are occasionally found in a hero george aspel was daring genial enthusiastic tall broadshouldered active and youngabout twenty  but george had a tendency to dissipation  his father who had recently died had been addicted to what he styled goodfellowship and grog  knowing his socalled weakness captain aspel had sent his boy to be brought up in the family of the reverend james maylands but some time before the death of that gentleman he had called him home to help to manage the small farm with which he amused his declining years  george and his father amused themselves with it to such an extent that they became bankrupt about the time of the fathers death and thus the son was left with the world before him and nothing whatever in his pocket except a tobaccopipe and a corkscrew  one day phil met george aspel taking a ramble and joined him  these two lived near to each other  indeed mrs maylands had been partly influenced in her choice of a residence by her desire to be near george  it was a bitterly cold december afternoon  as the friends reached the summit of the grey cliffs a squall fresh from the arctic regions came sweeping over the angry sea cutting the foam in flecks from the waves and whistling as if in baffled fury among the opposing crags  isnt it a grand sight said phil as they sought shelter under the lee of a projecting rock  glorious  i never look upon that sight said aspel with flashing eyes without wishing that i had lived in the days of the old vikings  the youth traced his descent from the seakings of norwaythose tremendous fellows who were wont in days of yore to ravage the shores of the known and unknown world east and west north and south leaving their indelible mark alike on the hot sands of africa and the icebound rocks of greenland  as phil maylands knew nothing of his own lineage further back than his grandfather he was free to admire the immense antiquity of his friends genealogical tree  phil was not however so completely under the fascination of his hero as to be utterly blind to his faults but he loved him and that sufficed to cover them up  sure they were a wild lot after all he said in a questioning tone as he looked up at the glowing countenance of his friend who with his bold mien bulky frame blue eyes and fair curls would have made a very creditable viking indeed had he lived in the tenth century  of course they were phil he replied looking down at his admirer with a smile  men could not well be otherwise than wild and warlike in those days but it was not all ravage and plunder with them  why it is to them and to their wise laws that we owe much of the freedom coupled with the order that prevails in our happy land and didnt they cross the atlantic ocean in things little better than herringboats without chart or compass and discover america long before columbus was born  you dont mean that said phil with increased admiration for the boy was not only smitten by his friends physical powers but by his supposed intellectual attainments  yes i do mean that returned aspel  if the norsemen of old did mischief as no one can deny they were undoubtedly grand old scoundrels and it is certain that they did much good to the world whether they meant it or not  phil maylands made no reply but continued to look meditatively at his friend until the latter laughed and asked what he was thinking about  its thinking i am what i wouldnt give if my legs were only as long as yours george  that they will soon be returned george if they go on at the rate theyve been growing of late  thats a true word anyhow but as mens legs dont go on growing at the same rate for ever its not much hope i have of mine  no george its kind of you to encourage me but the maylands have ever been a shortlegged and longbodied race  so its said  however its some comfort to know that short men are often longheaded and that many of them get on in the world pretty well  of course they do returned aspel and though they cant grow long they never stop short in the race of life  why look at nelsonhe was short and wellington wasnt long and bonny himself was small in every way except in his intellectwhos that coming up the hill  its mike kenny the postman i think  i wonder if he has brought a letter from sister may  mother expects one i know  the man who had attracted their attention was ascending towards them with the slow steady gait of a practised mountaineer  he was the postrunner of the district  being a thinlypeopled and remote region the runners walk was a pretty extensive one embracing many a mile of moorland vale and mountain  he had completed most of his walk at that time having only one mountain shoulder now between him and the little village of howlin cove where his labours were to terminate for that day  goodevening mike said george aspel as the man approached  any letters for me tonight  no sur not wan answered mike with something of a twinkle in his eye but ive left wan at rocky cottage he added turning to philip maylands  was it mays handwriting asked the boy eagerly  sure i dont know for sartin whose hand it is i the inside but its not miss mays on the cover  niver a wan in these parts could write like hercopperplate no less  come george lets go back said phil quickly weve been looking out for a letter for some days past  its not exactly a letter master phil said the postrunner slowly  ah then shed never put us off with a newspaper said phil  no its a telegram returned mike  phil maylands looked thoughtfully at the ground  a telegram he said thats strange  are ye sure mike  troth am i  without another word the boy started off at a quick walk followed by his friend and the postrunner  the latter had to diverge at that place to leave a letter at the house of a man named patrick grady  hence for a short distance they followed the same road  young maylands would have passed the house but as grady was an intimate friend of george aspel he agreed to stop just to shake hands  patrick grady was the soul of hospitality  he was not to be put off with a mere shake of the hand not hetelegrams meant nothing nowadays he said everybody sent them  no cause for alarm  they must stop and have a glass of mountain dew  aspel was resolute however he would not sit down though he had no objection to the mountain dew  accordingly the bottle was produced and a full glass was poured out for aspel who quaffed off the pure spirit with a freeandeasy toss and smack of the lips that might have rendered one of the beery old seakings envious  no sur i thank ye said mike when a similar glass was offered to him  what ye havent taken the pledge have ye said grady  no sur but ive had three glasses already on me walk an thats as much as i can rightly carry  nonsense mike  youve a stiff climb before youhere take it off  the facile postman did take it off without further remonstrance  have a dhrop phil  no thank ee said phil firmly but without giving a reason for declining  being a boy he was not pressed to drink and the party left the house a short distance farther on the road forked and here the postrunner turned off to the right taking the path which led towards the hill whose rugged shoulder he had yet to scale  mike kenny breasted it not only with the energy of youth and strength but with the additional and artificial energy infused by the spirits so that much to his own surprise his powers began to fail prematurely just then a storm of wind and sleet came down from the heights above and broke with bitter fury in his face  he struggled against it vigorously for a time till he gained a point whence he saw the dark blue sea lashing on the cliffs below  he looked up at the pass which was almost hid by the driving sleet  a feeling of regret and selfcondemnation at having so readily given in to grady was mingled with a strong sense of the duty that he had to discharge as he once more breasted the steep  the bitter cold began to tell on his exhausted frame  in such circumstances a small matter causes a man to stumble kennys foot caught on somethinga root it might beand he fell headlong into a ditch and was stunned  the cold did its work and from that ditch he never rose again  meanwhile mr grady looked out from the window of his cottage upon the gathering storm expressed some satisfaction that it did not fall to his lot to climb hills on such a day and comforted himselfthough he did not appear to stand in need of special comfortwith another glass of whisky  george aspel and philip maylands with their backs to the storm hurried homewards the former exulting in the grandthough somewhat disconnectedthoughts infused into his fiery soul by the firewater he had imbibed and dreaming of what he would have dared and done had he only been a seaking of the olden time the latter meditating somewhat anxiously on the probable nature of his sisters telegram    chapter two  tells of womans work and some of womans ways  many and varied and strange are the duties which woman has to perform in this lifeespecially in that wonderful and gigantic phase of this life which is comprehended in the word london  one chill december afternoon there sat in front of a strangelooking instrument a womanat least she was as nearly a woman as is compatible with the age of seventeen  she was also prettynot beautiful observe but prettysparklingly pretty dark dimpled demure and delightful in every way with a turnup nose a laughing eye and a kindly look  her chief duty from morning to night consisted in playing with her pretty little fingers on three white pianoforte keys  there were no other keysblack or whitein connection with these three  they stood alone and had no music whatever in themnothing but a click nevertheless this young woman whose name was may maylands played on them with a constancy and a deft rapidity worthy of a great if not a musical cause  from dawn to dusk and day by day did she keep those three keys clicking and clittering as if her life depended on the result and so in truth it did to some extent for her bread and butter depended on her performances on that very meagre piano  although an artless and innocent young girl fresh from the western shores of erin may had a peculiar and in one of her age and sex almost pert way of putting questions to which she often received quaint and curious replies  for instance one afternoon she addressed to a learned doctor the following query  can you send copy last prescription  lost it  face red as a carrot in agonies  what shall i do  help  to which the learned doctor gave the matteroffact but inelegant reply  stick your feet in hot water  go to bed at once  prescription sent by post  take it every hour  but may maylands did not stick her feet in hot water neither did she go to bed or take any physic  indeed there was no occasion to do so for a clear complexion and pink cheeks told of robust health  on another occasion she asked an irish farmer if he could send her twenty casks of finest butter to cost not more than 6 pence per pound  to which the farmer was rude enough to answernot by no manner of means  in short mays conduct was such that we must hasten to free her from premature condemnation by explaining that she was a female telegraphist in what we may call the literary lungs of londonthe general postoffice at st martinslegrand  on that chill december afternoon during a brief lull in her portion of the telegraphic communication of the kingdom may leaned her little head on her hand and sent her mind to the little cottage by the sea already described as lying on the west coast of ireland with greater speed than ever she flashed those electric sparks which it was her business to scatter broadcast over the land  the hamlet near which the cottage stood nestled under the shelter of a cliff as if in expectation and dread of being riven from its foundations by the howling winds or whelmed in the surging waves  the cottage itself was on the outskirts of the hamlet farther to the south  the mind of may entered through its closed doorfor mind like electricity laughs at bolts and bars  there was a buzz of subdued sound from more than twelve hundred telegraphists male and female in that mighty telegraphhall of saint martinslegrand but may heard it not  dozens upon dozens of tables each with its busy occupantstables to right of her tables to left of her tables in rear of her tables in front of herswept away from her in bewildering perspective but may saw them not  the clicking of six or seven hundred instruments broke upon her ear as they flashed the news of the world over the length and breadth of the land pulsating joy and sorrow surprise fear hope despair and gladness to thousands of anxious hearts but may regarded it not  she heard only the booming of the great sea and saw her mother seated by the fire darning socks with madge engaged in household work and phil tumbling with babybrother on the floor making new holes and rents for fresh darns and patches  mrs maylands was a student and lover of the bible  her children though a good deal wilder were sweettempered like herself  it is needless to add that in spite of adverse circumstances they were all moderately happy  the fair telegraphist smiled almost laughed as her mind hovered over the home circle  from the contemplation of this pleasant and romantic picture she was roused by a familiar rustle at her elbow  recalling her mind from the west of ireland she fixed it on a mass of telegrams which had just arrived from various parts of the city  they had been sucked through several pneumatic tubesvarying from a few yards to two miles in lengthhad been checked assorted registered and distributed by boys to the various telegraphists to whose lot they fell  may maylands chanced by a strange coincidence to command the instrument in direct connection with cork  the telegrams just laid beside her were those destined for that city and the regions to which it was a centre of redistribution  among others her own village was in connection with it and many a time had she yearned to touch her keys with a message of love to her mother but the rules of the office sternly forbade this  the communicative touch which she dispensed so freely to others was forbidden to herself  if she or any other telegraphist in st martinslegrand wished to send a private message it became necessary to step out of the office go to the appointed place pay her shilling and become one of the public for the occasion every one can see the necessity for such a rule in the circumstances  mays threekeyed machine by the way did not actually send forth the electricity  it only punched holes in a long tape of white paper which holes according to their relative arrangement represented the alphabet  having punched a message by playing on the keys she transferred her tape to the electric machine at her elbow and passed it through  this transmitting machine was automatic or self acting  it required only to be fed with perforated tapes  in ireland the receivingmachine presented its messages in the form of dots and dashes which according to arrangement became alphabetic  you dont understand this reader eh  it would be surprising if you did  a treatise on electric telegraphy would be required to make it clear supposing you to have a mechanical turn of mind  suffice it to say that the wheatstone telegraph instrument tapes off its messages at the rate of 100 words a minute  but to return  with a sigh may maylands cast her eyes on the uppermost telegram  it ran thus  buy the horse at any price  hes a spanker  let the pigs go for what theyll fetch  this was enough  romance domesticity and home disappeared probably with the message along the wire and the spirit of business descended on the little woman as she applied herself once more to the matteroffact manipulation of the keys  that evening as may left the postoffice and turned sharply into the dark street she came into collision with a lettercarrier  oh  miss he exclaimed with polite anxiety i beg your pardon  the sleet drivin in my face prevented my seeing you  youre not hurt i hope  no mr flint you havent hurt me said may laughing as she recognised the voice of her own landlord  why its you miss may  now isnt that good luck my turnin up just in the nick o time to see you home  here catch hold of my arm  the winds fit to tear the lampposts up by the roots  but this is not the way home objected the girl  thats true miss may it aint but im only goin round a bit by st pauls churchyard  theres a shop there where they sell the sausages my old oomans so fond of  it dont add more than a few yards to the road home  the old ooman to whom solomon flint referred was his grandmother flint himself had spent the greater part of his life in the service of the postoffice and was now a widower well stricken in years  his grandmother was one of those almost indestructible specimens of humanity who live on until the visage becomes deeply corrugated contemporaries have become extinct and age has become a matter of uncertainty  flint had always been a good grandson but when his wife died the love he had borne to her seemed to have been transferred with additional vehemence to the old ooman  theres a present for you old ooman said flint placing the paper of sausages on the table on entering his humble abode and proceeding to divest himself of his waterproof cape just let me catch hold of a fryinpan and ill give you to understand what a blowout means  youre a good laddie sol said the old woman rousing herself and speaking in a voice that sounded as if it had begun its career far back in the previous century  mrs flint was scotch and although she had lived from early womanhood in london had retained something of the tone and much of the pronunciation of the land o cakes  yell be wat lassie she said to may who was putting off her bonnet and shawl in a corner  no grannie returned the girl using a term which the old woman had begged her to adopt im not wet only a little damp  change your feet lassie direcly or youll tak cauld said mrs flint in a peremptory tone  may laughed gently and retired to her private boudoir to change her shoes  the boudoir was not more than eight feet by ten in size and very poorly furnished but its neat methodical arrangements betokened in its owner a refined and orderly mind  there were a few books in a stand on the table and a flowerpot on the windowsill  among the pegs and garments on the walls was a square piece of cardboard on which was emblazoned in scarlet silk the text god is love  this hung at the foot of the bed so as to be the first object to greet the girls eyes on awaking each morning  below it hung a row of photographs embracing the late reverend james maylands his widow his son philip his distant relative madge and the baby  these were so arranged as to catch the faint gleam of light that penetrated the window but as there was a twentyfoot brick wall in front of the window at a distance of two yards the gleam even on a summer noon was not intense  in winter it was barely sufficient to render darkness visible  poor may maylands  it was a tremendous change to her from the free air and green fields of ireland to a small back street in the heart of london but necessity had required the change  her mothers income could not comfortably support the family  her own salary besides supporting herself was devoted to the enlargement of that income and as it amounted to only 50 pounds a year there was not much left to pay for lodgings etcetera  it is true miss lillycrop would have gladly furnished may with board and lodging free but her house was in the neighbourhood of pimlico and mays duties made it necessary that she should live within a short distance of the general postoffice  miss lillycrop had heard of the flints as being goodhearted and trusty people and advised her cousin to board with them at least until some better arrangement could be made for her  meanwhile may was to go and spend part of every sunday with miss lillycrop at number 9 purr street  well grannie said may returning to the front room where the sausages were already hissing deliciously what news have you for me tonight  she sat down beside the old woman took her hand and spoke in that cheery cosy confidential way which renders some women so attractive  deed may theres little but the auld storymercies mornin noon and night  but oo ay i was maist forgettin miss lillycrap was here an left ye a message o some sort  and what was the message grannie  shes gone and forgot it said solomon flint putting the sausages on the table which had already been spread for supper by a stout little girl who was the sole domestic of the house and attendant on mrs flint youve no chance of getting it now miss may for ive noticed that when the old ooman once forgets a thing it dont come back to her except praps a week or two afterwards  come now draw in and go to work  but praps dollops may have heard the message  hallo dollops come here and bring the kettle with you  dollopsthe little girl above referred towas particularly small and shy ineffably stupid and remarkably fat  it was the last quality which induced solomon to call her dollops  her hair and garments stuck out from her in wild dishevelment but she was not dirty  nothing belonging to mrs flint was allowed to become dirty  did you see miss lillycrop dollops asked solomon as the child emerged from some sort of back kitchen  yes sir i did i sawd er agoin hout  did you hear her leave a message  yes sir i did  i eard er say to missis be sure that you give may maylands my love an tell er wotever she do to keep er feet dry an dont forgit the message an say im so glad about it though its not much to speak of arter all  what was she so glad about demanded solomon  i dun know sir  she said no more in my earin than that  i only comed in wen she was agoin hout  praps it was about the findin of er gloves in er pocket wen she was a talkin to missis which she thought shed lost though they wasnt wuth pickin up out of the  pooh be off to your pots an pans child said flint turning to his grandmother who sat staring at the sausages with a blank expression you cant remember it i spose eh  mrs flint shook her head and began to eat  thats right old ooman said her grandson patting her shoulder heap up the coals mayhap itll revive the memory  but mrs flints memory was not so easily revived  she became more abstracted than usual in her efforts to recover it  supper passed and was cleared away  the old woman was placed in her easy chair in front of the fire with the cather chief evening amusementon her knee the lettercarrier went out for his evening walk dollops proceeded miscellaneously to clean up and smash the crockery and may sat down to indite an epistle to the inmates of rocky cottage  suddenly mrs flint uttered an exclamation  may she cried and hit the cat an involuntary slap on the face which sent it with a caterwaul of indignant surprise from her knee it wasnt a message it was a letter  having thus unburdened her mind the old woman relapsed into the previous century from which she could not be recalled  may therefore made a diligent search for the letter and found it at last under a cracked teapot on the mantelpiece where mrs flint had told miss lillycrop to place it for safety  it was short but satisfactory and ran thus  dearest mayive been to see my friend in power and he says its all right that youve only to get your brother over as soon as possible and hell see to getting him a situation  the enclosed paper is for his and your guidance  excuse hasteyour affectionate coz sarah lillycrop  it need hardly be said that may maylands finished her letter with increased satisfaction and posted it that night  next morning she wrote out a telegram as followslet phil come here at once  the application has been successful  never mind clothes everything arranged  best love to all  the last clause was added in order to get the full value for her money she naturally underscored the words at once forgetting for the moment that in telegraphy a word underlined counts as two words  she was therefore compelled to forego the emphasis  this message she did not transmit through her own professional instrument but gave it in at the nearest district office  it was at once shot bodily with a bundle of other telegrams through a pneumatic tube and thus reached st martinslegrand in one minute thirtyfive seconds or about twenty minutes before herself  chancing to be the uppermost message it was flashed off without delay crossed the irish channel and entered the office at cork in about six minutes  here there was a short delay of halfanhour owing to other telegrams which had prior claim to attention  then it was flashed to the west coast which it reached long before the letter posted on the previous night and not long after may had seated herself at her own threekeyed instrument  but there telegraphic speed was thwarted by unavoidable circumstances the postrunner having already started on his morning rounds and it was afternoon before the telegram was delivered at rocky cottage  this was the telegram which had caused philip maylands so much anxiety he read it at last with great relief and at the same time with some degree of sadness when he thought of leaving his mother unprotected in her lonely cottage by the sea    chapter three  brilliant prospects  madgewhose proper name was marjory stevenswas absent when mays letter arrived the following day  on her return to the cottage she was taken into the committee which sat upon the subject of phils appointment  its not a very grand appointment said mrs maylands with a sigh  sure its not an appointment at all yet mother returned phil who held in his hand the paper of instructions enclosed in mays letter beggars you know mustnt be choosers an if im not a beggar its next thing to it i am  besides if the position of a boytelegraphmessenger isnt very exalted in itself its the first step to better things  isnt the first round of a ladder connected with the top round  thats true phil said madge theres nothing to prevent your becoming postmastergeneral in course of time  nothing whatever that i know of returned phil  perhaps somebody else knows of something that may prevent it said his mother with an amused smile  perhaps exclaimed the boy with a twinkle in his eye dont talk to me of perhapses im not to be damped by such things  now just consider this he continued looking over the paper in his hand here we have it all in print  i must apply for the situation in writin no less  well i can do it in copperplate if they please  then my age must be not less than fourteen and not more than fifteen  that suits to a t said madge  yes and but hallo what have we here said phil with a look of dismay  what is it asked his mother and madge in the same breath with looks of real anxiety  well well its too bad said phil slowly it says here that im to have no claim on the superannuation fund  isnt that hard  a smile from mrs maylands and a laugh from madge greeted this  it was also received with an appalling yell from the baby which caused mother and nurse to leap to the rescue  that sprout of mischief in the course of an experimental tour of the premises had climbed upon a sidetable had twisted his right foot into the loop of the windowcurtains had fallen back and hung head downwards howling  having been comforted with bread and treacle and put to bed the committee meeting was resumed  well then said phil consulting his paper again i give up the superannuation advantages  then as to wages seven shillings a week rising to eight shillings after one years service  why its a fortune  any man at my age can live on sixpence a day easythats threeandsix leaving threeandsix a week clear for you mother  then theres a uniform just think o that  i wonder what sort of uniform it is said madge  a red coat madge and blue trousers with silver lace and a brass helmet for certain  dont talk nonsense boy interrupted mrs maylands but go on with the paper  oh theres nothing more worth mentioning said phil folding the paper except that boymessengers if they behave themselves have a chance of promotion to boysorterships indoortelegraphmessengerships junior sorterships and lettercarrierships on their reaching the age of seventeen and i suppose secretaryships and postmastergeneralships with a baronetcy on their attaining the age of methuselah  its the very thing for me mother so ill be off tomorrow if  phil was cut short by the bursting open of the door and the sudden entrance of his friend george aspel  come phil he cried blazing with excitement theres a wreck in the bay  quick theres no time to lose  the boy leaped up at once and dashed out after his friend  it was evening  the gale which had blown for two days was only beginning to abate  dark clouds were split in the western sky by gleams of fiery light as the sun declined towards its troubled oceanbed  hurrying over the fields and bending low to the furious blast aspel and philip made their way to the neighbouring cliffs  but before we follow them reader to the wavelashed shore it is necessary for the satisfactory elucidation of our tale that we should go backward a short way in time and bound forward a long way into space    chapter four  the royal mail steamer  out far out on the mighty sea a large vessel makes her way gallantly over the billowshomeward bound  she is a royal mail steamer from the southern hemispherethe tridentand a right royal vessel she looks with her towering iron hull and her taper masts and her two thick funnels and her trim rigging and her clean decksfor she has an awning spread over them to guard from smoke as well as from sun  there is a large family on board of the trident and like all other large families its members display marked diversities of character they also exhibit like not a few large families remarkable diversities of temper  among them there are several human magnets with positive and negative poles which naturally draw together  there are also human flints and steels which cannot come into contact without striking fire  when the trident got up steam and bade adieu to the southern cross there was no evidence whatever of the varied explosives and combustibles which she carried in her aftercabin  the fifty or sixty passengers who waved kerchiefs wiped their eyes and blew their noses at friends on the receding shore were unknown to each other they were intent on their own affairs  when obliged to jostle each other they were all politeness and urbanity  after the land had sunk on the horizon the introcircumvolutions of a large family or rather a little world began  there was a birth on board an engagement ay and a death yet neither the interest of the first nor the romance of the second nor the solemnity of the last could check for more than a few hours the steady development of the family characteristics of love modesty hate frivolity wisdom and silliness  a proportion of the passengers were of course nobodies who aspired to nothing greater than to live and let live and who went on the even tenor of their way without much change from first to last  some of them were somebodies who after a short time began to expect the recognition of that fact  there were ambitious bodies who in some cases aimed too high and there were unpretendingbodies who frequently aimed too low  there were also selfishbodies who of course thought only of themselveswith perhaps a slight passing reference to those among the aftercabin passengers who could give them pleasure and there were selfforgettingbodies who turned their thoughts frequently on the ship the crew the sea the solar system the maker of the universe these also thought of their fellowpassengers in the forecabin who of course had a little family or world of their own with its similar joys and sins and sorrows before the mast and there were uproariousbodies who kept the little world livelysometimes a little too lively  as the royal mail steamer rushed out to sea and was tossed on the oceans breast these human elements began to mix and effervesce and amalgamate or fizz burst and go off like squibs and crackers  there was a mrs pods with three little girls and a mrs tods with two little boys whose first casual glance at each other was transmuted into a glare of undying and unreasoning hate  these ladies were exceptions to the rule of general urbanity before mentioned  both had fiery faces and each read the other through and through at a glance  there was a miss bluestocking who charmed some people irritated others frightened a few and caused many to sneer  her chief friend among the males was a young man named mr weakeyes who had a small opinion of himself and a very receptive mind  miss troolove among the ladies was her chief friend  the strange misnomers which one meets with in society were also found in the little world in that steamerthat royal mail steamer we should sayfor while we turn aside for a brief period to condescend upon these particulars we would not have the reader forget that they have an indirect bearing on the main thread of our tale  one misnamed lady was a miss mist who instead of being light airy and ethereal as she ought to have been weighed at least twelve stone six  but she sang divinely was a great favourite with the young people on board and would have been very much missed indeed if she had not been there  there was also a mr stout who was the tallest and thinnest man in the ship  on the other hand there were some whose names had been obviously the result of a sense of propriety in some one  among the men who were rabidly set on distinguishing themselves in one way or another was a major beak  now why was it that this majors nose was an aquiline of the most outrageous dimensions  surely no one would argue that the nose grew to accommodate the name  is it not more probablenay certain that the name grew to accommodate the nose  of course when major beak was born he was a minor and his nose must have been no better than a badlyshaped button or piece of putty but the majors father had owned a tremendous aquiline nose which at birth had also been a button and so on we can proceed backwards until we drive the beaks into that remote antiquity where historical fact begins and mythological theory terminatesthat period when men were wont it is supposed to name each other intelligently with reference to personal characteristic or occupation  so too mr brighta hearty goodnatured fellow who drew powerfully to major beak and hated miss bluestockingpossessed the vigorous frame animated air and intelligent look which must have originated his name but why go on  every reader must be well acquainted with the characters of mr fiery and mr stiff and mrs dashington and her niece miss squeaker and colonel blare who played the cornet and lieutenant limp who sang tenor and dr bassoon who roared bass and mrs silky who was all things to all men besides being everything by turns and nothing long and lady tower and miss gentle and mr blurt and miss dumbbelle  suffice it to say that after a week or two the effervescing began to systematise and the family became a living and complex electrical machine whose sympathetic poles drew and stuck together while the antagonistic poles kept up a steady discharge of sparks  then there arose a gale which quieted the machine a little and checked the sparkling flow of wit and humour  when during the course of the gale a toppling billow overbalanced itself and fell inboard with a crash that nearly split the deck open sweeping two of the quarterboats away mr blurt sitting in the saloon was heard to exclaim  pon my word its a terrible galeenough almost to make a fellow think of his sins  to which mrs tods who sat beside him replied with a serious shake of her head that it was indeed a very solemn occasion and cast a look not of undying hate but of gentle appeal at mrs pods who sat opposite to her  and that lady so far from resenting the look as an affront met her in a liberal spirit not only admitted that what mrs tods had said was equally just and true but even turned her eyes upward with a look of resignation  well was it for mrs pods that she did so for her resigned eyes beheld the globe of the cabin lamp pitched off its perch by a violent lurch and coming straight at her  thus she had time to bow to circumstances and allow the missile to pass over her head into the bosom of lady tower where it was broken to atoms  the effect of mutual concession was so strong on mrs pods and mrs tods that the former secretly repented having wished that one of mrs tods little sons might fall down the hatchway and get maimed for life while the latter silently regretted having hoped that one of mrs pods little girls might fall overboard and be halfdrowned  but the storm passed away and the effervescence returnedthough not it is pleasing to add with so much pungency as before  thus night and day the steamer sped on over the southern seas across the mystic line and into the northern hemisphere with the written records hopes commands and wishes of a continent in the mailbags in her hold and leaving a beautiful milkyway behind her  but there were more than letters and papers in these mailbags  there were diamonds  not indeed those polished and glittering gems whose proper restingplace is the brow of beauty but those uncut pebbles that are turned up at the mines which the ignorant would fling away or give to their children as playthings but for which merchants and experts would give hundreds and thousands of pounds  a splendid prize that royal mail steamer would have been for the buccaneers of the olden time but happily there are no buccaneers in these daysat least not in civilised waters  a famous pirate had however set his heart on those diamondseven old neptune himself  this is how it happened    chapter five  wreck and rescue  one evening miss gentle and rotund little mr blurt were seated on two campstools near the stern conversing occasionally and gazing in a dreamy frame of mind at the milkyway over which they appeared to travel  i wonder much miss gentle said mr blurt that you were not more afraid during that gale we had just before crossing the line  i was a good deal afraid though perhaps i did not show it  your remark she added with an arch glance at her companion induces me to express some surprise that you seemed so much afraid  afraid echoed mr blurt with a smile why i wasnt afraideh was i  i beg pardon hastily explained miss gentle i dont mean frightened of course perhaps i should have said alarmed or agitated  agitated cried mr blurt pulling off his hat and rubbing his bald headhe was prematurely bald being only forty though he looked like fiftyagitated  well miss gentle if you had diamonds  he stopped short and looked at his companion with a confused smile  diamonds mr blurt said miss gentle slightly surprised what do you mean  wellha hem said the other rubbing his forehead i see no reason why i should make a mystery of it  since i have mentioned the thing i may as well say that a man who happens to have a packet of diamonds in the mailbags worth about twenty thousand pounds may well be excused showing some little agitation lest the ship containing them should go to the bottom  i dont quite see that returned miss gentle  if the owner is on board and goes to the bottom with his diamonds it does not matter to him does it  ah said mr blurt it is the inconsiderateness of youth which prompts that speech  miss gentle looked about twenty though she was in reality twentyseven  do you think i have no anxiety for any one but myself  suppose i have a wife and family in england who are dependent on these diamonds  ah that did not occur to me returned the lady  have you any objection to become a confidante asked mr blurt  none whatever replied miss gentle laughing  well then to let you understand my feelings i shall explain  i have a brothera dear little fellow like mysah excuse me i did not mean dear like myself but little  well he is a naturalist  he lives in london and is not a very successful naturalist indeed i may say that he is an unfortunate and poor naturalist  last year he failed  i sent him a small sum of money  he failed again  i sent him more money being a successful diamondmerchant you see i could afford to do so we are both bachelors my brother being much older than i am  at last i resolved to send home my whole fortune and return to live with him after winding up my affairs  i did so made up my diamonds into a parcel and sent it by mail as being the most secure method  just after doing this i got a letter informing me of my brother being dangerously ill and begging me to come to england without delay  i packed up at once left my partner to wind up the business and so here i am on board the very steamer that carries my diamonds to england  how curiousand how interesting said the sympathetic miss gentle  whatever more she intended to say was checked by a large particoloured ball hitting her on the cheek and falling into her lap  it was followed up and captured with a shriek by the two little todses and the three little podses  at the same moment the gong sounded for tea  thus the conversation came to a close  the voyage of the tridentwith the exception of the gale before referred towas prosperous until her arrival in the waters of the northern hemisphere  by that time the passengers had crystallised into groups the nobodies and selfforgettingbodies fraternised and became more and more friendly as time went on  the uproariousbodies got up concerts and charades  the hatred of pods for tods intensified  the arrogance of major beak and the goodnatured modesty of mr bright increased  the noise of dr bassoon made the manner of mr silky quite agreeable by contrast while the pride of lady tower and mr stiff formed a fine deepshade to the neutral tint of miss gentle and the highlight of miss squeaker  gradually however feelings began to modify  the squalls and breezes that ruffled the human breasts on board the trident moderated in exact proportion as that vessel penetrated and experienced the storms of what should have been named the intemperate zone  at last they drew near to the shores of old england and then there burst upon them a norwester so violent that within the first hour the closereefed topsails were blown to ribbons and the foretopmast with the jibboom was carried away  of course this was a comparatively small matter in a steamer but when it was afterwards discovered that the vessel had sprung a leak things began to look more serious  its only a trifle miss gentle dont alarm yourself  we can put that to rights in a few minutes said major beak with the confident air of a man whose nautical education had begun with noah and continued uninterruptedly down to the present time  hes a hookednosed humbug miss gentle an knows nothing about it growled the captain  water rising rapidly in the hold sir said the carpenter coming aft and touching his cap  rig the pumps said the captain and the pumps were rigged  what is more to the purpose they were wrought with a will by the crew but in spite of their efforts the water continued to rise  it might have done a student of human nature good to have observed the effect of this information on the passengers  regarded as a whole the little world became perceptibly paler in the cheeks and strikingly moderate in tone of voice and manner  major beak in particular began to talk low and made no reference whatever to nautical matters while mrs pods looked amiablyalmost affectionatelyat mrs tods  of course the passengers observed with breathless interest the action of the captain at this crisis  that important personage did his best to stop the leak but only succeeded in checking it and it required the constant exertions of the crew night and day at the pumps to reduce the water in the hold even by an inch  in these circumstances the young men among the passengers readily volunteered their services to assist the crew  the gale continued and steadily increased  at night the ladies and such of the passengers as were not employed at the pumps retired to the cabin  some of those who did not realise the danger of the situation went to bed  others sat up in the saloon and consoled each other as best they might  morning came but with it came no abatement of the storm  water and sky seemed mingled together and were of one uniform tone  it was obvious that the men at the pumps were utterly exhausted and worst of all the water was beginning to gain slowly on them  the elderly men were now called on to help  it became necessary that all should work for their lives  miss bluestocking who was muscular as well as masculine rose to the occasion and suggested that the ladies so to speak should man the pumps  her suggestion was not acted on  at this point mr bright who had been toiling night and day like an inexhaustible giant suggested that music might be called in to aid their flagging powers  it was well known that fatigued soldiers on a march are greatly reinvigorated by the band  major beak soaking from head to foot with salt water almost blind with fatigue and want of sleep and with the perspiration dropping from the point of his enormous nose plucked up heart to raise himself and assert that that was true he further suggested that colonel blare might play to them on the cornet  but colonel blare was incapable by that time of playing even on a penny trumpet  dr bassoon was reduced so low as to be obliged to half whisper his incapacity to sing bass and as for the great tenor lieutenant limpa piece of tape was stiffer than his backbone  let the ladies sing to us sighed mr fiery who was mere milk and water by that time  im sure that mrs tods and mrs pods would be  a united shriek of protest from those ladies checked him  or miss troolove suggested mr blurt on whose stout person the labour told severely  the lady appealed to after a little hesitation began a hymn but the time was found to be too slow while the voice although sweet and true was too weak  come let us have one of the christy minstrels cried mr bright in a lively tone  im certain miss mist can sing one  poor miss mist was almost hysterical with fear and prolonged anxiety but she was an obliging creature  on being assured that the other ladies would support her she struck up the land of dixey and was joined in the chorus with so much spirit that those who laboured at the pumps felt like giants refreshed  explain it how we may there can be no question that lively music has a wonderful power of sustaining the energies of mankind  with the return of cheerful sensations there revived in some of them the sense of the ludicrous and it was all that they could do to refrain from laughter as they looked at the forlorn females huddled together wrapped in rugs and cloaks drenched to the skin almost blown from their seats ghastly with watching and fear solemnvisaged in the last degree and yet singing pop goes the weasel and similar ditties with all the energy of despair  we paint no fanciful picture  we describe facts and there is no saying how far the effect of that music might have helped in the saving of the ship had not an event occurred which rendered further efforts unnecessary  the captain who had either lost his reckoning or his head or both was seen to apply himself too frequently to a casebottle in the cabin and much anxiety began to be felt as to his capacity to manage the vessel owing also to the length of time that thick weather had prevailed no reliable observation had been obtained for several days  while the anxiety was at its height there came a sudden and terrible shock which caused the good ship to tremble  then for the first time the roar of breakers was heard above the howling of the storm  as if to increase the horror of the scene the fog lifted and revealed towering cliffs close ahead of them  the transition from a comparatively hopeful state to one of absolute despair was overwhelming  the wild waves lifted the great hull of the vessel and let it down on the rocks with another crash sending the masts over the side while the passengers could only shriek in agony and cling to the wreck  fortunately in taking the ground the vessel had kept straight so that the forepart formed a comparative shelter from the waves that were fast breaking up the stern  in the midst of all this confusion the first mate and mr bright seemed to keep quite cool  between them they loaded and fired the bow signalguns several times by which means they brought a few fishermen and coastguardmen to the scene of disaster  and among these as we have seen were our heroes philip maylands and george aspel  on arriving these two found that the rocket apparatus was being set up on the beach  phil said aspel in a quick low voice theyll want the lifeboat and the wind carries the sound of their guns in the wrong direction  run round lad and give the alarm  theres not a moment to lose  the boy turned to run without a word of reply but he could not help observing as he turned the compressed lips the expanding nostrils and the blazing eyes of his friend who almost quivered with suppressed excitement  for some time george aspel stood beside the men of the coastguard while they set up their apparatus and fired the rocket  to offer assistance he knew would only retard them  the first rocket was carried to the right of the vessel which was now clearly visible  the second went to the other side  there was a reef of rocks on that side which lay a few yards farther out from the beach than the wreck  over this reef the rocketline fell and got entangled  part of the shoreend of the apparatus also broke down  while the men were quickly repairing it aspel said in a hurried mannerill clear the rocketline and away he darted like a greyhound  hold haard foolish fellow youll be drownded roared one of the men  but aspel heeded him not  another minute and he was far away on the ledge of rock jutting out from a high capethe point of which formed the outlying reef above referred to  he was soon at the extremity of the ledge beyond which nearly a hundred yards of seething foam heaved between him and the reef  in he plunged without a moments halt  going with the rush of the waves through the channel he struck diagonally across and landed on the reef  every billow swept over it but not with sufficient force to prevent his struggling towards the rocketline which he eventually reached and cleared  wasnt that nately done cried an enthusiastic young fisherman on the beach but och what is he up to now  a few seconds sufficed to give an answer to his question  instead of letting go the line and returning young aspel tied it round his waist and ran or waded to the extreme edge of the reef which was nearest to the wreck  the vessel lay partially to leeward of him now with not much space between but that space was a very whirlpool of tormented waves  aspel gave no moment to thought  in his then state of mind he would have jumped down the throat of a cannon  next instant he was battling with the billows and soon reached the ship but now his danger was greatest for the curling waves threw him so violently against the side of the wreck that he almost lost consciousness and missed the lifebuoy which with a rope attached had been thrown to him by the anxious crew  a great cry of anxiety arose at this but mr bright had anticipated it and the first mate was ready to aid him  leaping into the sea with a rope round his waist mr bright caught aspel as he struggled past  the mates powerful hands held them both fast  some of the crew lent a ready hand and in a few seconds george aspel was hauled on board  he had quite recovered by that time and replied with a smile to the ringing cheer that greeted him  the cheer was echoed again and again by the men on shore  major beak attempted to grasp his hand but failed mr blurt feeling an irresistible impulse tried to embrace him but was thrust aside fell and rolled into the leescuppers  scattering the people aside aspel sprang on the bulwarks at the bow and snatching mr stiffs travellingcap from his head held it up as a signal to the men on shore  well did the youth know what to do in the circumstances for many a time had he talked it over with the men of the coastguard in former days  on receiving an answering signal from the shore he began to haul on the rocketline  the men in charge had fastened to it a block or pulley with two tails to it a line was rove through this block  the instant the block reached his hands aspel sprang with it to the stump of the foremast and looking round cried wholl lend a  here you are said mr bright embracing the mast with both arms and stoopingfor mr bright also knew well what to do  george aspel leaped on his shoulders and stood up  mr bright then raised himself steadily and thus the former was enabled to tie the block by its two tails to the mast at a height of about eleven feet the line rove through the block was the whip which was to be manipulated by those on shore  it was a double and of course an endless line  again the signal was given as before and the line began to run  very soon a stout hawser or cable was seen coming out to the wreck  aspel fastened the end of this to the mast several feet below the pulley  a third time the signal was given  now then ladies stand by to go ashore and lets have no hesitation its life or death with us all said the mate in a voice so stern that the crowd of anxious and somewhat surprised females prepared to obey  presently a ringshaped lifebuoy with something like a pair of short breeches dangling from it came out from the shore suspended to a block which traversed on the cable and was hauled out by means of the whip  a seaman was ordered to get into it  mrs tods who stood beside the mate eyeing the process somewhat curiously felt herself firmly but gently seized  come mrs tods step into it  hell take care of youno fear  never never without my two darlings shrieked mrs tods  but mrs tods was tenderly lifted over the side and placed in the powerful arms of the sailor  her sons instantly set up a howl and rushed towards her  but mr bright had anticipated this also and with the aid of a seaman arrested them  meanwhile the signal having been given the men on the land pulled in the cradle and mrs tods went shrieking over the hissing billows to the shore  a few minutes more and out came the cradle again  now then for the two darlings growled the mate  they were forcibly put over the side and sent howling to their mother  after them went mrs pods who profiting by the experience of her friend made no resistance  this however was more than counterbalanced by the struggles of her three treasures who immediately followed  but the shades of evening were now falling and it was with an anxious feeling at his heart that the mate surveyed the cluster of human beings who had yet to be saved while each roaring wave that struck the wreck seemed about to break it up  suddenly there arose a cry of joy and looking seaward the bright white and blue form of the lifeboat was seen coming in like an angel of light on the crests of the foaming seas  we may not stay to describe what followed in detail  the lifeboats anchor was let go to windward of the wreck and the cable paid out until the boat forged under the vessels lee where it heaved on the boiling foam so violently that it was difficult to prevent it being stove in and still more difficult to get the women and children passed on board soon the lifeboat was fullas full as she could holdand many passengers yet remained to be rescued  the officer in charge of the mailbags had got them up under the shelter of the companionhatch ready to be put into the boat but human life was of more value than lettersay even than diamonds  now then one other lady  only room for one roared the mate who stood with pistol in hand near the gangway  miss gentle tried to get to the front but lady tower stepped in before her  never mind little woman said mr bright encouragingly the rocket apparatus is still at work and the wreck seems hard and fast on the reef  youll get off next trip  but i cant bear to think of going by that awful thing said miss gentle shuddering and sheltering herself from the blinding spray under the lee of brights large and powerful body  well then he returned cheerfully the lifeboat will soon return youll go ashore with the mails  mr bright was right about the speedy return of the lifeboat with her gallant crew who seemed to rejoice in danger as if in the presence of a familiar friend but he was wrong about the wreck being hard and fast the rising tide shifted her a little and drove her a few feet farther in  when the other women and children were got into the boat mr bright who stood near the mailbags looking anxiously at them left his position for a moment to assist miss gentle to the gangway  she had just been safely lowered when a tremendous wave lifted the wreck and hurled it so far over the reef that the fore part of the vessel was submerged in a pool of deep water lying between it and the shore  mr bright looked back and saw the hatchway disappearing  he made a desperate bound towards it but was met by the rush of the crew who now broke through the discipline that was no longer needed and jumped confusedly into the lifeboat on the sea carrying bright along with them  on recovering his feet he saw the ship make a final plunge forward and sink to the bottom so that nothing was left above water but part of the two funnels  the splendid lifeboat was partly drawn down but not upset  she rose again like a cork and in a few seconds freed herself from water through the discharging tubes in her bottom  the men struggling in the water were quickly rescued and the boat having finished her noble work made for the shore amid cheers of triumph and joy  among all the passengers in that lifeboat there was only one whose visage expressed nothing but unutterable woe  why mr bright said miss gentle who clung to one of the thwarts beside him and was struck by his appearance you seem to have broken down all at once  what has happened  the mailbags groaned mr bright  why do you take so deep an interest in the mails asked miss gentle  because i happen to be connected with the postoffice and though i have no charge of them i cant bear to see them lost said mr bright with another groan as he turned his eyes wistfullynot to the shore at which all on board were eagerly gazingbut towards the wreck of the royal mail steamer trident the top of whose funnels rose black and defiant in the midst of the raging waves    chapter six  treats of poverty pride and fidelity  behind a very fashionable square in a very unfashionable little street in the west end of london dwelt miss sarah lillycrop  that ladys portion in this life was a scanty wardrobe a small apartment a remarkably limited income and a tender religious spirit from this it will be seen that she was rich as well as poor  her age was by a curious coincidence exactly proportioned to her incomethe one being forty pounds and the other forty years  she added to the former with difficulty by teaching and to the latter unavoidably by living  by means of a wellknown quality styled economy she more than doubled her income and by uniting prayer with practice and a gracious mien she did good as it were at the rate of five hundred or five thousand a year  it could not be said however that miss lillycrop lived well in the ordinary sense of that expression  to those who knew her most intimately it seemed a species of standing miracle that she contrived to exist at all for she fed chiefly on toast and tea  her dietary resulted in an attenuated frame and a threadpaper constitution  occasionally she indulged in an egg sometimes even in a sausage  but morally speaking miss lillycrop lived well because she lived for others  of course we do not mean to imply that she had no regard for herself at all  on the contrary she rejoiced in creature comforts when she had the chance and laid in daily one haporth of milk all for herself  she paid for it too which is more than can be said of every one  she also indulged herself to some extent in the luxury of brown sugar at twopencehalfpenny a pound and was absolutely extravagant in hot water which she not only imbibed in the form of weak tea and eau sucree hot but actually took to bed with her every night in an indiarubber bottle  but with the exception of these excusable touches of selfishness miss lillycrop ignored herself systematically and devoted her time talents and means to the welfare of mankind  beside a trim little teatable set for three she sat one evening with her hands folded on her lap and her eyes fixed on the door as if she expected it to make a sudden and unprovoked assault on her  in a few minutes her expectations were almost realised for the door burst open and a boy burst into the room withhere we are cousin lillycrop  phil darling at last exclaimed cousin lillycrop rising in haste  philip maylands offered both hands but cousin lillycrop declined them seized him round the neck kissed him on both cheeks and thrust him down into an easy chair  then she retired into her own easy chair and gloated over him  how much youve grownand so handsome dear boy murmured the little lady  ah then cousin its the blarney stone youve been kissing since i saw you last  no phil ive kissed nothing but the cat since i saw you last  i kiss that delicious creature every night on the forehead before going to bed but the undemonstrative thing does not seem to reciprocate  however i cannot help that  miss lillycrop was right she could not help it  she was overflowing with the milk of human kindness and rather than let any of that valuable liquid go to waste she poured some of it not inappropriately on the thankless cat  im glad you arrived before your sister phil said miss lillycrop of course i asked her here to meet you  i am so sorry the dear girl cannot live with me i had fully meant that she should but my little rooms are so far from the postoffice where her work is you know that it could not be managed  however we see each other as often as possible and she visits sometimes with me in my district  what has made you so late phil  i expected to have been here sooner cousin replied phil as he took off his greatcoat but was delayed by my friend george aspel who has come to london with me to look after a situation that has been promised him by sir james clubley mp for i forget where  hes coming here tonight  who sir james clubley  no returned the boy laughing george aspel  he went with mr blurt to a hotel to see after a bed and promised to come here to tea  i asked him knowing that youd be glad to receive any intimate friend of mine  wont you coz  miss lillycrop expressed and felt great delight at the prospect of meeting phils friend but the smallest possible shade of anxiety was mingled with the feeling as she glanced at her very small and not too heavilyloaded table  besides continued phil george is such a splendid fellow and as maybe you remember lived with us long ago  may will be glad to meet him and he saved mr blurts life so you see  saved mr blurts life interrupted miss lillycrop  yes and he saved ever so many more people at the same time who would likely have been all lost if he hadnt swum off to em with the rocketline and while he was doing that i ran off to call out the lifeboat an didnt they get her out and launch her with a willfor you see i had to run three miles and though i went like the wind they couldnt call out the men and launch her in a minute you know but there was no delay  we were in good time and saved the whole of em passengers and crew  so then you had a hand in the saving of them said miss lillycrop  sure i had said phil with a flush of pleasure at the remembrance of his share in the good work but id never have thought of the lifeboat i was so excited with what was going on if george hadnt sent me off he was bursting with big thoughts and as cool as a cucumber all the time  i do hope hell get a good situation here  its in a large east india house i believe with which sir james clubley is connected and sir james was an old friend of georges father and was very kind to him in his last days but they say hes a proud and touchy old fellow  as phil spoke the door which had a tendency to burst that evening opened quickly though not so violently as before and may maylands stood before them radiant with a glow of expectation  phil sprang to meet her  after the first effusions were over the brother and sister sat down to chat of home in the irish farwest while miss lillycrop retired to a small kitchen there to hold solemn converse with the smallest domestic that ever handled broom or scrubbingbrush  now tottie you must run round to the baker directly and fetch another loaf  what a whole one maam asked the small domesticin comparison with whom dollops was a giantess  yes a whole one  you see theres a young gentleman coming to tea whom i did not expecta grand tall gentleman too and a hero who has saved people from wrecks and swims in the sea in storms like a duck and all that sort of thing so hes sure to have a tremendous appetite  you will also buy another pennyworth of brown sugar and two more pats of butter  tottie opened her large blue eyes in amazement at the extent of what she deemed a reckless order but went off instantly to execute it wondering that any hero however regardless of the sea or storms could induce her poor mistress to go in for such extravagance after having already provided a luxurious meal for three  it might have seemed unfair to send such a child even to bed without an attendant  to send her into the crowded streets alone in the dusk of evening burdened with a vast commission and weighted with coppers appeared little short of inhumanity  nevertheless miss lillycrop did it with an air of perfect confidence and the result proved that her trust was not misplaced  tottie had been gone only a few seconds when george aspel appeared at the door and was admitted by miss lillycrop who apologised for the absence of her maid  great was the surprise and not slight the embarrassment of may maylands when young aspel was ushered into the little room for phil had not recovered sufficiently from the first greetings to mention him  perhaps greater was the surprise of miss lillycrop when these two whom she had expected to meet as old playmates shook hands rather stiffly  sure i forgot may to tell you that george was coming  i am very glad to see him interrupted may recovering herself though i confess to some surprise that he should have forsaken ireland so soon after saying to me that it was a perfect paradise  aspel whose curly flaxen hair almost brushed the ceiling brought himself down to a lower region by taking a chair while he said with a meaning smile  ah  miss maylands the circumstances are entirely altered now besides he added with a sudden change of tone and manner that inexorable manmade demon business calls me to london  i hope business intends to keep you here said miss lillycrop busying herself at the teatable  that remains to be seen returned aspel  if i find that  the loaf and butter maam said tottie announcing these articles at the door as if they were visitors  hush child leave them in the kitchen till i ask for them said miss lillycrop with a quiet laugh  my little maid is such an original mr aspel  shes a very beautiful though perhaps somewhat dishevelled original returned aspel of which one might be thankful to possess even an inferior copy  indeed you are right rejoined miss lillycrop with enthusiasm shes a perfect little angelcome draw in your chairs closer this way phil soa perfect little angelyou take sugar i think  yes  well as i was saying the strange thing about her was that she was born and bredthus farin one of the worst of the back slums of london and her father is an idle drunkard  i fear also a criminal  how strange and sad said aspel whose heart was easily touched and sympathies roused by tales of sorrow  but how comes it that she has escaped contamination  because she has a goodby which i mean a christianmother  ah  mr aspel you have no idea how many unknown and unnoticed gems there are half smothered in the moral mud and filth of london  it is a wonderfula tremendous citytremendous because of the mighty influences for good as well as evil which are constantly at work in it there is an army of moral navvies labouring here who are continually unearthing these gems and there are others who polish them  i have the honour to be a member of this army  dear little tottie is one of the gems and i mean with gods blessing to polish her  of course i cant get her all to myself continued miss lillycrop with a sigh for her mother who is a washerwoman wont part with her but she has agreed to come and work for me every morning for a few hours and i can get her now and then of an evening  my chief regret is that the poor thing has a long long way to walk from her miserable home to reach me i dont know how she will stand it  she has been only a few days in my service  as the unpolished diamond entered at this moment with a large plate of buttered toast miss lillycrop changed the subject abruptly by expressing a hope that may maylands had not to go on late duty that evening  oh no its not my turn for a week yet said may  it seems to me very hard that they should work you night and day said phil who had been quietly drinking in new ideas with his tea while his cousin discoursed  but they dont work us night and day phil returned may it is only the telegraphs that do that  we of the female staff work in relays  if we commence at 8 am we work till 4 pm  if we begin at nine we work till five and so oneight pm being our latest hour  night duty is performed by men who are divided into two sections and it is so arranged that each man has an alternate long and short dutyworking three hours one night and thirteen hours the next  we are allowed halfanhour for dinner which we eat in a dininghall in the place  of course we dine in relays also as there are above twelve hundred of us male and female  how many asked george aspel in surprise  above twelve hundred  why that would make two pretty fair regiments of soldiers said aspel  no george said phil its two regiments of pretty fair soldiers that theyd make  cant you hold your tongue man an let may talk retorted aspel  so you see continued may that amongst us we manage to have the telegraphic communication of the kingdom well attended to  but tell me may said phil do they really suck messages through tubes two miles long  indeed they do phil  you see the general postoffice in london is in direct communication with all the chief centres of the kingdom such as birmingham liverpool manchester edinburgh glasgow dublin cork etcetera so that all messages sent from london must pass through the great hall at st martinslegrand  but there are many offices in london for receiving telegrams besides the general postoffice  suppose that one of these offices in the city receives numerous telegrams every hour all day longinstead of transmitting these by wire to the general postoffice to be redistributed to their various destinations they are collected and put bodily into cylindrical leather cases which are inserted into pneumatic metal tubes  these extend to our central office and through them the telegrams are sucked just as they are written  the longest tube from the west strand is about two miles and each bundle or cylinder of telegrams takes about three minutes to travel  there are upwards of thirty such tubes and the suction business is done by two enormous fiftyhorsepower steamengines in the basement of our splendid building  there is a third engine which is kept ready to work in case of a breakdown or while one of the others is being repaired  ah  may wouldnt there be the grand blowup if you were to burst your boilers in the basement said phil  no doubt there would  but steam is not the only terrible agent at work in that same basement  if you only saw the electric batteries there that generate the electricity which enables us upstairs to send our messages flying from london to the lands end or john o groats or the heart of ireland  you must know that a far stronger battery is required to send messages a long way than a short  our battery inspector told me the other day that he could not tell exactly the power of all the batteries united but he had no doubt it was sufficient to blow the entire building into the middle of next week  now you know phil it would require a pretty severe shock to do that wouldnt it fortunately the accidental union of all the batteries is impossible but youll see it for yourself soon  and it will make you open your eyes when you see a room with three miles of shelving on which are ranged twentytwo thousand batteryjars  my dear said miss lillycrop with a mild smile you will no doubt wonder at my ignorance but i dont understand what you mean by a batteryjar  it is a jar cousin which contains the substances which produce electricity  well well rejoined miss lillycrop dipping the sugarspoon into the slopbowl in her abstraction this world and its affairs is to me a standing miracle  of course i must believe that what you say is true yet i can no more understand how electricity is made in a jar and sent flying along a wire for some hundreds of miles with messages to our friends than i can comprehend how a fly walks on the ceiling without tumbling off  im afraid returned may that you would require to study a treatise on telegraphy to comprehend that but no doubt phil will soon get it so clearly into his head as to be able to communicate it to youyoull go to the office with me on monday wont you phil  of course i willonly too glad to begin at once  my poor boy said may putting her hand on her brothers arm its not a very great beginning of life to become a telegraphmessenger  ah now may thats not like yourself said phil who unconsciously droppedperhaps we should say roseto a more decided brogue when he became tender or facetious  is it rousin the pride of me youd be afther  dont they say that any ould fiddle is good enough to learn upon  mustnt i put my foot on the first round o the ladder if i want to go up higher  if im to be postmastergeneral mustnt i get a general knowledge of the post from the bottom to the top by goin through it  its only men like george there that can go slap over everything at a bound  come phil dont be impertinent said george its a bad sign in one so young  will you convoy me a short way  i must go now  he rose as he spoke and bade miss lillycrop goodevening  that lady expressed an earnest hope that he would come to see her frequently and he promised to do so as often as he could find time  he also bade may goodevening because she was to spend the night with her cousin but may parted from him with the same touch of reserve that marked their meeting  he resented this by drawing himself up and turning away somewhat coldly  now phil he said almost sternly on reaching the street heres a letter to sir james clubley which i want to read to youlisten  by the light of a lamp he read    dear siri appreciate your kindness in offering me the situation   mentioned in your letter of the 4th and especially your remarks in   reference to my late father who was indeed worthy of esteem  i shall   have pleasure in calling on you on hearing that you are satisfied with   the testimonials herewith enclosedi am etcetera  now phil will that do  do of course it will  nothing could be better  only  well what  dont you think that you might call without waiting to hear his opinion of your testimonials  no phil i dont replied the other in a slightly petulant tone i dont feel quite sure of the spirit in which he referred to my dear father  of course it was kind and all that but it was slightly patronising and my father was an infinitely superior man to himself  well i dont know said phil if youre going to accept a favour of him you had better try to feel and act in a friendly way but of course it would never do to encourage him in pride  well then ill send it said aspel closing the letter do you know where i can post it  not i  never was here before  ive only a vague idea of how i got here and mustnt go far with you lest i lose myself  at that moment miss lillycrops door opened and little tottie issued forth  ah she will help usdyou know where the postoffice is tottie  yes sir its at the corner of the street miss lillycrop says  which direction  that one i think  here im going the other way will you post this letter for me  yes sir said tottie  thats a good girl heres a penny for you  please sir thats not a penny said the child holding out the halfcrown which aspel had put in her hand  never mind keep it  tottie stood bereft of speech at the youths munificence as he turned away from her with a laugh  now when tottie bones said that she knew where the post was she did so because her mistress had told her among other pieces of local information that the pillar letterbox stood at the corner of the street and was painted red but as no occasion had occurred since her arrival for the posting of a letter she had not yet seen the pillar with her own eyes  the corner of the street however was so plain a direction that no one except an idiot could fail to find it accordingly tottie started off to execute her mission  unfortunatelyor the reverse as the case may bestreets have usually two corners  the child went almost as a matter of course to the wrong one and there she found no pillar  but she was a faithful messenger and not to be easily balked  she sought diligently at that corner until she really did find a pillar in a retired angle  living as she did chiefly in the back slums of london where literary correspondence is not much in vogue tottie had never seen a pillar letterbox or if she had had not realised its nature  miss lillycrop had told her it was red with a slit in it  the pillar she had found was red to some extent with rust and it unquestionably had a slit in it where in days gone by a handle had projected  it also had a spout in front  tottie had some vague idea that this letterbox must have been made in imitation of a pump and that the spout was a convenient step to enable small people like herself to reach the slit  only she thought it queer that they should not have put the spout in front of the pillar under the slit instead of behind it  she was still more impressed with this when after having twice got on the spout she twice fell off in futile efforts to reach round the pump with her small arms  baffled but not defeated tottie waited till some one should pass who could put the letter in for her but in that retired angle no one passed  suddenly her sharp eyes espied a brickbat  she set it up on end beside the pump mounted it stood on tiptoe and stretching her little body to the very uttermost tipped the letter safely in  the brickbat tipped over at the same instant and sent her headlong to the ground  but this was no novelty to tottie  regardless of the fall she gathered herself up and with the light heart of one who has gained a victory in the performance of duty ran off to her miserable home in the back slums    chapter seven  phil begins life and makes a friend  some time after the small teaparty described in our last chapter philip maylands was invested with all the dignity privileges and emoluments of an outdoor boy telegraph messenger in the general postoffice  he rejoiced in the conscious independence of one who earns his own livelihood is a burden to nobody and has something to spare he enjoyed the privilege of wearing a grey uniform of sitting in a comfortable room with a huge fire in the basement of the office and of walking over a portion of london as the bearer of urgent and no doubt allimportant news  he also enjoyed a salary of seven shillings sterling a week and was further buoyed up with the hope of an increase to eight shillings at the end of a year  his duties as a rule began at eight each morning and averaged nine hours  we have said that out of his vast income he had something to spare this of course was not much but owing to the very moderate charge for lodging made by solomon flintwith whom and his sister he took up his abodethe sum was sufficient to enable him after a few months to send home part of his first years earnings to his mother  he did this by means of that most valuable institution of modern days a postoffice order which enables one to send small sums of money at a moderate charge and with perfect security not only all over the kingdom but over the greater part of the known world  it would have been interesting had it been possible to have entered into phils feelings on the occasion of his transacting this first piece of financial business  being a countrybred boy he was as bashful about it as if he had been only ten years old  he doubted first whether the clerk would believe him in earnest when he should demand the order  then when he received the form to fill up he had considerable hesitation lest he should fill in the blanks erroneously and when the clerk scanned the slip and frowned he felt convinced that he had done so  youve put only mrs maylands said the clerk  only mrs maylands thought phil does the man want me to add widow of the reverend james maylands and mother of all the little maylands but he only said sure sir its to her i want to send the money  put down her christian name said the clerk order cant be drawn without it  phil put down the required name handed over the money received back the change inserted the order into a previously prepared letter posted the same and walked away from that office as tall as his friend george aspelif not tallerin sensation  let us now follow our hero to the boymessengers room in the basement of st martinslegrand  entering one morning after the delivery of a telegram which had cost him a pretty long walk phil proceeded to the boys hall and took his seat at the end of the row of boys who were awaiting their turn to be called for mercurial duty  observing a very small telegraphboy in a scullery off the hall engaged in some mysterious operations with a large saucepan from which volumes of steam proceeded he went towards him by that time phil had become pretty well acquainted with the faces of his comrades but this boy he had not previously met with  the lad was stooping over a sink and carefully holding in the contents of the pan with its lid while he strained off the boiling water  sure ive not seen you before remarked phil  the boy turned up a sharpfeatured but handsome and remarkably intelligent face and with a quick glance at phil said well now any man might know you for an irishman by your impudence even if you hadnt the brogue  why what do you mean asked phil with an amused smile  mean echoed the boy with the most refined extract of insolence on his pretty little face i mean that small though i am surely im big enough to be seen  well returned phil with a laugh you know what i meanthat i havent seen you before today  then wy dont you say what you mean  how dyou suppose a man can understand you unless you speak in plain terms  you wont do for the gpo if you cant speak the queens english  we want sharp fellows here we do  so youd better go back to owld ireland avic cushla mavourneenthere put that in your pipe and smoke it  whether it was the distraction of the boys mind or the potent working of his impertinence we know not but certain it is that his left hand slipped somehow and a round ball with a delicious smell fell out of the pot  the boy half caught it and wildly yet cleverly balanced it on the lid but it would have rolled next moment into the sink if phil had not made a dart forward caught it like a football and bowled it back into the pot  well done splendidly done cried the boy setting down his pot arrah  pat he added mocking phils brogue and holding out his hand youre a man after my own heart give me your flipper and let us swear eternal friendship over this precious goblet  of course phil cheerfully complied and the friendship thus auspiciously begun afterwards became strong and lasting  so it is all through the course of life  at every turn we are liable to meet with those who shall thenceforth exercise a powerful influence on our characters lives and affections and on whom our influence shall be strong for good or evil  whats your name asked phil mine is philip maylands  mines peter pax answered the small boy returning to his goblet but ive no end of aliasessuch as mouse monkey spider snipe imp and little un  call me what you please its all one to me so as you dont call me too late for dinner  and what have you got there pax asked phil referring to the pot  a plumpudding  do two or three of you share it  certainly not replied the boy  what you dont mean to say you can eat it all yourself for dinner  the extent of my ability in the disposal of wittles answered pax i have never fairly tested  i think i could eat this at one meal though i aint sure but its meant to serve me all day  you see i find a good solid wellmade plumpudding with not too much suet and a moderate allowance of currants and raisins an admirable squencher of appetite  its portable too and keeps well  besides if i cant get through with it at supper it fries up next mornin splendidlycome ill let you taste a bit an thats a favour wich i wouldnt grant to every one  no thank ee pax  im already loaded and primed for the forenoon but ill sit by you while you eat and chat  youre welcome returned pax only dont be cheeky philip as i cant meet you on an equal footing wen im at grub  ill be careful pax but dont call me philipcall me phil  i will phil come along phil come fill up my cup come fill up my canthat sort o thing you understand phil me darlint  there was such a superhuman amount of knowing presumption in the look and air of pax as he poked phil in the ribs and winked that the latter burst into laughter in which however he was not joined by his companion who with the goblet in one hand and the other thrust into his pocket stood regarding his new friend with a pitiful expression till he recovered and then led him off to a confabulation which deepened their mutual esteem  that same evening a gentleman called at the postoffice desiring to see philip maylands  it turned out to be george aspel  why george what brings you here said phil in surprise  i chanced to be in the neighbourhood answered aspel and came to ask the address of that little creature who posted my letter the other night  i want to see her  she does not go to your cousins i know till morning and i must see her tonight to make sure that she did post the letter for dyou know ive had no reply from sir james and i cant rest until i ascertain whether my letter was posted  can you tell me where she lives phil  at that moment phil was summoned for duty  giving his friend the address hastily he left him  george aspel passed the front of the general postoffice on his way to visit tottie bones and observing a considerable bustle going on there he stopped to gaze for george had an inquiring mind  being fresh from the country his progress through the streets of london as may be well understood was slow  it was also harassing to himself and the public for when not actually standing entranced in front of shopwindows his irresistible tendency to look in while walking resulted in many collisions and numerous apologies  at the general postoffice he avoided the stream of human beings by getting under the lee of one of the pillars of the colonnade whence he could look on undisturbed  up to six oclock letters are received in the letterbox at st martinslegrand for the mails which leave london at eight each evening  the place for receiving bookparcels and newspapers however closes halfanhour sooner  before five a brass slit in the wall suffices for the public but within a few minutes of the halfhour the steady run of men and boys towards it is so great that the slit becomes inadequate  a trapdoor is therefore opened in the pavement and a yawning abyss displayed which communicates by an inclined plane with the newspaper regions below  into this abyss everything is hurled  when aspel took up his position people were hurrying towards the hole some with single bookparcels or a few newspapers others with armfuls and many with sackfuls  in a few minutes the rapid walk became a run men boys and girls sprang up the stepsoccasionally tumbled up jostled each other in their eager haste and tossed dropped hurled or poured their contributions into the receptacle which was at last fed so hastily that it choked once or twice and a policeman assisted by an official stuffed the literary matter down its throatwith difficulty however owing to the everincreasing stream of contributors to the feast  the trapdoor when open formed a barrier to the hole which prevented the too eager public from being posted headlong with their papers  one youth staggered up the steps under a sack so large that he could scarcely lift it over the edge of the barrier without the policemans aid  him aspel questioned as he was leaving with the empty sack and found that he was the porter of one of the large publishing firms of the city  others he found came from advertising agents with sacks of circulars etcetera  soon the minutes were reduced to seconds and the work became proportionally fast and furious sacks baskets hampers trays of material were emptied violently into that insatiable maw and in some cases the sacks went in along with their contents  but owners names being on these they were recoverable elsewhere  suddenly yet slowly the opening closed  the monster was satisfied for that time it would not swallow another morsel and one or two unfortunates who came late with large bags of newspapers and circulars had to resort to the comparatively slow process of cramming their contents through the narrow slit above with the comforting certainty that they had missed that post  turning from this point george aspel observed that the box for letters closing as we have said half an hour later than that for books and paperswas beginning to show symptoms of activity  at a quarter to six the long metal slit suddenly opened up like a gaping mouth into which a harlequin could have leaped easily  through it aspel could lookover the heads of the publicand see the officials inside dragging away great baskets full of letters to be manipulated in the mysterious realms inside  at five minutes to six the rush towards this mouth was incessant and the operations at the newspapertomb were pretty much repeated though of course the contents of bags and baskets were not quite so ponderous  at one side of the mouth stood an official in a red coat at the other a policeman  these assisted the public to empty their baskets and trays gave information sometimes advice and kept people moving on  little boys there as elsewhere had a strong tendency to skylark and gaze at the busy officials inside to the obstruction of the way  the policeman checked their propensities  a stout elderly female panted towards the mouth with a letter in one hand and a paper in the other  she had full two minutes and a half to spare but felt convinced she was too late  the redcoated official posted her letter and pointed out the proper place for the newspaper  at two minutes to six anxious people began to run while yet in the street cool personages seeing the clock and feeling safe affected an easy nonchalance but did not loiter  one minute to sixeager looks were on the faces of those who from all sides converged towards the great receivingbox  the active sprang up the wide stairs at a bound heaved in their bundles or packets or single missives and heaved sighs of relief after them the timid stumbled on the stairs and blundered up to the mouth while the hasty almost plunged into it bodily  even at this critical moment there were lulls in the rush  once there was almost a dead pause and at that moment an exquisite sauntered towards the mouth dropped a solitary little letter down the slope where whole cataracts had been flowing and turned away  he was almost carried off his legs by two youths from a lawyers office who rushed up just as the first stroke of six oclock rang out on the night air  slowly and grandly it tolled from st pauls whose mighty dome was visible above the housetops from the colonnade  during these fleeting moments a few dozens of late ones posted some hundreds of letters  with kindly consideration the authorities of st martinslegrand have set their timepieces one minute slow  aware of this a clerk gasping and with a pen behind his ear leaped up the steps at the last stroke and hurled in a bundle of letters  next moment like inexorable fate the mouth closed and nothing short of the demolition of the british constitution could have induced that mouth to convey another letter to the eight oclock mails  hope however was not utterly removed  those who chose to place an additional penny stamp on their letters could by posting them in a separate box have them taken in for that mail up to seven  twopence secured their acceptance up to 715  threepence up to 730 and sixpence up to 745 but all letters posted after six without the late fees were detained for the following mail  sharp practice observed george aspel to the redcoated official who after shutting the mouth placed a ticket above it which told all corners that they were too late  yes sir and pretty sharp work is needful when you consider that the mails weve got to send out daily from this office consist of over 5800 bags weighing fortythree tons while the mails received number more than 5500 bags  speaks to a deal of correspondence that dont it sir  whatevery day exclaimed aspel in surprise  every day replied the official with a goodhumoured smile and an emphatic nod  why sir he continued in a leisurely way were some what of a literary nation we are  how many letters now dyou think pass through the postoffice altogethercounting england scotland and ireland  havent the remotest idea  well sir continued the redcoated man with impressive solemnity we passes through our hands in one year about one thousand and fiftyseven million odd  i know enough of figures said aspel with a laugh to be aware that i cannot realise such a number  nevertheless sir continued the official with a patronising air you can realise something about such a number  for instance that sum gives thirtytwo letters per head to the population in the year and of course as thousands of us cant write and thousands more dont write it follows that the real correspondents of the kingdom do some pretty stiff work in the writing way  but these are only the letters if you include somewhere about four hundred and twenty million postcards newspapers bookpackets and circulars you have a sum total of fourteen hundred and seventyseven million odd passing through our hands  put that down in figures sir wen you git home 1477000000an praps itll open your eyes a bit  if you want em opened still wider just try to find out how long it would take you to count that sum at the rate of sixty to the minute beginning one two three and so on workin eight hours a day without takin time for meals but givin you off sixtyfive days each year for sundays and holidays to recruit your wasted energies  how long would it take asked aspel with an amused but interested look  wy sir it would take you just a little over one hundred and seventy years  the calculation aint difficult you can try it for yourself if you dont believe itgoodnight sir added the redcoated official with a pleasant nod as he turned and entered the great building where a huge proportion of this amazing work was being at that moment actively manipulated    chapter eight  downwarddeeper and deeper  as the great bell of st pauls struck the halfhour george aspel was reminded of the main object of his visit to that part of the city descending to the street and pondering in silent wonder on the vast literary correspondence of the kingdom he strode rapidly onward his long legs enabling him to pass ahead of the stream of life that flowed with him and causing him to jostle not a few members of the stream that opposed him  hallo sir  look out  mind your eye stoopid  now then you lamppost were are you agoin to  wot asylum ave you escaped from were among the mildest remarks with which he was greeted  but aspel heeded them not  the vendors of penny marvels failed to attract him  even the printshop windows had lost their influence for a time and as for monkeys barrelorgans and trained birds they were as the dust under his feet although at other times they formed a perpetual feast to his unsophisticated soul  letters letters letters  he could think of nothing else  fourteen hundred and seventyseven millions of letters etcetera through the postoffice in one year kept ringing through his brain only varied in its monotony by that gives thirtytwo letters per head to the entire population and as lots of em cant write of course its much more for those who can  take a man one hundred and seventy years to count em  at this point the brilliant glare of a ginpalace reminded him that he had walked far and long and had for some time felt thirsty  entering he called for a pot of beer  it was not a huge draught for a man of his size  as he drained it the memory of grand old jovial seakings crossed his mind and he called for another pot  as he was about to apply it to his lips and shook back his flaxen curls the remembrance of a norse drinkingcup in his possessionan heirloom which could not stand on its bottom and had therefore to be emptied before being set down induced him to chuckle quietly before quaffing his beer  on setting down the empty pot he observed a poor miserablelooking woman with a black eye and a black bottle gazing at him in undisguised admiration  instantly he called for a third pot of beer  being supplied by the wondering shopboy he handed it to the woman but she shook her head and drew back with an air of decision  no sir she said but thank you kindly all the same sir  very well returned the youth putting the pot and a halfcrown on the counter you may drink it or leave it as you please  i pay for it and you may take the changeor leave that too if you like he added as he went out somewhat displeased that his feeling of generosity had been snubbed  after wandering a short distance he was involved in labyrinths of brick and mortar and suddenly became convinced that he was lost  this was however a small matter  to find ones way by asking it is not difficult even in london if one possesses average intelligence  the first man he stopped was a scot  with characteristic caution that worthy cleared his throat and with national deliberation repeated aspels query after which in a marked tone of regret he said slowly weel sir i really div not ken  aspel thanked him with a sarcastic smile and passed on  his next effort was with a countryman who replied troth sur thats more nor i can tell ee and looked after his questioner kindly as he walked away  a policeman appearing was tried next  first to the right sir third to the left and ask again was the sharp reply of that limb of the executive as he passed slowly on stiff as a post and stately as a law of fate  having taken the required turns our wanderer found himself in a peculiarly low dirty and disagreeable locality  the population was in keeping with itso much so that aspel looked round inquiringly before proceeding to ask again  he had not quite made up his mind which of the tawdry halfdrunken creatures around him he would address when a middleaged man of respectable appearance dressed in black issued from one of the surrounding dens  a city missionary thought george aspel as he approached and asked for direction to the abode of a man named abel bones  the missionary pointed out the entrance to the desired abode and looked at his questioner with a glance which arrested the youths attention  excuse me sir he said but the man you name has a very bad character  well what then demanded aspel sharply  oh nothing  i only meant to warn you for he is a dangerous man  the missionary was a thin but muscular man with stern black eyes and a powerful nose which might have rendered his face harsh if it had not been more than redeemed by a large firm mouth round which played lines that told unmistakably of the milk of human kindness  he smiled as he spoke and aspel was disarmed  thank you he said i am well able to take care of myself  evidently the missionary thought so too for with a quiet bow he turned and went his way  at the end of a remarkably dark passage george aspel ran his head against a beam and his knee against a door with considerable violence  come in said a very weak but sweet little voice as though doors in that region were usually rapped at in that fashion  lifting the latch and entering aspel found himself confronted by tottie bones in her native home  it was a very small desolate and dirty home and barely rendered visible by a thin dip stuck into an empty pintbottle  tottie opened her large eyes wide with astonishment then laid one of her dirty little fingers on her rosy lips and looked imploringly at her visitor  thus admonished he spoke without knowing why in a subdued voice  you are surprised to see me tottie  im surprised at nothink sir  taint possible to surprise me with anythink in this life  dyou expect to be surprised by anything in any other life tottie asked aspel more amused by the air of the child than by her answer  praps  dont much know and dont much care said tottie  well ive come to ask something said the youth sitting down on a low box for the convenience of conversation and i hope tottie that youll tell me the truth  heres a halfcrown for you  the truth mind whether you think it will please me or not i dont want to be pleasedi want the truth  id tell you the truth without that said tottie eyeing the halfcrown which aspel still held between his fingers but hand it over  we want a good many o these things here bein pretty hard up at times  she spun the piece deftly in the air caught it cleverly and put it in her pocket  well tell me now did you post the letter i gave you the night i took tea with miss lillycrop  yes i did answered the child with a nod of decision  youre telling the truth  yes as sure as death  poor tottie had made her strongest asseveration but it did not convey to aspel nearly so much assurance as did the earnest gaze of her bright and truthful eyes  you put it in the pillar he continued  yes  at the end of the street  yes at the end of the street and oh youve no idea what an awful time i was about it the slit was so high an i come down sitch a cropper wen it was done  but it went in all right  yes all right  george aspel sat for some moments in gloomy silence  he now felt convinced of that which at first he had only suspectednamely that his intending patron was offended because he had not at once called in person to thank him instead of doing so by letter  probably also he had been hurt by the expressions in the letter to which philip maylands had objected when it was read to him  well well he exclaimed suddenly giving a severe slap to his unoffending thigh ill have nothing to do with him  if hes so touchyas that comes to the less that he and i have to say to each other the better  oh please sir hush exclaimed tottie pointing with a look of alarm to a bundle which lay in a dark corner youll wake im  wake who  father whispered the child  the visitor rose took up the pintbottle and by the aid of its flaring candle beheld something that resembled a large man huddled together in a heap on a straw mattress as he had last fallen down  his position together with his torn and disarranged garments had destroyed all semblance to human form save where a great limb protruded  his visage was terribly disfigured by the effects of drink besides being partly concealed by his matted hair  what a wretched spectacle exclaimed the young man touching the heap with his foot as he turned away in disgust  just then a woman with a black eye entered the room with a black bottle in her hand  she was the woman who had refused the beer from aspel  mother said tottie running up to her heres the gent who  aveegothgin growled a deep voice from the dark corner  yes abel  ave ee got th gin i say molly roared the voice in rising wrath  yes yes abel here it is exclaimed the woman hastening towards the corner  the savage who lay there was so eager to obtain the bottle that he made a snatch at it and let it slip on the stone floor where it was broken to pieces  o dont abel dear dont  ill get another pleaded the poor woman but abels disappointment was too great for endurance he managed to rise and made a wild blow at the womanmissed her and staggered into the middle of the room  here he encountered the stern glance of george aspel  being a dark stern man himself with a bulky powerful frame he rather rejoiced in the sight of a man who seemed a worthy foe  what dee wan here you longleggedhah would you he added on observing aspels face flush and his fists close take that  he struck out at his adversarys face with tremendous violence  aspel parried the blow and returned it with such goodwill that abel bones went headlong into the dark corner whence he had risenand lay there  im very sorry said the instantlyrepentant george turning to mrs bones but i couldnt help it really i  there there go away sir and thank you kindly said the unfortunate woman urgingalmost pushingher visitor towards the door  itll do im good praps  he dont get that every day an it wont urt im  aspel found himself suddenly in the dark passage and heard the door slammed  his first impulse was to turn dash in the door with his foot and take vengeance on abel bones his next to burst into a sardonic laugh  thereafter he frowned fiercely and strode away  in doing so he drew himself up with seakinglike dignity and assaulted a beam which all but crushed his hat over his eyes  this did not improve his temper but the beer had not yet robbed him of all selfcontrol he stooped to conquer and emerged into the street  well was it for george aspel that his blow had been such an effective one for if a riot with bones had followed the blow there were numerous kindred spirits there who would have been only too glad to aid their chum and the intruder would have fared badly among them despite his physical powers  as it was he soon regained a respectable thoroughfare and hastened away in the direction of his lodgings  but a dark frown clouded his brow for as he went along his thoughts were busy with what he believed to be the insolent pride of sir james clubley  he also thought of may maylands and the resolution with which she so firmly yet so gently repelled him  the latter thought wounded his pride as well as his feelings deeply  while in this mood the spirit of the seakings arose within him once again  he entered a publichouse and had another pot of beer  it was very refreshingremarkably so true the tall and stalwart young frame of george aspel needed no refreshment at the time and he would have scorned the insinuation that he required anything to support himbutbutit was decidedly refreshing  there could be no doubt whatever about that and it induced him to take a more amiable view of men in generalof poor abel bones in particular  he even felt less savagely disposed towards sir james though he by no means forgave him but made up his mind finally to have nothing more to do with him while as to mayhope told him flattering tales  at this point in his walk he was attracted by one of those traps to catch the unwary which are so numerous in londona musichall  george knew not what it was and cared not  it was a place of public entertainment that was enough for him  he wanted entertainment and in he went  it is not our purpose to describe this place  enough is told when we have said that there were dazzling lights and gorgeous scenes and much music and many other things to amuse  there were also many gentlemen butno ladies  there was also much smoking and drinking  aspel soon observed that he was expected either to drink or smoke  he did not wish to do either but disliking singularity ordered a cigar and a glass of brandyandwater  these were followed by another cigar and another glass  towards midnight he had reached that condition when drink stimulates the desire for more drink  being aware from former experience of the danger of this condition and being as we have said a man of some strength of will he rose to go  at the moment a halftipsy man at the little table next him carelessly flung the end of his cigar away  it alighted probably by accident on the top of aspels head  hallo sir shouted the enraged youth starting up and seizing the man by his collar  hallo sir echoed the man who had reached his pugnacious cups let go  he struck out at the same moment  aspel would have parried the blow but his arm had been seized by one of the bystanders and it took effect on his nose which instantly sent a red stream over his mouth and down the front of his shirt  goodhumour and kindliness usually served aspel in the place of principle  remove these qualities temporarily and he became an unguarded savagesometimes a roaring lion  with a shout that suspended the entertainments and drew the attention of the whole house he seized his adversary lifted him in the air and would infallibly have dashed him on the floor if he had not been caught in the arms of the crowd  as it was the offender went down carrying halfadozen friends and a couple of tables with their glasses along with him  aspel was prevented from doing more mischief by three powerful policemen who seized him from behind and led him into the passage there a noisy explanation took place which gave the offender time to cool and reflect on his madness  on his talking quietly to the policemen and readily paying for the damage he had done he was allowed to go free  descending the stair to the street where the glare of the entrancelamps fell full upon him he felt a sudden sensation of faintness caused by the combination of cold air excitement drink and smoke  seizing the railings with one hand he stood for a moment with his eyes shut  reopening them and gazing stupidly before him he encountered the horrified gaze of may maylands  she had been spending the evening with miss lillycrop and was on her way home escorted by solomon flint  come along miss may said solomon dont be afraid of im  he cant urt youtoo far gone for that bless you  come on  may yielded and was out of sight in a moment  filled with horror despair madness and selfcontempt george aspel stood holding on to the railings and glaring into vacuity  recovering himself he staggered home and went to bed    chapter nine  mr blurt and george aspel in peculiar circumstances  when a man finds himself in a false position out of which he sees no way of escape he is apt to feel a depression of spirits which reveals itself in the expression of his countenance  one morning mr enoch blurt sat on a high stool in his brothers shop with his elbows on a screened desk his chin in his hands and a grim smile on his lips  the shop was a peculiar one  it had somewhat the aspect of an old curiosity shop but the predominance of stuffed birds gave it a distinctly ornithological flavour  other stuffed creatures were there however such as lizards frogs monkeys etcetera all of which straddled in attitudes more or less unlike nature while a few wore expressions of astonishment quite in keeping with their circumstances  here am i soliloquised mr blurt with a touch of bitterness in the position of a shopboy in possession of a shop towards which i entertain feelings of repugnance seeing that it has twice ruined my poor brother and in regard to the details of which i know absolutely nothing  i had fancied i had reached the lowest depths of misfortune when i became a ruined diamondmerchant but this is a profounder deep  heres the doctor acomin downstairs sir said an elderly female protruding her head from the back shop and speaking in a stagewhisper  very well mrs murridge let him come said mr blurt recklessly  he descended from the stool as the doctor entered the shop looking very grave  every expression save that of deep anxiety vanished from mr blurts face  my brother is worse he said quickly  not worse replied the doctor but his case is critical  everything will depend on his mind being kept at ease  he has taken it into his head that his business is going to wreck while he lies there unable to attend to it and asked me earnestly if the shop had been opened  i told him id step down and inquire  poor fred murmured his brother sadly he has too good reason to fancy his business is going to wreck with or without his attendance for i find that very little is doing and you can see that the entire stock isnt worth fifty poundsif so much  the worst of it is that his boy who used to assist him absconded yesterday with the contents of the till and there is no one now to look after it  thats awkward  we must open the shop how ever for it is allimportant that his mind should be kept quiet  do you know how to open it mr blurt  poor mr blurt looked helplessly at the closed shutters through a hole in one of which the morning sun was streaming  turning round he encountered the deeply solemn gaze of an owl which stood on a shelf at his elbow  no doctor i know no more how to open it than that idiot there he said pointing to the owl but ill make inquiries of mrs murridge  the domestic fortunately knew the mysterious operations relative to the opening of a shop  with her assistance mr blurt took off the shutters stowed them away in their proper niche and threw open the door to the public with an air of invitation if not hospitality which deserved a better return than it received  with this news the doctor went back to the sick man  mrs murridge said mr blurt when the doctor had gone would you be so good as mind the shop for a few minutes while i go upstairs  if any one should come in just go to the foot of the stair and give two coughs  i shall hear you  on entering his brothers room he found him raised on one elbow with his eyes fixed wildly on the door  dear fred he said tenderly hurrying forward you must not give way to anxiety theres a dear fellow  lie down  the doctor says youll get well if you only keep quiet  ay but i cant keep quiet replied the poor old man tremulously while he passed his hand over the few straggling white hairs that lay on but failed to cover his head  how can you expect me to keep quiet enoch when my business is all going to the dogs for want of attention and that boy of mine is such a stupid fellow he loses or mislays the letters somehowi cant understand how  theres confusion too somewhere because i have written several times of late to people who owe me money and sometimes have got no answers at other times been told that they had replied and enclosed cheques and  come now dear fred said enoch soothingly while he arranged the pillows do give up thinking about these things just for a little while till you are better and in the meantime i will look after  and hes such a lazy boy too interrupted the invalidnever gets up in time unless i rouse himhas the shop been opened enoch  yes didnt the doctor tell you  i always open it myself returned enoch speaking rapidly to prevent his brother if possible from asking after the boy about whose unfaithfulness he was still ignorant  and now fred i insist on your handing the whole business over to me for a week or two just as it stands if you dont ill go back to africa why youve no idea what a splendid shopman i shall make  you seem to forget that i have been a successful diamondmerchant  i dont see the connection enoch returned the other with a faint smile  thats because youve never been out of london and cant believe in anybody who hasnt been borne or at least bred within the sound of bow bells  dont you know that diamondmerchants sometimes keep stores and that stores mean buying and selling and corresponding and all that sort of thing  come dear fred trust me a littleonly a littlefor a day or two or rather i should say trust god and try to sleep theres a dear fellowcome  the sick man heaved a deep sigh turned over on his side and dropped into a quiet slumberwhether under the influence of a more trustful spirit or of exhaustion we cannot sayprobably both  returning to the shop mr blurt sat down in his old position on the stool and began to meditate  he was interrupted by the entrance of a woman carrying a stuffed pheasant  she pointed out that one of the glass eyes of the creature had got broken and wished to know what it would cost to have a new one put in  poor mr blurt had not the faintest idea either as to the manufacture or cost of glass eyes  he wished most fervently that the woman had gone to some other shop becoming desperate and being naturally irascible as well as humorous he took a grimly facetious course  my good woman he said with a bland smile i would recommend you to leave the bird as it is  a dead pheasant can see quite as well with one eye as with two i assure you  la sir but it dont look so well said the woman  o yes it does quite as well if you turn its blind side to the wall  but we keeps it on a table sir an wen our friends walk round the table they cant elp seein the broken eye  well then persisted mr blurt dont let your friends walk round the table  shove the bird up against the wall or tell your friends that its a humorous bird an takes to winking when they go to that side  the woman received this advice with a smile but insisted nevertheless that a noo heye would be preferable and wanted to know the price  well you know said mr blurt that depends on the size and character of the eye and the time required to insert it for you see in our business everything depends on a lifelike turn being given to an eyeor a beakor a toe and we dont like to put inferior work out of our hands  so youd better leave the bird and call again  very well sir wen shall i call  say next week  i am very busy just now you seeextremely busy and cannot possibly give proper attention to your affair at present  stay give me your address  the woman did so and left the shop while mr blurt looked about for a memorandumbook  opening one which was composite in its character having been used indifferently as daybook cashbook and ledgerhe headed a fresh page with the words memorandum of transactions by enoch blurt and made the following entry  a womani should have said an idiotcame in and left a pheasant minus an eye to be repaired and called for next week  there exclaimed the unfortunate man shutting the book with emphasis  please sir said a very small sweet voice  mr blurt looked over the top of his desk in surprise for the owner of the voice was not visible  getting down from his stool and coming out of his den he observed the pretty face and dishevelled head of a little girl not much higher than the counter  please sir she said can you change alf a sov  no i cant said mr blurt so gruffly that the small girl retired in haste  stay come here cried the repentant shopman  the child returned with some hesitation  who trusted you with half a sov  miss lillycrop sir  and whos miss lillycrop  my missis sir  does your missis think that im a banker demanded mr blurt sternly  i dun know sir  then why did she send you here  please sir because the gentleman wot keeps this shop is a friend o missis an always gives er change wen she wants it  he stuffs her birds for her too for nothink an once he stuffed a tomcat for er wich she was uncommon fond of but he couldnt make much of a job of it cause it died through a kittle o boilin water tumblin on its back which took off most of the air  while the child was speaking mr blurt drew a handful of silver from his pocket and counted out ten shillings  there he said putting the money into the childs hand and tell miss lillycrop with my complimentsmr enoch blurts complimentsthat my brother has been very ill but is a littlea very littlebetter and see there is a sixpence for yourself  oh thank you sir exclaimed the child opening her eyes with such a look of surprised joy that mr blurt felt comforted in his difficulties and resolved to face them like a man do his duty and take the consequences  he was a good deal relieved however to find that no one else came into the shop during the remainder of that day  as he sat and watched the neverceasing stream of people pass the windows almost without casting a glance at the ornithological specimens that stood rampant there he required no further evidence that the business had already gone to that figurative state of destruction styled the dogs  the only human beings in london who took the smallest notice of him or his premises were the street boys some of whom occasionally flattened their noses on a pane of glass and returned looks of if possible exaggerated surprise at the owl while others put their heads inside the door yelled in derision and went placidly away  dogs also favoured him with a passing glance and one or two with sporting tendencies seemed about to point at the game inside but thought better of it and went off  at intervals the patient man called mrs murridge to mind the shop while he went upstairs  sometimes he found the invalid dozing sometimes fretting at the thoughts of the confusion about his letters  if they all went astray one could understand it he would say passing his hand wearily over his brow because that would show that one cause went on producing one result but sometimes letters come right at other times they dont come at all  but how dyou find out about those that dont come at all asked his brother  by writing to know why letters have not been replied to and getting answers to say that they have been replied to said the invalid its very perplexing enoch and ive lost a deal of money by it  i wouldnt mind so much if i was well but  there now youre getting excited again fred you must not speak about business matters  havent i promised to take it in hand and ill investigate this matter to the bottom  ill write to the secretary of the general postoffice  ill go down to st martinslegrand and see him myself and if he dont clear it up ill write letters to the times until i bust up the british postoffice altogether so make your mind easy fred else ill forsake you and go right away back to africa  there was no resisting this  the poor invalid submitted with a faint smile and his brother returned to the shop  its unsatisfactory to say the least of it murmured mr blurt as he relieved guard and sat down again on the high stool  to solicit trade and to be unable to meet the demand when it comes is a very false position  yet i begin to wish that somebody would come in for somethingjust for a change  it seemed as if somebody had heard his wish expressed for at that moment a man entered the shop  he was a tall powerful man  mr blurt had just begun to wonder what particular branch of the business he was going to be puzzled with when he recognised the man as his friend george aspel  leaping from his stool and seizing aspel by the hand mr blurt gave him a greeting so hearty that two street boys who chanced to pass and saw the beginning of it exclaimed go it old un and waited for more but aspel shut the door in their faces which induced them to deliver uncomplimentary remarks through the keyhole and make unutterable eyes at the owl in the window ere they went the even tenor of their way  kind and hearty though the greeting was it did not seem to put the youth quite at his ease and there was a something in his air and manner which struck mr blurt immediately  why youve hurt your face mr aspel he exclaimed turning his friend to the light  andandyouve had your coat torn and mended as if  yes mr blurt said aspel suddenly recovering something of his wonted bold and hearty manner i have been in bad company you see and had to fight my way out of it  london is a more difficult and dangerous place to get on in than i had imagined at first  i suppose it is though i cant speak from much experience said mr blurt  but come sit down  heres a high stool for you  ill sit on the counter  now lets hear about your adventures or misadventures how did you come to grief  simply enough replied aspel with an attempt to look indifferent and easy in which he was only halfsuccessful i went into a musichall one night and got into a row with a drunk man who insulted me  thats how i came by my damaged face  then about two weeks ago a fellow picked my pocket  i chased him down into one of his haunts and caught him but was set upon by half a dozen scoundrels who overpowered me  they will carry some of my marks however for many a dayperhaps to their graves but i held on to the pickpocket in spite of them until the police rescued me  thats how my clothes got damaged  the worst of it is the rascals managed to make away with my purse  my dear fellow said mr blurt laughing you have been unfortunate but most young men have to gather wisdom from experienceand now what of your prospects  excuse me if i appear inquisitive but one who is so deeply indebted to you as i am cannot help feeling interested in your success  i have no prospects returned the youth with a tone and look of bitterness that was not usual to him  what do you mean asked his friend in surprise have you not seen sir james clubley  no and i dont intend to see him until he has answered my letter  let me be plain with you mr blurt  sir james i have heard from my father is a proud man and i dont much half like the patronising way in which he offered to assist me  and his insolent procrastination in replying to my letter has determined me to have nothing more to do with him  hell find that im as proud as himself  my young friend said mr blurt i had imagined that a man of your good sense would have seen that to meet pride with pride is not wise besides to do so is to lay yourself open to the very condemnation which you pronounce against sir james  still further is it not possible that your letter to him may have miscarried  letters will miscarry you know at times even in such a wellregulated family as the postoffice  oh as to that returned aspel quickly ive made particular inquiries and have no doubt that he got my letter all rightbut the worst of it is he continued evidently wishing to change the subject that having lost my purse and having no account at a bankers i find it absolutely necessary to work and strange to say i cannot find work  well if you have been searching for work with a black eye and a torn coat it is not surprising that you have failed to find it said mr blurt with a laugh  but my dear young friend and preserver he added earnestly i am glad you have come to me  ah if that ship had not gone down i might havewell well the proverb says its of no use crying over spilt milk  i have still a little in my power  moreover it so happens that you have it in your power to serve methat is to say if you are not too proud to accept the work i have it in my power to offer  a beggar must not be a chooser said aspel with a light laugh  well then what say you to keeping a shop  keeping a shop repeated aspel in surprise  ay keeping a shopthis shop returned mr blurt you once told me you were versed in natural history here is a field for you a naturalhistorical shop if i may say so  but my dear sir i know nothing whatever about the business or about stuffing birdsandand fishes  he looked round him in dismay  but you are jesting  mr blurt declared that he was very far from jesting and then went on to explain the circumstances of the case  it is probable that george aspel would have at once rejected his proposal if it had merely had reference to his own advantage and that he would have preferred to apply for labour at the docks as being more suitable work for a seakings descendant but the appeal to aid his friend in an emergency went home to him and he agreed to undertake the work temporarily with an expression of face that is common to men when forced to swallow bitter pills  thus george aspel was regularly though suddenly installed  when evening approached mrs murridge lighted the gas and the new shopman set to work with energy to examine the stock and look over the books in the hope of thereby obtaining at least a faint perception of the nature of the business in which he was embarked  while thus engaged a woman entered hastily and demanded her pheasant  your pheasant my good woman  yes the one i left here today wi the broken heye  i dont want to ave it mended changed my mind  will you please give it me back sir  i must call the gentleman to whom you gave it said aspel rather sharply for he perceived the woman had been drinking  oh youve no need for theres the book he put my name down in an theres the bird astandin on the shelf just under the howl  aspel turned up the book referred to and found the page recently opened by mr blurt  he had no difficulty in coming to a decision for there was but one entry on the page  this is it i suppose he said  a womani should say an idiot left a pheasant minus  no more a hidyot than yourself young man nor a minus neither cried the woman swelling with indignation and red in the face  just then a lady entered the shop and approached the counter hurriedly  oh she exclaimed almost in a shriek of astonishment mr aspel  mr aspel indeed cried the woman with ineffable scornmr impudence more like  give me my bird i say  the lady raised her veil and displayed the amazed face of miss lillycrop  i came to inquire for my old friendim so grieved i was not awaremr aspel  give me my bird i say demanded the virago  step this way madam said aspel driven almost to distraction as he opened the door of the back shop  mrs murridge show this lady up to mr blurts roomnow then woman take youryourbrute and be off  he thrust the oneeyed pheasant into the customers bosom with such vigour that fearing a personal assault she retreated to the door there she came to a full stop turned about raised her right hand savagely exclaimed youre another let her fingers go off with the force of a peacracker and stumbling into the street went her devious way    chapter ten  a mystery cleared up  when night had fairly hung its sable curtains over the great city mr blurt descended to the shop  now mr aspel ill relieve you  the lady you sent up miss lillycrop is it seems an old friend of my brother and she insists on acting the part of nurse tonight  i am all the better pleased because i have business to attend to at the other end of the town  we will therefore close the shop and you can go home  by the way have you a home  o yes said aspel with a laugh  a poor enough one truly off the strand  indeedthat reminds me we always pay salaries in advance in this office  here is a sovereign to account of your first quarter  we can settle the amount afterwards  aspel accepted the coin with a not particularly good grace  now then you had betterhaexcuse meput up the shutters  instantly the youth pulled out the sovereign and laid it on the counter  no sir he said firmly i am willing to aid you in your difficulties but i am not willing to become a mere shopboyat least not while there is mans work to be had  mr blurt looked perplexed  what are we to do he asked  hire a little boy said aspel  but there are no little boys about he said looking out into the street where the wind was sending clouds of dust and bits of straw and paper into the air  i would do it myself but have not time im late as it is  ah  i have itmrs murridge  calling the faithful domestic he asked if she knew how to put up the shutters and would do it  she was quite willing and set about it at once while mr blurt nodded goodnight and went away  with very uncomfortable feelings george aspel stood in the shop his tall figure drawn up his arms crossed on his broad breast and his finely formed head bent slightly down as he sternly watched the operation  mrs murridge was a resolute woman  she put up most of the shutters promptly in spite of the high wind but just as she was fixing the last of them a blast caught it and almost swept it from her grasp  for two seconds there was a tough struggle between boreas and the old woman gallantry forbade further inaction  aspel rushed out just in time to catch mrs murridge and the shutter in his strong arms as they were about to be swept into the kennel  he could do no more however than hold them there the wind being too much even for him  while in this extremity he received timely aid from some one whom the indistinct light revealed as a broadshouldered little fellow in a grey uniform with his assistance the shutter was affixed and secured  thank you friend whoever you are said aspel heartily as he turned and followed the panting mrs murridge  but the friend instead of replying seized aspel by the arm and walked with him into the shop  george aspel he said  george looked down and beheld the all but awestricken visage of philip maylands  without uttering a word the former sat down on the counter and burst into a fit of halfsavage laughter  ah then you may laugh till you grow fat said phil but its more than that you must do if im to join you in the laugh  what more can i do phil asked aspel wiping his eyes  sure ye can explain said phil  well sit down on the counter and ill explain returned aspel shutting and locking the door  then mounting the stool he entered into a minute explanationnot only in reference to his present position and circumstances but regarding his recent misfortunes  phils admiration and love for his friend were intense but that did not altogether blind him to his faults  he listened attentively sympathetically but gravely and said little  he felt somehow that london was a dangerous place compared with the west of irelandthat his friend was in danger of something vague and undefinedthat he himself was in danger ofhe knew not what  while the two were conversing they heard a step in the now quiet street  it advanced quickly and stopped at the door  there was a rustling sound something fell on the floor and the step passed on  its only a few letters said aspel mr blurt explained matters to me this morning  they seem to have been a careless lot who have managed this business hitherto  a slit was made in the door for letters but no box has ever been attached to the slit  the letters put through it at night are just allowed to fall on the floor as you see and are picked up in the morning  as i am not yet fully initiated into my duties and dont feel authorised to open these we will let them liehallo look there  the last words were uttered in a low soft tone  phil maylands glanced in his friends face and was directed by his eyes to a corner near the front door where from behind the shelter of an overstuffed pelican of the wilderness two intensely bright little eyes were seen glistening the gradual advance of a sharp nose revealed the fact that their owner was a rat  no red indian of the prairie ever sat with more statuesque rigidity watching his foe than did these two friends sit watching that rat they were sportsmen both by nature and practice to the backbone  the idiotic owl at their elbow was not more still than theyone point only excepted phils right hand moved imperceptibly like the hourhand of a watch towards a book which lay on the counter  their patience was rewarded  supposing no doubt that the youths had suddenly died to suit its convenience the rat advanced a step or two looked suspicious became reassured advanced a little farther and displayed its tail to full advantage  after smelling at various objects with a view no doubt to supper it finally came on the letters appeared to read their addresses with some attention and seizing one by a corner began apparently to open it  at this point phil maylands fingers closing slowly but with the deadly precision of fate grasped the book and hurled it at the foe which was instantly swept off its legs  either the blow or the fright caused the rat to fly wriggling into the air  with a shriek of agonised emotion it vanished behind the pelican of the wilderness  bravo phil splendidly aimed but rather low cried aspel as he vaulted the counter and dislodged the pelican  of course the rat was gone  after a little more conversation the two friends quitted the place and went to their respective homes  very odd and absolutely unaccountable observed mr blurt as he sat next morning perusing the letters above referred to heres the same thing occurred again  brownlow writes that he sent a cheque a week ago and no one has heard of it  that rascal who made off with the cash could not have stolen it because he never stole chequesfor fear no doubt of being caughtand this was only for a small amount  then here is a cheque come all right from thomson  why should one appear and the other disappear  could the rats have made away with it suggested aspel who had told his patron of the previous nights incident  rats might destroy letters but they could not eat themat least not during the few hours of the night that they lie on the floor  no the thing is a mystery  i cannot help thinking that the postoffice is to blame  i shall make inquiries  i am determined to get to the bottom of it  so it ever is with mankind  people make mistakes or are guilty of carelessness and straightway they lay the blamenot only without but against reasonon broader shoulders than their own  that wonderful and almost perfect british postoffice delivers quickly safely and in good condition above fourteen hundred millions of letters etcetera in the year but some halfdozen letters addressed to messrs blurt and company have gone amissingtherefore the postoffice is to blame  full of this idea mr enoch blurt put on his hat with an irascible fling and went off to the city  arrived at st martinslegrand he made for the principal entrance  at any other time he would have been struck with the grandeur of the buildings  he would have paused and admired the handsome colonnade of the old office and the fine front of the new buildings opposite but mr blurt could see nothing except missing letters  architecture appealed to him in vain  perhaps his state of irritability was increased by a vague suspicion that all government officials were trained and almost bound to throw obstacles in the way of free inquiry  i want said he planting himself defiantly in front of an official who encountered him in the passage to see thethesecretary the thepostmastergeneral the chief of the postoffice whoever he may be  there is my card  certainly sir will you step this way  the official spoke with such civility and led the way with such alacrity that mr blurt felt it necessary to think exclusively of his wrongs lest his indignation should cool too soon  having shown him into a comfortable waitingroom the official went off with his card  in a few minutes a gentleman entered accosted mr blurt with a polite bow and asked what he could do for him  sir said mr blurt summoning to his aid the last rags of his indignation i come to make a complaint  many of the letters addressed to our firm are missinghave been missing for some time pastand from the inquiries i have made it seems evident to me that they must have been lost in passing through the postoffice  i regret much to hear this returned the gentleman whomas mr blurt never ascertained who he waswe shall style the secretary at all events he represented that officer  you may rely on our doing our utmost to clear up the matter  will you be kind enough to give me the full particulars  the secretarys urbanity gave the whole of mr blurts last rags of indignation to the winds  he detailed his case with his usual earnestness and goodnature  the secretary listened attentively to the close  well mr blurt he said we will investigate the matter without delay but from what you have told me i think it probable that the blame does not lie with us you would be surprised if you knew the number of complaints made to us which on investigation turn out to be groundless  allow me to cite one or two instances  in one case a missing letter having fallen from the letterbox of the person to whom it was addressed on to the hallfloor was picked up by a dog and buried in some straw where it was afterwards found  in another case the missing letter was discovered sticking against the side of the private letterbox where it had lain unobserved and in another the letter had been placed between the leaves of a book as a mark and forgotten  boys and others sent to post letters are also frequently unfaithful and sometimes stupid  many letters have been put into the receptacles for dust in our streets under the impression that they were pillar letterboxes and on one occasion a lettercarrier found two letters forced behind the plate affixed to a pillar letterbox which indicates the hours of collection obviously placed there by the ignorant sender under the impression that that was the proper way of posting them  your mention of rats reminds me of several cases in which these animals have been the means of making away with letters  the fact that rats have been seen in your shop and that your late letters drop on the floor and are left there till morning inclines me to think that rats are at the bottom of it  i would advise you to make investigation without delay  i will sir i will exclaimed mr blurt starting up with animation and i thank you heartily for the trouble you have taken with my case goodmorning  i shall see to this at once  and mr blurt did see to it at once  he went straight back to his brothers house and made preparation for a campaign against the rats for being a sanguine and impulsive man he had now become firmly convinced that these animals were somehow at the bottom of the mystery but he kept his thoughts and intentions to himself  during the day george aspel observed that his friend employed himself in making some unaccountable alterations in the arrangements of one part of the shop and ventured to ask what he was about but receiving a vague reply he said no more  that night after the shop was closed and aspel had gone home and mr fred blurt had gone to sleep under the guardianship of the faithful miss lillycrop and mrs murridge had retired to the coalholeor something like itwhich was her dormitory mr enoch blurt entered the shop with a mysterious air bearing two green tablecloths  these he hung like curtains at one corner of the room and placed a chair behind them raised on two empty packingboxes  seating himself in this chair he opened the curtains just enough to enable him to peep through and found that he could see the letterslit in the door over the counter but not the floor beneath it  he therefore elevated his throne by means of another packingbox  all being ready he lowered the gas to something like a dim religious light and began his watch  it bade fair to be a tedious watch but enoch blurt had made up his mind to go through with it and whatever enoch made up his mind to do he did  suddenly he heard a scratching sound  this was encouraging  another moment and a bright pair of miniature stars were seen to glitter behind the pelican of the wilderness  in his eagerness to see mr blurt made a slight noise and the stars went outsuddenly  this was exceedingly vexatious  he blamed himself bitterly resettled himself in his chair rearranged the curtains and glared intently  but although mr blurt could fix his eyes he could not chain his thoughts these unruly familiars ere long began to play havoc with their owner they hurried him far away from rats and ornithological specimens carried him over the irish channel made him look sadly down on the funnels of the royal mail steamer plunged him under the waves and caused him to gaze in fond regret on his lost treasures  his thoughts carried him even further  they bore him over the sea to africa and set him down once more in his forsaken hut among the diamonddiggers from this familiar retreat he was somewhat violently recalled by a scratching sound  he glared at the pelican of the wilderness  the little stars reappeared  they increased in size  they became unbearable suns  they suddenly approached  as suddenly mr blurt rose to fight or flyhe could scarce tell which  it did not matter much because next instant he fell headlong to the floor dragging the curtains down and forming a miscellaneous avalanche with the chair and packingboxes  the unfortunate man had fallen asleep and the rats which had in truth ventured out fled to their homes as a matter of course  but mr blurt had resolved to go through with it  finding that he was unhurt and that the household had not been disturbed he rebuilt his erection and began his watch over again  the shock had thoroughly roused him  he did not sleep again  fortunately london rats are not nervous  being born and bred in the midst of wars alarms they soon get over a panic  the watcher had not sat more than a quarter of an hour when the stars appeared once again  the pyramid of cheops is not more immovably solid than was mr blurt  a sharp nose advanced a head came out a body followed a tail brought up the rear and the pelican of the wilderness looked with calm indifference on the scene  the rat was an old grey one and very large  it was followed by a brown one nearly as large  there was an almost theatrical caution in their movements at first but courage came with immunity from alarm  six letters that had been thrust through the slit by the evening postman lay on the floor  to these the grey rat advanced seized one in its teeth and began to back out dragging the letter after it  the brown rat followed the grey rats example  while thus engaged another brown rat appeared and followed suit  nothing could have been more fortunate  mr blurt was charmed  he could afford to let the grey rat well out of sight because the two brown rats following in succession would when he sprang on them leave a trail of letters to point the direction of their flight  just as the third rat dragged its missive behind the pelican of the wilderness the watcher leaped upon them and in his haste consigned the pelican to all but irretrievable destruction  the rats vanished but left the telltale letters the last two forming pointers to the first which was already half dragged through a slit between the skirting and the wall  at the extremity of this slit yawned the gateway to the rats palace  mr blurt rubbed his hands chuckled crowed internally and having rescued the letters went to bed  next morning he procured a crowbar and with the able assistance of george aspel tore off the skirting uprooted a plank and discovered a den in which were stored thirtyone letters six postcards and three newspapers  see postmastergenerals report for 1877 page 13  the corners of the letters bearing the stamps were nibbled away showing that gumnot money or curiositywas the occasion of the theft  as four of these letters contained cheques and moneyorders their discovery afforded instant relief to the pressure which had been gradually bearing with intolerable weight on the affairs of messrs blurt and company    chapter eleven  the lettercarrier goes his rounds aids a little girl and overwhelms a lady statistically  solomon flint being a man of letters was naturally a hardworking man by night and by day did that faithful servant of his queen and country tramp through the streets of london with the letters of the lieges in his care  the dim twilight of early morning found him poking about like a solitary ghoul disembowelling the pillar posts  the rising sun sent a deflected ray from chimneypot or steeple to welcome himwhen fog and smoke permitted  the noontide beams broiled him in summer and cheered him in winter on his benignant path of usefulness  the evening fogs and glimmering lamps beheld him hard at work and the nightly returning stars winked at him with evident surprise when they found him still fagging along through heat and cold rain and snow with the sense of urgent duty ever present in his breast and part of the recorded hopes joys fears sorrows loves hates business and humbug of the world in his bag  besides being a hardworking man solomon flint was a public man and a man of note  in the district of london which he frequented thousands of the public watched for him wished for him even longed for him and received him gladly  young eyes sometimes sparkled and old eyes sometimes brightened when his wellknown uniform appeared  footmen opened to him with goodwill and servantgirls with smiles  even in the low neighbourhoods of his districtand he traversed several such solomon was regarded with favour  his person was as sacred as that of a detective or a city missionary  men who scowled on the world at large gave a familiar nod to him and women who sometimes desired to tear off peoples scalps never displayed the slightest wish to damage a hair of the postmans head  he moved about in fact like a benign influence distributing favours and doing good wherever he went  may it not be said truly that in the spiritual world we have a good many newsbearers of a similar stamp  are not the loving the gentle the selfsacrificing suchin a word the christlike who if they do not carry letters about are themselves living epistles known and read of all men  one of the low districts through which solomon flint had to pass daily embraced the dirty court in which abel bones dwelt  anticipating a very different fate for it no doubt the builder of this region had named it archangel court  as he passed rapidly through it solomon observed a phenomenon by no means unusual in london and elsewhere namely a very small girl taking charge of an uncommonly large baby  urgent though his duties were solomon would have been more than human if he had not stopped to observe the little girl attempt the apparently impossible feat of lifting the frolicsome mass of fat which was obviously in a rebellious state of mind  solomon had occasionally seen the little girl in his rounds but never before in possession of a baby  she grasped him round the waist which her little arms could barely encircle and making a mighty effort got the rebel on his legs  a second heave placed him on her knees and a third effort worthy of a gymnast threw him on her little bosom  she had to lean dangerously far back to keep him there and being incapable of seeing before her owing to the bulk of her burden was compelled to direct her course by faith  she knew the court well however and was progressing favourably when a loose stone tripped her and she fell  not having far to fall neither she nor the baby was the worse for it  hallo little woman said solomon assisting her to rise cant he walk  yes sir but e wont replied the little maid turning up her pretty face and shaking back her dishevelled hair  the baby looked up and crowed gleefully as though it understood her and would if able to speak have said thats the exact truthhe wont  come ill help you said solomon carrying the baby to the mouth of the alley pointed out by the little girl  is he your brother  o no sir i aint got no brother  he blonged to a neighbour whos just gone dead an mother she was fond o the neighbour an promised to take care of the baby  so she gave im to me to nuss  an oh youve no hidea sir what a hobstinate thing e is  ive ad im three days now  yes the child had had him three days and an amazing experience it had been to her  during that brief period she had become a confirmed staggerer being utterly incapable of walking with baby in her arms during the same period she had become unquestionably entitled to the gold medals of the lifeboat institution and the humane society having with reckless courage at the imminent risk of her life and on innumerable occasions saved that baby from death by drowning in washtubs and kennels from mutilation by hot water fire and steam and from sudden extinction by the wheels of cabs carriages and drays while at the same time she had established a fair claim to at least the honorary diploma of the royal college of surgeons by her amazing practice in the treatment of bruises and cuts and the application of stickingplaster  have you got a father or mother my dear asked the lettercarrier  yes sir ive got both of em  and oh  im so miserable  i dont know what to do  why whats wrong with you  the childs eyes filled with tears as she told how her father had gone off on the spree how her mother had gone out to seek him promising to be back in time to relieve her of the baby so as to let her keep an appointment she had with a lady and how the mother had never come back and didnt seem to be coming back and how the time for the engagement was already past and she feared the lady would think she was an ungrateful little liar and she had no messenger to send to her  where does the lady live and whats her name little woman asked solomon  her name is miss lillycrop sir and she lives in pimlico  well make your mind easy little woman  its a curious coincidence that i happen to know miss lillycrop  her house lies rather far from my beat but i happen to have a messenger who does his work both cheaply and quickly  i do a deal of work for him too so no doubt hell do a little for me  his name is postofficewhat is yours my dear  tottie bones replied the child with the air of a fullgrown woman an please sir tell er i meant to go back to her at the end of three days as i promised but i couldnt leave the ouse with baby inside an the fire an the kittle with nobody to take care on emcould i sir  cernly not little woman returned the lettercarrier with a solemn look at the overburdened creature who appealed to him  giving her twopence and a kindly nod solomon flint walked smartly awaywith a reproving conscienceto make up for lost time  that evening mrs bones returned without her husband but with an additional black eye and other signs of bad treatment  she found the baby sound asleep and tottie in the same condition by his side on the outside of the poor counterpane with one arm round her charge and her hair tumbled in confusion over him  she had evidently been herself overcome while in the act of putting the baby to sleep  mrs bones rushed to the bed seized tottie clasped her tightly to her bosom sat down on a stool and began to rock herself to and fro  the child nothing loath to receive such treatment awoke sufficiently to be able to throw her arms round her mothers neck fondled her for a moment and then sank again into slumber  oh  god help me  god save my abel from drink and bad men exclaimed the poor woman in a voice of suppressed agony  it seemed as if her prayer had been heard for at that moment the door opened and a tall thin man entered  he was the man who had accosted george aspel on his first visit to that region  youve not found him i fear he said kindly as he drew a stool near to mrs bones and sat down while tottie who had been reawakened by his entrance began to bustle about the room with something of the guilty feeling of a sentry who has been found sleeping at his post  yes mr sterling thank you kindly for the interest you take in im i found im at the old place but e knocked me down an went out an ive not been able to find im since  well take comfort molly said the city missionary for such he was ive just seen him taken up by the police and carried to the station as drunk and incapable  that you know will not bring him to very great trouble and i have good reason to believe it will be the means of saving him from much worse  he glanced at the little girl as he spoke  tottie dear said mrs bones you go out for a minute or two i want to speak with mr sterling  yes mother and ill run round to the bank ive got twopence more to put in said tottie as she went out  your lesson has not been lost sir said the poor woman with a faint smile tottie has a good bit o money in the penny savingsbank now she draws some of it out every time abel brings us to the last gasp but we dont let im know were it comes from  to be sure e dont much care  shes a dear child is tottie  thank the lord for that molly  he is already answering our prayers said mr sterling  just trust him keep up heart and persevere were sure to win at last  when tottie bones left the dark and dirty den that was the only home she had ever known she ran lightly out into the neighbouring street and threading her way among people and vehicles entered an alley ascended a stair and found herself in a room which bore some resemblance to an empty schoolroom  at one corner there was a desk at which stood a young man at work on a businesslooking book  before him were several children of various ages and sizes but all having one characteristic in commonthe aspect of extreme poverty  the young man was a gratuitous servant of the public and the place was for the hour at least a penny savingsbank  it was one of those admirable institutions which are now numerous in our land and which derive their authority from him who said gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost  noble work was being done there not so much because of the mere pence which were saved from the grog and tobacco shops as because of the habits of thrift which were being formed as well as the encouragement of that spirit of thoughtful economy which like the spirit of temperance is one of the handmaids of religion  please sir said tottie to the penny banker i wants to pay in tuppence  she handed over her bankbook with the money  receiving the former back she stared at the mysterious figures with rapt attention  please sir ow much do it come to now she asked  its eight and sevenpence tottie replied the amiable banker with a smile  thank you sir said tottie and hurried home in a species of heavenly contemplation of the enormous sum she had accumulated  when solomon flint returned home that night he found miss lillycrop seated beside old mrs flint shouting into her deafest ear  she desisted when solomon entered and rose to greet him  i have come to see my niece mr flint do you expect her soon  the lettercarrier consulted his watch  it is past her time now miss lillycrop she cant be long  pray sit down  youll stay and ave a cup of tea with us  now dont say no were just goin to ave it and my old ooman delights in company there now sit down an dont go splittin your lungs on that side of her next time you chance to be alone with her  its her deaf side  a cannon would make no impression on that side except you was to fire it straight into her earive got a message for you miss lillycrop  a message for me  ay from a beautiful angel with tumbled hair and jagged clothes named tottie bones  aint it strange how coincidences happen in this life  i goes an speaks to tottie which i never did before  tottie wants very bad to send a message to miss lillycrop  i happens to know miss lillycrop an takes the message and on coming home finds miss lillycrop here before meand all on the same nightaint it odd  it is very odd mr flint and pray what was the message  the lettercarrier having first excused himself for making arrangements for the evening meal while he talked hereupon related the circumstances of his meeting with the child and had only concluded when may maylands came in looking a little fagged but sunny and bright as usual  of course she added her persuasions to those of her landlord and miss lillycrop being induced to stay to tea was taken into mays private boudoir to put off her bonnet  while there the good lady inquired eagerly about her cousins health and work and companions asked for her mother and brother and chatted pleasantly about her own work among the poor in the immediate neighbourhood of her dwelling  by the way said she that reminds me that i chanced to meet with that tall handsome friend of your brothers in very strange circumstances  do you know that he has become a shopman in the birdshop of my dear old friend mr blurt who is very illhas been ill i should have saidwere you aware of that  no answered may in a low tone  i thought he came to england by the invitation of sir somebody something who had good prospects for him  did not you  so i thought said may turning her face away from the light  it is very strange continued miss lillycrop giving a few hasty touches to her cap and hair and do you know i could not help thinking that there was something queer about his appearance  i can scarce tell what it was  it seemed to me likelikebut it is disagreeable even to think about such things in connection with one who is such a fine clever gentlemanly fellowbut  fortunately for poor may her friend was suddenly stopped by a shout from the outer room  hallo ladies how long are you goin to be titivatin yourselves there aint no company comin  the sausages are on the table and the old oomans gittin so impatient that shes beginnin to abuse the cat  this last remark was too true and sad to be passed over in silence  old mrs flints age had induced a spirit of temporary oblivion as to surroundings which made her act especially to her favourite cat in a manner that seemed unaccountable  it was impossible to conceive that cruelty could actuate one who all her life long had been a very pattern of tenderness to every living creature  when therefore she suddenly changed from stroking and fondling her cat to pulling its tail tweaking its nose slapping its face and tossing it off her lap it is only fair to suppose that her mind had ceased to be capable of two simultaneous thoughts and that when it was powerfully fixed on sausages she was not aware of what her hands were doing to the cat  youll excuse our homely arrangements miss lillycrop said mr flint as he helped his guest to the good things on the table  i never could get over a tendency to a roughandready sort o feedin  but youll find the victuals good  thank you mr flint  i am sure you must be very tired after the long walks you take  i cant think how postmen escape catching colds when they have such constant walking in all sorts of weather  its the constancy as saves us maam but we dont escape altogether said flint heaping large supplies on his grandmothers plate  we often kitch colds but they dont often do us damage  this remark led miss lillycrop who had a very inquiring mind to induce solomon flint to speak about the postoffice and as that worthy man was enthusiastic in regard to everything connected with his profession he willingly gratified his visitor  now i want to know said miss lillycrop after the conversation had run on for some time and appetites began to abatewhen you go about the poorer parts of the city in dark nights if you are ever attacked or have your letters stolen from you  well no maamnever  i cant in all my long experience call to mind sitch a thing happenineither to me or to any other lettercarrier  the worst of people receives us kindly cause you see we go among em to do em service  i did indeed once hear of a letter being stolen but the thief was not a manhe was a tame raven  oh solomon said may with a laugh  remember that grannie hears you  no she dont but its all the same if she did  whatever i say about the postoffice i can give chapter and verse for  the way of it was this  the lettercarrier was a friend o mine  he was goin his rounds at kelvedon in essex when a tame raven seized a money letter he had in his hand and flew away with it  after circlin round the town he alighted and before he could be prevented tore the letter to pieces on puttin the bits together the contents o the letter was found to be a cheque for thirty pounds and of course when the particulars o the strange case were made known the cheque was renewedthere now concluded solomon if you dont believe that story youve only got to turn up the postmastergenerals report for 1862 and youll find it there on page 24  how curious said miss lillycrop  theres another thing i want to know she added looking with deep interest into the countenance of her host while that stalwart man continued to stow incredible quantities of sausages and crumpets into his capacious mouth  is it really true that people post letters without addresses  true maam why of course its true  thousands of people do  the average number of letters posted without addresses is about eighty a day  how strange  i wonder what causes this  miss lillycrop gazed contemplatively into her teacup and solomon became suddenly aware that grannies plate was empty  having replenished it he ordered dollops to bring more crumpets and then turned to his guest  ill tell you what it is maam that causes thisits forgetfulness or rather what we call absence of mind  its my solemn belief maam that if our heads warnt screwed on pretty tight youd see some hundreds of people walkin about london of a mornin with nothin whatever on their shoulders  why there was one man actually posted a cheque for 9 pounds 15 shillings loose in a pillar letterbox in liverpool without even an envelope on it  the owner was easily traced through the bank but was unable to explain how the cheque got out of his possession or into the pillarjust listen to this maam he added rising and taking down a pamphlet from a bookshelf this is last years report hear what it says  nearly 28500 letters were posted this year without addresses 757 of these letters were found to contain in the aggregate about 214 pounds in cash and banknotes and about 9088 pounds in bills of exchange cheques etceteraof course said the lettercarrier refreshing himself with a mouthful of tea the money and bills were returned to the senders but it warnt possible to do the same with 52856 postagestamps which were found knocking about loose in the bottom of the mailbags  how many cried miss lillycrop in amazement  fiftytwo thousand eight hundred and fiftysix repeated solomon with deliberation  no doubt he continued some of these stamps had bin carelessly stuck on the envelopes and some of em praps had come out of busted letters which contained stamps sent in payment of small accounts  youve no idea maam what a lot o queer things get mixed up in the mailbags out of bust letters and packagesall along of people puttin things into flimsy covers not fit to hold em  last year no fewer than 12525 miscellaneous articles reached the returned letter office we used to call it the dead letter office without covers or addresses and the number of inquiries dealt with in regard to these things and missing letters by that office was over 91000  were very partickler miss lillycrop in regard to these things continued solomon with a touch of pride  we keep books in which every stray article unaddressed is entered and described minutely so that when people come howlin at us for our carelessness in nondelivery we ask em to describe their missing property and in hundreds of cases prove to them their own carelessness in makin up parcels by handin the wrecks over to em  but what sort of things are they that break loose asked miss lillycrop  oh many sorts  anything may break loose if its ill packed and as almost every sort of thing passes through the post it would be difficult to describe em all  here is a list however that may give you an idea of what kind of things the public sent through our mailbags last year  a packet of pudding a steamgauge a tin of cream a birds wing a musical box packet of snowdrops fruit sweets shrimps and sample potatoes a dormouse four white mice two goldfinches a lizard and a blindworm all alive besides cutlery medicines varnish ointments perfumery articles of dress a stoat a squirrel fish leeches frogs beetles caterpillars and vegetables  of course many of these such as live animals being prohibited articles were stopped and sent to the returned letter office but were restored on application to the senders  observing miss lillycrops surprised expression of face the old womans curiosity was roused  whats he haverin aboot my dear she asked of may  about the many strange things that are sent through the post grannie  ay ay likely enough returned the old creature shaking her head and administering an unintentional cuff to the poor cat folk write a heap o lees nooadays nae doot  youd hardly believe it now continued solomon turning the leaves of the report but its a fact that live snakes have frequently been sent through the post  no later than last year a snake about a yard long managed to get out of his box in one of the night mail sorting carriages on the london and northwestern railway  after a good deal of confusion and interruption to the work it was killed  again a small box was sent to the returned letter office in liverpool which when opened was found to contain eight living snakes  come now mr flint said may you mustnt bore my cousin with the postoffice  you know that when you once begin on that theme there is no stopping you  very well miss may returned the lettercarrier with a modest smile lets draw round the fire and talk of something elsehallo dollops clear away the dishes  but he doesnt bore me protested miss lillycrop who had the happy knack of being intensely interested in whatever happened to interest her friends  i like of all things to hear about the postoffice  i had no idea it was such a wonderful institutiondo tell me more about it mr flint and never mind mays saucy remarks  much gratified by this appeal solomon wheeled the old woman to her own corner of the fire placed a stool under her feet the cat on her knees and patted her shoulder all of which attentions she received with a kindly smile and said that sol was a good laddie  meanwhile the rotund maidofallwork having as it were hurled the crockery into her den and the circle round the fire having been completed as well as augmented by the sudden entrance of phil maylands the good laddie reopened fire  yes maam as you well observe it is a wonderful institution  more than that its a gigantic one and it takes a big staff to do the duty too  in london alone the staff is 10665  the entire staff of the kingdom is 13763 postmasters 10000 clerks and 21000 lettercarriers sorters and messengerssum total a trifle over 45500  then the total number of postoffices and receptacles for receiving letters throughout the kingdom is 25000 odd  before the introduction of the penny postagein the year 1840there were only 4500  then again  o mr flint pray stop cried miss lillycrop pressing her hands to her eyes i never could take in figures  at least i never could keep them in  they just go in here and come out there pointing to her two ears and leave no impression whatever  youre not the only one thats troubled with that weakness maam said the gallant solomon but if a few thousands puzzle you so much what will you make of thisthe total number of letters postcards newspapers etcetera that passed through the postoffices of the kingdom last year was fourteen hundred and seventyseven million eight hundred and twentyeight thousand two hundred  what dye make o that maam  mr flint i just make nothing of it at all returned miss lillycrop with a placid smile  come phil said may laughing can you make nothing of it  you used to be good at arithmetic  well now said phil it dont take much knowledge of arithmetic to make something of that  george aspel happened to be talking to me about that very sum not long ago  he said he had been told by a man at the postoffice that it would take a man about a hundred and seventy years to count it  i tried the calculation and found he was right  then i made another calculation  i put down the average length of an envelope at four inches and i found that if you were to lay fourteen hundred and seventyseven million letters out in a straight line end to end the lot would extend to above 93244 miles which is more than three times the circumference of the world  moreover this number is considerably more than the population of the whole world which at the present time is about 1444 millions so that if the british postoffice were to distribute the 1477 millions of letters that pass through it in the year impartially every man woman and child on the globe would receive one letter postcard newspaper or bookpacket and leave thirtythree millions to spare  now really you must stop this said may i see that my cousins colour is going with her efforts to understand you  cant you give her something more amusing to think of  oh cernly said solomon again turning with alacrity to the report would you like to hear what some people think its our dooty to attend to  ill give you a letter or two received by our various departments  here the lettercarrier began to read the following letters which we give from the same report some being addressed to the chief of the dead office others to the postmastergeneral etcetera  may 18  dear siri write to ask you for some information about finding out persons who are missingi want to find out my mother and sisters who are in melbourne in australia i believeif you would find out for me please let me know by return of post and also your charge at the lowest yours etcetera  nov 8 18  sirnot having received the live bullfinch mentioned by you as having arrived at the returned letter office two days ago having been posted as a letter contrary to the regulations of the postal system i now write to ask you to have the bird fed and forwarded at once to  and to apply for all fines and expenses to   if this is not done and i do not receive the bird before the end of the week i shall write to the postmastergeneral who is a very intimate friend of my fathers and ask him to see that measures are taken against you for neglect  this is not an idle threat so you will oblige by following the above instructions  wales nov 12 18  dear siri am taking the liberty of writeing you those few lines as i am given to understand that you do want men in new south wales and i am a smith by trade a single man  my age is 24 next birthday  i shood be verry thankful if you would be so kind and send all the particulars by return  london nov 5 18  siri right to you and request of you sinsearly for to help me to find out my husband  i ham quite a stranger in london only two months left irelandi can find know trace of my husbandyour the only gentleman that i know that can help me to find him  thears is letters goes to him to  in his name and thears is letters comes to him to the  postoffice for himsir you may be sure that i ham low in spirit in a strange contry without a friend  i hope you will be so kind as not to forget me  sir i would never find  for i would go astray besides i have no money  so you see maam continued solomon closing the report much though we do more is expected of us  but although we cant exactly comply with such requests as these we do a pretty stroke of business in other ways besides letterdistributin  for instance we are bankers on a considerable scale  through our moneyorder agency the sum we transmitted last year was a trifle over 27870000 pounds while the deposits in our savingsbanks amounted to over 9166000 pounds  then as to telegraphs there werebut i forgot said solomon checking himself miss may is the proper authority on that subjecthow many words was it you sent last year  i wont tell you said may with a toss of her little head  you have already driven my cousin distracted  she wont be able to walk home  my dear i dont intend to walk home i shall take a cab said the mild little woman  do tell me something about your department  no cousin i wont  sure if ye dont i will said phil  well then i will tell you a very little just to save you from phil who if he once begins will kill you with his calculations  but you cant appreciate what i say  let me see  the total number of telegraphic messages forwarded by our offices in the united kingdom during the last twelve months amounted to a little more than twentytwo millions  dear me said miss lillycrop with that look and tone which showed that if may had said twentytwo quintillions it would have had no greater effect  there thats enough said may laughing  i knew it was useless to tell you  ah may said phil thats because you dont know how to tell her see here now cousin sarah  the average length of a message is thirty words  well that gives 660 millions of words  now a good average storybook of 400 pages contains about ninetysix thousand words divide the one by the other and that gives you a magnificent library of 6875 volumes as the work done by the postal telegraphs every year  all these telegrams are kept for a certain period in case of inquiry and then destroyed  phil i must put on my things and go exclaimed miss lillycrop rising  ive had quite as much as i can stand  just cap it all with this maam to keep you steady interposed solomon flintthe total revenue of the postoffice for the year was six millions and fortyseven thousand pounds and the expenditure three millions nine hundred and ninetyone thousand  now you may consider yourself pretty well up in the affairs of the postoffice  the old ooman awaking at this point with a start hurled the cat under the grate and may laughingly led miss lillycrop into her little boudoir    chapter twelve  in which a bosom friend is introduced rural felicity is enlarged on and deep plans are laid  a bosom friend is a pleasant possession  miss lillycrop had one  she was a strongminded woman  we do not say this to her disparagement  a strong mind is as admirable in woman as in man  it is only when woman indicates the strength of her mind by unfeminine selfassertion that we shrink from her in alarm  miss lillycrops bosom friend was a warmhearted charitable generous hardfeatured squareshouldered deepchested largeboned lady of middle age and quick temper  she was also in what is styled comfortable circumstances and dwelt in a pretty suburban cottage  her name was maria stivergill  come with me child said miss stivergill to miss lillycrop one day and spend a week at the rosebud  it must not be supposed that the good lady had given this romantic name to her cottage  no when miss stivergill bought it she found the name on the two gateposts found that all the tradespeople in the vicinity had imbibed it and therefore quietly accepted it as she did all the ordinary affairs of life  impossible dear maria said her friend with a perplexed look i have so many engagements at least so many duties that  pooh interrupted miss stivergill  put em off  fulfil em when you come back  at all events she continued seeing that miss lillycrop still hesitated come for a night or two  but  come now lillythus she styled her friendbut give me no buts you know that youve no good reason for refusing  indeed i have pleaded miss lillycrop my little servant  what the infant who opened the door to me  yes tottie bones she is obliged to stay at nights with me just now owing to her mother poor thing being under the necessity of shutting up her house while she goes to look after a drunken husband who has forsaken her  hah exclaimed miss stivergill giving a nervous pull at her left glove which produced a wide rent between the wrist and the thumb  i wonder why women marry  dont you think its a sort ofofunavoidable necessity suggested miss lillycrop with a faint smile  not at all my dear not at all  i have avoided it  so have you  if i had my way id put a stop to marriage altogether and bring this miserable world to an abrupt closebut little bones is no difficulty well take her along with us  but dear maria  well what further objections lilly  tottie has charge of a baby and  what one baby in charge of another  indeed it is too true and you know you couldnt stand a baby  couldnt i said miss stivergill sharply  how dyou know that  let me see it  tottie being summoned with the baby entered the room staggering with the rotund mountain of goodnatured selfwill entirely concealing her person with exception of her feet and the pretty little coaldusted arms with which she clasped it to her heaving breast  ha  i suppose little bones is behind it said miss stivergillset the baby down child and let me see you  tottie obeyed  the baby true to his principles refused to stand  he sat down and stared at those around him in jovial defiance  what is your age little bones  just turned six mm replied tottie with a courtesy which miss lillycrop had taught her with great pains  youre sixtysix at the least compared with male creatures of the same age observed her interrogator  thank you mm replied tottie with another dip  have you a bonnet and shawl little bones  tottie in a state of considerable surprise replied that she had  go and put em on then and get that thing also ready to go out  miss stivergill pointed to the baby contemptuously as it were with her nose  hes a very good bybieso the child pronounced itony rather selfwilled at times mm said tottie going through the athletic feat of lifting her charge  just so  true to your womans nature  always ready to apologise for the male monster that tyrannises over you  i suppose now youd say that your drunken father was a good man  miss stivergill repented of the speech instantly on seeing the tears start into totties large eyes as she replied quicklyindeed i would mm  oh youve no notion ow kind father is wen es not in liquor  there there  of course he is  i didnt mean to say he wasnt little bones  its a curious fact that many drun i mean people given to drink are kind and amiable  its a disease  go now and get your things on and do you likewise lilly  my cab is at the door  be quick  in a few minutes the whole party descended to the street  miss stivergill locked the door with her own hand and put the key in her pocket  as she turned round totties tawdry bonnet had fallen off in her efforts to raise the baby towards the outstretched hands of her mistress while the cabman stood looking on with amiable interest  catching up the bonnet miss stivergill placed it on the childs head back to the front twisted the strings round her head and faceanyhow lifted her and her charge into the cab and followed them  where to maam said the amiable cabman  charing crossyou idiot  yes maam replied the man with a broad grin touching his hat and bestowing a wink on a passing policeman as he mounted the box  on their way to the station the good lady put out her head and shouted stop  the maligned man obeyed  stay here lilly with the babyjump out little bones  come with me  she took the childs bonnet off and flung it under the cab then grasped totties hand and led her into a shop  a hat demanded the lady of the shopwoman  what kind of hat maam  any kind replied miss stivergill suitable for this childonly see that its not a dolls hat  let it fit her  the shopwoman produced a headdress which tottie afterwards described as a billycock at with a feather in it  the purchaser paid for it thrust it firmly on the childs head and returned to the cab  a few minutes by rail conveyed them to a charmingly countrylike suburb with neat villas dotting the landscape and a few picturesque old red brick cottages scattered about here and there  such a drive to such a scene reader may seem very commonplace to you but what tongue can tell or pen describe what it was to tottie bones that pretty little human flower had been born in the heart of londonin one of the dirtiest and most unsavoury parts of that heart  being the child of a dissolute man and a hardworking woman who could not afford to go out excursioning she had never seen a green field in her life she had never seen the thames or the parks  there are many such unfortunates in the vast city  of flowerswith the exception of cauliflowersshe knew nothing save from what little she saw of them in broken pots in the dirty windows of her poor neighbourhood and on the barrows and baskets of the people who hawked them about the city  there was a legend among the neighbours of archangel court that once upon a timein some remote period of antiquitya sunbeam had been in the habit of overtopping the forest of chimneys and penetrating the court below in the middle of each summer but a large brick warehouse had been erected somewhere to the southward and had effectually cut off the supply so that sunshine was known to the very juvenile population only through the reflecting power of roofs and chimneycans and gable windows  in regard to scents it need scarcely be said that tottie had had considerable experience of that class which it is impossible to term sweet  judge then if you can what must have been the feelings of this little townsparrow when she suddenly rushed at the rate of forty miles an hour into the heavenly influences of fields and flowers hedgerows and trees farmyards and village spires horseponds country inns sheep cattle haycarts piggeries and poultry  her eyes always large and liquid became great crystal globes of astonishment as forgetful of herself and almost of baby she sat with parted lips and heaving breast gazing in rapt ecstasy from the carriage window  miss stivergill and miss lillycrop being sympathetic souls gazed with almost equal interest on the childs animated face  she only wants wings and washing to make her an angel whispered the former to the latter  but if the sights she saw on the journey inflated totties soul with joy the glories of rosebud cottage almost exploded her  it was a marvellous cottage  rosebushes surrounded it ivy smothered it leaving just enough of room for the windows to peep out and a few of the old red bricks to show in harmony with the green  creepers in great variety embraced it and a picturesque clump of trees on a knoll behind sheltered it from the east wind  there was a farmyard which did not belong to itself but was so close to it that a stranger could scarcely have told whether it formed part of the rosebud domain or that of the neighbouring cottage  the day too was exceptionally fine  it was one of those still calm sunny cloudless days which induce healthy people sometimes to wish that earth might be their permanent home  oh bybie exclaimed tottie bones when having clambered to the top of the knoll she sat down on a treeroot and gazed on the cottage and the farmyard where hens were scratching in the interest of active chickens and cows were standing in blank felicity and pigs were revelling in dirt and sunshineoh bybie its eaven upon earth aint it darling  the darling evidently agreed with her for once for lying on his back in the long grass he seized two handfuls of wildflowers kicked up his fat legs and laughed aloud  thats right darling  aint it fun  and such flowers toooh all for nothing only got to pull em  yes roll away darling you cant dirty yourself ere  come i shall ave a roll too  with which remark tottie plunged into the grass seized the baby and tumbled him and herself about to such an extent that the billycock hat was much deteriorated and the feather damaged beyond recovery  inside the rosebud the other two members of the party were also enjoying themselves though not exactly in like manner  they revelled in tea and in the feast of reason  where and when and why did you find that child asked miss stivergill  her friend related what she knew of totties history  strange remarked miss stivergill but beyond that remark she gave no indication of the state of her mind  it is indeed strange returned her friend but it is just another instance of the power of gods word to rescue and preserve souls even in the most unfavourable circumstances  totties mother is christian and all the energies of her vigorous nature are concentrated on two pointsthe training of her child in the fear of god and the saving of her husband from drink  she is a woman of strong faith and is quite convinced that her prayers will be answered because she says he who has promised is faithful but i fear much that she will not live to see it  why so demanded the other sharply  because she has a bad affection of the lungs  if she were under more favourable circumstances she might recover  pooh nonsense  people constantly recover from what is called bad affection of the lungs  can nothing be done for her  nothing replied miss lillycrop she will not leave her husband or her home  if she dies  well what then  little tottie must be rescued you know and i have set my heart on doing it  youll do nothing of the sort said miss stivergill firmly  miss lillycrop looked surprised  no you shant rescue her continued the good lady with still firmer emphasis youve got all london at your feet and theres plenty more where that one came from  come lilly you mustnt be greedy  you may have the baby if you like but you must leave little bones to me  miss lillycrop was making feeble resistance to this proposal when the subject of dispute suddenly appeared at the door with glaring eyes and a horrified expression of face  baby was in her arms as usual and both he and his nurse were drenched besides being covered from head to foot with mud  it needed little explanation to tell that in crossing a ditch on a single plank tottie had stumbled and gone headlong into the water with baby in her arms  fortunately neither was hurt though both had been terribly frightened  miss stivergill was equal to the occasion  ordering two tubs halffull of warm water into the back kitchen she stripped the unfortunates and put them therein to the intense joy of baby whose delight in a warm bath was only equalled by his pleasure in doing mischief  at first miss stivergill thought of burning the childrens garments and fitting them out afresh but on the suggestion of her friend that their appearing at home with new clothes might create suspicion and cause unpleasant inquiries she refrained  when thoroughly cleaned tottie and baby were wrapped up in shawls and set down to a hearty tea in the parlour  while this was being devoured the two friends conversed of many things among others miss stivergill touched on the subject of her progenitors and made some confidential references to her mother which her friend received with becoming sympathy  yes my dear said miss stivergill in a tone of unwonted tenderness i dont mind telling you all about her for youre a good soul with a feeling heart  her loss was a terrible loss to me though it was great gain to her  before her death we were separated for a timeonly a short timebut it proved to be a blessed separation for the letters she wrote me sparkled with love and wit and playfulness as though they had been set with pearls and rubies and diamonds  i shall show you my treasures before going to bed  i keep them in that box on the sideboard to be always handy  it is not large but its contents are more precious to me than thousands of gold and silver  she paused and then observing that tottie was staring at her she advised her to make the most of her opportunity and eat as much as possible  if you please mm i cant eat any more said tottie  cant eat more childtry urged the hospitable lady  tottie heaved a deep sigh and said that she couldnt eat another morsel if she were to try ever so much  as baby appeared to be in the same happy condition and could with difficulty keep his eyes open both children were sent to bed under the care of a maid and miss stivergill taking down her treasurebox proceeded to read part of its contents to her bosom friend  little did good miss stivergill imagine that she had dug a mine that night under rosebud cottage and that the match which was destined to light it was none other than her innocent protegee little bones  throwing herself into the receptive arms of her mother two days after the events just described tottie poured the delight and amazement of her surcharged spirit into sympathetic ears  unfortunately her glowing descriptions also reached unsympathetic ears  mrs bones had happily recovered her husband and brought him home where he lay in his familiar corner resting from his labours of iniquity  the unsympathetic ears belonged to mr abel bones  when tottie however in her discursive wandering began to talk of pearls and rubies and diamonds and treasures worth thousands of gold and silver in a box on the sideboard the ears became suddenly sympathetic and mr bones raised himself on one elbow  hush darling said mrs bones glancing uneasily at the dark corner  mr bones knew well that if his wife should caution tottie not to tell him anything about rosebud cottage he would be unable to get a word out of her  he therefore rose suddenly staggered towards the child and seized her hand  come tot you and i shall go out for a walk  oh abel dont  dear abel  but dear abel was gone and his wife clasping her hands looked helplessly and hopelessly round the room  then a gleam of light seemed to come into her eyes  she looked up and went down on her knees  meanwhile abel went into a publichouse and calling for a pint of beer bade his child drink but tottie declined  he swore with an oath that hed compel her to drink but suddenly changed his mind and drank it himself  now tot tell father all about your visit to miss stivergill  shes very richeh  oh awfully replied tottie who felt an irresistible drawing to her father when he condescended to speak to her in kindly tones  keeps a carriageeh  no nor a ossnot even a pony returned the child  an no manservant about the house  nonot as i seed  not even a gardener now  no only womentwo of em and very nice they was too  one fat and short the other tall and thin  i liked the fat one best  ha blessins on em both said mr bones with a bland smile  come now tot tell me all about the cottageinside first the rooms and winders an specially the box of treasure  then well come to the garden an so well get out by degrees to the fields and flowers  go ahead tot  it need scarcely be said that abel bones soon possessed himself of all the information he required after which he sent tottie home to her mother and went his way    chapter thirteen  miss lillycrop gets a series of surprises  what a world this is for plots  and there is no escaping them  if we are not the originators of them we are the victimsmore or less  if we dont originate them designedly we do so accidentally  we have seen how abel bones set himself deliberately to hatch one plot let us now turn to old fred blurt and see how that invalid with the help of his brother enoch unwittingly sowed the seeds of another  dear enoch said fred one day turning on his pillow i should have died but for you  and miss lillycrop fred  dont be ungrateful  if miss lillycrop had not come to my assistance its little i could have done for you  well yes i ought to have mentioned her in the same breath with yourself enoch for she has been kindvery kind and patient  now i want to know if that snake has come  are you sure youve recovered enough to attend to business asked the brother  yes quite sure  besides a snake is not businessit is pleasure  i mean to send it to my old friend balls who has been long anxious to get a specimen  i had asked a friend long ago to procure one for me and now that it has come i want you to pack it to go by post  by post echoed the brother  yes why not  because i fear that live snakes are prohibited articles  get the postoffice directory and see for yourself said the invalid  the enormous volume full six inches thick which records the abodes and places of business of all noteworthy londoners was fetched  nothing about snakes here said enoch running his eye over the paragraph referring to the articles in questionglass bottles leeches game fish but that refers to dead ones i suppose flesh fruit vegetables or other perishable substances a snake aint perishable at least not during a brief postjourneynor any bladder or other vessel containing liquid ha that touches him a snake contains blood dont itor anything whatsoever which might by pressure or otherwise be rendered injurious to the contents of the mailbags or to the officers of the postofficewell brother continued enoch im not quite sure that it comes within the forbidden degrees so well give it the benefit of the doubt and pack it  how dyou propose doing it up  in a letter  no i had a box made for it before i was taken ill  youll find it in the shop on the upper shelf beside the northern diver  the little box was brought and the snake which had been temporarily consigned to an empty glass aquarium was put into it  youre sure he dont bite fred and isnt poisonous  quite sure  then here goeswhew what a lively fellow he is  this was indeed true  the animal upwards of a yard in length somewhat resembled the eel in his efforts to elude the grasp of man but mr blurt fixed him coiled him firmly down on his bed of straw and wadding pressed a similar bed on the top of him to keep him quiet and shut the lid  there ive got him in all right  now for the screws  he cant move easily and even if he could he wouldnt make much noise  the box was finally secured with a piece of string a label with the address and the proper number of stamps was affixed and then it was committed to the care of george aspel to post in time for the evening mail  it was five minutes to six when aspel ascended the steps of st martinslegrand  the usual rush was in progress  there was a considerable crowd in front of the letterbox  instead of pushing through george took advantage of his height stretched his long arm over the heads of the people and with a good aim pitched the box into the postal jaws  for a few seconds he stood still meditating a call on phil maylands but he was not now as eager to meet his friend as he used to be  he had begun a course of dissipation and superior though he was in years physique and knowledge to his friend he felt a new and uncomfortable sense of inferiority when in the presence of the straightforward steady boy  at seventeen a year adds much to the manhood of a youth  phils powers of perception had been greatly quickened by his residence in london although he regarded aspel with as warm affection as ever he could not avoid seeing the change for the worse in him and a new feeling of deep anxiety and profound but respectful pity filled his heart  he prayed for him also but did not quite believe that his prayers would be heard for as yet he did not fully realise or comprehend the grand truths of the religion in which his mother had faithfully trained him  he did not at that time understand as he afterwards came to understand that the prayer of faithhowever weak and flutteringis surely answered whether we see the answer or not and whether the answer be immediate or long delayed  on one occasion with feelings of timorous selfabasement he ventured to remonstrate with his friend but the effort was repelled  possibly the thought of another reproof from phil was the cause of aspels decision not to look him up on the present occasion  as he descended the steps a man as tall and powerful as himself met him and stared him in the face  aspel fired up at once and returned the stare  it was abel bones on his way to post a letter  the glare intensified and for a moment it seemed as if the two giants were about to fight  a small street boy observing the pair was transfixed with ardent hope but he was doomed to disappointment  bones had clenched his right hand  if he had advanced another inch the blood of the seakings would have declared for war on the spot regardless of consequences  but bones was too old a bird thus to come within reach of his great enemy the law  besides a deeper though not immediate plan of revenge flashed into his mind  relaxing the hand and frown simultaneously he held out the former  come he said in a hearty tone i dont bear you no illwill for the crack on the nut you gave me and youve surely no occasion to bear illwill to a man you floored so neatly  shake hands  the familiarity not to say insolence of this proposal from one so much beneath him would probably have induced the youth to turn aside with scorn but the flattering reference to his pugilistic powers from one who was no mean antagonist softened his feelings  well im sure that i bear you no illwill he said with a smile extending his hand  bah chickenlivers exclaimed the small boy turning away in supreme contempt  and i assure you continued aspel i had no intention of doing you injury  but no doubt a stout fellow like you didnt let a knockdown blow interfere with his next days work  his next days work repeated mr bones with a chuckle  it would be a queer blow as would interfere with my work  why guvnor i haint got no work at all here he put on a very lugubrious expression praps you wont believe it sir but i do assure you that i havent in them hard times had a full days work for ever so long  and i havent earned a rap this day except the penny i got for postin this here letter  george aspel besides being as we have said a kindhearted man was unusually ignorant of the ways of the world especially the world of london  he believed abel bones at once and spoke in quite a softened friendly tone as he replied  im sorry to hear that and would gladly help you if i could but to tell you the truth mr bones im not in flourishing circumstances myself  still i may perhaps think of some way of helping you  post your letter and ill walk with you while we talk over it  the man ran up the steps posted his letter which had missed the mail though he did not appear to care for thatand returned  although we have spoken of this man as a confirmed drunkard it must not be supposed that he had reached the lowest state of degradation  like george aspel he had descended from a higher level in the social scale of course his language proved that he had never been in the rank of a gentleman but in manners and appearance he was much above the unhappy outcasts amongst whom he dwelt  moreover he had scarcely reached middle life and was or had been a handsome man so that when he chose to dress decently and put on a sanctimonious look which he could do with much facility he seemed quite a respectable personage  now guvnor im at your sarvice he said  this is my way  is it yours  yesany way will do continued aspel  now let me hear about you  i owe you some sort of reparation for that blow  have you dinedwill you eat  well no thank ee all the same but ive no objection to drink  they chanced to be near a publichouse as he spoke  it would be difficult in some thoroughfares of london to stop without chancing to be near a publichouse  they entered and aspel resolving to treat the man handsomely called for brandy and soda  it need scarcely be said that at that hour the brandy and soda was by no means the first of its kind that either of the men had imbibed that day  over it they became extremely confidential and chatty  mr bones was a lively and sensible fellow  it was noticeable too that his language improved and his demeanour became more respectful as the acquaintance progressed  after a time they rose aspel paid for the brandy and soda and they left the place in company  leaving them we shall return to st martinslegrand and follow the footsteps of no less a personage than miss lillycrop for it so happened that that enthusiastic lady having obtained permission to view the interior of the postoffice had fixed on that evening for her visit but we must go back a little in timeto that period when the postal jaws were about to open for the reception of the evening mail  ever since miss lillycrops visit to the abode of solomon flint she had felt an increasing desire to see the inside and the working of that mighty engine of state about which she had heard so much  a permit had been procured for her and her cousin may maylands being off duty at that hour was able to accompany her  they were handed over to the care of a polite and intelligent lettersorter named bright  the sorter seemed fully to appreciate and enter into miss lillycrops spirit of inquiry  he led her and may to the insidethe throat as it wereof those postal jaws the exterior aspect of which we have already described  on the way thither they had to pass through part of the great lettersorting hall  it seemed to miss lillycrops excited imagination as if she had been suddenly plunged over head and ears into a very ocean of letters  from that moment onwards during her two hours visit she swam as it were among snowy billows of literature  this is the receivingboxthe inside of it said mr bright as he led the way through a glass door into a species of closet or compartment about six feet by ten in dimension or thereabouts with a low roof  this way ladies  stand here on one side  they are just going to open it  the visitors saw in front of them a recess divided by a partition in which were two large baskets  a few letters were falling into these as they entered  glancing upwards they saw a long slit through which a number of curious human eyes peeped for a moment and disappeared to be replaced by other eyes  little spurts of letters came intermittently through the slit and fell into the baskets  these when full were seized by two attendants dragged away and replaced by empty ones  suddenly the upper lip of the slit or postal mouth rose  oh may look exclaimed miss lillycrop eagerly  not only the eyes but the heads and shoulders of the moving public now became visible to those inside while the intermittent spurts became gradually a continuous shower of letters  the full significance of the old superscription haste post haste for thy life now began to dawn on miss lillycrop  the hurry mentioned elsewhere in our description of the outside view increased as the minutes of grace flew by and the visitors fairly laughed aloud when they saw the cataract of correspondencethe absolute waterfall with now and then a bag or an entire bandboxful of letters like a loosened boulderthat tumbled into the baskets below  from this letterfall miss lillycrop was led speechless by her cicerone followed by may to whom the scene was not quite new and whose chief enjoyment of it consisted in observing her interested and excitable friends surprise  mr bright led them back to the great sortingroom where the energetic labour of hundreds of men and boysfacing carrying stamping distributing sorting etceterawas going on full swing  everywhere there was rapid work but no hurry busy and varied action but no confusion a hum of mingled voice and footfall but no unnecessary noise  it was a splendid example of the power of orderly and united action  to miss lillycrop it conveyed the idea of hopeless and irretrievable confusion  mounting a staircase mr bright conducted the ladies to a gallery from which they had a birdseye view of the entire hall  it was in truth a series of rooms connected with the great central apartment by archways  through theseextending away in far perspective so that the busy workers in the distance became like miniature mencould be seen rows on rows of facing and sortingtables covered heaped up and almost hidden by the snows of the evening mail  here the chaos of letters books papers etcetera was being reduced to orderthe whole under the superintendence of a watchful gentleman on a raised platform in the centre who took good care that england should not only expect but also be assured that every man and boy did his duty  miss lillycrop glanced at the clock opposite  it was a quarter to seven  do you mean to tell me she said turning full on mr bright and pointing downwards that that ocean of letters will be gone and these tables emptied by eight oclock  indeed i do maam and more than what you see there for the district bags have not all come in yet  by eight oclock these tables will be as bare as the palm of my hand  mr bright extended a large and manly palm by way of emphasising his remark  miss lillycrop was too polite to say thats a lie but she firmly though mutely declined to believe it  dyou observe the tables just below us maam  he pointed to what might have been six large boardroom tables surrounded by boys and men as close as they could stand  as however the tables in question were covered more than a foot deep with letters miss lillycrop only saw their legs  these are the facingtables continued mr bright  all that the men and lads round em have got to do with the letters there is to arrange them for the stampers with their backs and stamps all turned one way we call that facing the letters  they have also to pick out and pitch into baskets as you see all bookpackets parcels and newspapers that may have been posted by mistake in the letterbox  while the sorter went on expounding matters one of the tables had begun to show its wooden surface as its faced letters were being rapidly removed but just then a man with a bag on his shoulder came up sent a fresh cataract of letters on the blank spot and recovered it presently a stream of men with bags on their backs came in  these are the district mails maam explained mr bright during the last halfhour and more they have been hurrying towards us from all quarters of london the nearest being brought by men on foot the more distant bags by vans  some are still on their way all will concentrate here at last in time for sorting  the contents of these bags as they came in were shot out and the facingtablesall of which had begun to show symptoms of the flood going down and dry land appearingwere flooded and reflooded again and again to a greater depth than before  the mail will be late tonight observed miss lillycrop with an assured nod  o no maam it wont replied bright with an easy smile and may laughed as they returned to the hall to inspect the work in detail  here you see we stamp the letters  mr bright stopped in front of a long table at which was standing a row of stampers who passed letters under the stamps with amazing rapidity each man or youth grasped a stamp which was connected with a machine on a sort of universal joint  it was a miniature printingmachine with a little inkingroller which was moved over the types each time by the mere process of stamping so the stamper had only to pass the letters under the die with the one hand and stamp with the other as fast as he could  the rate varied of course considerably  nervous and anxious stampers illustrated more or less the truth of the proverb the more hurry the less speed while quiet steady hands made good progress they stamped on the average from 100 to 150 letters in the minute each man  you see maam remarked mr bright its the way all the world over coolheaded men who know their powers always get on best  the stampingmachine is a great improvement on the old system where you had to strike the inker first and then the letter  it just doubled the action and the time  we have another ingeniously contrived stamp in the office  it might not occur to you that stamping parcels and other articles of irregular shape is rather difficult owing to the stamper not striking flatly on them  to obviate this one of our own men invented a stamp with an indiarubber neck so that no matter how irregular the surface of the article may be the face of the stamp is forced flat upon it by one blow  when stamped continued mr bright moving on the letters are taken by boys as you see to the sorters  you observe that each sorter has a compartment or frame before him with separate divisions in it for the great towns only such as manchester liverpool birmingham brighton etcetera  now you knowhere he stopped and assumed an impressive explanatory toneyou couldnt expect any single man to sort the letters for every town and village in the kingdomcould you maam  miss lillycrop admitted that she could not indulge such an expectation and further expressed her belief that any man who could must be little better than a lunatic  but every man you see here continued mr bright has batch after batch of letters put before him which may contain letters from anywhere to everywhere  so you see we subdivide the work  the sorters you are now looking at sort the letters for the large towns into separate sections and all the rest into divisions representing the various parts of the country such as northern southern etcetera  the letters are then collected by the boys you see going up and down the hall  i dont see them interrupted miss lillycrop  there thats a northern division boy who has just backed against you maam  the boy referred to turned apologised and gathering the letters for the northern division from the sorter at their elbow moved on to gather more from others  the division letters continued bright are then conveyed to other sorters who subdivide them into roads and then the final sorting takes place for the various towns  we have a staff of about a thousand sorters assistant sorters and boysorters in this inland office alone who have been or are being carefully trained for the work some are smart and some of course are slow  they are tested occasionally  when a sorter is tested he is given a pack of five hundred cardsdummiesto represent letters  a good man will sort these in thirteen or fifteen minutes  there are always sure to be a few missorts even in our wellregulated familythat is letters sorted to the wrong sections or divisions  forty missorts in the five hundred is considered very bad work  but what if a sorter does not happen to know the division to which any particular letter belongs asked miss lillycrop  he ought to know replied her guide because all the sorters have to undergo a strict examination once a year as to their knowledge of towns and villages throughout england  indeed but persisted miss lillycrop what does he do with a letter if he chances to forget  why he must get other sorters to help him  and what happens if he finds a letter so badly addressed that he cannot read it  sends it to the blind division we shall come to that presently said mr bright  meanwhile we shall visit the hospital i need scarcely explain to you that the hospital is the place to which wounded letters and packages are taken to be healed  here it is  the party now stood beside a table at which several clerkswe might almost say surgeonswere at work busy with sealingwax and string  the patients were a wondrous lot and told eloquently of human carelessness  here were found letters containing articles that no envelope of mere paper could be expected to holdsuch as bunches of heavy keys articles of jewellery etcetera which had already more than half escaped from their covers  there were also frail cardboard boxes so squeezed and burst that their contents were protruding and parcels containing worsted and articles of wearing apparel which had been so carelessly put up as to have come undone in the mailbags  all these things were being retied refolded patched up here and there with sealingwax or put into new covers by the postal surgeons and done with as much care too as though the damage had been caused by the postoffice rather than by carelessness in the public  but among these invalided articles were a few whose condition accidentally revealed attempts to contravene the postal laws  one letter which had burst completely open revealed a pillbox inside with dinner pills on the outside  on examination the pills turned out to be two sixpences wrapped up in a scrap of paper on which was writtenthought you had no money to get a stamp with so sent you some  it is contrary to regulations to send coin by post without registering the letter  the unfortunate receiver would have to pay eightpence as a registration fee for this shilling  while the party was looking at the hospital work another case was discovered  a bookpacket came open and revealed a letter inside  but still further the letter was found to contain sixpence in silver sent to defray postage when the book should be returned  here was a double sin  no letter or writing of the nature of a letter is allowed to go by book post and coin may not be sent unregistered  in this case the book would be forwarded at letterrate and the 8 pence registration fee would be charged for the cointhe whole amounting to 6 shillings 6 pence  if the public would only attend observed mr bright in commenting on these facts to the regulations laid down for their guidance by the postofficeas detailed in our directories and postal guidessuch errors would seldom occur for i believe that things of this sort are the result of ignorance rather than dishonesty  now maam he continued we come to the blind officers  there were several of those gentlemen whose title we presume was satirically expressive of the extraordinary sharpness of their eyes and intellects  they were seated at a table engaged in examining addresses so illegible so crabbed so incomplete and so ineffably ridiculous that no man of ordinary mental capacity could make head or tail of them all the principal london and provincial directories guides and gazetteers were ranged in front of the blind officers to assist them in their arduous labours and by the aid of these and their own extensive knowledge of men and places they managed to dispose of letters for which a stranger would think it impossible to find owners  what would you make of that address now said mr bright presenting a letter to miss lillycrop for inspection  it looks like copcupnoit begins with a c at all eventswhat think you of it may said the puzzled lady  it seems to me something like captain troller of rittler bunch said may laughing  it is quite illegible  not quite said one of the blind officers with a smile  it is comptroller of the returned letter branch  some one making inquiries no doubt after a lost letter addressed as badly as this one  having looked at a few more of the letters that were then passing under examination mr bright showed them a book in which were copied facsimiles of addresses which had passed through the post  some of these were pictorialembracing quaint devices and caricatures most of them in ink and some in colours all of which had been traced by a gentleman in the office with great skill  one that struck may as being very original was the representation of an artist painting the portrait of the queen  her majesty was depicted as sitting for her portrait and the canvas on the easel before which the artist stood was made the exact size of the postagestamp  while the ladies were examining this book of literary curiosities mr bright took occasion to comment with pardonable pride on the working of the postoffice  you see maam he said we do our best for the publicthough many of em have no idea of it  we dont send letters to the returned letter branch till weve tried as you see to get the correct addresses and until two separate lettercarriers have attempted to deliver them after leaving the lettercarriers hands the address of every undelivered letter and the indorsement it bears are carefully examined by a superior officer who is held responsible for discovering any wrong treatment it may have undergone and for having recourse to any further available means of finding the owner  it is considered better that the sender of a letter should know as soon as possible of its nondelivery than that it should travel about with little prospect of its owner being found  we therefore send it to the returned branch without further delay where it is carefully examined by a superior officer to see that it has actually been presented as addressed and that the reasons assigned for its nondelivery are sufficient  in doubtful cases the directories and other books of reference in the branch are consulted and should it be found that there has been any oversight or neglect the letter is immediately reissued  after all has been done that can be to deliver such letters they are opened and returned the same day to the senders  if valuables are enclosed the address and contents are recorded in case of inquiry  when senders fail to give their addresses sometimes these are discovered by bills of exchange cheques or moneyorders which happen to be enclosed  when addresses of senders can be discovered by information on the outside of covers the letters are returned without passing through the returned letter branch and are not opened  when all efforts have failed and the letters do not contain property they are not preserved  do many letters come into the returned letter offices in this way asked miss lillycrop  ay over the whole kingdom including the letters sent direct to the senders last year there were above four millions eight hundred thousand and of these we managed to return ninetenths to the writers or reissued them to corrected addresses  oh indeed said miss lillycrop utterly bewildered  a large proportion of the letters passing through this office said mr bright consists of circulars  an account of these was once taken and the number was found to be nearly twenty millions a year and of these circulars it was ascertained that  stop pray sir stop exclaimed miss lillycrop pressing her hand to her forehead i am lost in admiration of your amazing memory but ii have no head for figures  indeed what i have already heard and seen in this place has produced such confusion in my poor brain that i cannot perceive any difference whatever between millions billions and trillions  well come we will continue our round said mr bright laughing  now while all this was going on in the hall there was a restive creature inside of a box which did not relish its confinement  this was mr fred blurts snake  that sagacious animal discovered that there was a knot in the side of his pinewood box  now knots are sometimes loose  whether the snake found this out and wrought at the knot intentionally or forced it out accidentally during its struggles we cannot tell but certain it is that it got it out somehow made its escape and glided away into the darkest corner it could find  meanwhile its box was treated after the manner of parcels and put safely into one of the mailbags  as the mass of letters began to diminish in bulk the snake began to feel uncomfortably exposed  at the same time miss lillycrop with that wicked delight in evil prophecy which is peculiar to mankind began to feel comfortably exultant  you see i was right she said to her guide glancing at the clock which now indicated ten minutes to eight the confusion is almost as great as ever  we shall see replied mr bright quietly as he led the way back to the gallery  from this point it could be seen even by unpractised eyes that although the confusion of letters all over the place was still considerable there were huge gaps on the sortingtables everywhere while the facingtables were of course empty  there was a push and energy also which had not prevailed at first  men seemed as though they really were in considerable haste  letters were being bundled up and tied with string and thrust into bags and the bags sealed with a degree of celerity that transfixed miss lillycrop and silenced her  a few minutes more and the tables were cleared  another minute and the bags were being carried out  thirty red vans outside gaped to receive them eight oclock struck whips cracked wheels rattled the eight oclock mail was gone and there was not a single letter left in the great sortingroom of st martinslegrand  i was right you see said mr bright  you were right responded miss lillycrop  they descended and crossed the now unencumbered floor  the snake took it into its mottled head at that moment to do the same  miss lillycrop saw it shrieked sprang to get out of its way fell and sprained her ankle  there was a rush of sorters lettercarriers boysorters and messengers the snake was captured and miss lillycrop was tenderly borne from the general postoffice in a state of mental amazement and physical collapse    chapter fourteen  formation of the pegaway literary association and other matters  close to the residence of solomon flint there was a small outhouse or shed which formed part of the lettercarriers domain but was too small to be sublet as a dwelling and too inconveniently situated in a back court to be used as an apartment  it was therefore devoted to the reception of lumber  but solomon not being a rich man did not possess much lumber  the shed was therefore comparatively empty  when philip maylands came to reside with solomon he was allowed to use this shed as a workroom  phil was by nature a universal geniusa jackofalltradesand formed an exception to that rule about being master of none which is asserted though not proved by the proverb for he became master of more than one trade in the course of his career  solomon owned a few tools so that carpentry was naturally his first attempt and he very soon became proficient in that  then having discovered an old clock among the lumber of the shed he took to examining and cleaning its interior of an evening after his work at the postoffice was done  as his mechanical powers developed his genius for invention expanded and soon he left the beaten tracks of knowledge and wandered into the less trodden regions of fancy  in all this phil had an admirer and sympathiser in his sister may but mays engagements both in and out of the sphere of her telegraphic labours were numerous so that the boy would have had to pursue his labours in solitude if it had not been for his friend peter pax whose admiration for him knew no bounds and who if he could would have followed phil like his shadow  as often as the little fellow could manage to do so he visited his friend in the shed which they named pegaway hall  there he sometimes assisted phil but more frequently held him in conversation and commented in a free and easy way on his workfor his admiration of phil was not sufficient to restrain his innate insolence  one evening phil maylands was seated at his table busy with the works of an old watch  little pax sat on the table swinging his legs  he had brought a pipe with him and would have smoked but phil sternly forbade it  its bad enough for men to fumigate their mouths he said with a smile on his lip and a frown in his eye but when i see a thing like you trying to make yourself look manly by smoking i cant help thinking of a monkey putting on the boots and helmet of a guardsman  the boots and helmet look grand no doubt but that makes the monkey seem all the more ridiculous  your pipe suggests manhood pax but you look much more like a monkey than a man when its in your mouth  how severe you are tonight phil returned pax putting the pipe however in his pocket where did you graduate nowat cambridge or oxford  because wen my eldest boy is big enough id like to send im were hed acquire sitch an amazin flow of eloquence  phil continued to rub the works of the watch but made no reply  i say phil observed the little fellow after a thoughtful pause  well  dont it strike you sometimes that this is a queer sort of world  yes ive often thought that and it has struck me too that you are one of the queerest fish in it  come phil dont be cheeky  im in a sedate frame of mind tonight an want to have a talk in a philosophical sort o way of things in general  well pax go ahead  i happen to have been reading a good deal about things in general of late so perhaps between us we may grind something out of a talk  just so thems my ideas precisely  theres nothin said pax thrusting both hands deeper into his trousers pockets and swinging his legs more vigorouslynothin like a free an easy chat for developin the mental powers  but i say what a fellow you are for goin ahead seems to me that youre always either workin at queer contrivances or readin  you forget pax that i sometimes carry telegraphic messages  ha true then you and i are bound together by the cords of a common dootypraps i should say an uncommon dooty all things considered  among other things returned phil i have found out by reading that there are two kinds of men in the world the men who push and strive and strike out new ideas and the men who jog along easy on the letbeforletbe principle and who grow very much like cabbages  youre right there philan yet cabbages aint bad vegetables in their way remarked pax with a contemplative cast of his eyes to the ceiling  well continued phil gravely i shouldnt like to be a cabbage  wich means said the other that youd rather be one o the fellows who push an strive an strike out noo ideas  phil admitted that such were his thoughts and aspirations  now pax he said laying down the tool with which he had been working and looking earnestly into his little friends face something has been simmering in my mind for a considerable time past  youd better let it out then phil for fear it should bust you suggested pax  come now stop chaffing for a little and listen because i want your help said phil  there was something in phils look and manner when he was in earnest which effectually quelled the levity of his little admirer  the appeal to him for aid also had a sedative effect  as phil went on pax became quite as serious as himself  this power of pax to suddenly discard levity and become interested was indeed one of the qualities which rendered him powerfully attractive to his friend  the fact is continued phil i have set my heart on forming a literary association among the telegraphboys  a what  a literary association  that is an association of those boys among us who want to read and study and discuss and become knowing and wise  the daring aspirations suggested by this proposition were too much for little pax  he remained silentopen mouthed and eyedwhile phil went on quietly to expound his plans  there is a capital library as you know at the postoffice which is free to all of us though many of us make little use of itmores the pityso that we dont require a library of our own though we may come to that too some day who knows  sure it wouldnt be the first time that great things had come out of small beginnings if all i have read be true  but its not only books we would be after  what we want pax is to be organisedmade a body of  when weve got that done we shall soon put soul into the bodywhat with debates an readings an lectures an maybe a soiree now and then with music and speeches to say nothing of tea an cakes  as phil maylands warmed with his subject his friend became excited  he ceased to chaff and raise objections and finally began to see the matter through phils rosecoloured glasses  capital he exclaimed heartily  itll do phil  itll worklike everything else you put your hand to  buthere his chubby little visage elongatedhow about funds  nothin in this world gets along without funds an then weve no place to meet in  we must content ourselves with funds of humour to begin with returned phil resuming his work on the watch  as for a meetingroom wouldnt this do  pegaway hall is not a bad place and quite enough room in it when the lumbers cleared out o the way  then as to members we would only admit those who showed a strong desire to join us  just sowho showed literary tastes like you an me suggested pax  exactly so said phil for you see i dont want to have our society flourished about in the eyes of people as a public postoffice affair we must make it private and very select  yes uncommon select echoed pax  it would never do you know continued the other to let in every shallow young snipe that wanted to have a lark and make game of the affair  we will make our rules very stringent  of course murmured pax with a solemn look tremendously stringent  for first offences of any kinda sousin with dirty water for second offencesa woppin and a fine  for thirddismissal with ears and noses chopped off or such other mutilation as a committee of the house may invent  but phil who dyee think would be suitable men to make members of  well let me see said phil again laying down his tools and looking at the floor with a thoughtful air theres long poker hes a longlegged goodhearted fellowfond o the newspapers  yes put in pax pokerll do for one  hed be a capital member long and thin as a literary cracter ought to be and pliable too  we could make amost anything of him except a firescreen or a tablecloth then theres big jackhes got strong sedate habits  too fond of punning objected phil  a little punishment in the mutilation way would stop that said pax  and theres jim brown rejoined phil  hes a steady enthusiastic fellow and little grigs hes about as impudent as yourself pax strange isnt it that its chiefly little fellows who are impudent  wouldnt it be strange if it were otherwise retorted pax with an injured look  as we cant knock people down with our fists arent we justified in knockin em down with our tongues  then continued phil theres george granger and macnab  ah aint he the boy for argufyin too interrupted pax and hell meet his match in sandy tod  and theres tom blunter  and jim scroggins  an limp letherby  an fat collins  an bobby sprat  oh exclaimed pax with a glowing countenance weve got lots o firstrate men among the messageboys though there are some uncommon bad uns  but well have none except trueblues in our literary association  the society thus planned was soon called into being for philip maylands was one of those determined characters who carry their plans into execution with vigour and despatch  his first move was to seek counsel of mr sterling a city missionarythe same who had directed george aspel to the abode of abel bones on the night of that youths visit to archangel courtwith whom he had become acquainted on one of his visits to miss lillycrop  that good lady was a staunch ally and able assistant of many city missionaries and did much service in the way of bringing them into acquaintance with people who she thought might be helpful to them or get help from them  a mutual liking had sprung up between mr antony sterling and phil on that occasion which had ripened into friendship  youll help us at our first meeting wont you asked phil after they had talked the matter over  yes if you wish it replied mr sterling  but i wont come at the beginning  ill drop in towards the close and wont say much  youd best begin the work by yourselves  ill come to your aid whenever you seem to require it  but have a care how you start phil  whatever the other members may do remember that you as the originator of the association are bound to lay the foundations with the blessing of god  phil did not neglect this allimportant point and having obtained permission from solomon flint to use the shed the society was soon auspiciously commenced with a lively debate in pegaway hall as to the best method of conducting its own affairs  on this occasion philip maylands proved himself to be an able organiser  long poker showed that he had not dabbled in newspapers without fishing up and retaining a vast amount of miscellaneous knowledge  jim brown roused the meeting to a pitch of enthusiasm almost equal to his own  little grigs made stinging remarks all round and chaffed little pax with evident delight  macnab disputed with everybody  sandy tod argued and objected more or less to everything while tom blunter jim scroggins limp letherby fat collins and bobby sprat lent more or less effectual fire to the debate  big jack did not speak much  he preferred as he said to form a large audience but if he might be permitted to offer an opinion would suggest that less talk and more action might facilitate the despatch of business and that they ought to try to emulate the house of commons by allowing a little common sense to mingle with their discussions  as for peter pax he assumed the role of peacemakergeneral  when the debaters seemed to be getting too warm he rose to order and in a calm dignified manner commented on the conduct of the disputants with such ineffable insolence as to draw down their wrath on his devoted headto the great delight of the other members  thus he threw oil on the troubled waters and generally kept the meeting lively  finally the laws of the pegaway literary association were fixed the plan of meetings was arranged and the whole thing fairly started  the society worked well for a time but after the various members had done their best as pax said to keep the pot boiling it was felt and suggested that they should seek a little aid from without  a reading or a lecture was proposed seconded and carried  then came the question who should be asked to read or lecture  macnab proposed that their chairman should endeavour to procure a lecturer and report to next meeting  sandy tod objected and proposed a committee to consider the subject  phil maylands said he had anticipated the demand and had already secured the promise of a lecturerif the members chose to accept him  name name cried several voices  our excellent landlord solomon flint said phil  you all know his admirable powers of memory and his profound knowledge of men and things at least if you dont you ought to from pax and you may be sure hell give us something good  and proverbial added little grigs  ay flint will certainly strike fire out of whatever he tackles said big jack  order from pax  when is he to give it asked one  wont fix the time just yet said phil  whats his subject asked another  cant say not yet decided  with this uncertainty as to time and subject the association was obliged to rest content and thereafter the meeting was dissolved  we are grieved to be obliged to state that the society thus hopefully commenced came to a premature close at an early period of its career owing to circumstances over which its members had no control  some time before that sad event occurred however solomon flint delivered his discourse and as some of the events of that memorable evening had special bearing on the issues of our tale we shall recur to it in a succeeding chapter    chapter fifteen  george aspel receives various visitors at the ornithological shop and is called to vigorous action  as long as a man retains a scrap of selfrespect and struggles from any motive whatever against his evil tendencies his journey to destruction is comparatively slow but when once he gives way to despair assumes that he has tried his best in vain and throws the reins on the neck of his passions his descent into the dark abyss is terribly rapid  for a time george aspel was buoyed up by hope  he hoped that may maylands might yet come to regard him with favour though she studiously avoided giving him ground for such hope  he also continued though faintly to hope that sir james clubley might still think of fulfilling his promises and in pursuance of that hope frequently inquired whether any letters had been left for him at the hotel where he first put up on arriving in london  but when both of these hopes forsook him and he found himself in what he deemed the ridiculous position of shopman to a birdstuffer without an influential friend in the great city or the slightest prospect of improving his condition he gave way to despair  before quite giving way however he made several attempts to obtain work more suited to his tastes and acquirements in which efforts he was heartily seconded by mr enoch blurt but enoch was about as unknown in london as himself so that their united efforts failed  in these circumstances the ambitious youth began to regard himself as a martyr to misfortune and resolved to enjoy himself as he best might with a view to this he spent his evenings in places of amusement with companions whose example and influence helped to drag him down and increase his tendency to drink  this tendency was in part hereditary  his father had been a confirmed drinker  although well aware of this he did not believe in his own fallibility  few young men of his stamp do  other men might give way to it but there was no fear of him  he admitted that he could and sometimes did take a stiff glass of grogbut what then  it did him no harm  he was not a slave to it  he could give it up and do without it if he chosealthough it is to be remarked he had never made the trial and only assumed this power  to be rather screwed now and then was he admitted somewhat discreditable but he wasnt worse than many others and it didnt occur often  thus he reasoned halfjustifying himself in a thoroughly selfish sinful course growling at his bad luck and charging the guilt of his sin which he said he couldnt help on fatein other words on god  it never occurred to george aspel that the true way to get out of his troubles was to commit his way to his maker to accept the position assigned him to do the work of a faithful servant therein to get connected with good society through the medium of churches and young mens christian associations and to spend a few years in establishing a character for trustworthiness capacity vigour and intelligence which would secure his advancement in life  at least if such thoughts did occur to him he refused to entertain them and resolved to fling care to the dogs and defy fortune  of course it soon became apparent to his employer that there was a great change for the worse in the youth whom he not only admired for his frank bearing and strapping appearance but loved as his deliverer from death  delicacy of feeling however prevented mr blurt from alluding to dissipations at which he could only guess  poverty and distress bring about strange companionships  when aspel first arrived in london he would have scouted the idea of his having anything whatever to do with such a man as abel bones but he had not proceeded far in his downward course when that disreputable character became if not a companion at least an acquaintance  this state of things was brought about primarily by the patronage which aspel had extended to the poor worthless fellow whom he had so unceremoniously knocked down  but the poor worthless fellow although born in a lower rank of life was quite equal to him in natural mental power and much superior in cunning and villainy  mr bones had also a bold reckless air and nature which were attractive to this descendant of the seakings  moreover he possessed a power of mingling flattery with humbug in a way that made his victim fall rather easily into his toils  revenge as we have said lay at the bottom of abel bones desire to become better acquainted with aspel but profit soon took the place of revenge  mr bones earned his livelihood chiefly by appropriating what belonged to other people  he was not particular as to what he took or how he took it but on the whole preferred easy work like most people and large profit  being a man of bold ambitious views he had often thought of forgery but a neglected education stood in the way of that being also a man of resource he did not doubt that this like many other difficulties would ere long succumb to his perseverance  while in this frame of mind it occurred to him that he might make a tool of his new acquaintance and wouldbe patron  at the same time he had penetration enough to perceive that his intended tool was a dangerous instrument highlytempered and sharpset with a will of its own not yet quite demoralised and not by any means to be played with  it might be tedious to trace the steps and winding ways by which abel bones led his victim from one piece of impropriety to anotheralways concealing his real character and playing the role of an unfortunate man willing to work but unable to find employmentuntil he almost had him in his toils  its of no use your dancing attendance on me any longer bones said aspel one day as the former appeared at the door of the ornithological shop  i have all the will to help you but i have not the power  my friends have failed me and i can do no more than keep my own soul in my body  you must look to some one else with more influence than i possess  thats a bad job sir returned bones with a downcast look  ive bin down at the docks all day an earned only enough to get a plate of bacon and beans  surely theres somethin wrong when a cove thats willin to work must starve and theres my wife and child starvin too seems to me that a cove is justified in stealin in the circumstances  he cast a sidelong glance at aspel  it was the first time he had ventured to suggest dishonest intentions  if they should be taken ill he could turn it off as a jest if taken well he could proceed  im very sorry for you bones said aspel not noticing the hint very sorry but what can i do  i have not a copper left beyond what i absolutely require  well sir i know that you can do nothing but now that my wife and child are actually starvin i really dont see the sin of helpin myself to a loaf at the nearest bakers and giving him legbail for it  nothing justifies stealing said aspel  dee think not sir said bones  if you saw your wife now supposin you had one at the pint of death with hunger an you saw a loaf lyin as didnt belong to you would you let her die  aspel thought of may maylands  i dont know he replied what i should do  all that i say is that stealing is unjustifiable  the argument was stopped at this point by the entrance of a small telegraph messageboy  bones was startled by his sudden entrance  well goodnight sir well talk that matter over some other time he said quickly pulling his wideawake well over his face as he went out and giving the messageboy a prolonged stare  the boy paid no regard to him but turning to aspel introduced himself as peter pax  what the comradeinarms of my friend phil maylands asked aspel  the same at your service replied the small messenger an if you are the friend he talks to me so much about as goes by the name of george aspel an is descended in a direct line from the old seakings im proud to make your acquaintance  aspel laughed at the consummate selfpossession of the boy and shaking hands with him heartily as a comrade of their common friend phil bade him take a seat which he immediately did on the counter  youre surrounded by pleasant company here observed pax gazing intently at the pelican of the wilderness  well yes but its rather silent company said aspel  did that fellow now continued pax pointing to the owl die of surprise  perhaps he did but i wasnt present at his death returned the other  well now i do like this sort o thing  little pax said this with such genuine feeling and looked round him with such obvious interest that aspel with some surprise asked him why he liked it  why because from my earliest years i always was fond of animals  no matter what sort they wos i liked em allbirds an beasts an fishes flyers and creepers an squeakers and flutterers said the boy clasping both hands over one knee and rocking himself to and fro on the counter while he gazed into the owls face with the air of one whose mind is rambling far away into the remote past  once on a time he continued sadly i dwelt in the country  i was born in the country  im a sort o country gentleman by nature so to speak and would have bin revellin in the country to this day if a perwerse fate hadnt driven me into the towna very perwerse fate indeed  indeed said aspel unable to restrain a laugh at his visitors oldfashioned ways what sort of fate was it  a perwerse one didnt i tell you  yes but wherein consisted its perversity  how did it act you know  ah its perwersity consisted in drivin me into town in a marketcart said pax  you must know that my perwerse fate was a uncle  he was a big brute  i dont mean to speak of im disrespectfully  i merely give im his proper name  he was a marketgardener and kept cowsalso a pump  he had a wife and childa little girl  ah a sweet child it was  indeed said aspel as the boy relapsed into a silent contemplative gaze at the pelican  yes resumed pax with a sigh it was a child that was  her name was mariar but we called er merry  her fathers namethe brutes you knowwas blackadder and a blacker adder dont wriggle its slimy way through filthy slums nowheresupposin him to be yet unscragged for he was uncommon hard on his wifethats my aunt georgie  her name was georgianna  i wonder how it is that people never give people their right names  well mr aspel you must know i was nuss to baby an amytoor nuss i wasgot no pay for it but a considerable allowance o kicks from the brute who wasnt fond o me as id done im a mortal injury somehow by being his defunct brothers orphan child  you understand  george aspel having professed a thorough comprehension of these family relationships little pax went on  well then bein nuss to merry i used to take er out long walks in the fields among the flowers an i was used to catch butterflies and beetles for er an brought em home an stuck pins through em an made clections an oh i did like to scuttle about the green lanes an chase the cows an roll on the grass in the sunshine with merry an tear an bust my trousers for wich i got spanked by the brute but didnt care a rap because that brought me double allowance o coddlin from aunt georgie  one day the brute drove me into town in the marketcart set me down in the middle of a street and drove away an i havent seen him nor aunt georgie nor merry from that day to this  dear me exclaimed george aspel rather shocked at this sudden and unexpected termination of the narrative do you mean to say  it strikes me interrupted pax looking pointedly at the door that youve got another visitor  aspel turned and saw the dishevelled curls and pretty face of tottie bones in the doorway  please sir she said entering i didnt like to interrupt you but miss lillycrop sent me to say that there was a strange smell of singein in the ouse an would mr aspel be so kind as to come and try to find out where it was as she didnt understand such things  smell of singeing child exclaimed aspel rising at once and putting on his coat and hat  did you search for the cause especially about your kitchen fireplace  o yes sir exclaimed tottie an we couldnt see no cause at all only the flue seemed to be otter than usual  we looked all over the ouse too but couldnt see nothinkbut we could feel a most drefful smell  desiring mrs murridge to call mr blurt to attend to the shop george aspel hurried out  dont try to keep up with us said aspel to tottie i must run  it may be fire  oh please sir dont leave me behind pleaded the child  all rightwe wont kitch hold of my hand give the other to mr aspel said peter pax  holding on to her two friends tottie was swept along the streets at a rate which she had never before experiencedat least not as a footpassengerand in a few minutes they were in miss lillycrops dwelling  that excellent lady was in a state of dreadful perturbation as well she might be for the house was filled with a thin smoke of very peculiar odour  few persons except the initiated are fully alive to the immense importance of checking fire at its commencement  the smoke although not dense enough to attract the attention of people outside was sufficiently so to make those inside commence an anxious search when they should have sent at once for the fireengine  three families occupied the tenement  miss lillycrops portion was at the top  a dealer in oils and stores of a miscellaneous and unsavoury kind occupied the basement  george aspel at once suspected and made for this point followed by miss lillycrop who bade tottie remain in her kitchen with the intention of keeping her at once out of danger and out of the way  theres certainly fire somewhere pax run call the engines out said aspel descending three steps at a time  pax took the last six steps at a bound and rushed along the street overturning in his flight two boys bigger than himself and a wheelbarrow  the owner of the cellars was absent and his door locked  where was the key  no one knew but george aspel knew of a key that had done some service in times past  he retreated a few steps and rushing at the door with all his weight and momentum dashed it in with a tremendous crash and went headlong into the cellar from out of which came belching flames and smoke  reissuing instantly therefrom with singed hair and glaring eyes he found miss lillycrop lying on her back in a faint where the fire and smoke had floored her  to gather her up and dash into the street was the work of a moment  scarcely less rapid was the rush of the fire which having been richly fed and long pent up in the cellar now dashed up the staircases like a giant refreshed  meanwhile little pax ran headlong into a policeman and was collared and throttled  now then young un  fire station gasped pax  all right this wayjust round the corner said the man in blue releasing his captive and running along with him but the man in blue was stout middleaged and heavy  pax outran him saw the red lamp found the firestation door open and leaped through with a yell of fire that nearly split his little lungs  the personification of calmness in the form of a fireman rose and demanded where  before pax could gasp the address two other personifications of calmness who had been snoring on trestlebeds dressed and booted when he entered now moved swiftly out axed and helmeted  there was a clattering of hoofs outside  the double doors flew open and the red engine rolled out almost of its own accord  more brass helmets were seen flashing outside  are you sure of the address youngster asked one of the imperturbable firemen settling his chinstrap more comfortably  are you sure o your own grandmother said pax  youre cheeky replied the man with a smile  you make haste retorted pax three minutes allowed to get under weigh  two and a half gone already  twoandsix fine if late besides a  the whip cracked and pax leaping forward seized the side of the engine  six brass helmets bounded into the air and their owners settled on their seats as the horses made that momentary pause and semirear which often precedes a dashing start  the man whom he had been insulting held out a hand pax seized it and was next moment in a terrestrial heaven while calmness personified sauntered into the back office to make a note of the circumstance and resume his pipe  oh it was a brief but maddening ride  to experience such a magnificent rush seemed to pax worth living for  it was not more than halfamile but in that brief space there were three corners to turn like zigzag lightning which they did chiefly on the two near wheels and there were carts vans cabs drays applestalls children dogs and cats innumerable  to have run over or upset these would have been small gratification to the comparatively tender spirit of pax but to shave them to graze the applestalls to just scrape a lamppost with your heart in your mouth to hear the tremendous roar of the firemen to see the abject terror of some people the excitement of others the obedient skedaddling of all while the sparks from the pumpboiler trailed behind and the two bullseyes glared ahead so that the engine resembled some awful monster rushing through thick and thin and waving in triumph its fiery tailah words are but feeble exponents of thought it was excruciating ecstasy  to have been born for this one burst and died would have been better than never to have been born at allin the estimation of the enthusiastic peter pax  a few minutes after george aspel had borne the fainting miss lillycrop from the house the engine arrived  some of the men swarmed into the house and dived to the basement as if fire and smoke were their natural food  others got the engine to work in a few seconds but already the flames had rushed into the lower rooms and passages and licked away the windows  the thick stream of water had just begun to descend on the fire when another engine came rattling to the field and its brazenheaded warriors leaped down to join the battle  oh groaned miss lillycrop at that moment recovering in aspels arms oh  tottietooooties in the kitchen  little pax heard and understood  in one moment he bounded through the blazing doorway and up the smoking stair  just then the fireescape came into view towering up against the black sky  hold her some one cried aspel dropping his poor burden into the ready arms of a policeman  the boys lost he exclaimed leaping after pax  aspel was a practised diver  many a time had he tried his powers under the atlantic waves on the west of ireland  he drew one long breath and was in the attic kitchen before it was expended  here he found little pax and tottie on the floor  the former had fallen suffocated in the act of hauling the latter along by the hair of the head  aspel did not see them  he stumbled over them grasped both in his strong arms and bore them to the staircase  it was by that time a roaring furnace  his power of retaining breath was exhausted  in desperation he turned sharp to the right and dashed in miss lillycrops drawingroom door just as the fireescape performed the same feat on one of the windows  the gush of air drove back the smoke for one moment  gasping and reeling to the window aspel hurled the children into the bag of the escape  he retained sufficient power to plunge in head first after them and ram them down its throat  all three arrived at the bottom in a state of insensibility  in this state they were borne to a neighbouring house and soon restored to consciousness  the firemen battled there during the greater part of that night and finally gained the victory but before this happy consummation was attained poor miss lillycrops home was gutted and her little property reduced to ashes  in these circumstances she and her little maid found a friend in need in miss stivergill and an asylum in rosebud cottage    chapter sixteen  begins with juvenile flirtation and ends with canine cremation  the disreputable nature of the wind which blows good to nobody has been so frequently referred to and commented on by writers in general that it merits only passing notice here  the particular breeze which fanned the flames that consumed the property that belonged to miss lillycrop and drove that lady to a charming retreat in the country thereby rescuing her from a trying existence in town also blew small peter pax in the same direction  boy said miss stivergill in stern tones on the occasion of her first visit to the hospital in which pax was laid up for a short time after his adventure youre a good boy  i like you  the first of your sex i ever said that to  thank you maam  i hope i shant be the last returned pax languidly for he was still weak from the effects of the partial roasting and suffocation he had undergone  miss lillycrop desired me to come and see you resumed miss stivergill  she has told me how bravely you tried to rescue poor little bones who  not much hurt i hope asked the boy eagerly  no very littlescarcely at all im glad to say  those inexplicable creatures called firemen who seem to me what you may call firefiends of a goodnatured and recklessly hilarious type say that her having fallen down with her nose close to the ground where there is usually a free current of air saved her  at all events she is saved and quite well  i hope i didnt haul much of the hair out of her poor head said pax  apparently not if one may judge from the very large quantity that remains replied his visitor  you see maam in neckornothin scrimmages o that sort continued pax in the offhand tone of one much experienced in such scrimmages one cant well stop to pick and choose besides i couldnt see well dee see an her hair came first to hand you know an was convenient its well for both on us however that that six foot odd o magnificence came to the rescue in time  i like im i do an shall owe im a good turn for savin little boneswhat was her other name did you say maam  i didnt mention any other name but i believe it is tottienow little peter when the doctor gives you leave to be moved you are to come to me to recruit your health in the country  thank you maam  youre too good said pax becoming languid again pray give my best respects to tottie and miss lillycrop  so small and so pretty and such a wise little thing murmured miss stivergill unaware apparently that she soliloquised aloud  so big and so ugly and such a goodhearted stoopid old thing murmured pax but it is only just to add that he was too polite to allow the murmur to be heard  goodbye little peter till we meet again said miss stivergill turning away abruptly  farewell maam said pax farewell and if for ever  he stopped because his visitor was gone  according to this arrangement pax found himself not many days after revelling in the enjoyment of what he styled tooralooral felicity among cows and hay sunshine and milk buttercups and cream green meadows and blue skiesfree as a butterfly from telegraphic messagery and other postal cares  he was allowed to ramble about at will and as little bones was supposed to be slightly invalided by her late semisuffocation she was frequently allowed by her indulgent mistress to accompany him  seated on a stile one day pax drew tottie out as to her early life and afterwards gave an account of his own in exchange  how strange said tottie that you and i should both have had bybies to nuss wen we was young aint it  it is totvery remarkable  and weve had a sad fate both of us in havin bin wrenched from our babbies  but the wrench couldnt have bin so bad in your case as in mine of course for your babby was nobody to you whereas mine was a full cousin an such a dear one too  oh tot youve no notion what splendid games we used to have an such clections of things i used to make for er  of course she was too young to understand it you know for she could neither walk nor speak and i dont think could understand though she crowed sometimes as if she did  my how she crowedbut whats the matter tot  tottie was pouting  i dont like your bybie at allnot one bit she said emphatically  not like my babby exclaimed pax  no i dont cause it isnt alf so good as mine  well returned pax with a smile i was took from mine  i didnt forsake it like you  i didnt forsake it cried tottie with flashing eyes and shaking her thick curls indignantlywhich latter by the way since her coming under the stern influence of miss stivergill had been disentangled and hung about her like a golden gloryi left it to go to service and mother takes care of it till i return home  i wont speak to you any more  i hate your bybie and i adore mine  so saying little bones jumped up and ran away  small pax made no attempt to stop her or to follow  he was too much taken aback by the sudden burst of passion to be able for more than a prolonged whistle followed by a still more prolonged stare  thereafter he sauntered away slowly ruminating perhaps on the fickle character of woman even in her undeveloped stages  tottie climbed hastily over a stile and turned into a green lane where she meant to give full vent to her feelings in a satisfactory cry when she was met face to face by mr abel bones  why father she exclaimed running to her sire with a look of joyful surprise for occasional bad treatment had failed to dry up the bottomless well of love in her little heart  hush  tottie theretake my hand an dont kick up such a row  you neednt look so scared at seein me here  im fond o the country you know an ive come out to ave a little walk and a little talk with youwho was that you was talkin with just now  tottie told him  stoppin here i spose  yes  hes bin here for some time but goes away soonnow that hes better  it was him as saved my lifeat least him and mr aspel you know  no i dont know tot  lets hear all about it replied mr bones with a look of unwonted gravity  tottie went off at once into a glowing account of the fire and the rescue to which her father listened with profound attention not unmingled with surprise  then he reverted to the aspect of the surrounding country  its a pretty place you live in here tot an a nice house  its there the lady lives i suppose who has the strange fancy to keep her wealth in a box on the sideboard  well it is curious but theres no accountin for the fancies o the rich tot  an you say she keeps no menservants about her  well thats wise for men are dangerous characters for women to ave about em  shes quite right  theres a dear little dog too she keeps im told  is that the only one she owns  yes its the only one and such a darlin it is and so fond of me exclaimed tottie  ah yes wery small but wery noisy an vicious remarked mr bones with a sudden scowl which fortunately his daughter did not see  o no father little floppart aint vicious though it is awful noisy wen it chooses  well tot id give a good deal to see that dear little floppart and make friends with it  dyou think you could manage to get it to follow you here  oh easily  ill run an fetch it but praps you had better come to the house  i know theyd like to see you for theyre so kind to me  mr bones laughed sarcastically and expressed his belief that they wouldnt like to see him at all  just at that moment miss stivergill came round the turn of the lane and confronted them  well little bones whom have you here asked the lady with a stern look at mr bones  please maam its father  he appened to be in this neighbourhood and came to see me  your father exclaimed miss stivergill with a look of surprise indeed  yes maam said bones politely taking off his hat and looking her coolly in the face  i ope its no offence but i came a bit out o my way to see er  she says youve bin wery kind to her  well she says the truth  i mean to be kind to her returned miss stivergill as sternly as beforetake your father to the cottage child and tell them to give him a glass of beer  if you see miss lillycrop tell her ive gone to the village and wont be back for an hour  so saying miss stivergill walked down the lane with masculine strides leaving tottie pleased and her father smiling  i dont want no beer tot said the latter  but you go to the cottage and fetch me that dear little dog  i want to see it and dont forget the ladys message to miss lillycropbut be sure you dont say im waitin for you  dont mention me to nobody  dee understand  poor tottie with a slight and undefined misgiving at her heart professed to understand and went off  in a few minutes she returned with the little doga lively poodle which at first showed violent and unmistakable objections to being friendly with mr bones  but a scrap of meat which that worthy had brought in his pocket and a few soothing words soon modified the objection  presently mr bones pulled a small muzzle from his pocket  dyou think now that floppart would let you put it on er tot  tot was sure she would and soon had the muzzle on  thats right now hold er fast a momentjust athere  he sprang at and caught the dog by the throat choked a snarling yelp in the bud and held it fast  dear dear how wild it has got all of a sudden  wy it must be ill praps mad  its well you put that muzzle on tot  while he spoke abel bones thrust the dog into one of the capacious pockets of his coat  now tot he said somewhat sternly i durstnt let this dog go  it wants a doctor very bad  you go back to the ouse and tell em a man said so  you neednt say what man call me a philanthropist if you choose an tell em ill send it back wen it recovers  but you neednt tell em anything until youre axed you knowit might get me into trouble dee see an say to miss stivergill it wasnt your father as took the dog but another man  he leaped over a low part of the hedge and was gone leaving poor tottie in a state of bewildered anxiety on the other side  under the influence of fear tottie told the lies her father had bid her tell and thereafter dwelt at rosebud cottage with an evil conscience and a heavy heart  having gained the highroad mr bones sauntered easily to the railway station took a thirdclass ticket for charing cross and in due time found himself passing along the strand  in the course of that journey poor little floppart lay on its back in the bottom of its captors pocket with a finger and thumb gently pressing her windpipe  whenever she became restive the finger and thumb tightened and this with such unvarying regularity that she soon came to understand the advantage of lying still  she did however make sundry attempts to escapeonce very violently when the guard was opening the carriagedoor to let mr bones enter and again almost as violently at charing cross when mr bones got out  indeed the dog had wellnigh got off and was restored to its former place and position with difficulty  turning into chancery lane and crossing over to holborn abel bones continued his way to newgate where appropriately enough he stopped and gazed grimly up at the massive walls  dont be in a urry said a very small boy with dirt and daring in equal proportions on his face itll wait for you  mr bones made a tremendous demonstration of an intention to rush at the boy who precipitately fled and the former passed quietly on  at st martinslegrand he paused again  strange he muttered there seems to be some sort o fate as links me wi that postoffice  it was here i began my london life as a porter and lost my situation because the postmastergeneral couldnt see the propriety of my opening letters that contained coin and postagestamps and fipun notes which was quite unreasonable for i had a special talent that way and even the clargy tell us that our talents was given us to be used  it wasnt far from here where i sot my little nephy down that time i got rid of him and it was goin up these wery steps i met with the man im tryin my best to bring to grief an that same man wants to marry one of the girls in the postoffice and now i find has saved my tot from bein burnt alive  wery odd  it was here too that  floppart at this moment turned the flow of his meditations by making a final and desperate struggle to be free  she shot out of his pocket and dropped with a bursting yell on the pavement  recovering her feet before bones recovered from his surprise she fled  thought is quick as the lightningflash  bones knew that dogs find their way home mysteriously from any distance  he knew himself to be unable to run down floppart  he saw his schemes thwarted  he adopted a mean device shouted mad dog and rushed after it  a small errandboy shrieked with glee flung his basket at it and followed up the chase  floppart took round by st pauls churchyard  however sane she might have been at starting it is certain that she was mad with terror in five minutes she threaded her way among wheels and legs at full speed in perfect safety  it was afterwards estimated that seventeen cabmen four gentlemen two applewomen threeandtwenty errandboysmore or lessand one policeman flung umbrellas sticks baskets and various missiles at her with the effect of damaging innumerable shins and overturning many individuals but without hurting a hair of flopparts body during her wild but brief career  bones did not wish to recapture her  he wished her dead and for that end loudly reiterated the calumny as to madness  floppart circled round the grand cathedral erected by wren and got into cheapside  here doubling like a hare she careered round the statue of peel and went blindly back to st martinslegrand as if to add yet another link to the chain of fate which bound her archpursuer to the general postoffice  by way of completing the chain she turned in at the gate rushed to the rear of the building dashed in at an open door and scurried along a passage  here the crowd was stayed but the policeman followed heroically  the passage was cut short by a glass door but a narrow staircase descended to the left any port in a storm is a proverb as well known among dogs as men down went floppart to the basement of the building invading the sanctity of the lettercarriers kitchen or salleamanger  a dozen stalwart postmen leaped from their meals to rush at the intruder  in the midst of the confusion the policemans truncheon was seen to sway aloft  next instant the vaulted roof rang with a terrible cry which truth compels us to state was flopparts dying yell  none of those who had begun the chase were in at the deathsave the policemannot even abel bones for that worthy did not by any means court publicity  besides he felt pretty sure that his end was gained he remembered no doubt the rule of the office that no letters or other things that have been posted can be returned to the sender and having seen the dog safely posted he went home with a relieved mind  meanwhile the policeman took the remains of poor floppart by the tail holding it at armslength for fear of the deadly poison supposed to be on its lips and left the kitchen by a long passage  the men of the postoffice returned to their food and their duties  those who manage the details of her majestys mails cannot afford to waste time when on duty  the policeman left to himself lost himself in the labyrinth of the basement  he made his way at last into the warm and agreeable room in which are kept the boilers that drive the engine that works the lifts  he was accosted by a stalwart stoker whose appearance and air were as genial as the atmosphere of his apartment  hallo said he what ave you got there  a mad dog answered the policemani say stoker have you any ashpit where i could bury him  couldnt allow im burial in our ashpit replied the stoker with a decided shake of the head altogether out of the question  the policeman looked at the dead dog and at the stoker with a perplexed air  i say look here he said couldnt weahdont you think that we might  he paused and cast a furtive glance at the furnaces  what you dont meancremate im  the policeman nodded  well now i dont know that its actooally against the rules of the gpo replied the stoker with a meditative frown but it seems to me a raither unconstitootional proceedin  its out o the way of our usual line of business but  thats right said the policeman as the stoker who was an obliging man took up a great shovel and flung open the furnacedoor  a terrific glare of intense heat and light shot out appearing as if desirous of licking the stoker and policeman into its dreadful embrace  i dont half like it said the stoker glancing in the postmastergeneral might object you know  not a bit of it hes too much of a gentleman to objectcome said the policeman encouragingly  the stoker held up the shovel  the body of floppart was put thereon after the removal of its collar  there was one good swing of the shovel followed by a heave and the little dog fell into the heart of the fiery furnace  the stoker shut the great iron door with a clang and looked at the policeman solemnly  the policeman returned the look thanked him and retired  in less probably than three minutes flopparts body was reduced to its gaseous elements vomited forth from the furnace chimney and finally dissipated by the winds of heaven  thus did this the first recorded and authentic case of cremation in the united kingdom emanateas many a new advantageous and national measure has emanated beforefrom the prolific womb of the general postoffice    chapter seventeen  tottie and mrs bones in difficulty  the descent of george aspel became very rapid in course of time  as he lost selfrespect he became reckless and as a natural consequence more dissipated  remonstrances from his friend mr blurt which were repelled at first with haughty disdain came to be received with sullen indifference  he had nothing to say for himself in reply because in point of fact there was nothing in his case to justify his taking so gloomy and despairing a view of life  many men he knew were at his age out of employment and many more had been crossed in love  he was too proud to condescend to false reasoning with his lips though he encouraged it in his heart  he knew quite well that drink and bad companionship were ruining him and offhand openhearted fellow though he was said to be he was mean enough as we have already said to growlingly charge his condition and his sins on fate  at last he resolved to give up the business that was so distasteful to him  unable to give a satisfactory reason for so doing or to say what he meant to attempt next and unwilling or ashamed to incur the remonstrances and rebut the arguments of his patron the bold descendant of the seakings adopted that cowardly method of departure called taking french leave  like some little schoolboy he ran away  in other words he disappeared and left no trace behind him  deep was mr enoch blurts regret for he loved the youth sincerely and made many fruitless efforts to find himfor lost in london means lost indeed  he even employed a detective but the grave man in greywho looked like no class of man in particular and seemed to have no particular business in hand and who talked with mr blurt at their first meeting in a quiet sensible easy way as though he had been one of his oldest friendscould find no clue to him for the good reason that mr bones had taken special care to entice aspel into a distant locality under pretence of putting him in the way of finding seminautical employment about the docks  moreover he managed to make aspel drunk and arranged with boon companions to strip him while in that condition of his garments and reclothe him in the seedy garb peculiar to those gentlemen who live by their wits  very strange muttered aspel on recovering sufficiently to be led by his friend towards archangel courtvery strange that i did not feel the scoundrels robbing me  i must have slept very soundly  yes you slep wery sound and theyre a bad lot and uncommon sharp in that neighbourhood  its quite celebrated  i tried to get you away but you was as obstinate as a mule an kep on singing about some sort o coves o the old times that must have bin bigger blackguards than we ave about us nowadays though the song calls em glorious  well well said aspel shrinking under the public gaze as he passed through the streets dont talk about that  couldnt you get into some bylanes where there are not so many people  i dont like to be seen even by strangers in this disreputable guise  i wish the sun didnt shine so brightly  come push on man  wy sir said bones becoming a little more respectful in spite of himself youve no need to be ashamed of your appearance  theres not alf a dozen people in a mile walk in london as would look twice at you whatever appearance you cutso long as it was only disreputable  never mindpush on said aspel sternly i am ashamed whether i have need to be or not  im a fool  im moreim a brute  i tell you what it is bones im determined to turn over a new leaf  ill write to mr blurt and tell him where i am for of course i cant return to him in such clothes as these andandill give up drink  bones met this remark with an unexpected and bitter laugh  what dyou mean demanded aspel turning fiercely upon him  i mean replied bones returning his stare with the utmost coolness that you cant give up drink if you was to try ever so much  youre too far gone in it  ive tried it myself many a time and failed though ive about as strong a will as your ownmaybe stronger  we shall see returned aspel as they moved on again and turned into the lane which led to the wretched abode of bones  bring me pen ink and paper he exclaimed on entering the room with a grand airfor a pint of ale recently taken had begun to operate  bones falling in with his friends humour rummaged about until he found the stump of a quill a penny inkbottle and a dirty sheet of paper  these he placed on a rickety table and aspel wrote a scrawly note in which he gave himself very bad names and begged mr blurt to come and see him as he had got into a scrape and could by no means see his way out of it  having folded the note very badly he rose with the intention of going out to post it but his friend offered to post it for him  accepting the offer he handed him the note and flung himself down in a heap on the straw mattress in the dark corner where he had first become acquainted with bones  in a few seconds he was in a deep lethargic slumber  what a wretched spectacle exclaimed bones touching him with his toe and in bitter mockery quoting the words that aspel had once used regarding himself  he turned to leave the room and was met by mrs bones  theres a friend o yours in the corner molly  dont disturb him im goin to post a letter for him and will be back directly  bones went out posted the letter in the common sewer and returned home  during the brief interval of his absence tottie had come inon a visit after her prolonged sojourn in the country  she was strangling her mother with a kiss when he entered  oh mother  im so happy and so sorry she exclaimed laughing and sobbing at once  tottie was obviously torn by conflicting emotions  take your time darling said mrs bones smoothing the childs hair with her red toilworn hand  ay take it easy tot said her father with a meaning glance that sent a chill to the childs heart while he sat down on a stool and began to fill his pipe  whats it all about  oh its the beautiful country ive been in  mother you cant think the green fields and the trees and oh the flowers and no bricks almost no housesandbut did you knowher grief recurred herethat mr aspel as bin lost an ive been tellin such lies  we came in to town miss lillycrop an me and weve heard about mr aspel from old mr blurt whos tryin to find him out with vertisements in the papers an detectives an a messageboy they call phil whos a friend of mr aspel an also of peter  whos peter asked mrs bones  ah whos peter echoed mr bones with a somewhat sly glance under his brows  hes a messageboy and such a dear fellow replied tottie  i dont know his other name he didnt mention it and they only call him little peter but he saved me from the fire at least he tried  saved you from the fire exclaimed mrs bones in amazement  yes didnt miss lillycrop tell you asked tottie in no less surprise  now it is but justice to miss lillycrop to say that even in the midst of her perturbation after the fire she sought to inform mrs bones of her childs safety and sent her a note which failed to reach her owing to her being away at the time on one of her prolonged absences from home and the neighbour to whose care it had been committed had forgotten all about it  as mrs bones read no newspapers and took no interest in fires she knew nothing about the one that had so nearly swallowed up tottie  come tell us all about it tot  you mentioned it to me but we couldnt go into details at the time said her father puffing a vigorous cloud of smoke into the chimney  nothing loath the child gave her parents an account of the event which was as glowing as the fire itself  as she dwelt with peculiar delight on the brave rescue effected by aspel at the extreme peril of his life conscience took abel bones by surprise and gave him a twinge  at that moment the sleeper in the corner heaved a deep sigh and turned round towards the light  mrs bones and the child recognised him at once and half rose  keep still said bones in a low savage growl which was but too familiar to his poor wife and child  now look here he continued in the same voice laying down his pipeif either of you two tell man woman or child were george aspel is itll be the death of you both and of him too  oh abel dont be hard on us pleaded his wife  you wouldno you cant mean to do im harm  no i wont hurt him said bones but you must both give me your word that youll make no mention of him or his whereabouts to any one till i give you leave  they were obliged to promise and bones knowing from experience that he could trust them was satisfied  but youll make a promise to me too abel wont you dear said mrs bones youll promise not to do im harm of any kindnot to tempt im  yes molly i promise that  mrs bones knew by some peculiarity in the tone of her husbands voice that he meant what he said and was also satisfied  now molly said bones with a smile i want you to write a letter for me so get another sheet of paper if you can mr aspel used up my last one  a sheet was procured from a neighbouring tobacconist  mrs bones always acted as her husbands amanuensis although he wrote very much better than she did either because he was lazy or because he entertained some fear of his handwriting being recognised by his enemies the police squaring her elbows and with her head very much on one sidealmost reposing on the left armmrs bones produced a series of hieroglyphics which might have been made by a fly halfdrowned in ink attempting to recover itself on the paper  the letter ran as follows  deer bil i am agoin to doo it on mundy the 15th tother cove wont wurk besides iv chaningd my mind about him  dont fale  whats the address abel asked mrs bones  willum stiggs replied her husband  soigs said mrs bones writing very slowly rosebud cottage  what exclaimed the man fiercely as he started up  oh i declare said mrs bones with a laugh if that place that totties been tellin us of aint runnin in my ead  but ive not writ it abel i only said it  well then dont say it again growled bones with a suspicious glance at his wife write number 6 little alley birmingham  sonumr sx littlaly bringinghum said mrs bones completing her task with a sigh  when bones went out to post this curious epistle his wife took tottie on her knee and embracing her rocked to and fro uttering a moaning sound  the child expressed anxiety and tried to comfort her  come whats the use o strivin against it she exclaimed suddenly shes sure to come to know it in the end and i need advice from some oneif it was even from a child  tottie listened with suspense and some anxiety  youve often told me mother that the best advice comes from god  so has miss lillycrop  mrs bones clasped the child still closer and uttered a short fervent cry for help  tottie she said listenyoure old enough to understand i think your father is a bad manat least i wont say hes altogether bad butbut hes not good  tottie quite understood that but said that she was fond of him notwithstanding  fond of im child cried mrs bones thats the difficulty  im so fond of im that i want to save him but i dont know how  hereupon the poor woman explained her difficulties  she had heard her husband murmuring in his sleep something about committing a burglary and the words rosebud cottage had more than once escaped his lips  now tottie dear said mrs bones firmly when i heard you tell all about that rosebud cottage an the treasure miss stiffinthegills  stivergill mother  well stivergill  it aint a pretty name whichever way you put it when i heard of the treasure shes so foolish as to keep on her sideboard i felt sure that your father had made up his mind to rob miss stivergillwith the help of that bad man bill stiggsall the more wen i see how your father jumped wen i mentioned rosebud cottage  now tottie we must save your father  if he had only got me to post his letter i could easily have damaged the address so as no one could read it  as it is ive writ it so bad that i dont believe theres a man in the postoffice could make it out  this is the first time tottie that your father has made up his mind to break into a ouse but when he do make up his mind to a thing hes sure to go through with it  he must be stopped tottie somehowmust be stoppedbut i dont see how  tottie who was greatly impressed with the anxious determination of her mother and therefore with the heinous nature of her fathers intended sin gave her entire mind to this subject and after talking it over and looking at it in all lights came to the conclusion that she could not see her way out of the difficulty at all  while the two sat gazing on the ground with dejected countenances a gleam of light seemed to shoot from totties eyes  oh  ive got it she cried looking brightly up  peter  what the boy you met at rosebud cottage asked mrs bones  yes  hes such a nice boy and youve no idea mother what a inventor he is  he could invent anythink i do believeif he tried and im sure hell think of some way to help us  mrs bones was not nearly so hopeful as her daughter in regard to peter but as she could think of nothing herself it was agreed that tottie should go at once to the postoffice and inquire after peter  she did so and returned crestfallen with the news that peter was away on a holiday until the following monday  why thats the 15th said mrs bones anxiously  you must see him that day tottie dear though i fear it will be too late  how did you find him out  there must be many peters among the telegraphboys  to be sure there are but there are not many peters who have helped to save a little girl from a fire you know said tottie with a knowing look  they knew who i wanted at once and his other name is such a funny one it is pax  what exclaimed mrs bones with a sudden look of surprise  pax mother peter pax  whatever mrs bones might have replied to this was checked by the entrance of her husband  she cautioned tottie in earnest hurried tones to say nothing about rosebud cottage unless asked and especially to make no mention whatever of the name of pax    chapter eighteen  business interfered with in a remarkable manner  the modest estimate which mrs bones had formed of her penmanship turned out to be erroneous and her opinion that there was not a man in the postoffice able to read it was illfounded  she was evidently ignorant of the powers and intelligence of the blind division  to make this more plain we will follow the letter  you and i reader will post ourselves as it were and pass through the general postoffice unstamped  at a few minutes to six pm the mouth is wide enough to admit us bodily  mr bones has just put in his epistle and walked away with the air of a man who feels that he has committed himself and is in for it  he might have posted it at an office or a pillar nearer home but he has an idea founded no doubt on experience that people especially policemen are apt to watch his movements and prefers a longish walk to the general  there we take a header and descend with the cataract into the basket on emerging in the great sortingroom somehow we catch sight of the bones epistle at once  there is no mistaking it  we should know its dirty appearance and awry foldingnot to mention bad writingamong ten thousand  having been turned with its stamp in the right direction at the facingtables and passed under the stampingmachines without notice it comes at last to one of the sorters and effectually though briefly stops him  his rapid distributive hand comes to a dead pause  he looks hard at the letter frowns turns it upside down turns his head a little on one side can make nothing of it puts it on one side and continues his work  but at the blind division to which it is speedily conveyed our letter proves a mere trifle  it is nothing to the hieroglyphics which sometimes come under the observation of the blind officers  one of these officers gazes at it shrewdly for a few seconds  william stiggs i think he says appealing to a comrade  yes replies the comrade number six little ladynoalyoh little alley bringbringingah birmingham  just sothe thing is made out almost as quickly as though it had been written in copperplate and the letter redirected in red ink finds its way into the birmingham mailbag  so far so good but there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip and other elements were more successful than bad writing in preventing mr william stiggs from receiving that letter  when the mailbag containing it was put into the travelling postoffice van mr bright passed in after it  our energetic sorter was in charge of the van that night and went to work at once  the letters to be dropped at the early stages of the journey had to be commenced even before the starting of the train  the letter did not turn up at first the officials of whom there were six in the van had littered their sortingtable and arranged many of the letters and the limited mail was flying north at full speed before the bones epistle found its appropriate pigeonholefor it must be understood that the vans of the travelling postofficethe tpo as it is familiarly called by its friendsare fitted up on one side with a long narrow table above which are numerous pigeonholes arranged somewhat like those of the sortingtables in the nontravelling postoffices  there is a suggestive difference however in the former  their edges are padded to prevent the sorters knuckles and noses from being damaged in the event of violent jolting  the sides and ends of the vans are padded all round to minimise their injuries in the event of an accident  beyond this padding however there are no luxuriesno couches or chairs only a few things like bicycle saddles attached to the tables astride which the sorters sit in front of their respective pigeonholes  on the other side of the van are the pegs on which to hang the mailbags a lamp and wax for sealing the same and the apparatus for lowering and lifting the net which catches the bags  everything connected with railways must needs be uncommonly strong as the weight of materials coupled with high speed subjects all the parts of a carriage to extremely violent shocks  hence the bagcatching affair is a powerful iron frame with rope netting the moving of which although aided by a pulley and heavy weight tries the strength of a strong man  nimbly worked the sorters as they swept by town and field village tunnel bridge and meadowfor time may not be wasted when space between towns is being diminished at the rate of forty or fifty miles an hour and chaos has to be reduced to order  the registeredletter clerk sat in one corner in front of a set of special pigeonholes with a sliding cover which could be pulled over all like a blind and locked if the clerk should have occasion to quit his post for a moment  while some were sorting others were bagging and sealing the letters presently the junior sorter whose special duty it is to manipulate the net became aware that a bagexchanging station drew near  his eyes might have assured him of this but officers of the travelling postoffice become so expert with their ears as to know stations by the peculiarity of the respective sounds connected with themcaused it might be by the noise of tunnels cuttings bridges or even slighter influences  going quietly to the apparatus above referred to the junior sorter looked out at the window and lowered the net which instead of lying flat against the van now projected upwards of three feet from it  as he did so something flashed about his feet  he leaped aside and gave a shout  fearful live creatures were sometimes sent by post he knew and serpents had been known before that to take an airing in postoffice vans as well as in the great sortingroom of st martinslegrand  a snake had only a short time before been observed at large on the floor of one of the night mail sorting carriages on the london and northwestern railway which after a good deal of confusion and interruption to the work was killed  this flashed into his mind but the moment was critical and the junior sorter had no time to indulge in private little weaknesses  duty required prompt action  about a hundred yards from the approaching station a mailbag hung suspended from a massive wooden frame  the bag weighed nearly eighty pounds  it was fitted so exactly in its place with reference to the approaching train that its neck was caught to a nicety in a fork which swept it with extreme violence off its hook and laid it in the net this process reversed had been at the same moment performed on the bag given out by the train  to prevent the receiving and delivering apparatus from causing mutual destruction in passing each other the former is affixed to the upper the latter to the lower part of the van  there was a rather severe jerk  the junior sorter exerted his powers raised the net and hauled in the bag while the train with undiminished speed went thundering on  what was that i saw on the floor asked the junior sorter looking anxiously round as he set the mailbags down  only two white mice replied bright who was busy in front of his pigeonholes  they nibbled themselves out of a parcel under my very nose  i made a grab at em but they were too quick for me  isnt it strange observed the registeredletter clerk sealing one of the bags which had just been made up that people will break the law by sending live animals through the post  more strange it seems to me returned bright as he tied up a bundle of letters that the people who do it cant pack em properly  theres the next station said the junior sorter proceeding once more to the net  whew shrieked the steamwhistle as the train went crashing towards the station  bright looked out  the frame and its mailbags were all right and ready  the net was lowered  another moment and the mailbags were swept into the van while the outgoing bags were swept off the projecting arm into the fixed net of the station  the train went through the station with a shriek and a roar  there was a bridge just beyond  the junior sorter forgot to haul up the net which caught some object close to the bridgeno one knew what or how  no one ever does on such occasions  the result was that the whole apparatus was demolished the side of the van was torn out and mr bright and the junior sorter who were leaning against it at the time were sent in a shower of woodwork burst bags and letters into the air  the rest of the van did not leave the rails and the train shot out of sight in a few seconds like a giant warrocket leaving wreck and ruin behind  there are many miraculous escapes in this world  mr bright and the junior sorter illustrated this truth by rising unhurt from the debris of their recent labours and began sadly to collect the scattered mails these however were not like their guardians undamaged  there were several fatal cases and among these was the bones epistle  that important document had been caught by a mass of timber and buried beyond recovery in the ballast of the line  but why pursue this painful subject further  it is sufficient to say that although the scattered mails were carefully collected resorted and finally as far as possible delivered the letter with which we have specially to do never reached its destination  indeed it never more saw the light of day but remained in the hole where it had been buried and thus it came to pass that mr william stiggs failed to make his appearance on the appointed night of the 15th and abel bones was constrained to venture on his deed of darkness alone  on the appointed night however tottie did not fail to do her best to frustrate her fathers plans  after a solemn and last consultation with her mother she left her home with fluttering heart and dry tongue and made for the general postoffice    chapter nineteen  deeplaid plans for checkmating mr bones  now it chanced that the postoffice messageboys literary association had fixed to hold its first grand soiree on the night of the 15th  it was a great occasion  of course it was held in pegaway hall the shed in rear of solomon flints dwelling  there were long planks on trestles for tables and school forms to match  there were slabs of indigestible cake buns in abundance and tea with milk and sugar mixed in illimitable quantities  there were paper flowers and illuminated texts and proverbs round the walls the whole being lighted up by two magnificent paraffin lamps which also served to perfume the hall agreeably to such of the members and guests as happened to be fond of bad smells  on this particular evening invitations had been issued to several friends of the members of the association among whom were mr enoch blurt and mr sterling the missionary  no ladies were invited  a spirited discussion had taken place on this point some nights before the soiree on which occasion the bashful poker opposed the motion that invitations should be issued to ladies on the ground that being himself of a susceptible nature the presence of the fair sex would tend to distract his attention from the business on hand  big jack also opposed it as he thought it wasnt fair to the fair sex to invite them to a meeting of boys but big jack was immediately called to order and reminded that the society was composed of young men and that it was unmanlynot to say unmannerlyto make puns on the ladies  to this sentiment little grigs shouted hear hear in deafening tones and begged leave to support the motion  this he did in an eloquent but much interrupted speech which was finally cut short by macnab insisting that the time of the society should not be taken up with an irrelevant commentary on ladies by little grigs whereupon sandy tod objected to interruptions in generalexcept when made by himselfand was going on to enlarge on the inestimable blessing of free discussion when he was in turn called to order  then blunter and scroggins and fat collins and bobby sprat started simultaneously to their feet but were put down by peter pax who rose and with a calm dignified wave of his hand remarked that as the question before the meeting was whether ladies should or should not be invited to the soiree the simplest plan would be to put it to the vote  on this being done it was found that the meeting was equally divided whereupon the chairmanphil maylandsgave his casting vote in favour of the amendment and thus the ladies were excluded from the soiree amid mingled groans and cheers  but although the fair sex were debarred from joining in the festivities they were represented on the eventful evening in question by a mrs square an angular washerwoman with only one eye but that was a piercingly black one who dwelt in the same court and who consented to act the double part of teamaker and doorkeeper for that occasion  as most of the decorations and wreaths had been made and hung up by may maylands and two of her telegraphic friends there was a pervading influence of woman about pegaway hall in spite of phils ungallant and unirish vote  when tottie bones arrived at the general postoffice in search of peter pax she was directed to pegaway hall by those members of the staff whose duties prevented their attendance at the commencement of the soiree  finding the hall with difficulty she was met and stopped by the uncompromising and oneeyed stare of mrs square  please maam is mr peter pax here asked tottie  yes he is but hes engaged  tottie could not doubt the truth of this for through the halfopen door of the hall she saw and heard the little secretary on his little legs addressing the house  please may i wait till hes done asked tottie  you may if you keep quiet but i doubt if hell ave time to see you even wen he is done said the oneeyed one fiercelydyou like buns or cake best  tottie was much surprised by the question but stated at once her decided preference for cake  look here said mrs square removing a towel from a large basket  tottie looked and saw that the basket was threequarters full of buns and cakes  that said the washerwoman is their leavins  one on em called it the debree of the feast though what that means is best known to hisself  for one hour by the clock these literairies went at it tooth an nail but they failed to get through with all that was purwided though they stuffed themselves to their muzzlesthere elp yourself  tottie selected a moderate slab of the indigestible cake and sat down on a stool to eat it with as much patience as she could muster in the circumstances  peter paxs remarks whatever else they might have been considered possessed the virtue of brevity  he soon sat down amid much applause and mr sterling rose to speak  at this point tottie who had cast many anxious glances at a small clock which hung in the outer porch or vestibule of the hall entreated mrs square to tell pax that he was wanted very much indeed  i durstnt said mrs square its as much as my sitooations worth i was told by mr maylands the chairman to allow of no interruptions nor anythink of the kind  but please maam pleaded tottie with such an earnest face that the woman was touched its a matter ofoflife an deathat least it may be so  oh doooo tell im hes wantedby tottie bones  only say tottie bones thatll be sure to bring im out  welli never exclaimed mrs square sticking her fists in her waist and leaning her head to one side in critical scrutiny of her small petitioner  you do seem cocksure o your powers  hm praps youre not far out neither  well ill try it on though it may cost me a deal of abuse  you sit there an see that cats dont get at the wittles for the cats in this court are a sharper set than ornar  mrs square entered the hall and begged one of the members near the door to pass up a messageas quietly as possibleto the effect that mr pax was wanted  this was immediately done by the member shouting irreverently that the secretarys mother ad come to take im ome  order order  put im out from several of the members  anyow es wanted by some one on very partikler business growled the irreverent member and the secretary made his way to the door  wy tottie exclaimed pax taking both the childs hands patronisingly in his what brings you here  with a furtive glance at mrs square tottie said oh please i want to speak about something very partikler  indeed come out to the court then said little pax leading the way youll be able to air the subject better there whatever it is and the cats wont object  sorry i cant take you into the hall little un but ladies aint admitted  when the child with eager haste stated the object of her visit and wound up her discourse with the earnest remark that her father must be stopped and mustnt be took her small counsellor looked as perplexed and anxious as herself  wrinkling up his smooth brow he expressed the belief that it was a difficult world to deal with and he had had some trouble already in finding out how to manage it  you see tot he said this is a great evenin with the literary messageboys  not that i care a rap for that but ive unfortunately got to move a vote of thanks to our lecturer tonight and say somethin about the lecture which i couldnt do you know unless i remained to hear it  to be sure i might get some one else to take my place but im not easily spared for half the fun o the evenin would be lost if they hadnt got me to make game of and air their chaff upon  still as you say your dad must have his little game stopped  he must be a great blackgi beg pardon tot i mean that he must be a great disregarder of the rights of manwoman as it happens in this case  however as you said with equal truth he must not be took for if he was hed probably be hanged and i couldnt bear to think of your father bein scragged  let me see  when did you say he meant to start  he said to mother that hed leave at nine and might ave to be out all night  at nineeh  that would just give im time to get to charing cross to catch the 930 train  solomon flints lecture will be over about eight i could polish im off in ten minutes or so and ave plenty of time to catch the same train  yes that will do  but how am i to know your father tot for you know i havent yet had the pleasure of makin his acquaintance  oh you cant mistake him replied the child confidently  hes a big tall andsome man with a ook nose an a great cut on the bridge of it all down is left cheek  youll be sure to know im  but how will you stop im  that is more than i can tell at present my dear replied pax with a careworn look but ill hatch a plot of some sort durin the lecture let me see he added with sudden animation glancing at the limited portion of sky that roofed the court i might howl im down  thats not a bad idea  yellin is a powerful influence wen brought properly to bear  dyou mind waitin in the porch till the lectures over  o no  i can wait as long as ever you please if youll only try to save father was totties piteous response  well then go into the porch and sit by the door so that you can hear and see whats goin on  dont be afraid of the oneeyed fair one who guards the portals  shes not as bad as she looks only take care that you dont tread on her toes she cant stand that  tottie promised to be careful in this respect and expressed a belief that she was too light to hurt mrs square even if she did tread on her toes accidentally  youre wrong tottie returned pax most females of your tender years are apt to jump at wrong conclusions  as you live longer youll find out that some peoples toes are so sensitive that they cant bear a feathers weight on em  wy theres a member of our society who riles up directly if you even look at his toes  we keep that members feet in hot water pretty continuously we dothere now ill be too late if i keep on talkin like this  youll not feel tired of the lecture for solomons sure to be interesting whatever his subject may be  i dont know what it ishe hasnt told us yet  youll soon hear it if you listen  pax reentered the hall and tottie sat down by the door beside mrs square just as solomon flint rose to his legs amid thunders of applause    chapter twenty  the post of the olden time  when the applause had subsided solomon flint caused a slight feeling of depression in the meeting by stating that the subject which he meant to bring before them that evening was a historical view of the postoffice most of those present felt that they had had more than enough of the postoffice thrust on their attention every day of their lives and the irreverent member ventured to call out shop but he was instantly and indignantly called to order  when however solomon went on to state his firm belief that a particular branch of the postoffice began in the immediate neighbourhood of the garden of eden and that adam was the first postmastergeneral the depression gave way to interest not unmingled with curiosity  you see my young friends continued the lecturer our information with regard to the origin of the postoffice is slight  the same may be said as to the origin of amost everythink  taking the little information that we do possess and applying to it the reasoning power which was given to us for the purpose of investigatin an discoverin truth i come to the following conclusions  adam was a tiller of the ground  there can be no doubt about that judging from analogy we have the best ground for supposing that while adam was digging in the fields eve was at home preparing the dinner and otherwise attending to the domestic arrangements of the house or hut or hovel or cave  dinner being ready eve would naturally send little cain or abel to fetch their father and thus you see the branch of boymessengers began  applause mingled with laughter and cheers  of course continued solomon it may be objectedfor some people can always objecthear hearthat these were not postoffice messengers but my young friends it is well known that the greater includes the less  as mankind is involved in adam and the oak is embedded in the acorn so it may be maintained that the first faint germ of the boymessenger branch of the postoffice was included in cain and abel  passing however from what i may style this postoffice germ over many centuries during which the records of postal history are few and faint and far between we come down to more modern timessay five or six hundred years agoand what do we find  here solomon became solemn we find next to nothink  absolutely next to nothink  the boymessenger department had indeed developed amazingly insomuch that whereas there were only two to begin with there were in the 15th century no fewer than innumerable millions of em in every region and land and clime to which the uman family had penetrated but no section of them had as yet prefixed the word telegraph to their name and as to postal arrangements wy they were simply disgraceful  just think now up to the century of which i speakthe fifteenththere was no regular postoffice in this country  letters were conveyed by common carriers at the rate probably of three or four miles an hour  flesh and blood couldnt stand that you know so about the close of the century places or posts were established in some parts of the country where horses could be hired by travellers and letters might be conveyed  the postboys of those days evidently required spurring as well as their horses for letters of the period have been preserved with the words haste post haste on their backs  sometimes the writers seem to have been in a particularly desperate hurry  one letter written by a great man of the period had on the back of it the words in haste post haste for thy life for thy life for thy life and it is believed that this was no idle caution but a threat which was apt to be carried out if the postboy loitered on the way  it may be remarked that solomons language became more refined as he proceeded but lapsed into a freeandeasy style whenever he became jocular  the first horseposts continued the lecturer were established for military purposesthe convenience of the public being deemed quite a secondary matter  continental nations were in advance of england in postal arrangements and in the first quarter of the sixteenth century 1514 the foreign merchants residing in london were so greatly inconvenienced by the want of regular letter conveyance that they set up a postoffice of their own from london to its outports and appointed their own postmaster but quarrelling among themselves they referred their dispute to government  james the first established a postoffice for letters to foreign countries for the benefit of english merchants but it was not till the year 1635in the reign of charles the first that a postoffice for inland letters was established  it was ordained that the postmaster of england for foreign parts should settle a running post or two to run night and day between edinburgh and london to go thither and come back again in six days and to take with them all such letters as shall be directed to any posttown in or near that road  in 1640 the postoffice was placed under the care and superintendence of the principal secretary of state and became one of the settled institutions of the country  here then we have what may be considered the birth of the postoffice which is now pretty nigh two centuries and a half old  and what a wonderful difference there is between this infant postoffice and the man  then six days now less than a dozen hours between the capitals of england and scotlandto say nothing of other things  but my lads we must not turn up our noses at the day of small things  hear hear cried little grigs who approved the sentiment  lay it to heart then grigs said peter pax who referred to the fact that little grigss nose was turned up so powerfully by nature that it could not help turning up at things small and great alike  laughter and great applause were mingled with cries of order which solomon subdued by holding up his hand  at the same time continued the lecturer byeposts were set agoing to connect the main line with large towns such as hull lincoln chester etcetera  these byeposts were farmed out to private individuals and the rates fixed at 2 pence a single letter to any place under 80 miles 4 pence up to 140 miles 6 pence to any more distant place in england and 8 pence to scotland  from that date forward the infant began to growsometimes slowly sometimes quickly now and then by spurtsjust like other infants and a horribly spoiled and mismanaged baby it was at first  those who see it nowin the prime of its manhood wielding its giant strength with such ease accomplishing all but miraculous work with so great speed regularity and certainty and with so little fusscan hardly believe what a crossgrained little stupid thing it was in those early days or what tremendous difficulties it had to contend with  in the first place the roads in the land were few and most of them inconceivably bad besides which they were infested by highwaymen who often took a fancy to rummage the mailbags and scatter their contents the post in those days was slow but not sure  then it experienced some trouble from other infants of the same family who claimed a right to share its privileges  among these was a postoffice established by the common council of london in direct rivalry to the parliamentary child this resulted in a great deal of squabbling and pamphleteering also in many valuable improvementsfor it is well known that opposition is the life of trade  the council of state however came to the conclusion that in an affair so thoroughly national the office of postmaster and the management of the postoffice ought to rest in the sole power and disposal of parliament the city posts were peremptorily suppressed opposition babies were quietlyno doubt righteouslymurdered and from that date the carrying of letters has remained the exclusive privilege of the crown  but considerable and violent opposition was made to this monopoly  this is a world of opposition my young friendsthe lecturer was pathetic hereand i have no doubt whatever that it was meant to be a world of oppositionthe lecturer was energetic here and drew an emphatic hear hear from the scotch members  why it is only by opposition that questions are ventilated and truth is established  no doubt every member of this ancient and literary society is well acquainted with the name of hillgreat cheeringsir rowland hill who in the year 1840 succeeded in getting introduced to the nation one of the greatest boons with which it has been blessednamely the penny post  renewed cheering well it is a curious and interesting fact that in the middle of the seventeenth centurymore than two hundred years agoa namesake of sir rowland whether an ancestor or not i cannot tell a mr john hill wrote a pamphlet in which monopoly was condemned and a penny post suggested  the title of the pamphlet was john hills penny post or a vindication of every englishman in carrying merchants or any other mens letters against any restraints of farmers of such employment  so you see in regard to the penny post the coming event cast its shadow about two hundred years in advance  the creeping era may be the title assigned to this period of postoffice history  little was expected of the postoffice and not much was done  nevertheless considering the difficulties in its way our infant progressed wonderfully  its revenue in 1649 was 5000 pounds gradually it got upon its legs  then it monopolised posthorses and began to run  waxing bolder it also monopolised packetboats and went to sea  like all bold and energetic children it had numerous falls and experienced many troubles in its progress  nevertheless its heart was kept up by the steady increase of its revenue which amounted to 76000 pounds in 1687  during the following seventyeight years the increase was twofold and during the next ninety years to 1854 it was tenfold  it was hard times with the postoffice officials about the beginning of last century  during what we may call the postboy era the officials were maltreated by robbers on shore and by privateers next thing to pirates at sea in fact they were compelled to become men of war  and the troubles and anxieties of the postmastergenerals were proportionately great  the latter had to fit out the mailpackets as ships of war build new ships and sell old ones provide stores and ammunition for the same engage captains and crews and attend to their disputes mutinies and shortcomings  they had also to correspond with the deputypostmasters all over the country about all sorts of matterschiefly their arrears and carelessness or neglect of dutybesides foreign correspondence what the latter involved may be partly gathered from lists of the articles sent by post at that time  among other things we find reference to fifteen couple of hounds going to the king of the romans with a free pass  a certain dr crichton carrying with him a cow and divers other necessaries is mentioned as having been posted also two servantmaids going as laundresses to my lord ambassador methuen and a deal case with four flitches of bacon for mr pennington of rotterdam  the captains of the mailpackets ought to have worn coats of mail for they had orders to run while they could to fight when they could not run and to throw the mails overboard when fighting failed  of course it is to be hoped this rule was not strictly enforced when doctors and females formed part of the mails  in one case a certain james vickers captain of the mailpacket grace dogger lay in dublin bay waiting till the tide should enable him to get over the bar  a french privateer chanced to be on the lookout in these waters and pounced upon james vickers who was either unable or unwilling to fight  the french captain stripped the grace doggeras the chronicler writesof rigging sails spars yards and all furniture wherewith she had been provided for due accommodation of passengers leaving not so much as a spoone or a naile or a hooke to hang anything on  having thus made a clean sweep of her valuables and having no use for the hull the frenchman ransomed the grace dogger to poor jv for fifty guineas which the postoffice had to pay  but our mailpackets were not always thus easily or summarily mastered sometimes they fought and conquered but whatever happened the result was invariably productive of expense because wounded men had to be cared for and cured or pensioned  thus one edward james had a donation of 5 pounds because a musket shot had grazed the tibia of his left leg  what the tibia may be my young friends is best known to the doctorsi have not taken the trouble to inquire  hear hear and applause then another got 12 pounds because a shot had divided his frontal muscles and fractured his skull while a third received a yearly pension of 6 pounds 13 shillings 4 pence on account of a shot in the hinder part of the head whereby a large division of scalp was made  observe what significance there is in that fourpence  dont it speak eloquently of the strict justice of the postoffice authorities of those days  dont it tell of tender solicitude on their part thus to gauge the value of gunshot wounds  might it not be said that the men were carefully rated when wounded  one postmastergeneral writes to an agent at falmouth in regard to rates each arm or leg amputated above the elbow or knee is 8 pounds per annum below the knee 20 nobles loss of sight of one eye 4 pounds of pupil of the eye 5 pounds of sight of both eyes 12 pounds of pupils of both eyes 14 pounds  our wellknown exactitude began to crop up you see even in those days  the postboyswho in many instances were greyheaded menalso gave the authorities much trouble many of them being addicted to strong drink and not a few to dilatory habits and dishonesty  one of them was at one time caught in the act of breaking the laws  at that period the byeposts were farmed but the postboys regardless of farmers rights often carried letters and brought back answers on their own account receiving and keeping the hire so that neither the postoffice nor the farmer got the benefit  the particular boy referred to was convicted and committed to prison but as he could not get bailhaving neither friends nor moneyhe begged to be whipped instead  his petition was granted and he was accordingly whipped to his hearts contentor as the chronicler has it he was whipped to the purpose  many men of great power and energy contributed to the advance of the postoffice in those times  i wont burden your minds with many of their names however  one of them william dockwra started a penny post in london for letters and small parcels in 1683  twentythree years later an attempt was made to start a halfpenny post in london but that was suppressed  soon after that a great man arose named ralph allen  he obtained a lease of the cross posts from government for life at 6000 pounds a year by his wisdom and energy he introduced vast improvements in the postal system besides making a profit of 12000 pounds a year which he lived to enjoy for fortyfour years spending much of his fortune in charity and in the exercise of hospitality to men of learning and genius  about the middle of last centurythe eighteenththe postoffice although greatly increased in efficiency was an insignificant affair compared with that of the present day  it was bound to pay into the exchequer 700 pounds a week  in ireland and scotland improvements also went on apace but not so rapidly as in england as might have been expected considering the mountainous nature of these countries  in scotland the first modern stagecoach was introduced in 1776  the same year a penny post was started in edinburgh by a certain peter williamson of aberdeen who was a keeper of a coffeestall in the parliament house and his experiment was so successful that he had to employ four carriers to deliver and collect letters  these men rang a bell on their rounds and wore a uniform  others soon entered into competition but the postoffice authorities came forward took the local penny post in hand and pensioned williamson off  it was not till the end of the century that the postoffice made one of its greatest and most notable strides  the mailcoach era followed that of the postboys and was introduced by mr john palmer manager of the bath theatre  the postboys had become so unbearably slow and corrupt that people had taken to sending valuable letters in brown paper parcels by the coaches which had now begun to run between most of the great towns  palmer who afterwards became controllergeneral of the postoffice proposed that mailbags should be sent by passengercoaches with trusty and armed guards  his advice after some opposition was acted on and thus the mails came to travel six miles an hour instead of three or fourthe result being an immediate increase of correspondence despite an increase of postage rapidity security regularity economy are the great requisites in a healthy postal system  here then was an advance in at least two of these  the advance was slight it is true but once more i repeat we ought not to turn up our noses at the day of small things  little grigs was going to repeat hear hear but thought better of it and checked himself of course there was opposition to the stagecoaches there always is and will be opposition to everything in a world of mixed good and evil  the scotsman here thought of repeating hear hear but refrained one pamphleteer denounced them as the greatest evil that had happened of late years in these kingdomsmischievous to the public prejudicial to trade and destructive to lands  those who travel in these coaches contract an idle habit of body become weary and listless when they had rode a few miles and were unable to travel on horseback and not able to endure frost snow or rain or to lodge in the fields  opposition for ever  so it ever is  so it was when footrunners gave place to horsemen so it was when horseflesh succumbed to steam  so it will be when electrogalvanic aerial locomotives take the place  the remainder of the sentence was lost in laughter and rapturous applause but roads were still intolerably bad  stagecoach travelling was a serious business  men made their wills before setting out on a journey  the journey between edinburgh and london was advertised to last ten days in summer and twelve in winter and that too in a socalled flying machine on steel springs  but to returnour infant having now become a sturdy youth advanced somewhat more rapidly  in 1792 a moneyorder office was set on foot for the first time  it had been originally undertaken by some postoffice clerks on their own account but was little used until the introduction of the penny postage  great reforms were made in many departments among them was an act passed to authorise the sending of letterbags by private ships  this originated the shipletter system by which letters are now conveyed to every part of the world visited by private ships  another mighty influence for good was the introduction about 1818 of macadamised roads which brought travelling up to the point of ten miles an hour  so also was the opening for use in 1829 of st martinslegranda grand event this in every sense of the word here a member objected to punning and was immediately hooted out of countenance  with mailcoaches macadamised roads security ten miles an hour and a vastly increased revenue the postoffice seemed to have reached the highest heights of prosperity  the heights from which we now look down upon these things ought to make us humble in our estimate of the future we have far surpassed the wildest dreams of those days but there were some points of picturesque interest in which we can never surpass them ah boys said solomon looking up with a gleam of enthusiasm in his eyes i mind the old mailcoaches well  they had for a long time before i knew them reached their best days  it was about the year 1820 that most of the postroads had been macadamised and the service had reached its highest state of efficiency  in 1836 there were fifty fourhorse mails in england thirty in ireland and ten in scotland besides fortynine twohorse mails in england  those who have not seen the starting of the mailcoaches from the general postoffice can never understand the magnificence and excitement of that scene  the coaches were clean trim elegant and glittering the bloodhorses were the finest that could be procured groomed to perfection and full of fire the drivers and guards were tried and trusty men of mettle in bright scarlet costumesome of the former being lords baronets and even parsons  it was a gay and stirring sight when the insides and outsides were seated when the drivers seized their reins and the bugles sounded the whips cracked the impatient steeds reared plunged or sprang away and the royal mails flew from the yard of st martinslegrand towards every corner of the kingdom  their progress too was a sort of royal progressa triumphal march wherever they had to pass crowds of people waited for them in subdued excitement hailed them with delight and waved them on with cheers for they were almost the only means of distributing news and when a great victory such as trafalgar vittoria or waterloo had to be announced the mailcoachesdressed in flowers and ribbons with guards shouting the news to eager crowds as they passed through hamlet village and townswept like a thrill of electric fire throughout the land  news was news in those days  you didnt get it at all till you got it altogether and then you got it like a thunderbolt  there was no dribbling of advance telegrams no daily papers to spread the news or lies and contradict em next day in the same columns with commentaries or prophetic remarks on what might or should have been but wasnt until news got muddled up into a hopeless entanglement so that when all was at last cleared up youd been worried out of all your interest in it  yes my lads although i would not wish to see the return of those stirring days im free to assert that the world lost something good and that it was not all clear gain when the old fourinhand royal mail coaches drove out of the present into the past and left the iron horse in possession of the field  but nothing can arrest the hand of time  when mailcoaches were at their best and a new great north road was being laid out by telford the celebrated engineer another celebrated engineer named stephenson was creating strange commotion among the coalpits of the north  the iron horse was beginning to snort  soon he began to shriek and claw the rails  despite the usual opposition he succeeded in asserting himself and in the words of a disconsolate old mailcoach guard men began to make a gridiron of old england  the romance of the road had faded away  no more for the old guard were there to be the exciting bustle of the start the glorious rush out of the smoky town into the bright country the crash through hamlet and village the wayside changings the rough crossing of snowdrifted moorlands the occasional breakdowns the difficulties and dangers the hospitable inns the fireside gossipings  the old guards day was over and a new act in the drama of human progress had begun  the railway era may be said to have commenced about the time of the opening of the liverpool and manchester line in 1830 though the railway system developed slowly during the first few years  men did not believe in it and many suggestions were made to accelerate the speed of mails in other ways  one writer proposed balloons  anotherprofessor babbagesuggested a series of high pillars with wires stretched thereon along which letterbags might be drawn  he even hinted that such pillars and wires might come to be made available for a species of telegraphic communication yet more rapida hint which is peculiarly interesting when we consider that it was given long prior to the time of the electric telegraph  but the iron horse rode roughshod over all other plans and finally became the recognised and effective method of conveyance  during this halfcentury of the mailcoach period many improvements and alterations had been made in the working of the postoffice  among other things the mails to india were despatched for the first time by the overland routethe mediterranean suez and the red sea in 1835  a line of communication was subsequently extended to china and australia  in the following year the reduction of the stampduty on newspapers to one penny led to a great increase in that branch of the service  but now approached the time for the greatest reform of allthat reduction of postage of which i have already spokennamely the uniform rate of one penny for all inland letters not exceeding a certain weight  the average postage of a letter in 1837 was 8 pence three farthings owing to the heavy rates the net proceeds of the department had remained stationary for nearly twenty years  to mend this state of matters sir rowland hill fought his long and famous fight the particulars of which i may not enter on just now but which culminated in victory in 1840 when the penny post was established throughout the kingdom  sir rowland still 1879 lives to witness the thorough success of his daring and beneficent innovation  it is impossible to form a just estimate of the value of cheap postage to the nationi may say to the world  trade has been increased correspondence extended intelligence deepened and mental activity stimulated  the immediate result of the change was to raise the number of letters passing through the post from seventysix millions in 1839 to one hundred and sixtynine millions in 1840  another result was the entire cessation of the illicit smuggling of letters  despite penal laws some carriers had been doing as large a business in illegal conveyance of letters as the postoffice itself  one seizure made a single bag in the warehouse of a wellknown london carrier revealed eleven hundred such letters  the horrified head of the firm hastened to the postmastergeneral and offered immediate payment of 500 pounds to escape the penalties incurred  the money was accepted and the letters were all passed through the postoffice the same night  sir rowlandthen mrhill had said that the postoffice was capable of performing a distinguished part in the great work of national education  his prophetic words have been more than justified  people who never wrote letters before write them now  those who wrote only a few letters now write hundreds  only grave and important subjects were formerly treated of by letter now we send the most trifling as well as the most weighty matters by the penny post in such floods that there is scarce room to receive the correspondence but liberal men and measures have been equal to the emergency  one objector to cheap rates prophesied that their adoption would cause the very walls of the general postoffice to burst  well it has seemed as if his prophecy were about to come true especially on recent christmas eves but it is not yet fulfilled for the old place has a tough skin and wont burst up for a considerable time to come  great applause  financially too continued solomon the penny post reform was an immense success though at first it showed a tendency to hang fire  the business of the moneyorder office was enormously increased as the convenience of that important department became obvious to the public and trade was so greatly improved that many tradesmen at the end of the first three years took the trouble to write to the postoffice to tell how their business had increased since the introduction of the change in short the penny post would require a lecture to itself  i will therefore dismiss it with the remark that it is one of the greatest blessings of modern times and that the nation owes an everlasting debt of gratitude to its author  with decreased rates came the other great requisitesincreased speed and security and now as you all know the work of the postoffice in all its wide ramifications goes on with the uniform regularity of a good chronometer from year to year  to the special duty of lettercarrying the postoffice has now added the carriage of books and patterns and a savingsbank as well as a money order department but if i were to enlarge on the details of all this it would become necessary to order coffee and buns for the whole society of literary messageboys and make up our beds on the floor of pegaway hallhear hear applause and cries of go onto avoid which i shall bring my discourse to a close with a humble apology for having detained you so long    chapter twenty one  tells of a series of terrible surprises  well what did you think of that old girl asked peter pax of tottie on issuing from the literary messageboys hall after having performed his duties there  it was wonderful  i ad no idear that the postoffice was so old or so grand a institootionbut please dont forget father said tottie with an anxious look at the battered clock  i dont forget im tot  ive been thinkin about im the whole time an ive made up my mind what to do  the only thing i aint sure of is whether i shouldnt take my friend phil maylands into partnership  oh please dont pleaded tottie i shouldnt like im to know about father  well the less he knows about im the better  praps youre right ill do it alone so you cut away home  ill go to have my personal appearance improved and then off to charing cross  lots of time tottie  dont be anxious  try if you can trust me  im small no doubt but im toughgoodnight  when abel bones seated himself that night in a thirdclass carriage at charing cross and placed a neat little black handbag in which he carried his housebreaking tools on the floor between his feet a small negro boy entered the carriage behind him and sitting down directly opposite stared at him as if lost in unutterable amazement  mr bones took no notice of the boy at first but became annoyed at last by the pertinacity of his attention  well you chunk of ebony he said how much are you paid a week for starin  no pound no shillins an nopence massa and find myself replied the negro so promptly that bones smiled in spite of himself  being however in no mood for conversation he looked out at the carriage window and let the boy stare to his hearts content  on drawing up to the platform of the station for rosebud cottage mr bones seemed to become anxious stretched his head out at the carriage window and muttered to himself  on getting out he looked round with a disappointed air  failed me he growled with an anathema on some one unknown  well ill do it alone he muttered between his teeth  o no you wont my fine fellow thought the negro boy ill help you to do it and make you do it badly if you do it at allmay i carry your bag massa he added aloud  mr bones replied with a savage kick which the boy eluded nimbly and ran with a look of mock horror behind a railway van  here he put both hands to his sides and indulged in a chuckle so heartythough subduedthat an ordinary cat to say nothing of a cheshire one might have joined him from sheer sympathy  o the brute he gasped on partially recovering and tottie tottie why shes again this eccentric boy went off into subdued convulsions in which state he was discovered by a porter and chased off the premises  during the remainder of that night the chunk of ebony followed mr bones like his shadow  when he went down to the small publichouse of the hamlet to moisten his throat with a glass of beer the negro boy waited for him behind a haystack when he left the publichouse and took his way towards rosebud cottage the boy walked a little behind himnot far behind for the night was dark  when on consulting his watch with the aid of a match bones found that his time for action had not arrived and sat down by the side of a hedge to meditate the chunk crept through a hole in the same hedge crawled close up like a panther lay down in the grass on the other side and listened  but he heard nothing for the burglar kept his thoughts whatever they might have been to himself  the hour was too still the night too dark the scene too ghostly for mutterings  peering through the hedge which was high and thick the boy could see the red glow of mr boness pipe  suddenly it occurred to pax that now was a favourable opportunity to test his plan  the hedge between him and his victim was impassable to any one larger than himself on his side the ground sloped towards a plantation in which he could easily find refuge if necessary  there was no wind  not a leaf stirred  the silence was profoundbroken only by the puffing of the burglars lips  little pax was quick to conceive and act  suddenly he opened his mouth to its widest took aim where he thought the ear of bones must be and uttered a short sharp appalling yell compared to which a shriek of martyrdom must have been as nothing  that the effect on bones was tremendous was evinced by the squiblike action of his pipe as it flew into the air and the stumbling clatter of his feet as he rushed blindly from the spot  little pax rolled on the grass in indescribable ecstasies for a few seconds then crept through the hole and followed his victim  but bones was no coward  he had only been taken by surprise and soon stopped  still he was sufficiently superstitious to look frequently over his shoulder as he walked in the direction of miss stivergills cottage  pax was by that time on familiar ground  fearing that bones was not to be scared from his purpose by one fright he made a detour got ahead of him and prepared to receive him near the old well of an adjoining farm which stood close by the road  when the burglars footsteps became audible he braced himself up  as bones drew near pax almost burst his little chest with an inhalation  when bones was within three feet of him he gave vent to such a skirl that the burglars reason was again upset  he bounded away but suddenly recovered selfpossession and turning round dashed at the old well where pax had prematurely begun to enjoy himself  to jump to his feet and run like the wind was the work of a moment bones followed furiously  rage lent him for the moment unwonted power he kept well up for some distance growling fiercely as he ran but the lithe limbs and sound lungs of the boy were too much for him  he soon fell behind and finally stopped while pax ran on until out of breath  believing that he had now rid himself of some mischievous boy of the neighbourhood the burglar turned back to transact his business at rosebud cottage  peter pax also turned in the same direction  he felt that things were now beginning to look serious  to thwart mr bones in his little game by giving information as to his intentions would have been easy but then that would have involved his being took which was not to be thought of  at the same time it was evident that he was no longer to be scared by yells  somewhat depressed by his failure pax hastened towards the cottage as fast as he could resolved to give his enemy a last stunning reception in the garden even although by so doing he would probably scare miss stivergill and her household out of their wits  he reached the garden some minutes before bones and clambered over the wall  while in the very act of doing so he felt himself seized by the throat and nearly strangled  now then young un growled a deep voice which was not that of bones what little game may you be up to  ease your grip and ill tell you gasped pax  it was the constable of the district who had caught him  that faithful guardian of the night having been roused by the unwonted yells and having heard paxs footsteps had followed him up  im not a burglar sir pleaded pax not well knowing what to say suddenly he opened his mouth in desperation intending to give one final yell which might scare bones from his impending fate but it was nipped in the bud by the policemans strong hand  ha youd give your pal a signal would you he said in a gruff whisper  come now keep quiet if you dont want to be choked  you cant save im so youd better give in  poor pax now saw that nothing more could be done  he therefore made a virtue of necessity and revealed as much of the object of his mission as he deemed prudent  the man believed him and on his promising to keep perfectly still released him from his deadly grip  while the policeman and the boy lay thus biding their time in the shrubbery bones got over the wall and quietly inspected the premises  ill let him begin and take him in the act whispered the policeman  but hes an awful big strong determined feller said pax  so am i returned the policeman with a smile which was lost in the dark  now it so happened that miss lillycrop who had been spending that day with miss stivergill had been induced to spend the night also with her friend  of course these two had much to talk aboutladies generally have in such circumstancesand they were later than usual in going to bed  mr bones was therefore much against his will obliged to delay the execution of his plans  little dreaming that two admirers lay in ambush about fifty yards off he retired to a dark corner behind a bit of old wall and there appropriately screened by a laurel bush lit his pipe and enjoyed himself  my dear said miss stivergill to her friend about midnight we must go to bed  do you go up to my room ill follow after looking round  it was the nightly practice of this lady to go over her premises from cellar to garret to make quite sure that the servant had fastened every bolt and bar and lock  she began with the cellars  finding everything right there she went to the diningroom windows  ha the gipsyunbolted and the shutters open exclaimed miss stivergill fastening the bolt  hm  the old fool thought the burglar observing her tall square figure while thus engaged might as well bolt the door of newgate with a steel pen  cottage windowgear is meant for show not for service old girl  i look round regularly every night observed miss stivergill entering her bedroom in which miss lillycrop usually occupied a chair bed when on a visit to the rosebud  youve no idea how careless servants are havent i just thought her friend and although i have no personal fear of burglars i deem it advisable to interpose some impediments to their entrance  but what would you do if they did get in asked miss lillycrop in some anxiety for she had a very strong personal fear of burglars  oh  i have several little plans for their reception replied the lady with a quiet smile  theres a bell in the corner there which was meant for the parish church but was thought to be a little too small i bought it had a handle affixed to it as you see and should ring it at an open window if the house were attempted  but they might rush in at the door and stop youkill you even suggested the other with a shudder  have you not observed said miss stivergill that i lock my door on the inside  besides i have other little appliances which i shall explain to you in the morning for i scorn to be dependent on a manservant for protection  theres a revolver in that drawer beside youmiss lillycrop shrank from the drawer in questionbut i would only use it in the last extremity for i am not fond of taking human life  indeed i would decline to do so even to save my own but i should have no objection to maim  injuries about the legs or feet might do burglars spiritual as well as physical good in the longrun besides being beneficial to societynow my dear goodnight  miss stivergill extinguished the candle as violently as she would have maimed a burglar and poor miss lillycrops heart leapt as she was suddenly plunged into total darknessfor she was naturally timid and could not help it  for some time both ladies lay perfectly still the hostess enjoying that placid period which precedes slumber the guest quaking with fear caused by the thoughts that the recent conversation had raised  presently miss lillycrop raised herself on one elbow and glared in the direction of her friends bed so awfully that her eyes all but shone in the dark  did you hear that dear she asked in a low whisper  of course i did replied miss stivergill aloud  hush listen  they listened and heard that again  there could be no doubt about ita curious scratching sound at the diningroom window immediately below theirs  rats said miss stivergill in a low voice  oh  i do hope so whispered miss lillycrop  she entertained an inexpressible loathing of rats but compared with burglars they were as bosom friends whom she would have welcomed with a glad shudder  in a few minutes the scratching ceased and a bolt or spring snapped the wildest of rats never made a sound like that  miss lillycrop sat bolt up in her bed transfixed with horror and could dimly see her friend spring from her couch and dart across the room like a ghostly phantom  lilly if you scream said miss stivergill in a voice so low and stern that it caused her blood to curdle ill do something awful to youget up  the command was peremptory  miss lillycrop obeyed  here catch hold of the bellhandleso  your other handtherekeep the tongue fast in it and dont ring till i give the word  miss lillycrop was perfect in her docility  a large tin teatray hung at the side of miss stivergills bed  beside it was a round ball with a handle to it  miss lillycrop had wondered what these were there for  she soon found out  miss stivergill put the dressingtable a little to one side and placed a ewer of water on it  at that moment the diningroom window was heard to open slowly but distinctly  miss stivergill threw up the bedroom window  the marrow in miss lillycrops spine froze  mr bones started and looked up in surprise  he received a deluge of water on his face and at the same moment a ewer burst in atoms on the gravel at his feetfor miss stivergill did nothing by halves  but bones was surpriseproof by that time besides the coveted treasure was on the sideboardalmost within his grasp  he was too bold a villain to be frightened by women and he knew that sleeping countryfolk are not quickly roused to succour the inmates of a lonely cottage  darting into the room he tumbled over chairs tables workboxes fireirons and coalscuttle  ring said miss stivergill sharply  at the same moment she seized the teatray in her left hand and belaboured it furiously with the drumstick  ring out at the window shouted miss stivergill  miss lillycrop did so until her spinal marrow thawed  the noise was worse than appalling  little pax unable to express his conflicting emotions in any other way yelled with agonising delight even the hardened spirit of bones trembled with mingled feelings of alarm and surprise  he found and grasped the coveted box and leaped out of the window with a bound  it is highly probable that he would have got clear off but for the involuntary action of miss lillycrop  as that ladys marrow waxed warm she dashed the great bell against the windowsill with such fervour that it flew from her grasp and descended full on the burglars cranium just as he leaped into the arms of the policeman and both fell heavily to the ground  the guardian of the night immediately jumped up uninjured but bones lay prone on the green swardstunned by the bell  thats well done anyhow an saved me a world o trouble said the constable looking up at the window as he held the burglar down though there was little necessity for that  you couldnt shy me over a bit of rope could you maam  miss stivergill to whom nothing seemed difficult and who had by that time stopped her share in the noise went into a cupboard and fetched thence a coil of rope  i meant it to be used in the event of fire she said quietly to her friend who had thrown herself flat on her bed but it will serve other purposes as wellthere policeman  she threw it down and when bones recovered consciousness he found himself securely tied and seated in a chair in the rosebud kitchenthe policeman looking at him with interest and the domestics with alarm miss stivergill regarded him with calm severity  now hes quite safe maam but i cant venture to take im to the station alone  if youll kindly consent to keep an eye on him maam till i run down for a comrade ill be greatly obleeged  theres no fear of his wrigglin out o that maam you may make your mind easy  my mind is quite easy policeman you may go  i shall watch him  when the man had left miss stivergill ordered the servants to leave the kitchen  little pax who had discreetly kept out of range of the burglars eye went with them a good deal depressed in spirit for his mission had failed  the burglary had not indeed been accomplished butfather was took  when miss stivergill was left alone with the burglar she gazed at him for some time in silence  man she said at length you are little boness father  if you means tottie maam i is replied bones with a look and tone which were not amiable  i have a strong feeling of regard for your child though not a scrap of pity for yourself said miss stivergill with a frown  mr bones muttered something to the effect that he returned the compliment with interest  for totties sake i should be sorry to see you transported continued the lady therefore i mean to let you off  moreover bad as you are i believe you are not so bad as many people would think you  therefore im going to trust you  bones looked inquiringly and with some suspicion at his captor  he evidently thought there was a touch of insanity about her  this was confirmed when miss stivergill seizing a carvingknife from the dresser advanced with masculine strides towards him  he made a desperate effort to burst his bonds but they were too scientifically arranged for that  dont fear said the lady severing the cord that bound the burglars wrists and putting the knife in his hands  now she added you know how to cut yourself free no doubt  well you are a trump exclaimed bones rapidly touching his bonds at salient points with the keen edge  in a few seconds he was free  now go away said miss stivergill and dont let me see you here again  bones looked with admiration at his deliverer but could only find words to repeat that she was a trump and vanished through the backdoor just as a band of men with pitchforks rakes spades and lanterns came clamouring in at the front garden gate from the neighbouring farm  what is it exclaimed the farmer  only a burglar answered miss stivergill  where is he chorussed everybody  thats best known to himself replied the lady who in order to give the fugitive time went into a minute and slow account of the whole affairexcepting of course her connivance at the escapeto the great edification of her audience among whom the one who seemed to derive the chief enjoyment was a black boy  he endeavoured to screen himself behind the labourers and was obviously unable to restrain his glee  but whats come of im maam asked the farmer impatiently  escaped answered miss stivergill  escaped echoed everybody looking furtively round as though they supposed he had only escaped under the dresser or into the keyhole  escaped repeated the policeman who entered at the moment with two comrades impossible  i tied im so that no efforts of his own could avail im  somebody must ave elped im  the carvingknife helped him said miss stivergill with a look of dignityperhaps instead of speculating how he escaped policeman it would be better to pursue him  he cant be very far off as it is not twenty minutes since he cut himself free  in a state of utter bewilderment the policeman rushed out of the cottage followed by his comrades and the agriculturists  peter pax essayed to go with them but was restrained by an iron grip on his collar  pulling him back miss stivergill dragged her captive into a parlour and shut the door  come now little pax she said setting the boy in a chair in front of her you neednt try to deceive me  id know you among a thousand in any disguise  if you were to blacken your face with coaltar an inch thick your impertinence would shine through  you know that the burglar is little boness father youve a pretty good guess that i let him off you have come here for some purpose in connection with him  comeout with it and make a clean breast  little pax did make a clean breast then and there was washed white supped and slept at the rosebud returned to town next day by the first train and had soon the pleasure of informing tottie that the intended burglary had been frustrated and that her father wasnt took after all    chapter twenty two  shows how one thing leads to another and so on  it is a mere truism to state that many a chain of grave and farreaching events is set in motion by some insignificant trifle  the touching of a trigger by a child explodes a gun which extinguishes a valuable life and perhaps throws a whole neighbourhood into difficulties  the lighting of a match may cause a conflagration which shall bring down an extensive firm some of whose dependants in the retail trade will go down along with it and cause widespreading distress if not ruin among a whole army of greengrocers buttermen and other small fry  the howling of a bad baby was the comparatively insignificant event which set going a certain number of wheels whose teeth worked into the cogs which revolved in connection with our tale  the howling referred to awoke a certain contractor near pimlico with a start and caused him to rise off what is popularly known as the wrong side  being an angry man the contractor called the baby bad names and would have whipped it had it been his own  going to his office before breakfast with the effects of the howl strong upon him he met a humble labourer there with a surly well what do you want  the labourer wanted work  the contractor had no work to give him  the labourer pleaded that his wife and children were starving  the contractor didnt care a pinch of snuff for his wife or children and bade him be off  the labourer urged that the times were very hard and he would be thankful for any sort of job no matter how small  he endeavoured to work on the contractors feelings by referring to the premature death by starvation of his pet parrot which had been for years in the family and a marvellous speaker having been taught by his mate bill  the said bill was also out of work and waiting for him outside  he too would be thankful for a jobanything would do and they would be willing to work for next to nothing  the contractor still professed utter indifference to the labourers woes but the incident of the parrot had evidently touched a cord which could not be affected by human suffering  after a few minutes consideration he said there was a small joba pump at the corner of a certain street not far off had to be taken down to make way for contemplated alterations  it was not necessary to take it down just then but as the labourers were so hard up for a job they were at liberty to undertake that one  thus two wheels were set in motion and the result was that the old pump at the corner of purr street was uprooted and laid low by these labourers one of whom looked into the lower end of the pump and said hallo  his companion bill echoed the hallo and added whats up  wy if there aint somethink queer inside of the old pump said the labourer going down on both knees in order to look more earnestly into it  i do blieve its letters  some doubleextra stoopids ave bin an posted em in the pump  he pulled out handfuls of letters as he spoke some of which from their appearance must have lain there for years while others were quite fresh  a passing lettercarrier took charge of these letters and conveyed them to the postoffice where the machinery of the department was set in motion on them  they were examined faced sorted and distributed among them was the letter which george aspel had committed to the care of tottie bones at the time of his first arrival in london and thus it came to pass that the energies of sir james clubley baronet were roused into action  dear me how strange said sir james to himself on reading the letter  this unaccountable silence is explained at last  poor fellow i have judged him hastily  come  ill go find him out  but this resolve was more easily made than carried into effect  at the hotel from which the letter had been dated nothing was known of the missing youth except that he had departed long long ago leaving as his future address the name of a birdstuffer which name had unfortunately been mislaidnot lost  oh noonly mislaid  on further inquiry however there was a certain undersized plainlooking and rather despised chambermaid who retained a lively and grateful recollection of mr aspel in consequence of his having given her an unexpectedly large tip at parting coupled with a few slight but kindly made inquiries as to her welfare which seemed to imply that he regarded her as a human being  she remembered distinctly his telling her one evening that if any one should call for him in his absence he was to be found at the residence of a lady in cat street pimlico but for the life of her she couldnt remember the number though she thought it must have been number nine for she remembered having connected it in her mind with the wellknown lives of a cat  cat street  strange namevery said sir james  are you sure it was cat street  well i aint quite sure sir replied the little plain one with an inquiring frown at the chandelier but i know it ad somethink to do with cats  praps it was mew street but im quite sure it was pimlico  and the ladys name  well sir i aint sure of that neither  it was somethink queer i know but then theres amany queer names in londonaint there sir  sir james admitted that there were and advised her to reflect on a few of them  the little plain one did reflectwith the aid of the chandelierand came to the sudden conviction that the ladys name had to do with flowers  not rosesno nor yet violets she said with an air of intense mental application for the maidens memory was largely dependent on association of ideas it might ave been marigolds though it dont seem likely  stay was it wateroh it was lilies  yes i ave it now miss liliessomethink  think again now said the baronet everything depends on the something for miss lilies is not so extravagantly queer as you seem to think her name was  thats true sir said the perplexed maid with a last appealing gaze at the chandelier and beginning with the first letter of the alphabet miss lilies a lilies b lilies c etcetera until she came to k thats it now  i ave it almost  it ad to do with lots of lilies im quite surequantities it must ave been  on sir james suggesting that quantities did not begin with a k the little plain ones feelings were slightly hurt and she declined to go any further into the question  sir james was therefore obliged to rest content with what he had learned and continued his search in pimlico there he spent several hours in playing with small shopkeepers and policemen a game somewhat analogous to that which is usually commenced with the words is it animal vegetable or mineral  the result was that eventually he reached number 9 purr street and found himself in the presence of miss lillycrop  that lady however damped his rising hopes by saying that she did not know where george aspel was to be found and that he had suddenly disappearedto her intense regretfrom the birdwarehouse in which he had held a situation  it belonged to the brothers blurt whose address she gave to her visitor  little tottie bones who had heard the conversation through the open parlour door could have told where aspel was to be found but the promise made to her father sealed her lips besides particular inquiries after any one were so suggestive to her of policemen and being took that she had a double motive to silence  mr enoch blurt could throw no light on the subject but he could and did add to sir jamess increasing knowledge of the youths reported dissipation and sympathised with him strongly in his desire to find out aspels whereabouts  moreover he directed him to the general postoffice where a youth named maylands a lettersorterwho had formerly been a telegraph messageboyand an intimate friend of aspel was to be found and might be able to give some information about him though he mr blurt feared not  phil maylands could only say that he had never ceased to make inquiries after his friend but hitherto without success and that he meant to continue his inquiries until he should find him  sir james clubley therefore returned in a state of dejection to the sympathetic miss lillycrop who gave him a note of introduction to a detectivethe grave man in greya particular friend and ally of her own with whom she had scraped acquaintance during one of her many pilgrimages of love and mercy among the poor  to the man in grey sir james committed his case and left him to work it out  now the way of a detective is a mysterious way  far be it from us to presume to point it out or elucidate or expound it in any degree  we can only give a vague incomplete it may be even incorrect view of what the man in grey did and achieved nevertheless we are bound to record what we know as to this officers proceedings inasmuch as they have to do with the thread of our narrative  it may be that other motives besides those connected with george aspel induced the man in grey to visit the general postoffice but we do not certainly know  it is quite possible that a whole host of subsidiary and incidental cases on hand might have induced him to take up the postoffice like a huge stone wherewith to knock down innumerable birds at one and the same throw we cannot tell  the brain of a detective must be essentially different from the brains of ordinary men  his powers of perceptionwe might add of conception reception deception and particularly of interceptionare marvellous  they are altogether too high for us  how then can we be expected to explain why it was that on arriving at the postoffice the man in grey instead of asking eagerly for george aspel at the inquiry office or the returned letter office or the poste restante as any sane man would have done began to put careless and apparently unmeaning questions about little dogs and to manifest a desire to be shown the chief points of interest in the basement of st martinslegrand  in the gratifying of his desires the man in grey experienced no difficulty  the staff of the postoffice is unvaryingly polite and obliging to the public  an order was procured and he soon found himself with a guide traversing the mysterious regions underneath the splendid new building where the great work of postal telegraphy is carried on  while his conductor led him through the labyrinthine passages in which a stranger would infallibly have lost his way he explained the various objects of interestespecially pointing out the racks where thousands on thousands of old telegrams are kept for a short time for reference in case of dispute and then destroyed  he found the man in grey so intelligent and sympathetic that he quite took a fancy to him  do you happen to remember asked the detective in a quiet way during a pause in his companions remarks anything about a mad dog taking refuge in this basement some time agoa small poodle i think it was which disappeared in some mysterious way  the conductor had heard a rumour of such an event but had been ill and off duty at the time and could give him no details  this said he opening a door is the battery room where the electricity is generated for the instruments aboveallow me to introduce you to the battery inspector  the man in grey bowed to the inspector who was a tall powerful man quite fit apparently to take charge of a battery of horse artillery if need were  a singular place remarked the detective looking sharply round the large room whose dimensions were partially concealed however by the rows of shelving which completely filled it from floor to ceiling  somewhat curious assented the inspector you see our batteries require a good deal of shelving  all put together there is in this room about three miles of shelving completely filled as you see with about 22000 cells or jars  the electricity is generated in these jars they contain carbon and zinc plates in a solution of bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid and water  we fill them up once every two weeks and renew the plates occasionally  there is a deal of sulphate of copper used up here sir in creating electricityabout six tons in the year  pure copper accumulates on the plates in the operation but the zinc wears away  the detective expressed real astonishment and interest in all this and much more that the inspector told him  poisonous stuff in your jars i should fancy he inquired  rather replied the inspector  does your door ever stand open asked the detective  sometimes said the other with a look of slight surprise  you never received a visit down here from a mad dog did you asked the man in grey  never  i only ask the question continued the other in a careless tone because i once read in the newspapers of a poodle being chased into the postoffice and never heard of again  it occurred to me that poison might account for ita curiouslooking thing here what is it  he had come to a part of the battery room where there was a large frame or case of dark wood the surface of which was covered with innumerable brass knobs or buttons which were coupled together by wires  that is our battery testbox explained the inspector  there are four thousand wires connected with ittwo thousand going to the instruments upstairs and two thousand connected with the batteryjars when i complete the circuit by connecting any couple of these buttons the influence of the current is at once perceived  he took a piece of charcoal as he spoke and brought it into contact with two of the knobs  the result was to convert the coal instantly into an intense electric light of dazzling beauty  the point of an ordinary lead pencil applied in the same way became equally brilliant  that must be a powerful battery remarked the detective  the inspector smilingly took two handles from a neighbouring shelf and held them out to his visitor  lay hold of these he said and you will feel its powers  the detective did as directed and received a shock which caused him to fling down the handles with great promptitude and violence  he was too selfpossessed a man however to seem put out  strong he said with a short laugh remarkably strong and effective  yes assented the inspector it is pretty powerful and it requires to be so for it does heavy work and travels a considerable distance the greater the distance you know the greater the power required to do the work and transmit the messages  this is the battery that fires two signalguns every day at one oclockone at newcastle the other at south shields and supplies greenwich time to all our principal stations over a radius of three hundred milesi sent the contents of one hundred and twenty jars through you just now  thats curious and interesting i may even say it is suggestive returned the detective in a meditative tone  double that number of jars now applied to the locks of street doors at night and the fastenings of windows would give a powerful surprise to burglars  ah no doubt and also to belated friends said the inspector not to mention the effect on servantmaids in the morning when people forgot to disconnect the wires  the man in grey admitted the truth of the observation and thanking the battery inspector for his kind attentions bade him a cordial adieu continuing his investigation of the basement he came to the three huge fiftyhorsepower engines whose duty it is to suck the air from the pneumatic telegraph tubes in the great hall above  here the detective became quite an engineer asked with much interest and intelligence about governors pistons escapevalves actions etcetera and wound up with a proposition  suppose now he said that a little dog were to come suddenly into this room and dash about in a miscellaneous sort of way could it by any means manage to become entangled in your machinery and get so demolished as never more to be seen or heard of  the engineer looked at his questioner with a somewhat amused expression no sir i dont think it could  no doubt it might kill itself with much facility in various ways for fifty horsepower properly applied would do for an elephant much more a dog  but i dont believe that power to be sufficient to produce annihilation  there would have been remains of some sort  from the engineroom our detective proceeded to the boilerroom and the various kitchens and thence to the basement of the old building on the opposite side of the street where he found a similarly perplexing labyrinth  he was taken in hand here by mr bright who chanced to be on duty and led him first to the stamp department  there was much to draw him off his canine mania here  first he was introduced to the chief of the department who gave him much interesting information about stamps in general  then he was conducted to another room and shown the tables at which men were busy counting sheets of postagestamps and putting them up in envelopes for all parts of the united kingdom  the officer in charge told him that the weight of stamps sent out from that room averaged a little over three tons daily and that the average value of the weekly issue was 150000 pounds  then he was led into a fireproof safea solid stone apartmentwhich was piled from floor to ceiling with sheets of postagestamps of different values  those for letters ranged from one halfpenny to one pound but those used for telegrams ran up to as much as five pounds sterling for a single stamp  taking down from a shelf a packet of these highpriced stamps which was about the size of a thick octavo book the official stated that it was worth 35000 pounds  yes sir he added this strong box of ours holds a deal of money you are at this moment in the presence of nearly two millions sterling  a tidy little sum to retire upon  would build two thousand board schools at a thousand pounds each said the detective who was an adept at figuresas at everything else  feeling that it would be ridiculous to inquire about mad dogs in the presence of two millions sterling the man in grey suffered himself to be led through long passages and vaulted chambers some of which latter were kitchens where the men on duty had splendid fires oceans of hot water benches and tables and liberty to cook the food either brought by themselves for the day or procured from a caterer on the premises for postoffice officials when on duty may not leave the premises for any purpose whatever except duty and must sign books specifying to the minute when where and why they come and go  in this basement also as in the other were long rows of numbered cupboards or large pigeonholes with lockable doors one of which was appropriated to each man for the safe depositing of his victuals and other private property  here too were whitewashed lavatories conveniently and plentifully distributed with every appliance for cleanliness and comfort including a large supply of fresh and good water  of this 49000 gallons a day is supplied by an artesian well and 39000 gallons a day by the new river company in the new building  in the old building the 27000 gallons consumed daily is supplied by the new river company  it is however due to the 5900 human beings who labour in both buildings to state that at least 55000 of these gallons are swallowed by steamengines on the premises  to all these things mr bright directed attention with professional zeal and the man in grey observed with much interest all that he saw and heard until he came to the lettercarriers kitchen where several of the men were cooking food at the fire while others were eating or chatting at the tables  happening to mention the dog here he found that mr bright was partially acquainted with the incident  it was down these stairs it ran he said and was knocked on the head in this very room by the policeman  no one knows where he took the body to but he went out at that door in the direction it is supposed of the boilerhouse  the detective had at last got hold of a clew  he was what is styled in a wellknown game getting warm  let us visit the boilerhouse he said  again for the nonce he became an engineer  like paul he was all things to all men  he was very affable to the genial stoker who was quite communicative about the boilers  after a time the detective referred to the dog and the peculiar glance of the stoker at once showed him that his object was gained  a policeman brought it he asked quietly  yes a policeman brought it said the stoker suspiciously  the man in grey soon however removed his suspicions and induced him to become confidential  when he had obtained all the information that the stoker could givein addition to poor flopparts collar which had no name on it but was stamped with three stars on its insidethe detective ceased to make any further inquiries after mad dogs and with a disengaged mind accompanied mr bright through the remainder of the basement where he commented on the wise arrangement of having the mailbags made by convicts and on the free library which he pronounced a magnificent institution and which contained about 2000 volumes that were said by the courteous librarian to be largely used by the officials as well as the various newspapers and magazines furnished gratuitously by their proprietors  he was also shown the lifts which raised peopleto say nothing of mails etceterafrom the bottom to the top of the building or vice versa the small steamengine which worked the same and the engineer of whichan old servantwas particularly impressive on the peculiar governor by which his engine was regulated the array of letter stampers which were kept by their special guardian in immaculate order and readiness the firehose which was also ready for instant service and the firemen who were in constant attendance with a telegraphic instrument at their special disposal connecting them with other parts of the building  all this and a great deal more which we have not space to mention the man in grey saw admired and commented on as well as on the general evidence of order method regularity neatness and system which pervaded the whole place  you manage things well here he said to his conductor at parting  we do responded mr bright with an approving nod and we had need to for the daily despatch of her majestys mails to all parts of the world is no childs play  our motto isor ought to besecurity celerity punctuality and regularity  we couldnt carry that out sir without good managementgoodbye  goodbye and thank you said the detective leaving st martinslegrand with his busy brain ruminating on a variety of subjects in a manner that no one but a detective could by any possibility understand    chapter twenty three  the turningpoint  as time advanced philip maylands circumstances improved for phil belonged to that class of which it is sometimes said they are sure to get on  he was thoroughgoing and trustworthytwo qualities these which the world cannot do without and which being always in demand are never found begging  phil did not set up for anything  he assumed no airs of superior sanctity  he did not even aim at being better than others though he did aim daily at being better than he was  in short the lad having been trained in ways of righteousness and having the word of god as his guide advanced steadily and naturally along the narrow way that leads to life  hence it came to pass in the course of time that he passed from the ranks of outdoor boy telegraph messenger to that of boysorter with a wage of twelve shillings a week which was raised to eighteen shillings  his hours of attendance at the circulation department were from 430 in the morning till 9 and from 430 in the evening till 8  these suited him well for he had ever been fond of rising with the lark while at home and had no objection to rise before the lark in london  the evening being free he devoted to studyfor phil was one of that by no means small class of youths who in default of a college education do their best to train themselves by the aid of books and the occasional help of clergymen philanthropists and evening classes  in all this phil was greatly assisted by his sister may who although not much more highly educated than himself was quick of perception of an inquiring mind and a sympathetic soul  he was also somewhat assisted and at times not a little retarded by his ardent admirer peter pax who joined him enthusiastically in his studies but being of a discursive and enterprising spirit was prone to tempt him off the beaten paths of learning into the thickets of speculative philosophy  one evening pax was poring over a problem in euclid with his friend in pegaway hall  phil he said uneasily drop your triangles a bit and listen  would you think it dishonest to keep a thing secret that ought to be known  that depends a good deal on what the secret is and what i have got to do with it replied phil  but why do you ask  because ive been keeping a secret a long timemuch against my will an i can stand it no longer  if i dont let it out itll bust me besides ive got leave to tell it  out with it then pax for its of no use trying to keep down things that dont agree with you  well then said pax  i know where george aspel is  phil who had somewhat unwillingly withdrawn his mind from euclid turned instantly with an eager look towards his little friend  ah i thought that would rouse you said the latter with a look of unwonted earnestness on his face  you must know phil that a long while agojust about the time of the burglary at miss stivergills cottagei made the amazin discovery that little tottie bones is mariaralias merrythe little babycousin i was nuss to in the country long ago whom ive often spoke to you about and from whom i was torn when she had reached the tender age of two or thereby  it follows of course that totties fatherold bonesis my uncle alias blackadder alias the brute of whom i have also made mention and who it seems came to london to try his fortune in knavery after havin failed in the country  i saw him once i believe at old blurts birdshop but did not recognise im at the time owin to his hat bein pulled well over his eyes though i rather think he must have recognised me  the second time i saw him was when tottie came to me for help and set me on his tracks when he was goin to commit the burglary on rosebud cottage  ive told you all about that but did not tell you that the burglar was totties father as tottie had made me promise not to mention it to any one  i knew the rascal at once on seeing him in the railway carriage and could hardly help explodin in his face at the fun of the affair  of course he didnt know me on account of my bein as black in the face as the king of dahomeywell continued pax warming with his subject it also follows as a matter of course that mrs bones is my blessed old aunt georgienow changed into molly on account no doubt of the brutes desire to avoid the attentions of the police  now as ive a great regard for aunt georgie and have lost a good deal of my hatred of the brute and find myself fonder than ever of tottiei beg her pardon of merryive been rather intimateindeed i may say pretty thickwith the boneses ever since and as i am no longer a burden to the brutecan even help im a littlehe dont abominate me as much as he used to  theyre wery poorawful poorare the boneses  the brute still keeps up a fiction of a marketgarden and a dairythe latter bein supplied by a cow and a pumpbut it dont pay and the business in the city whatever it may be seems equally unprofitable for their town house is not a desirable residence  this is all very interesting and strange pax but what has it to do with george aspel asked phil  you know im very anxious about him and have long been hunting after him  indeed i wonder that you did not tell me about him before  how could i said pax when toti mean merryno ill stick to tottie it comes more natural than the old nametold me not for worlds to mention it  only now after pressin her and aunt georgie wery hard have i bin allowed to let it out for poor aspel himself dont want his whereabouts to be known  surely exclaimed phil with a troubled anxious air he has not become a criminal  no  auntie assures me he has not but he is sunk very low drinks hard to drown his sorrow and is ashamed to be seen  no wonder  youd scarce know im phil workin like a coalheaver in a suit of dirty fustian about the wharvestryin to keep out of sight  ive come across im once or twice but pretended not to recognise im  now phil added little pax with deep earnestness in his face as he laid his hand impressively on his friends arm we must save these two men somehowyou and i  yes god helping us we must said phil  from that moment philip maylands and peter pax passed as it were into a more earnest sphere of life a higher stage of manhood  the influence of a powerful motive a settled purpose and a great end told on their characters to such an extent that they both seemed to have passed over the period of hobbledehoyhood at a bound and become young men  with the ardour of youth they set out on their mission at once  that very night they went together to the wretched abode of abel bones having previously however opened their hearts and minds to may maylands from whom as they had expected they received warm encouragement  little did these unsophisticated youths know what a torrent of anxiety grief fear and hope their communication sent through the heart of poor may  the eager interest she manifested in their plans they regarded as the natural outcome of a kind heart towards an old friend and playfellow  so it was but it was more than that  the same evening george aspel and abel bones were seated alone in their dismal abode in archangel court  there were tumblers and a pot of beer before them but no food  aspel sat with his elbows on the table grasping the hair on his temples with both hands  the other sat with arms crossed and his chin sunk on his chest gazing gloomily but intently at his companion  remorsethat most awful of the ministers of vengeancehad begun to torment abel bones  when he saved tottie from the fire aspel had himself unwittingly unlocked the door in the burglars soul which let the vengeful minister in  thereafter miss stivergills illustration of mercy for the sake of another had set the unlocked door ajar and the discovery that his illtreated little nephew had nearly lost his life in the same cause had pulled the door well back on its rusty hinges  having thus obtained free entrance remorse sat down and did its work with terrible power  bones was a man of tremendous passions and powerful will  his soul revolted violently from the mean part he had been playing  although he had not succeeded in drawing aspel into the vortex of crime as regards human law he had dragged him very low and especially had fanned the flame of thirst for strong drink which was the youths chiefat least his most dangerousenemy  his thirst was an inheritance from his forefathers but the sin of giving way to itof encouraging it at first when it had no power and then of gratifying it as it gained strength until it became a tyrantwas all his own  aspel knew this and the thought filled him with despair as he sat there with his now scarred and roughened fingers almost tearing out his hair while his bloodshot eyes stared stonily at the blank wall opposite  bones continued to gaze at his companion and to wish with all his heart that he had never met him  he had some time before that made up his mind to put no more temptation in the youths way  he now went a step furtherhe resolved to attempt the task of getting him out of the scrapes into which he had dragged him  but he soon found that the will which had always been so powerful in the carrying out of evil was woefully weak in the unfamiliar effort to do good  still bones had made up his mind to try  with this end in view he proposed a walk in the street the night being fine  aspel sullenly consented  the better to talk the matter over bones proposed to retire to a quiet though not savoury nook by the riverside  aspel objected and proposed a publichouse instead as being more cheerful  just opposite that publichouse there stood one of those grand institutions which are still in their infancy but which we are persuaded will yet take a prominent part in the rescue of thousands of mankind from the curse of strong drink  it was a publichouse without drinka coffeetavern where working men could find a cheap and wholesome meal a cheerful warm and welllit room wherein to chat and smoke and the daily papers without being obliged to swallow firewater for the good of the house  bones looked at the coffeehouse and thought of suggesting it to his companion  he even willed to do so but alas his will in this matter was as weak as the water which he mingled so sparingly with his grog shame which never troubled him much when about to take a vicious course suddenly became a giant and the strong man became weak like a little child  he followed aspel into the publichouse and the result of this first effort at reformation was that both men returned home drunk  it seemed a bad beginning but it was a beginning and as such was not to be despised  when phil and pax reached archangel court aglow with hope and good resolves they found the subjects of their desires helplessly asleep in a corner of the miserable room with mrs bones preparing some warm and wholesome food against the period of their recovery  it was a crushing blow to their newborn hopes  poor little pax had entertained sanguine expectations of the effect of an appeal from phil and lost heart completely  phil was too much cast down by the sight of his friend to be able to say much but he had a more robust spirit than his little friend and besides had strong faith in the power and willingness of god to use even weak and sinful instruments for the accomplishment of his purposes of mercy  afterwards in talking over the subject with his friend sterling the city missionary he spoke hopefully about aspel but said that he did not expect any good could be done until they got him out of his miserable position and away from the society of bones  to his great surprise the missionary did not agree with him in this  of course he said it is desirable that mr aspel should be restored to his right position in society and be removed from the bad influence of bones and we must use all legitimate means for those ends but we must not fall into the mistake of supposing that no good can be done by the almighty to his sinful creatures even in the worst of circumstances  no relatives or friends solicited the prodigal son to leave the swinetroughs or dragged him away  it was god who put it into his heart to say i will arise and go to my father  it was god who gave him power to will and to do  would you then advise that we should do nothing for him and leave him entirely in the hands of god asked phil with an uncomfortable feeling of surprise  by no means replied the missionary  i only combat your idea that no good can be done to him if he is left in his present circumstances  but we are bound to use every influence we can bring to bear in his behalf and we must pray that success may be granted to our efforts to bring him to the saviour  means must be used as if means could accomplish all but means must not be depended on for it is god who giveth us the victory  the most appropriate and powerful means applied in the wisest manner to your friend would be utterly ineffective unless the holy spirit gave him a receptive heart  this is one of the most difficult lessons that you and i and all men have to learn philthat god must be all in all and man nothing whatever but a willing instrument  even that mysterious willingness is not of ourselves for it is god who maketh us both to will and to do of his good pleasure  without me says jesus ye can do nothing  a rejecter of jesus therefore is helpless for good yet responsible  that is hard to understand said phil with a perplexed look  the reverse of it is harder to understand as you will find if you choose to take the trouble to think it out replied the missionary  phil maylands did take the trouble to think it out  one prominent trait in his character was an intense reverence for truthany truth every trutha strong tendency to distinguish between truth and error in all things that chanced to come under his observation but especially in those things which his mother had taught him from earliest infancy to regard as the most important of all  many a passerby did phil jostle on his way to the postoffice that day after his visit to the missionary for it was the first time that his mind had been turned earnestly at least to the subject of gods sovereignty and mans responsibility  too deep by far for boys we hear some reader mutter  and yet that same reader perchance teaches her little ones to consider the great fact that god is one in three  no truth is too deep for boys and girls to consider if they only approach it in a teachable reverent spirit and are brought to it by their teacher in a prayerful spirit  but fear not reader  we do not mean to inflict on you a dissertation on the mysterious subject referred to  we merely state the fact that phil maylands met it at this period of his career and instead of shelving itas perhaps too many doas a too difficult subject which might lie over to a more convenient season tackled it with all the energy of his nature  he went first to his closet and his knees and then to his bible  to the law and to the testimony used to be mrs maylands watchword in all her battles with doubt  to whom shall we go she was wont to say if we go not to the word of god  phil therefore searched the scripture  not being a greek scholar he sought help of those who were learnedboth personally and through books  thus he got at correct renderings and by means of dictionaries ascertained the exact meanings of words  by study he got at what some have styled the general spirit of scripture and by reading both sides of controverted points he ascertained the thoughts of various minds  in this way he at length became fully persuaded in his own mind that gods sovereignty and mans responsibility are facts taught in scripture and affirmed by human experience and that they form a great unsolvable mysteryunsolvable at least by man in his present condition of existence  this not only relieved his mind greatly by convincing him that the subject being bottomless it was useless to try to get to the bottom of it and wise to accept it as a little child but it led him also to consider that in the bible there are two kinds of mysteries or deep thingsthe one kind being solvable the other unsolvable  he set himself therefore diligently to discover and separate the one kind from the other with keen interest  but this is by the way  phils greatest anxiety and care at that time was the salvation of his old friend and former idol george aspel    chapter twenty four  plans and counter plans  one evening phil sat in the sortingroom of the general postoffice with his hand to his headfor the eight oclock mail was starting his head eyes and hands had been unusually active during the past two hours and when the last bundle of letters dropped from his fingers into the mailbags head eyes and hands were aching  a row of scarlet vans was standing under a platform into which mailbags apparently innumerable were being shot  as each of these vans received its quota it rattled off to its particular railway station at the rate which used in the olden time to be deemed the extreme limit of haste haste post haste  the yard began to empty when eight oclock struck  a few seconds later the last of the scarlet vans drove off and about forty tons of letters etcetera were flying from the great centre to the circumference of the kingdom  phil still sat pressing the aching fingers to the aching head and eyes when he was roused by a touch on the shoulder  it was peter pax who had also by that time worked his way upwards in the service  tired phil asked pax  a little but it soon passes off said phil lightly as he rose theres no breathingtime you see towards the close and its the pace that kills in everything  are you going to pegaway hall tonight asked pax because if so ill go with you bein so to speak in a stoodious humour myself  no im not going to study tonightdont feel up to it  besides i want to visit mr blurt  the book he lent me on astronomy ought to be returned and i want to borrow anothercome youll go with me  after exchanging some books at the library in the basement which the man in grey had styled a magnificent institootion the two friends left the postoffice together  old mr blurt is fond of you pax  that shows him to be a man of good taste said pax and his lending you and me as many books as we want proves him a man of good sense  do you know phil it has sometimes struck me that what between our postoffice library and the liberality of mr blurt and a few other friends you and i are rather lucky dogs in the way of literature  we are assented phil  and ought somehow to rise to somethin some time or other said pax  we oughtand will replied the other with a laugh  but do you know continued pax with a sigh ive at last given up all intention of aiming at the postmastergeneralship  indeed pax  yes  it wouldnt suit me at all  you see i was born and bred in the country and cant stand a city life  no my soulsmall though it be is too large for london  the metropolis cant hold me phil  if i were condemned to live in london all my life my spirit would infallibly bust its shell an blow the bricks and mortar around me to atoms  thats strange now it seems to me pax that london is country and town in one  just look at the parks  pooh flat as a pancake  no ups and downs no streams no thickets no wildflowers worth mentioningnothin wild whatever cept the childn returned pax contemptuously  but look at the serpentine and the thames and  bah interrupted pax would you compare the thames with the clear flowing limpid  come now pax dont become poetical it isnt your forte but listen while i talk of matters more important  youve sometimes heard me mention my mother havent you  i havewith feelings of poetical reverence answered pax  well my mother has been writing of late in rather low spirits about her lonely condition in that wild place on the west coast of ireland now mr blurt has been groaning much lately as to his having no female relative to whom he could trust his brother fred  you know he is obliged to look after the shop and to go out a good deal on business during which times mr fred is either left alone or under the care of mrs murridge who though faithful is old and deaf and stupid  miss lillycrop would have been available once but ever since the fire she has been appropriatedalong with tottie bonesby that female trojan miss stivergill and dare not hint at leaving her  its a good thing for her no doubt but its unfortunate for mr fred  now do you see anything in the mists of that statement  ahyesjust so said pax mr blurt wants help mother wants cheerful society  a sickroom aint the perfection of gaiety no doubt but its better than the west coast of irelandat least as depicted by you  yes somethin might come o that  more may come of it than you think pax  you see i want to provide some sort of home for george aspel to come to when we save himfor were sure to save him at last  i feel certain of that said phil with something in his tone that did not quite correspond to his wordsquite certain of that he repeated god helping us  i mean to talk it over with may  they turned as he spoke into the passage which led to mr flints abode  may was at home and she talked the matter over with phil in the boudoir with the small window and the near prospect of brick wall and the photographs of the maylands and the embroidered text that was its occupants sheetanchor  she at once fell in with his idea about getting their mother over to london but when he mentioned his views about her furnishing a house so as to offer a home to his friend aspel she was apparently distressed and yet seemed unable to explain her meaning or to state her objections clearly  oh  phil dear she said at last dont plan and arrange too much let us try to walk so that we may be led by god and not run in advance of him  phil was perplexed and disappointed for may not only appeared to throw cold water on his efforts but seemed unwilling to give her personal aid in the rescue of her old playmate  he was wrong in this  in the circumstances poor may could not with propriety bring personal influence to bear on aspel but she could and did pray for him with all the ardour of a young and believing heart  its a very strange thing continued phil that george wont take assistance from any one  i know that he is in wantthat he has not money enough to buy respectable clothes so as to be able to appear among his old friends yet he will not take a sixpence from menot even as a loan  may did not answer  with her face hid in her hands she sat on the edge of her bed weeping at the thought of her lovers fallen condition poor may  people said that telegraphic work was too hard for her because her cheeks were losing the fresh bloom that she had brought from the west of ireland and the fingers with which she manipulated the keys so deftly were growing very thin  but sorrow had more to do with the change than the telegraph had  it must be pride said her brother  oh  phil she said looking up dont you think that shame has more to do with it than pride  phil stooped and kissed her  sure its that no doubt and im a beast entirely for suggesting pride  supper  hallo in there shouted mr flint thundering at the door dont keep the old ooman waiting  phil and may came forth at once but the former would not remain to supper  he had to visit mr blurt he said and might perhaps sup with him  pax would go with him  well my lads please yourselves said mr flintwheeling the old woman to the table on which smoked a plentiful supply of her favourite sausages  let me take the cat off your lap grannie said may  let the cat be lassie its daein nae ill  are the callants gaein oot  yes grannie said phil we have business to attend to  bizness exclaimed mrs flint  weel weel they lay heavy burdens on ee at that postoffice  night an daynight an day  theyve maist killed my solomon  theyve muckle to answer for  in her indignation she clenched her fist and brought it down on her knee  unfortunately the cat came between the fist and the knee  with its usual remonstrative mew it fled and found a place of rest and refuge in the coalbox  but its not to the postoffice were goin grannie said phil laying his hand kindly on the old womans shoulder  what o that what o that she exclaimed somewhat testily at being corrected has that onything to dae wi the argiment  if ye git yer feet wat bairns mind to chynge theman whatever ye dae  she stopped suddenly  one glance at her placid old countenance sufficed to show that she had retired to the previous century from which nothing now could recall her except sausages  the youths therefore went out  meanwhile mr enoch blurt sat in his brothers back shop entertaining a visitor  the shop itself had for a considerable time past been put under the care of an overgrown boy who mightby courtesy and a powerful stretch of truthhave been styled a young man  jiggshe appeared to have no other namewas simply what men style a born idiot not sufficiently so to be eligible for an asylum but far enough gone to be next to useless  mr blurt had picked him up somewhere in a philanthropic wayno one ever knew how or whereduring one of his many searches after george aspel  poor mr blurt was not happy in his selection of men or boys  four of the latter whom he had engaged to attend the shop and learn the business had been dismissed for rough play with the specimens or making free with the till when a few coppers chanced to be in it  they had failed also to learn the business chiefly because there was no business to learn and mr enoch blurt did not know how to teach it  when he came in contact with jiggs mr blurt believed he had at last secured a prize and confided that belief to mrs murridge  so he had as regards honesty  jiggs was honest to the core but as to other matters he was defectiveto say the least  he could however put up and take down the shutters call mr blurt downstairs if wantedwhich he never was and tell customers when he was out to call againwhich he never did as customers never darkened the door  jiggs however formed a sufficient scarecrow to street boys and thieves  the visitor in the back shopto whom we now returnwas no less a personage than miss gentle whose acquaintance mr blurt had made on board the illfated mail steamer trident  that lady had chanced some weeks before to pass the ornithological shop and looking in was struck dumb by the sight of the neverforgotten fellowpassenger who had made her a confidant  recovering speech she entered the shop and introduced herself  the introduction was needless  mr blurt recognised her at once dropped his paper extended both hands gave her a welcome that brought even jiggs back to the verge of sanity and had her into the back shop whence he expelled mrs murridge to some other and littleknown region of the interior  the interview was so agreeable that mr blurt begged it might be repeated  it was repeated four times  the fifth time it was repeated by special arrangement in the evening for the purpose of talking over a business matter  i fear miss gentle began mr blurt when his visitor was seated in the back shop and mrs murridge had been expelled to the rear as usual and jiggs had been left on guard in the fronti fear that you may think it rude in me to make such a proposal but i am driven to it by necessity andthe fact is i want you to become a nurse  a nurse mr blurt  there now dont take offence  its below your position i dare say but i have gathered from you that your circumstances are notare not not exactly luxurious andin short my poor brother fred is a hopeless invalid  the doctors say he will never be able to leave his bed  ah if those diamonds i once spoke to you about had only been mine still instead of adorning the caves of crabs and fishes miss gentle i would have had halfadozen of the best nurses in london for dear fred but the diamonds are gone  i am a poor man a very poor man miss gentle and i cannot afford a good nurse  at the same time i cannot bear to think of fred being even for a brief period at the mercy of cheap nurses who like other wares are bad when cheapalthough of course there may be a few good ones even among the cheap  what i cannot buy therefore i must beg and i have come to you as one with a gentle and pitiful spirit who may perhaps take an interest in my poor brothers case and agree to help us  having said all this very fast and with an expression of eager anxiety mr blurt blew his nose wiped his bald forehead and laying both hands on his knees looked earnestly into his visitors face  you are wrong mr blurt in saying that the office of nurse is below my position  it is below the position of no one in the land  i may not be very competent to fill the office but i am quite willing to try  my dear madam exclaimed the delighted mr blurt your goodness is but i expected as much  i knew you would  of course he said interrupting himself all the menial work will be done by mrs murridge  you will be only required to fill as it were the part of a daughteroror a sisterto my poor fred  as to salary it will be small very small i fear but there are a couple of nice rooms in the house which will be entirely at your  i quite understand interrupted miss gentle with a smile  we wont talk of these details please until you have had a trial of me and see whether i am worthy of a salary at all  miss gentle returned mr blurt with sudden gravity your extreme kindness emboldens me to put before you another matter of business which i trust you will take into consideration in a purely business lighti am getting old madam  miss gentle acknowledged the truth with a slight bow  and you areexcuse menot young miss gentle  the lady acknowledged this truth with a slighter bow  you would not object to regard me in the light of a brother would you  mr blurt took one of her hands in his and looked at her earnestly  miss gentle looked at mr blurt quite as earnestly and replied that she had no objection whatever to that  still further miss gentle if i were to presume to ask you to regard me in the light of a husband would you object to that  miss gentle looked down and said nothing from which mr blurt concluded that she did not object  she withdrew her hand suddenly however and blushed  there was a slight noise at the door  it was jiggs who with an idiotical stare asked if it was not time to put up the shutters  the plan thus vexatiously interrupted was however ultimately carried into effect  miss gentle regardless of poverty the absence of prospects and the certainty of domestic anxiety agreed to wed mr enoch blurt and nurse his brother  in consideration of the paucity of funds and the pressing nature of the case she also agreed to dispense with a regular honeymoon and to content herself with as it were a honeystar at home  of course the event knocked poor phils little plans on the head for the time being though it did not prevent his resolving to do his utmost to bring his mother to london    chapter twenty five  light shining in dark places  down by the riverside in an outoftheway and unsavoury neighbourhood george aspel and abel bones went one evening into a small eatinghouse to have supper after a day of toil at the docks  it was a temperance establishment  they went to it however not because of its temperance but its cheapness  after dining they adjourned to a neighbouring publichouse to drink  bones had not yet got rid of his remorse nor had he entirely given up desiring to undo what he had done for aspel  but he found the effort to do good more difficult than he had anticipated  the edifice pulled down so ruthlessly was not he found to be rebuilt in a day  it is true the work of demolition had not been all his own  if aspel had not been previously addicted to careless living such a man as bones never could have had the smallest chance of influencing him  but bones did not care to reason deeply  he knew that he had desired and plotted the youths downfall and that downfall had been accomplished  having fallen from such a height and being naturally so proud and self sufficient aspel was proportionally more difficult to move again in an upward direction  bones had tried once again to get him to go to the temperance publichouse and had succeeded  they had supped there once and were more than pleased with the bright cheerful aspect of the place and its respectable and sober yet jolly frequenters  but the cup of coffee did not satisfy their depraved appetites  the struggle to overcome was too much for men of no principle  they were selfwilled and reckless both said whats the use of trying and returned to their old haunts  on the night in question after supping as we have said they entered a publichouse to drink  it was filled with a noisy crew as well as with tobaccosmoke and spirituous fumes  they sat down at a retired table and looked round  god help me muttered aspel in a low husky voice ive fallen very low  ay responded bones almost savagely very low  aspel was too much depressed to regard the tone  the waiter stood beside them expectant  two pints of beer said bonesginger beer he added quickly  yessir  the waiter would have said yessir to an order for two pints of prussic acid if that had been an article in his line  it was all one to him so long as it was paid for  men and women might drink and die they might come and go they might go and not comeothers would come if they didntbut he would go on like the brook for ever supplying the terrible demand  as the gingerbeer was being poured out the door opened and a man with a pack on his back entered  setting down the pack he wiped his heated brow and looked round  he was a mild benignantlooking man with a thin face  opening his box he said in a loud voice to the assembled company who will buy a bible for sixpence  there was an immediate hush in the room  after a few seconds a halfdrunk man with a black eye saidwe dont want no bibles ere weve got plenty of em at ome  bibles is only for sundays  dont people die on mondays and saturdays said the colporteur for such he was  it would be a bad job if we could only have the bible on sundays  gods word says today if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts  jesus christ is the same yesterday today and for ever now is the accepted time now is the day of salvation  it says the same on tuesdays and wednesdays and every day of the week  thats all right enough old fellow said another man but a public is not the right place to bring a bible into  turning to this man the colporteur said quietly does not death come into publichouses  dont people die in publichouses  surely it is right to take the word of god into any place where death comes for after death the judgment  the blood of jesus christ gods son cleanseth us from all sin  come come thatll do  we dont want none of that here said the landlord of the house  very well sir said the man respectfully but these gentlemen have not yet declined to hear me  this was true and one of the men now came forward to look at the contents of the box  another joined him  have you any book thatll teach a man how to get cured of drink asked one who obviously stood greatly in need of such a book  yes i have  here it isthe author of the sinners friend it is a memoir of the man who wrote a little book called the sinners friend said the colporteur producing a thin booklet in paper cover but id recommend a bible along with it because the bible tells of the sinners best friend jesus and remember that without him you can do nothing  he is god and it is god who giveth us the victory  you cant do it by yourself if you try ever so much  the man bought the booklet and a testament  before he left the place that colporteur had sold a fourpenny and a twopenny testament and several other religious works beside distributing tracts gratuitously all round  see report of the christian colportage association for england 1879 page 12  thats what i call carryin the war into the enemys camp remarked one of the company as the colporteur thanked them and went away  come lets go said aspel rising abruptly and draining his glass of gingerbeer  bones followed his example  they went out and overtook the colporteur  are there many men going about like you asked aspel  a good many answered the colporteur  we work upwards of sixty districts now  last year we sold bibles testaments good books and periodicals to the value of 6700 pounds besides distributing more than 300000 tracts and speaking to many people the blessed word of life it is true we have not yet done much in publichouses but as you saw just now it is not an unhopeful field  that branch has been started only a short time ago yet we have sold in publichouses above five hundred bibles and testaments and over five thousand christian books besides distributing tracts  its a queer sort o work said bones  do you expect much good from it  the colporteur replied with a look of enthusiasm that he did expect much good because much had already been done and the promise of success was sure  he personally knew and could name sinners who had been converted to god through the instrumentality of colporteurs men and women who had formerly lived solely for themselves had been brought to jesus and now lived for him  swearers had been changed to men of prayer and praise and drunkards had become sober men  through that little book i suppose asked bones quickly  not altogether but partly by means of it  have you another copy asked george aspel  the man at once produced the booklet and aspel purchased it  what do you mean he said by its being only partly the means of saving men from drink  i mean that there is no saviour from sin of any kind but jesus christ the remedy pointed out in that little book is i am told a good and effective one but without the spirit of god no man has power to persevere in the application of the remedy  he will get wearied of the continuous effort he will not avoid temptation he will lose heart in the battle unless he has a higher motive than his own deliverance to urge him on  why sirs what would you expect from the soldier who in battle thought of nothing but himself and his own safety his own deliverance from the dangers around him  is it not those men who boldly face the enemy with the love of queen and country and comrades and duty strong in their breasts who are most likely to conquer  in the matter of drink the man who trusts to remedies alone will surely fail because the disease is moral as well as physical  the physical remedy will not cure the souls disease but the moral remedythe acceptance of jesus will not only cure the soul but will secure to us that spiritual influence which will enable us to persevere to the end with the physical  thus jesus will save both soul and bodyit is god who giveth us the victory  they parted from the colporteur at this point  what think you of that asked bones  it is strange if truebut i dont believe it replied aspel  well now it appears to me rejoined bones that the man seems pretty sure of what he believes and very reasonable in what he says but i dont know enough about the subject to hold an opinion as to whether its true or false  it might have been well for aspel if he had taken as modest a view of the matter as his companion but he had been educatedthat is to say he had received an average elementary training at an ordinary school and on the strength of that although he had never before given a serious thought to religion and certainly nothing worthy of the name of study he held himself competent to judge and to disbelieve  while they walked towards the city evening was spreading her grey mantle over the sky  the lamps had been lighted and the enticing blaze from ginpalaces and beershops streamed frequently across their path  at the corner of a narrow street they were arrested by the sound of music in quick time and energetically sung  a penny gaff remarked bones referring to a low musichall what dee say to go in  aspel was so depressed just then that he welcomed any sort of excitement and willingly went  whats to pay he asked of the man at the door  nothing its free  thats liberal anyhow observed bones as they pushed in  the room was crowded by people of the lowest ordermen and women in tattered garments and many of them with debauched looks  a tall thin man stood on the stage or platform  the singing ceased and he advanced  bah whispered aspel its a prayermeeting  lets be off  stay returned bones  i know the feller  he comes about our court sometimes  lets hear what hes got to say  friends said mr sterling the city missionary for it was he i hold in my hand the word of god  there are messages in this wordthis biblefor every man and woman in this room  i shall deliver only two of these messages tonight  if any of you want more of em you may come back tomorrow  only two tonight  the first is though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool  the other is it is god who giveth us the victory  bones started and looked at his companion  it seemed as if the missionary had caught up and echoed the parting words of the colporteur  mr sterling had a keen earnest look and a naturally eloquent as well as persuasive tongue  though comparatively uneducated he was deeply read in the book which it was his lifes work to expound and an undercurrent of intense feeling seemed to carry him alongand his hearers along with himas he spoke  he did not shout or gesticulate that made him all the more impressive  he did not speak of himself or his own feelings that enabled his hearers to give undistracted attention to the message he had to deliver  he did not energise  on the contrary it seemed as if he had some difficulty in restraining the superabundant energy that burned within him and as people usually stand more or less in awe of that which they do not fully understand they gave him credit perhaps for more power than he really possessed  at all events not a sound was heard save now and then a suppressed sob as he preached christ crucified to guilty sinners and urged home the two messages with all the force of unstudied language but wellconsidered and aptly put illustration and anecdote  at one part of his discourse he spoke with bated breath of the unrepentant sinners awful danger comparing it to the condition of a little child who should stand in a blazing house with escape by the staircase cut off and no one to delivera simile which brought instantly to boness mind his little tottie and the fire and the rescue by the man he had resolved to ruinay whom he had ruined to all appearance  but there is a deliverer in this case continued the preacher jesus christ came to seek and to save the lost to pluck us all as brands from the burning to save us from the fire of sin of impurity of drink  oh friends will you not accept the saviour  yes yes shouted bones in an irresistible burst of feeling i do accept him  every eye was turned at once on the speaker who stood looking fixedly upwards as though unaware of the sensation he had created  the interruption however was only momentary  thanks be to god said the preacher  there is joy among the angels of heaven over one sinner that repenteth  then not wishing to allow attention to be diverted from his message he continued his discourse with such fervour that the people soon forgot the interrupter and bones forgot them and himself and his friend in contemplation of the great salvation  when the meeting was over he hurried out into the open air  aspel followed but lost him in the crowd  after searching a few minutes without success he returned to archangel court without him  the proud youth was partly subdued though not overcome  he had heard things that night which he had never heard before as well as many things which though heard before had never made such an impression as then  lighting the remnant of the candle in the pintbottle he pulled out the little book which he had purchased and began to read and ever as he read there seemed to start up the words it is god who giveth us the victory  at last he came to the page on which the prescription for drunkards is printed in detail  he read it with much interest and some hope though of course being ignorant of medicine it conveyed no light to his mind  ill try it at all events he muttered in a somewhat desponding tone but ive tried before now to break off the accursed habit without success and have my doubts of this for  he paused for the words it is god that giveth us the victory leaped again to his mind with tenfold power  just then there arose a noise of voices in the court  presently the sound of many footsteps was heard in the passage  the shuffling feet stopped at the door and some one knocked loudly  with a strange foreboding at his heart aspel leaped up and opened it  four men entered bearing a stretcher  they placed it gently on the low trucklebed in the corner and removing the cover revealed the mangled and bloody but still breathing form of abel bones  he seemed to be a bit unhinged in his mind said one of the men in reply to aspels inquiring lookwas seen goin recklessly across the road and got run over  we would ave took im to the hospital but he preferred to be brought here  all right  george said bones in a low voice ill be better in a little  it was an accident  send em away an try if you can find my old girl and tottieit is strange he continued faintly as aspel bent over him that the lady i wanted to rob set me free for totties sake and the boy i cast adrift in london risked his life for tottie and the man i tried to ruin saved her and the man i have often cursed from my door has brought me at last to the sinners friend  strange very strange    chapter twenty six  tells of a sham fight and a real battle  there are periods in the busy round of labour at the great heart in st martinslegrand when some members of the community cease work for a time and go off to enjoy a holiday  such periods do not occur to all simultaneously else would the great postal work of the kingdom come to a deadlock  they are distributed so that the action of the heart never flags even when large drafts are made on the working staff as when a whole battalion of the employes goes out for a fieldday in the garb of volunteers  there are between eight and nine hundred men of the postoffice who not content with carrying her majestys mails voluntarily carry her majestys rifles  these go through the drudgery and drill of military service at odd hours as they find time and on high occasions they march out to the martial strains of fife and drum  on one such occasion the postoffice battalion better known as the 49th middlesex took part in a sham fight which phil maylands and peter pax who chanced to have holidays at the time went out to see  they did not take part in it not being volunteers but they took pride in it as worthy rightspirited men of the post could not fail to do  the 49th middlesex distinguished themselves on that occasion  their appearance as they marched on to the battlegroundsome distance out of londonbore creditable comparison with the best corps in the service so said pax and pax was a good judge being naturally critical  when the fight began and the rattling musketry to say nothing of booming artillery created such a smoke that no unmilitary person could make head or tail of anything the 49th middlesex took advantage of a hollow and executed a flank movement that would have done credit to the 42nd highlanders and even drew forth an approving nod and smile from the reviewing officer who with his cockedhatted staff witnessed the movement from an eminence which was swept by a devastating crossfire from every part of the field  when the artillery were ordered to another eminence to check the movement and dislodge them from the hollow the gallant 49th stood their ground in the face of a fire that would have swept that hollow as with the besom of destruction  they also replied with a continuous discharge that would in five minutes have immolated every man and horse on the eminence  when afterwards a body of cavalry was sent to teach the gallant 49th a lesson and came thundering down on them like a wolf on the fold or an avalanche on a swiss hamlet they formed square with mathematical precision received them with a withering fire that ought to have emptied every saddle and with the bayonets point turned them trooping off to the right and left discomfited  when finally inflated with the pride of victory they began to reform line too soon and were caught in the act by the returning cavalry they flung themselves into rallying squares which bristling with bayonets like porcupines of steel keeping up such an incessant roar of musketry that the spot on which they stood became as it were a heart or core of furious firing in the midst of a field that was already hotly engaged all round  we do not vouch for the correctness of this account of the battle  we received it from pax and give it for what it is worth  oh it was as phil maylands said a glorious day entirely for the 49th middlesex that same queens birthday for there was all the pomp and circumstance of war all the smoke and excitation all the glitter of bright sunshine on accoutrements the flash of sword and bayonet and the smoke and fire of battle without the bloodshed and the loss of life  no doubt there were drawbacks  where is the human family however wellregulated that claims exemption from such  there were some of the warriors on that bloodless battlefield who had no more idea of the art of war than the leg of a telescope has of astronomy  there were many who did not know which were friends and which were foes  many more there were who did not care  some of the volunteer officers though not many depending too much on their sergeants to keep them right drove these sergeants nearly mad  others there were who depending too much on their own genius drove their colonels frantic but by far the greater number both of officers and men knew their work and did it well  yes it was indeed a glorious day entirely that same queens birthday for all arms of the service especially for the 49th middlesex and when that gallant body of men marched from the field of glory with drums beating and fifes shrieking little pax could scarcely contain himself for joy and wished with all his heart that he were drummajor of the corps that he might find vent for his feelings in the bursting of the big drum  now said phil when they had seen the last of the volunteers off the field what shall you and i do  ah true that is the question returned pax what are we to do  our holidays are before us  the day is far spent the evening is at hand we cant bivouac here that is plain  what say you phil to walking over to miss stivergills  i have a general invite from that lady to spend any holidays i have to dispose of at rosebud cottage  it is not more than two miles from where we stand  dye think shed extend her invite to me asked phil dubiously  think exclaimed pax i am sure of it  why that respectable old lady owns a heart that might have been enshrined in a casket of beauty shes a trumpa regular brick  come pax be respectful  aint i respectful you irish noodle  my language maynt be choice indeed but you cant find fault with the sentiment  come along before it gets darker  any friend of mine will be welcome besides i half expect to find your sister there and we shall be sure to see miss lillycrop and my sweet little cousin tottie who has been promoted to the condition of ladiesmaid and companion  ah poor tottie said phil her fathers illness has told heavily on her  thats true returned pax as every vestige of fun vanished from his expressive face and was replaced by sympathy but ive good news for her tonight  since her last visit her father has improved and the doctor says he may yet recover  the fresh air of the new house has done him good  pax referred here to a new residence in a more airy neighbourhood to which bones had been removed through the kindness and liberality of miss stivergill whose respect for the male sex had curiously enough increased from the date of the burglary  with characteristic energy she had removed bones with his wife and a few household goods to a better dwelling near the river but this turned out to be damp and bones became worse in it  she therefore instituted another prompt removal to a more decidedly salubrious quarter  here bones improved a little in health  but the poor mans injury was of a serious nature  ribs had been broken and the lungs pierced  a constitution debilitated by previous dissipation could not easily withstand the shock  his life trembled in the balance  the change however in the mans spirit was marvellous  it had not been the result of sudden calamity or of prolonged suffering  before his accident while in full vigour and in the midst of his sins the drops which melted him had begun to fall like dew  the night when his eyes were opened to see jesus was but the culminating of gods work of mercy  from that night he spoke little but the little he said was to express thankfulness  he cared not to reason  he would not answer questions that were sometimes foolishly put to him but he listened to the word of god read by his poor yet rejoicing wife with eager thirsting looks  when told that he was in danger he merely smiled  georgie he whisperedfor he had reverted to the old original name of his wife which with his proper name of blackadder he had changed on coming to londongeorgie i wish i might live for your sake and his but itll be better to go  were on the same road at last georgie and shall meet again  aspel marked the change and marvelled  he could not understand it at all  but he came to understand it ere long  he had followed bones in his changes of abode because he had formed a strange liking for the man but he refused to associate in any way with his former friends they occasionally visited the sick man but if aspel chanced to be with him at the time he invariably went out by the backdoor as they entered by the front  he refused even to see phil maylands but met pax and seemed not to mind him  at all events he took no notice of him whether his conduct was owing to pride shame or recklessness none could tell  the changes of residence we have referred to had the effect of throwing off the scent a certain gentleman who had been tracking out abel bones with the perseverance though not the success of a bloodhound  the man in grey after losing or rather coming to the end of his clew at the postoffice furnace recovered it by some magical powers known best to himself and his compeers and tracked his victim to archangel court but here he lost the scent again and seemed to be finally baffled  it was well for bones that it so fell out because in his weak state it would probably have gone hard with him had he believed that the police were still on his tracks  as it was he progressed slowly but favourably and with this good news pax and his friend hurried to rosebud cottage  what an unmitigated blessing a holiday is to those who work hard  ah ye lazy ones of earth if ye gain something by unbounded leisure ye lose much  staywe will not preach on that text  it needs not  to return phil and pax found tottie and may at the rosebud as they had anticipatedthe latter being free for a time on sickleaveand the four went in for a holiday as pax put it neck and crop  it may occur to some that there was somewhat of incongruity in the companionship of tottie and may but the difference between the poor mans daughter who had been raised to comparative affluence and the gentlemans daughter who had been brought down to comparative poverty was not so great as one might suppose  it must be remembered that tottie had started life with a godfearing mother and that of itself secured her from much contamination in the midst of abounding evil while it surrounded her with a rich influence for good  then latterly she had been mentally morally and physically trained by miss lillycrop who was a perfect pattern of propriety delicacy good sense and good taste  she first read to her pupil and then made the pupil read to her  miss lillycrops range of reading was wide and choice thus tottie who was naturally refined and intelligent in time became more so by education  she had grown wonderfully too and had acquired a certain sedateness of demeanour which was all the more captivating that it was an utterly false index to her character for totties spirit was as wildly exuberant as that of the wildest denizen of archangel court  in like manner pax had been greatly improved by his association with phil maylands  the vigorous strength of phils mind had unconsciously exercised a softening influence on his little admirer  we have said that they studied and read together  hence pax was learned beyond his years and station  the fitness therefore of the four to associate pleasantly has we think been clearly made out  pax at all events had not a shadow of a doubt on that point especially when the four lay down under the shadow of a spreading oak to examine the butterflies and moths they had captured in the fields  what babies we are said phil to go after butterflies in this fashion  speak for yourself retorted pax i consider myself an entomologist gathering specimens  call em specimens phil that makes a world of differenceoh tot what a splendid one you have got there  it reminds me so of the time when i used to carry you about the fields on my back and call you merry  dont you remember  no said tottie i dont  and wont you let me call you merry pleaded pax  no i wont  i dont believe you ever carried me on your back or that my name was merry  what an unbeliever exclaimed pax  you cant deny that you are merry today tot said may  tot did not deny it but so to speak admitted it by starting up and giving sudden chase to a remarkably bright butterfly that passed at the moment  and dont you remember resumed pax when she returned and sat down again by his side the day when we caught the enormous spider which i kept in a glass box where it spun a net and caught the flies i pushed into the box for it to feed on  no  nor the black beetle we found fighting with another beetle which i tried to impress on you was its grandmother and you laughed heartily as if you really understood what i said though you didnt  you remember that surely  no  well well these joys were thrown away on you for you remember nothing  o yes i do remember something cried tottie  i remember when you fell into the horsepond and came out dripping and covered from head to foot with mud and weeds  she followed up this remark with a merry laugh which was suddenly checked by a shrill and terrible cry from the neighbouring field  in order to account for this cry we must state that miss lillycrop desirous of acquiring an appetite for dinner by means of a short walk left rosebud cottage and made for the dell in which she expected to meet may maylands and her companions  taking a short cut she crossed a field  short cuts are frequently dangerous  it proved so in the present instance  the field she had invaded was the private preserve of an old bull with a sour temper  beholding a female he lowered his horrid head cocked his tail and made at her  this it was that drew from poor miss lillycrop a yell such as she had not uttered since the days of infancy  phil maylands was swift to act at all times of emergency  he vaulted the fence of the field and rushed at miss lillycrop as if he himself had been a bull of bashan and meant to try his hand at tossing her not an idea had phil as to what he meant to do  all he knew was that he had to rush to the rescue  between phil and the bull the poor lady seemed to stand a bad chance  not a whit less active or prompt was peter pax but peter had apparently more of method in his madness than phil for he wrenched up a stout stake in his passage over the fence  lie down lie down  o lie down shouted phil in agony for he saw that the brute was quickly overtaking its victim  poor miss lillycrop was beyond all power of selfcontrol  she could only fly  fortunately a hole in the field came to her rescue  she put her foot into it and fell flat down  the bull passed right over her and came face to face with phil as it pulled up partly in surprise no doubt at the sudden disappearance of miss lillycrop and at the sudden appearance of a new foe  before it recovered from its surprise little pax brought the paling down on its nose with such a whack that it absolutely sneezedor something like itthen roaring rushed at pax  as if he had been a trained matador pax leaped aside and brought the paling down again on the bulls head with a smash that knocked it all to splinters  dont dodge it shouted phil draw it away from her  pax understood at once  tempting the bull to charge him again he ran off to the other side of the field like a greyhound followed by the foaming enemy  meanwhile phil essayed to lift miss lillycrop who had swooned on his shoulders  fortunately she was light  still it was no easy matter to get her limp form into his arms  with a desperate effort he got her on his knee with an inelegant hitch he sent her across his shoulder where she hung like a limp bolster as he made for the fence  may and tottie stood there rooted to the earth in horror  to walk on uneven ground with such a burden was bad enough but phil had to run  how he did it he never could tell but he reached the fence at last and shot miss lillycrop over into the arms of her friends and all three were sent headlong down into a thick bush  phil turned at once to run to the aid of pax but there was no occasion to do so  that youth had reached and leaped the fence like an acrobat and was now standing on the other side of it making faces at the bull calling it names and insulting it with speeches of the most refined insolence by way of relieving his feelings and expressing his satisfaction    chapter twenty seven  the greatest battle of all  time advanced apace and wrought many of those innumerable changes in the fortunes of the human race for which time is famous  among other things it brought sir james clubley to the birdshop of messrs blurt one christmas eve  my dear sir said sir james to mr enoch in the back shop through the halfclosed door of which the owl could be seen gazing solemnly at the pelican of the wilderness i have called to ask whether you happen to have heard anything of young aspel of late  nothing whatever replied mr blurt with a sad shake of his head since bones diedthe man you know with whom he livedhe has removed to some new abode and no one ever hears or sees anything of him except mrs bones  he visits her occasionally as i believe you are aware but refuses to give her his address  she says however that he has given up drinkthat the dying words of her husband had affected him very deeply  god grant it may be so for i love the youth  i join your prayer mr blurt said sir james who was slightly though perhaps unconsciously pompous in his manner  my acquaintance with him has been slightin fact only two letters have passed between usbut i entertained a strong regard for his father who in schoolboy days saved my life  in after years he acquired that passion for spirits which his son seems to have inherited and giving up all his old friends went to live on a remote farm in the west of ireland  sir james spoke slowly and low as if reflectively with his eyes fixed on the ground  in one of the letters to which i have referred he continued looking up young aspel admitted that he had fallen and expressed regret in a few words which were evidently sincere but he firmly though quite politely declined assistance and wound up with brief yet hearty thanks for what he called my kind intentions and especially for my expressions of regard for his late father who he said had been worthy of my highest esteem  hes a strange characterbut how did you manage to get a letter conveyed to him asked mr blurt  through mrs bones  you are aware i think that a considerable time ago i set a detective to find out his whereabouts  how strange  so did i said mr blurt  indeed exclaimed sir james  well this man happened by a strange coincidence to be engaged in unravelling a mystery about a lost little dog which after many failures led him to the discovery of abel bones as being a burglar who was wanted  poor bones happened at the time of his visit to be called before a higher tribunal  he was dying  aspel was at his bedside and the detective easily recognised him as the youth of whom he had been so long in search  i sent my letter by the detective to mrs bones who gave it to aspel  his reply came of course through the ordinary channelthe post  and what do you now propose doing asked mr blurt  i think of going to see philip maylands who i am given to understand by miss lillycrop was once an intimate friend of aspel  do you happen to know his address  yes he lives with his mother now but its of no use your going to his home tonight  you are aware that this is christmas eve and all the officials of the postoffice will be unusually busy  they often work night and day at this season  then i will go direct to the general postoffice  perhaps i shall be able to exchange a few words with him there said sir james rising  at that moment there burst upon the ears of the visitor a peculiar squall which seemed to call forth a bland and beaming smile on the glad countenance of mr blurt  sir james looked at him inquiringly  my babe sir james said mr blurt with illconcealed pride since last i had the pleasure of seeing you i have been married  ah  sir james it is not good for man to be alone  that is a truth with which i was but feebly impressed until i came to understand the blessedness of the wedded state  words cannot  he was cut short by a sudden crash of something overhead and a bump followed by a squall of unwonted vehemence  the squall was simultaneous with the ringing of a handbell and was followed by the cry of a soft entreating voice roused to excitation  oh  nockie dearthus the former miss gentle named her spousecome here quickoh do be quick  babys fallen and freds ringing  the truth of this was corroborated by another furious ring by the invalid which mingled with the recurring squalls and was increased by the noisy and pertinacious clatter of the cracked bell that announced the opening of the shopdoor  zounds  mrs murridge mind the shopgoodbye sir james  excuse coming dear  mr blurt glaring as he clutched his scant side locks dashed upstairs with the agility of a schoolboy  sir james clubley who was a bachelor left the place with a quiet smile and proceeded at what we may style a reflective pace towards the city  but sir james might have saved himself the trouble  it was as we have said christmas eve and he might as well have demanded audience of a soldier in the heat of battle as of a postoffice official on that trying night of the year  in modern times the tendency of the human race the british part of it at least to indulge in social intercourse by letter and otherwise at the christmas season has been on the increase and since the introduction of cheap postage it has created a pressure on the postoffice which has taxed its powers very considerably  the advent of halfpenny postcards and especially the invention of christmascard and packet correspondence with the various facilities which have of late years been afforded to the public by the department have created such a mass of intercommunication throughout the kingdom that christmas has now to be regularly prepared for as a great fieldday or rather a grand campaign extending over several days  wellplanned arrangements have to be made beforehand  contingencies and possibilities have to be weighed and considered  all the forces of the department have to be called out or rather called in  provisionsactual food of exceptional kind and quantityhave to be provided and every man boy nerve muscle eye hand brain and spirit has to be taxed to the very uttermost to prevent defeat  on the particular year of which we write symptoms of the coming struggle began to be felt before christmas eve  on the morning of the 23rd the enemyif we may so style the lettersbegan to come in like a flood and the whole of that day the duty was most pressing although the reserve forces had been called into action  on the morning of the 24th the strain was so severe that few men could be allowed to leave the office though some of them had been at work for eighteen hours  during the whole of the 24th the flood was at its height  every available man in the other branches whose services could be utilised was pressed into the service of the circulation department at st martinslegrand  the great mouth under the portico was fed with a right royal feast that dayworthy of the christmas season  the subsidiary mouths elsewhere were fed with similar liberality  through these letters cards packets parcels poured rushed leaped roared into the great sortinghall  floods is a feeble word a highland spate is but a wishywashy figure wherewith to represent the deluge  a beehive an anthill were weak comparisons  nearly two thousand men energised body soul and spiritin that hall that christmastide and an aggregate of fifteen thousand eight hundred and seventynine hours work was accomplished by them  they faced stamped sorted carried bundled tied bagged and sealed without a moments intermission for two days and two nights continuously  it was a great a tremendous battle  the easygoing public outside knew and cared little or nothing about the conflict which themselves had caused  letters were heaped on the tables and strewed on the floors  letters were carried in baskets in bags in sacks and poured out like water  the men and boys absolutely swam in letters  eager activitybut no blind hastewas characteristic of the gallant two thousand  they felt that the honour of her majestys mails depended on their devotion and that was no doubt dearer to them than life  so the first day wore on and the warriors stood their ground and kept the enemy at bay  as the evening of the 24th drew on apace and the ordinary pressure of the evening mail began to be added to the extraordinary pressure of the day the real tug of war began  the demand for extra service throughout the country began to exercise a reflex influence on the great centre mails came from the country in some instances with the letters unsorted thus increasing the difficulties of the situation  the struggle was all the more severe that preparations for the night despatch were begun with a jaded force some of the men having already been twentysix and twentyeight hours at work  moreover frost and fog prevailed at the time and that not only delayed trains and the arrival of mails but penetrated the building so that the labour was performed in a depressing atmosphere  to meet the emergency at least in part the despatch of the usual eight oclock mail was delayed for that night fifty minutes as in actual war an hours delay may be fraught with tremendous issues for good or ill so this brief postal delay permitted the despatch of an enormous amount of correspondence that would have otherwise been left over to the following day  usually the despatch of the evening mail leaves the vast sortinghall in serene repose with clean and empty tables but on the night of this great battlewhich has to be refought every christmasthe embarrassment did not cease with the despatch of the evening mail correspondence continued to flow on in as great a volume as before  squads of the warriors however withdrew at intervals from the fight to refresh themselves in the various kitchens of the basement  as we have said elsewhere the members of the postoffice provide their own food and there are caterers on the premises who enable them to do so without leaving the office while on duty  but on this occasion extra and substantial foodmeat bread tea coffee and cocoawere provided by the department at its own cost besides which the men were liberally and deservedly remunerated for the whole severe and extra duty  it chanced that phil maylands and peter pax retired from the battle about the same time and met in the sorters kitchen  well old fellow said phil who was calm and steady but looking fagged to pax who was dishevelled about the head and dress and somewhat roused by the exciting as well as fatiguing nature of the workwell old fellow tough work isnt it  tough  its glorious said pax seating himself enthusiastically at the table im proud of my countryproud of the gpoproud  i say is that beef that i see before me  hand me a daggerno a knife will do  you cut it phil and help me first cause im little  while phil was cutting the meat pax rested his head on the table and was asleep almost instantly  hallo pax rouse yourself cried phil giving his comrade a hearty slap on the shoulder up lad and eatthe battle still rages no rest allowed till victory is ours  his little friend set to work at once and the food and coffee soon banished drowsiness  a number of men were similarly engaged around him but they did not feast long  like giants refreshed they returned to the scene of combat while others took their places  and what a scene it was  despite all that had been done the hall might be described as waistdeep in letters  the fever had not yet abated it seemed as if the whole world had concentrated its literary produce into one mighty avalanche on st martinslegrand  the midnight mails worked off some of this but a large portion of it still remained to be disposed of on christmasday together with what the mails brought in on that morning but the officers worked so well that between nine and ten on christmas morning all were allowed to go home with the exception of twentysix who volunteered to remain  thus the battle was fought and won the tables were cleared the fever was subdued and the pulse of the postoffice was reduced to its normal condition  think on these things reader when next you read the little card that wishes you a merry christmas  some of the facts and results connected with this great battle are worth recording  the number of extra bags and sacks received at the chief office altogether on that occasion was 1401  the number of extra bags despatched was 2269 all of them were crammed full to their mouths and the aggregate weight of these extra mails was 197 tons  to convey these from the chief office 176 extra vans were used and 75 extra carts  as nearly as could be estimated the number of extra letters and packets was not less than four millions  there was a vast increase also in the registered correspondenceto the extent of thirtyone thousand in excess of the ordinary numbers  during these three days some of the men did nearly thirty hours extra duty besides performing their ordinary work  the continuous attendance at the office of some of them varied from forty to fortyeight hours and the total increase to the revenue on that auspicious but trying occasion was estimated to be about twenty thousand pounds sterling  phil maylands and peter pax were among those who had volunteered to remain after the press of work was over and it was not till the afternoon of christmasday that they finally and simultaneously plunged into their beds and oblivion    chapter twenty eight  the storming of rocky cottage and other matters  years flew by  the daily routine at st martinslegrand went on the mails departed and came in with unvarying regularity in the working of the vast machine good men and boys rose to the surface and bad ones went down  among the former were phil maylands and peter pax  the latter in course of time rose to the rank of inspector in which condition he gradually developed a pretty pair of brown whiskers and a wonderful capacity for the performance of duty  he also rose to the altitude of five feet six inches at which point he stuck fast and continued the process of increase laterally  pax however could not become reconciled to city life  he did his work cheerfully and with all his might because it was his nature so to do but he buoyed up his spiritsso he was wont to sayby fixing his eye on the postmastergeneralship and a suburban villa on the thames  his friend phil on the contrary was quite pleased with city life and devoted himself with such untiring energy to his work and to his own education that he came ere long to be noted as the youth who knew everything  faults he had undoubtedly and his firm severe way of expressing his opinions raised him a few enemies in the postoffice but he attained at last to the condition of being so useful and so trustworthy as to make men feel that he was almost indispensable  they felt as if they could not get on without him  when man or boy comes to this point success is inevitable  phil soon became a favourite with the heads of departments  the chief of the postoffice himself at last came to hear of him and finding that he was more than capable of passing the requisite examinations he raised him from the ranks and made him a clerk in the savingsbank department  having attained to this position with a good salary for a single man and a prospect of a steady rise phil set about the accomplishment of the darling wish of his heart  he obtained leave of absence went over to the west of ireland and took rocky cottage by storm  mother dear he said almost before he had sat down im promoted im richcomparatively  ive taken a housea small houseat nottinghill and your room in it is ready for you so pack up at once for we leave this tomorrow afternoon  you jest phil  im in earnest mother  but it is impossible said the good lady looking anxiously round i cannot pack up on so short notice  and the furniture  its all arranged mother said phil stroking the curls of a strapping boy who no longer went by the name of baby but was familiarly known as jim  being aware of your desire to get rid of the furniture i have arranged with a man in howlin cove to take it at a valuation he comes out to value it this evening so youve nothing to do but pack up your trunks  with the aid of madge and jim well manage that in no time  sure well do it in less than no time cried jim who was a true son of erin  you see mother continued phil my leave extends only to four days i have therefore ordered a coacha sort of noahs arkthe biggest thing i could hire at the coveto take you and all your belongings to the railway tomorrow evening  well travel all night and so get to london on thursday  may expects you  may and i have settled it all so you neednt look thunderstruck  if i hadnt known for certain that youd be glad to come and live with us i would not have arranged it at all  if i had not known equally well that your fluttering bird of a heart would have been totally upset at the prospect i would have consulted you beforehand  as it is the die is cast  your fate is fixed  nothing can reverse the decrees that have gone forth so its as well to make your mind easy and go to work  mrs maylands wisely submitted  three days afterwards she found herself in london in a very small but charming cottage in an outoftheway corner of nottinghill  it was a perfect bijou of a cottage very smallonly two stories with ceilings that a tall man could touch and a trelliswork porch at the front door and a little garden all to itself and an ivy wall that shut out the curious public but did not interfere with the sky a patch of which gleamed through between two great palatial residences hard by like a benignant eye  this is our new home mother and we have got it at such a low rent from sir james clubley our landlord that your income coupled with mays salary and mine will enable us easily to make the two ends meet if we manage economically  as he spoke phil seized the poker and with an utter disregard of the high price of coal caused the fire to roar joyously up the chimney  it was a brilliant winter day  white gems sparkled on the branches of the trees and jim was already commencing that course of romping which had up to that date strewn his path through life with wreck and ruin madge was investigating the capabilities of cupboards and larders under the care of a small maidofallwork  may wont be home till after dark said phil  she could not get away from duty to meet us  i shall telegraph to her that we have arrived and that i shall meet her under the portico of the postoffice and fetch her home this evening  it is an amazing thing that telegraph  to think that one can send messages and make appointments so quickly remarked mrs maylands  why mother said phil with a laugh that is nothing to what can beand isdone with it every day  i have a friend in the city who does a great part of his business with india by telegraph  the charge is four shillings and sixpence a word and if a word has more than ten letters it is charged as two words  a registered address also costs a guinea so you see telegraphic correspondence with india is expensive business men have therefore fallen on the plan of writing out lists of words each of which means a longish sentence  this plan is so thoroughly carried out that books like thick dictionaries are now printed and regularly usedwhat would you think now of obstinate kangaroo for a message  i would think it nonsense phil  nevertheless mother it covers sense  a quebec timbermerchant telegraphed these identical words the other day to a friend of mine and when the friend turned up the words obstinate kangaroo in his corresponding code he found the translation to be demand is improving for ohio or michigan white oak planks 16 inches and upwards  you dont say so exclaimed mrs maylands raising both hands and eyebrows  yes i do mother and in my city friends code the word blazing means quality is approved while blissful signifies what is the smallest quantity you require  do you mean phil asked the widow with a perplexed look that if i were a man of business and wanted to ask a customer in india what was the smallest quantity of a thing he required i should have to telegraph only the word blissful  only that mother  a blissful state of brevity to have come to isnt it  and some of the telegraph clerks fall into queer mistakes too owing to their ignorance  one of the rules is that the words sent must be bona fide wordsnot a mere unmeaning arrangement of letters  my city friend told me that on three different occasions telegrams of his were refused because the words were not known yet each of them was taken from the bible  one of the telegrams was blastus unholy  oh phil how can you exclaimed mrs maylands with a shocked look  well mother whats wrong in that  you know very well phil that blast us is not in the bible at all and that it is a very awful species of slang swearing  so the telegraph clerk thought returned phil but when my city friend pointed out that blastus was the kings chamberlain they were obliged to let the telegram go  blastus stands for superior quality and unholy for offer is open for three days from time of despatch of telegram  using the same code if a merchant wants to ask a calcutta friend the questionhow is the coming crop as regards extent and appearance he merely telegraphs the word hamlet  if he wishes to say bills of lading go forward by this mail invoices will follow he has only to telegraph heretic  for the most part the compilers of these codes seem to have used the words arbitrarily for the word ellwood has no visible connection with the words blue velvet which it represents neither is there connection between doves and french brandy nor between collapse and scotch coals though there does seem to have been a gleam of significance when they fixed on downward to represent irish whisky  thats true phil there was a touch of sense there if not sarcasm said the widow heartily for she was an abhorrer of strong drink  then mother think of the saving of time accomplished by the telegraph  in days not long past if a merchant in india wished to transact business with another in new york he had to write a letter which took months to make the voyage out and his correspondent had to write a reply which took about the same time to return  now not long ago the head of an indian house wanted a shipload of something i forget what from new york  he telegraphed a few unconnected words to my city friend in london  if there had been no obstruction of any kind the message could have been flashed from bombay to london in a few seconds as it was it made the journey in three hours  my friend who received it in the forenoon telegraphed to new york transacted the business received a reply from new york and telegraphed back to bombay that the order was given and in process of execution before five pm on the same day  thus a commercial transaction between india and america via england involving perhaps thousands of pounds was completed at the cost of a few pounds between breakfast and dinner  in other words bombay aroused new york to action by means of a flash of electricity within twentyfour hours  phil remarked mrs maylands with a sigh dont you think that man has now made almost all the discoveries that it is possible to make  why no mother i think he is only on the threshold of discovery yet the thought has sometimes come into my mind with tremendous power that as god is infinite and his knowledge infinite there is as it were a necessity that we shall go on learning something new for everbut that is too deep a subject to enter on just now said phil rising for i must go and send off my telegram to mayshe will be anxious to hear about you poor girl  you must not be troubled when you see how the roses have faded from her cheeks  she is in good enough health but i fear the telegraph service is too heavy for her and the city air is not so bracing as that of the west of ireland  mrs maylands was quite prepared for the change referred to for she knew what phil did not know that it was neither the telegraph nor the city that had robbed may of the bloom of youth and health    chapter twenty nine  describes an interview and a rencontre  one frosty winter afternoon sir james clubley sat in his chambers having finished dinner and toasted his toes while he sipped his wine and glanced languidly over the times  sir james was a lazy goodnatured man in what is sometimes styled easy circumstances  being lazy and having nothing to do he did nothing nothing that is in the way of work  he found the world enjoyable and enjoyed it  he never ran to excessin truth he never ran at all either literally or figuratively but always ate drank slept read and amused himself in moderation  in politics being nothing in particular he was wont to say he was a liberalconservative if anything as that happy medium in which truth is said though not proved to lie enabled him to agree with anybody  everybody liked him except perhaps a few fiery zealots who seemed uncertain whether to regard him with indignation pity or contempt  it mattered not to which feeling the zealots leaned sir james smiled on them all alike  that foolish fellow is going to be late he muttered glancing over his paper at the clock on the chimneypiece  the foolish fellow referred to was george aspel  sir james had at last discovered and had an interview with him  he had offered to aid him in any way that lay in his power but aspel had firmly though gratefully declined aid in any form  sir james liked the youth and had begged him by letter to call on him for the purpose of chatting over a particular piece of business had appointed an hour and now awaited his arrival  the muttered remark had just passed sir jamess lips when there came a tap at the door and aspel stood before him  but how changed from what he was when we last saw him reader  his aspect might have forcibly recalled the words was lost and is found  his tall broad frame stood erect again as of old but the proud bearing of the head was gone  there was the same fearless look in his bright blue eye but the slightly selfsatisfied curl of the lip was not there he looked as strong and well as when on the irish cliffs he had longed for the free wild life of the seakings but he did not look so youthful yet the touch of sadness that now rested at times on his countenance gave him a far more regal airthough he knew it notthan he ever possessed before  he was dressed in a simple suit of dark grey  glad to see you aspel thought you were going to fail me  sit down now come i hope you have considered my proposal favourablythe piece of business i asked you to come about is nothing more than to offer you again that situation and to press it on you  it would just suit a man of your powerswhat  no  the baronet frowned for george aspel had smiled slightly and shaken his head as he sat down  forgive me sir james if i seem to regard your kind proposals with indifference  indeed i am sincerely grateful especially for the motive that actuates youi mean regard for my dear fathers memory  how do you know sir interrupted sir james testily that this is my only motive  i did not say it was your only motive sir james  i cannot doubt from your many expressions of kindness that personal regard for myself influences you but i may not accept the situation you offer mebright with future prospects though it bebecause i feel strongly that god has called me to another sphere of action  i have now been for a considerable time and hope to be as long as i live a missionary to the poor  what  a city missionary  one of those fellows who go about in seedy black garments with long lugubrious faces exclaimed sir james in amazement  some of them do indeed wear seedy black garments replied aspel under some strange hallucination i suppose that it is their duty to appear like clergymen and i admit that they would look infinitely more respectable in sober and economical grey tweeds but you must have seen bad specimens of the class of men if you think their faces long and lugubrious  i know many of them whose faces are round and jovial and whose spirits correspond to their faces  no doubt they are sometimes sad  your own face would lengthen a little sir james if you went where they go and saw what they sometimes see  i dare say you are right  well but have you seriously joined this body of men  not officially  iihesitate to offer myself becausethat is to say i am a sort of freelance just now  but my young friend returned sir james slowly i understand that city missionaries preach and usually have a considerable training in theology now it is not very long ago since you were aexcuse meii shrink from hurting your feelings but  a drunkard sir james said aspel looking down and blushing crimson state the naked truth  i admit it with humiliation and sorrow but to the everlasting praise of god i can say that jesus christ has saved me from drink  surely that being the case i am in some degree fitted to speak of the great remedythe good physicianto the thousands who are perishing in this city from the effects of drink even though i be not deeply versed in theology  to save men and women from what i have suffered by exhorting and inducing them to come to the saviour is all my aimit is now my chief ambition  sir james looked inquiringly at the fire and shook his head  he was evidently not convinced  there is truth in what you say aspel but by taking this course you sacrifice your prospects entirelyat least in this life  on the contrary sir james i expect by taking this course to gain all that in this life is worth living for  ah  i see you have become religiously mad said sir james with a perplexed look well aspel you must take your own way for i am aware that it is useless to reason with madmen yet i cannot help expressing my regret that a young fellow of your powers should settle down into a moping melancholy wouldbe reformer of drunkards  to this aspel replied with a laugh  why sir james he said do i look very moping or melancholy  if so my looks must belie my spirit for i feel very much the reverse and from past experiencewhich is now considerablei expect to have a great deal of rejoicing in my work for it does not all consist in painful strivings with unrepentant men and women  occasionally men in our position know something of that inexpressible joy which results from a grateful glance of the eye or a strong squeeze of the hand from some one whom we have helped to pluck from the very edge of hell  it is true i do not expect to make much money in my profession but my master promises me sufficient and a man needs no more  but even if much money were essential there is no doubt that i should get it for the silver and gold of this world are in the hands of my father  where do you work asked sir james abruptly  chiefly in the neighbourhood of archangel court  it was there i fell and sinned it was there my saviour rescued me it is there i feel bound to labour  very well i wont press this matter further said the baronet rising but remember if you ever get into a better frame of mind i shall be happy to see you  profound and various were the thoughts of the reformed drunkard that afternoon as he left his friends abode and walked slowly towards the city  there was a strange feeling of sadness in his heart which he could not account for  it was not caused by the sacrifice of worldly good he had just made for that had cost him no effort  the desire to rescue the perishing had been infused so strongly into his soul that he had become quite regardless of mere temporal advancement  neither had he been unfaithful as far as he could remember in the recent conversationat least not in words  the hopes and joys which he had truly referred to ought to have been as strong as ever within him nevertheless his spirit was much depressed  he began to think of the position from which he had fallen and of the great amount of good he might have done for christ in a higher sphere of societybut this thought he repelled as a recurrence of pride  as he came to st martinslegrand he stopped and forgetting the bustling crowd of people buses cabs and carts by which he was surrounded allowed his mind to wander into the past  it was on the broad steps of the postoffice that he had been first led astray by the man who wished to compass his ruin but who was eventually made the willing instrument in bringing about his salvation  he thought of the scowling look and clenched fist of poor bones as he had stood there long ago under the grand portico  he thought of the same man on his sickbed with clasped hands and glittering eyes thanking god that he had been brought to the gates of death by an accident that his eyes and heart had been opened to see and accept jesus and that he had still power left to urge his friend george aspel to come to jesus the sinners refuge  he thought also of the burglars death and of the fading away of his poor wife who followed him to the grave within the year  he thought of the orphan tottie who had been adopted and educated by miss stivergill and was by that time as pretty a specimen of budding womanhood as any one could desire to see with the strong will and courage of her father and the selfsacrificing trusting gentleness of her mother  but above and beyond and underlying all these thoughts his mind kept playing incessantly round a fair form which he knew was somewhere engaged at that moment in the building at his side manipulating a threekeyed instrument with delicate fingers which he longed to grasp  ah it is all very well for a man to resolve to tear an idol from his heart it is quite another thing to do it  george aspel had long ago given up all hope of winning may maylands  he not only felt that one who had fallen so low as he and shown such a character for instability had no right to expect any girl to trust her happiness to him but he also felt convinced that may had no real love for him and that it would be unmanly to push his suit even although he was now delivered from the power of his great enemy  he determined therefore to banish her as much as possible from his mind and in furtherance of his purpose had conscientiously kept out of her way and out of the way of all his former friends  heaving a little sigh as he dismissed her for the tenthousandth time from his mind he was turning his back on the postofficethat precious casket which contained so rich but unattainable a jewelwhen he remembered that he had a letter in his pocket to post  turning back he sprang up the steps  the great mouth was not yet wide open  the evening feedinghour had not arrived and the lips were only in their normal conditionslightly parted  having contributed his morsel to the insatiable giant aspel turned away and found himself face to face with phil maylands  it was not by any means their first meeting since the recovery of aspel but as we have said the latter had kept out of the way of old friends and phil was only partially excepted from the rule  the very man i wanted to see cried phil with gleaming eyes as he seized his friends hand  ive got mother over to london at last shes longing to see you  come out with me this eveningdo  but im in sudden perplexity ive just been sent for to do some extra duty  it wont take me half an houryoure not engaged are you  well nonot particularly  then youll do me a favour im sure you will  youll mount guard here for half an hour wont you  i had appointed to meet may here this evening to take her home and when she comes shell not know why i have failed her unless you  my dear phil i would stay with all my heart said aspel hastily butbutthe fact isive not seen may for a long time and  why what on earth has that to do with it asked phil in some surprise  you are right returned aspel with a deprecating smile that has nothing to do with it  my wits are woolgathering phil  go i will mount guard  phil was gone in a moment and aspel leaned his head on his arm against one of the pillars of the portico  he had scarcely breathed a prayer for guidance when may approached  she stopped abruptly flushed slightly and hesitated a moment then advancing with the hearty air of an old playmate she frankly held out her hand  this was enough for aspel  he had been depressed before he was in the depths of despair now  if may had only shown confusion or shyness or anything but freeandeasy goodwill hope might have revived but he was evidently nothing more to her than the old playmate  hope therefore died and with its death there came over aspel the calm subdued air of a crushed but resigned man  he observed her somewhat worn face and his heart melted  he resolved to act a brothers part to her  im so glad to meet you at last may he said returning the kindly grasp of the hand with interest but quite in a brotherly way  you might have seen me long ago  why did you not come  we would all have been so glad to see you  may blushed decidedly as she made this reply but the shades of evening were falling  moreover the pillar near to which they stood threw a deep shadow over them and aspel did not observe it  he therefore continuedin a quiet brotherly way  ah  may it is cruel of you to ask that  you know that i have been unfit  nay i did not mean that interrupted may with eager anxiety i meant that sincesincelately you knowwhy did you not come  true may i might have come latelypraise be to godbut butwhy should i not speak out  its all over now  you know the love i once bore you may which you told me i must not speak of and which i have tried to cure with all the energy of my heart for i do not want to lose you as a sisteran old playmate at leastthough i may not have you asbut as i said its all over now  i promise never again to intrude this subject on you  let me rather tell you of the glorious work in which i am at present engaged  he stopped for in spite of his efforts to be brotherly there was a sense of sinking at his heart which slightly embittered his tone  is true love then so easily cured  may looked up in his face as she asked the question  there was something in the look and in the tone which caused george aspels heart to beat like a sledgehammer  he stooped down and looking into her eyesstill in a brotherly way said  is it possible may that you could trifle with my feelings  no it is not possible she answered promptly  oh  may continued aspel in a low earnest tone if i could only dare to thinkto believeto hope that  forgive me may im so sorry cried her brother phil as he sprang up the steps i did my best to hurry through with it  im afraid ive kept you and george waiting very long  not at all replied may with unquestionable truth  if you could have only kept us waiting five minutes longer thought aspel but he only saidcome along phil ill go home with you tonight  the evening was finefrosty and clear  shall we walk to nottinghill asked phil  its a longish tramp for you may but thats the very thing you want  may agreed that it was a desirable thing in every point of view and george aspel did not object  as they walked along the latter began to wonder whether a new experiment had been made lately in the way of paving the streets with indiarubber  as for may she returned such ridiculous answers to the simplest questions that phil became almost anxious about her and finally settled it in his own mind that her labours in the telegraph department of the general postoffice must be brought to a close as soon as possible  you see mother he said that night after aspel had left the cottage and may had gone to her room it will never do to let her kill herself over the telegraph instrument  shes too delicately formed for such work  we must find something better suited to her  yes phil we must find something better suited to hergoodnight replied mrs maylands  there was a twinkle in the widows eye as she said this that sorely puzzled phil and kept him in confused meditation that night until the confusion became worse confounded and he fell into an untroubled slumber    chapter thirty  the last  sitting alone in the breakfast parlour of the rosebud one morning in june miss stivergill read the following paragraph in her newspapergallant rescueyesterday forenoon a lady and her daughter accompanied by a gentleman went to the landingwharf at blackfriars with the intention of going on board a steamer  there were some disorderly men on the wharf and a good deal of crowding at the time  as the steamer approached one of the halfdrunk men staggered violently against the daughter above referred to and thrust her into the river which was running rapidly at the time the tide being threequarters ebb  the gentleman who happened to have turned towards the mother at the moment heard a scream and plunge  he looked quickly back and missed the young lady  being a tall powerful man he dashed the crowd aside hurled the drunk manno doubt inadvertentlyinto the river sprang over his head as he was falling with a magnificent bound and reached the water so near to the young lady that a few powerful strokes enabled him to grasp and support her  observing that the unfortunate cause of the whole affair was lulling helplessly past him with the tide he made a vigorous stroke or two with his disengaged arm and succeeded in grasping him by the nape of the neck and holding him at armslength despite his struggles until a boat rescued them all  we believe that the gentleman who effected this double rescue is named aspel and that he is a city missionary  we have also been informed that the young lady is engaged to her gallant deliverer and that the wedding has been fixed to come off this week  laying down the paper miss stivergill lifted up her eyes and hands pursed her mouth and gave vent to a most unladylike whistle  she had barely terminated this musical performance and recovered the serenity of her aspect when miss lillycrop burst in upon her with unwonted haste and excitement  my darling maria she exclaimed breathlessly flinging her bonnet on a chair and seizing both the hands of her friend i am so glad youre at home  its such an age since i saw you  i came out by the early train on purpose to tell you  i hardly know where to begin  oh  im so glad  youre not going to be married interrupted miss stivergill whose stern calmness deepened as her friends excitement increased  married oh no  ridiculous but i think im going deranged  that is impossible returned miss stivergill you have been deranged ever since i knew you  if there is any change in your condition it can only be an access of the malady  besides there is no particular cause for joy in that  have you no more interesting news to give me  more interesting news echoed miss lillycrop sitting down on her bonnet of course i have  now just listen peter paxof the firm of blurt pax jiggs and company antiquarians birdstuffers mechanists stampcollectors and i dont know what else besides to the queenis going to be married towhom do you think  the queen of sheba replied miss stivergill folding her hands on her lap with a placid smile  totottie bones said miss lillycrop with an excited movement that ground some of her bonnet to strawpowder  miss stivergill did not raise her eyes or whistle at this  she merely put her head a little on one side and smiled  i knew it my dearat least i felt sure it would come to this though it is sooner than i expected  it is not written anywhere i believe that a boy may not marry a baby nevertheless  but shes not a baby broke in miss lillycrop  tottie is seventeen now and pax is twentyfour  but this is not the half of what i have to tell you  ever since pax was taken into partnership by mr enoch blurt the business has prospered as you are aware and our active little friend has added all kinds of branches to itsuch as the preparation and sale of entomological and ichthyological and other ological specimens and the mechanical parts of toyengines and that lad jiggs has turned out such a splendid expounder of all these things that the shop has become a sort of terrestrial heaven for boys  and dear old fred blurt has begun to recover under the influence of success so that he is now able to get out frequently in a wheelchair  but the strangest news of all is that mister enoch blurt got a new babya girland recovered his diamonds on the selfsame day  indeed said miss stivergill beginning to be influenced by these surprising revelations  yes and its a curious evidence of the energetic and successful way in which things are managed by our admirable postoffice  what the union of a new baby with recovered diamonds  no no maria how stupid you are  i refer of course to the diamonds  have you not seen reference made to them in the papers  no  ive seen or heard nothing about it  indeed  im surprised  well that hearty old lettercarrier solomon flint sent that ridiculously stout creature whom he calls dollops to me with the last report of the postmastergeneral with the corner of page eleven turned down for he knew i was interested in anything that might affect the blurts  but here it is  i brought it to read to you listen on the occasion of the wreck of the trident in howlin cove on the west of ireland many years ago strenuous efforts were made by divers to recover the cape of good hope mails and it will be recollected they were partially successful but a portion which contained diamonds could not be found  diving operations were however resumed quite recently and with most satisfactory results  one of the registeredletterbags was found  it had been so completely imbedded in sand and covered by a heavy portion of the wreck that the contents were not altogether destroyed notwithstanding the long period of their immersion  on being opened in the chief office in london the bag was found to contain several large packets of diamonds the addresses on which had been partially obliterated besides about seven pounds weight of loose diamonds which having escaped from their covers were mixed with the pulp in the bottom of the bag  every possible endeavour was used by the officers of the department to discover the rightful owners of those packets which were nearly intact and with such success that they were all with very little delay duly delivered  the remaining diamonds were valued by an experienced broker and soldthe amount realised being about 19000 pounds  after very great trouble and much correspondence the whole of the persons for whom the loose diamonds were intended were it is believed ascertained and this sum proved sufficient to satisfy the several claimants to such an extent that not a single complaint was heard  how strange  why did you not tell me of this before lilly  because mr blurt resolved to keep it secret until he was quite sure there was no mistake about the matter  now that he has received the value of his diamonds he has told all his friends  moreover he has resolved to take a house in the suburbs so that fred may have fresh country air fresh milk and fresh eggs  peter pax too talks of doing the same thing being bent so he says on devoting himself to the entomological department of his business in order that he may renew his youth by hunting butterflies and beetles with tottie  it never rains but it pours said miss stivergill  surprises dont come singly it appearshave you read that  she handed her friend the newspaper which recounted the gallant rescue  miss lillycrops countenance was a study which cannot be described  the same may be said of her bonnet  when she came to the name of aspel her eyeballs became circular and her eyebrows apparently attempted to reach the roots of her hair  maria dear she cried with a little shriek this only reminds me that i have still more news to tell  you remember sir james clubley well he is dead and he has left the whole of his property to george aspel  it seems that sir james went one night secretly as it were to some low locality where aspel was preaching to poor people and was so affected by what he heard and saw that he came forward at the close signed the pledge along with a number of rough and dirty men and then and there became a total abstainer  this i am told occurred a considerable time ago and he has been a helper of the temperance cause ever since  sir james had no near relatives  to the few distant ones he possessed he left legacies and in his will stated that he left the rest of his fortunewhich although not large is considerableto george aspel in the firm belief that by so doing he was leaving it to further the cause of christianity and temperance  come now dont stop there observed miss stivergill calmly go on to tell me that phil maylands has also had a fortune left him or become postmastergeneral and got married or is going to be  well i cant exactly tell you that returned miss lillycrop but i can tell you that he has had a rise in the postoffice savings bank with an increase of salary and that may declines to marry aspel unless he agrees to live with her mother in the cottage at nottinghill  of course aspel has consentedall the more that it is conveniently situated near to a station whence he can easily reach the field of his missionary labours  does he intend to continue these now that he is rich asked miss stivergill  how can you ask such a question replied her friend with a slightly offended look  aspel is not a man to be easily moved from his purpose he says he will labour in the good cause and devote health and means to it as long as god permits  good exclaimed miss stivergill with a satisfied nodnow lilly she added with the decision of tone and manner peculiar to her i mean to make some arrangements  the farmer next to me has a very pretty villa as you are aware on the brow of the hill that overlooks the whole country in the direction of london  it is at present to let  mr blurt must take it  beside it stands a cottage just large enough for a newmarried couple  i had already rented that cottage for a poor friend  he however knows nothing about the matter  i will therefore have him put somewhere else and sublet the cottage to mr and mrs pax  lastly you shall give up your insane notion of living alone come here with all your belongings and take up your abode with me for ever  thats a long time dear maria said miss lillycrop with a little smile  not too long by any means lilly  now clear that rubbish off the chairits well got rid of i never liked the shapego put yourself to rights use one of my bonnets and come out for a walk  tomorrow you shall go into town and arrange with pax and blurt about the villa and the cottage to the best of your ability  its of no use attempting to resist me lillytell them thatfor in this affair i have made up my mind that my will shall be law    reader what more need we addexcept that miss stivergills will did eventually become law because it happened to correspond with the wishes of all concerned  it is due also to solomon flint to record that after his long life of faithful service in the postoffice he retired on a small but comfortable pension and joined the rosebud colony as pax styled it taking his grandmother along with him  that remarkable piece of antiquity when last seen by a credible witness was basking in the sunshine under a rustic porch covered with honeysuckle more wrinkled more driedup more tough more amiableespecially to her catand more stooped in the previous century than ever  mr bright the energetic sorter who visits solomon whenever his postal duties will allow expresses his belief that the old lady will live to see them all out and mr brights opinion carries weight with it besides which phil maylands and may aspel with her husband are more than half inclined to agree with him  time will show  pegaway hall still exists but its glory has departed for although mrs square still keeps her one watchful eye upon its closed door its walls and rafters no longer resound with the eloquence wit and wisdom of boy telegraph messengers although these important servants of the queen still continuewith their friends the lettercarriersto tramp the kingdom post haste in ceaseless benignant activity distributing right and left with impartial justice the varied contents of her majestys mails
