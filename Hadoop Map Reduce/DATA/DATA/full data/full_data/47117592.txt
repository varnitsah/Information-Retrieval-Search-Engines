obtained employment on the london and birmingham railway after the strike of 1846 he devoted himself to journalism and in 1848 was subeditor of the economist  he died in 1903     herbert spencer

sons ltd aldine house · bedford street · london first published in everymans library 1911 last reprinted 1963  no 504     introduction   the four essays on education which herbert spencer published in a single volume in 1861 were all written and separately published between 1854 and 1859 their tone was aggressive and their proposals revolutionary although all the doctrineswith one important exceptionhad already been vigorously preached by earlier writers on education as spencer himself was at pains to point out the doctrine which was comparatively new ran through all four essays but was most amply stated in the essay first published in 1859 under the title what knowledge is of most worth in this essay spencer divided the leading kinds of human activity into those which minister to selfpreservation those which secure the necessaries of life those whose end is the care of offspring those which make good citizens and those which prepare adults to enjoy nature literature and the fine arts and he then maintained that in each of these several classes knowledge of science was worth more than any other knowledge he argued that everywhere throughout creation faculties are developed through the performance of the appropriate functions so that it would be contrary to the whole harmony of nature if one kind of culture were needed for the gaining of information and another kind were needed as a mental gymnastic he then maintained that the sciences are superior in all respects to languages as educational material they train the memory better and a superior kind of memory they cultivate the judgment and they impart an admirable moral and religious discipline he concluded that for discipline as well as for guidance science is of chiefest value in all its effects learning the meaning of things is better than learning the meaning of words he answered the question what knowledge is of most worth with the one wordscience  this doctrine was extremely repulsive to the established profession of education in england where latin greek and mathematics had been the staples of education for many generations and were believed to afford the only suitable preparation for the learned professions public life and cultivated society in proclaiming this doctrine with ample illustration ingenious argument and forcible reiteration spencer was a true educational pioneer although some of his scientific contemporaries were really preaching similar doctrines each in his own field  the profession of teaching has long been characterised by certain habitual convictions which spencer undertook to shake rudely and even to deride the first of these convictions is that all education physical intellectual and moral must be authoritative and need take no account of the natural wishes tendencies and motives of the ignorant and undeveloped child the second dominating conviction is that to teach means to tell or show children what they ought to see believe and utter expositions by the teacher and books are therefore the true means of education the third and supreme conviction is that the method of education which produced the teacher himself and the contemporary or earlier scholars authors and publicists must be the righteous and sufficient method its fruits demonstrate its soundness and make it sacred herbert spencer in the essays included in the present volume assaulted all three of these firm convictions accordingly the ideas on education which he put forth more than fifty years ago have penetrated educational practice very slowlyparticularly in england but they are now coming to prevail in most civilised countries and they will prevail more and more through him the thoughts on education of comenius montaigne locke milton rousseau pestalozzi and other noted writers on this neglected subject are at last winning their way into practice with the modifications or adaptations which the immense gains of the human race in knowledge and power since the nineteenth century opened have shown to be wise  for teachers and educational administrators it is interesting to observe the steps by which spencers doctrinesand especially his doctrine of the supreme value of sciencehave advanced towards acceptance in practice in general the advance has been brought about through the indirect effects of the enormous industrial social and political changes of the last fifty years the first practical step was the introduction of laboratory teaching of one or more of the sciences into the secondary schools and colleges chemistry and physics were the commonest subjects selected these two subjects had been taught from books even earlier but memorising science out of books is far less useful as training than memorising grammars and vocabularies the characteristic discipline of science can be imparted only through the laboratory method the schoolmasters and college faculties who took this step by no means admitted spencers contention that science should be the universal staple at all stages of child development on the contrary they believed as most people do today that the mind of the young child cannot grasp the processes and generalisations of science and that science is no more universally fitted to develop mental power than the classics or mathematics indeed experience during the past fifty years seems to have proved that fewer minds are naturally inclined to scientific study than to linguistic or historical study so that if some science is to be learnt by everybody the amount of such study should be limited to acquiring in one or two sciences knowledge of the scientific method in general so much scientific training is indeed universally desirable because good training of the senses to observe accurately is universally desirable and the collecting comparing and grouping of many facts teach orderliness in thinking and lead up to something which spencer valued highly in educationa rational explanation of phenomena  science having obtained a foothold in secondary schools and colleges an adequate development of scienceteaching resulted from the introduction of options or elections for the pupils among numerous different courses in place of a curriculum prescribed for all the elaborate teaching of many sciences was thus introduced the pupil or student saw and recorded for himself used books only as helps and guides in seeing recording and generalising proceeded from the known to the unknown and in short made numerous applications of the doctrines which pervade all spencers writings on education in the united states these methods were introduced earlier and have been carried farther than in england but within the last few years the changes made in education have been more extensive and rapid in england than in any other countrywitness the announcements of the new high schools and the reorganised grammar schools of such colleges as south kensington armstrong kings the university college london and goldsmiths and of the new municipal universities such as victoria bristol sheffield birmingham liverpool and leeds the new technical schools also illustrate the advent of instruction in applied science as an important element in advanced education such institutions as the seafield park engineering college the city guilds of london institute the city of london college and the battersea polytechnic are instances of the same development some endowed institutions for girls illustrate the same tendencies as for example the bedford college for women and the royal holloway college all these institutions teach sciences in considerable variety and in the way that spencer advocatednot so much because they have distinctly accepted his views as because modern industrial and social conditions compel the preparation in science of young people destined for various occupations and services indispensable to modern society the method of the preparation is essentially that which he advocated  spencers propositions to the effect that the study of science was desirable for artisans artists and in general for people who were to get their livings through various skills of hand and eye were received with great incredulity not to say derisionparticularly when he maintained that some knowledge of the theory which underlies an art was desirable for manual practitioners of the art but the changes of the last fifty years in the practice of the arts and trades may be said to have demonstrated that his views were thoroughly sound the applications of science in the arts and trades have been so numerous and productive that widespread training in science has become indispensable to any nation which means to excel in the manufacturing industries whether of large scale or small scale the extraordinary popularity of evening schools and correspondence schools in the united states rests on the need which young people employed in the various industries of the country feel of obtaining more theoretical knowledge about the physical or chemical processes through which they are earning a livelihood the young mens christian associations in the american cities have become great centres of evening instruction for just such young persons the correspondence schools are teaching hundreds of thousands of young people at work in machineshops mills mines and factories who believe that they can advance themselves in their several occupations by supplementing their elementary education with correspondence courses taken while they are at work earning a livelihood in industries that rest ultimately on applications of science  spencers objection to the constant exercise of authority and compulsion in schools families and the state is felt today much more widely than it was in 1858 when he wrote his essay on moral education his proposal that children should be allowed to suffer the natural consequences of their foolish or wrong acts does not seem to the present generationany more than it did to himto be applicable to very young children who need protection from the undue severity of many natural penalties but the soundness of his general doctrine that it is the true function of parents and teachers to see that children habitually experience the normal consequences of their conduct without putting artificial consequences in place of them now commands the assent of most persons whose minds have been freed from the theological dogmas of original sin and total depravity spencer did not expect the immediate adoption of this principle because society as a whole was not yet humane enough he admitted that the uncontrollable child of illcontrolled adults might sometimes have to be scolded or beaten and that these barbarous methods might be perhaps the best preparation such children can have for the barbarous society in which they are presently to play a part he hoped however that the civilised members of society would by and by spontaneously use milder measures and this hope has been realised in good degree with the result that happiness in childhood is much commoner and more constant than it used to be parents and teachers are beginning to realise that selfcontrol is a prime object in moral education and that this selfcontrol cannot be practised under a regime of constant supervision unexplained commands and painful punishments but must be gained in freedom some largescale experience with american secondary schools which prepare boys for admission to college has been edifying in this respect the american colleges as a rule do not undertake to exercise much supervision over their students but leave them free to regulate their own lives in regard to both work and play now it is the boys who come from the secondary schools where the closest supervision is maintained that are in most danger of falling into evil ways when they first go to college  spencer put very forcibly a valuable doctrine for which many earlier writers on the theory of education had failed to get a hearingthe doctrine namely that all instruction should be pleasurable and interesting fifty years ago almost all teachers believed that it was impossible to make schoolwork interesting or lifework either so that the child must be forced to grind without pleasure in preparation for lifes grind and the forcing was to be done by experience of the teachers displeasure and the infliction of pain through the slow effects of spencers teaching and of the experience of practical teachers who have demonstrated that instruction can be made pleasurable and that the very hardest work is done by interested pupils because they are interested it has gradually come to pass that his heresy has become the prevailing judgment among sensible and humane teachers the experience of many adults hard at work in the modern industrial commercial and financial world has taught them that human beings can make their intensest application only to problems in which they are personally interested for one reason or another and that freemen work much harder than slaves because they feel within themselves strong motives for exertion which slaves cannot possibly feel so many intelligent adults including many parents and teachers have come to believe it possible that children will learn to do hard work both in school and in after life through the free play of interior motives which appeal to them and prompt them to persistent exertion  the justice of spencers views about training through pleasurable sensation and achievement in freedom rather than through uninterested work and pain inflicted by despotic government is well illustrated by the recent improvements in the discipline of reformatories for boys and girls and young men and women it has been demonstrated that the only useful reformatories are those which diminish the criminals liberty of action as little as possible require him to perform productive labour educate him for a trade or other useful occupation and offer him the reward of an abridgment of sentence in return for industry and selfcontrol repression and compulsion under penalties however severe fail to reform and often make bad moral conditions worse instruction as much freedom as is consistent with the safety of society and an appeal to the ordinary motives of emulation satisfaction in achievement and the desire to win credit can and do reform  many schools both public and private have now adoptedin most cases unconsciouslymany of spencers more detailed suggestions the laboratory method of instruction for example now common for scientific subjects in good schools is an application of his doctrines of concrete illustration training in the accurate use of the senses and subordination of bookwork many schools realise too that learning by heart and in general memorising from books are not the only means of storing the mind of a child they should make parts of a sound education but should not be used to the exclusion of learning through eye ear and hand spencer pointed out with much elaboration that children acquire in their early years a vast amount of information exclusively through the incessant use of their senses today teachers know this fact and realise much better than the teachers of fifty years ago did that all through the school and college period the pupils should be getting a large part of their new knowledge through the careful application of their own powers of observation aided indeed by books and pictures which record the observations old and new of other people the young human being unlike the puppy or the kitten is not confined to the use of his own senses as sources of information and discovery but can enjoy the fruits of a prodigious width and depth of observation acquired by preceding generations and adult members of his own generation a recent illustration of this extension of the method of observation in teaching to observations made by other people is the new method of giving moral instruction to school children through photographs of actual scenes which illustrate both good morals and bad the exhibition of the photographs being accompanied by a running oral comment from the teacher in this kind of moral instruction it seems to be possible to interest all kinds of children both civilised and barbarous both illbred and wellbred the teaching comes through the eye for the children themselves observe intently the pictures which the lantern throws on the screen but the striking scenes thus put before them probably lie in most instances quite outside the region of their own experiences  the essay on what knowledge is of most worth contains a hot denunciation of that kind of information which in most schools used to usurp the name of history it is enough to say of this part of spencers educational doctrine that all the best historical writers since the middle of the nineteenth century seem to have adopted the principles which he declared should govern the writing of history as a result the teaching of history in schools and colleges has undergone a profound change it now deals with the nature and action of government central local and ecclesiastical with social observances industrial systems and the customs which regulate popular life outofdoors and indoors it depicts also the intellectual condition of the nation and the progress it has made in applied science the fine arts and legislation and includes descriptions of the peoples food shelters and amusements to this result many authors and teachers have contributed but spencers violent denunciation of history as it was taught in his time has greatly promoted this important reform  many twentiethcentury teachers are sure to put in practice spencers exhortation to teach children to draw with pen and pencil and to use paints and brush he maintained that the common omission of drawing as an important element in the training of children was in contempt of some of the most obvious of natures suggestions with regard to the natural development of human faculties and the better recent practice in some english and american schools verifies his statement nevertheless some of the best secondary schools in both countries still fail to recognise drawing and painting as important elements in liberal education  modern society as yet hardly approaches the putting into effective practice of the sound views which spencer set forth with great detail in his essay on physical education the instruction given in schools and colleges on the care of the body and the laws of health is still very meagre and in certain subjects of the utmost importance no instruction whatever is given as for example in the normal methods of reproduction in plants and animals in eugenics and in the ruinous consequences of disregarding sexual purity and honour in one respect his fundamental doctrine of freedom carried into the domain of physical exercise has been extensively adopted in england on the continent and in america he taught that although gymnastics military drill and formal exercises of the limbs are better than nothing they can never serve in place of the plays prompted by nature he maintained that for girls as well as boys the sportive activities to which the instincts impel are essential to bodily welfare this principle is now being carried into practice not only for schoolchildren but for operatives in factories clerks and other young persons whose occupations are sedentary and monotonous for all such persons free plays are vastly better than formal exercises of any sort  the wide adoption of spencers educational ideas has had to await the advent of the new educational administration and the new public interest therein it awaited the coming of the state university in the united states and of the city university in england the establishment of numerous technical schools the profound modifications made in grammar schools and academies and the multiplication in both countries of the secondary schools called high schools in other words his ideas gradually gained admission to a vast number of new institutions of education which were created and maintained because both the governments and the nations felt a new sense of responsibility for the training of the future generations these new agencies have been created in great variety and the introduction of spencers ideas has been much facilitated by this variety these institutions were national state or municipal they were taxsupported or endowed they charged tuition fees or were open to competent children or adults without fee they undertook to meet alike the needs of the individual and the needs of the community and this undertaking involved the introduction of many new subjects of instruction and many new methods through their variety they could be sympathetic with both individualism and collectivism the variety of instruction offered is best illustrated in the strongest american universities some of which are taxsupported and some endowed these universities maintain a great variety of courses of instruction in subjects none of which was taught with the faintest approach to adequacy in american universities sixty years ago but in making these extensions the universities have not found it necessary to reduce the instruction offered in the classics and mathematics the traditional cultural studies are still provided but they represent only one programme among many and no one is compelled to follow it the domination of the classics is at an end but any student who prefers the traditional path to culture or whose parents choose that path for him will find in several american universities much richer provisions of classical instruction than any university in the country offered sixty years ago the present proposals to widen the influence of oxford university do not mean therefore that the classics history and philosophy are to be taught less there but only that other subjects are to be taught more and that a greater number and variety of young men will be prepared there for the service of the nation  the new public interest in education as a necessary of modern industrial and political life has gradually brought about a great increase in the proportional number of young men and women whose education is prolonged beyond the period of primary or elementary instruction and this multitude of young people is preparing for a great variety of callings many of which are new within sixty years having been brought into being by the extraordinary advances of applied science the advent of these new callings has favoured the spread of spencers educational ideas the recent agitation in favour of what is called vocational training is a vivid illustration of the wide acceptance of his arguments even the farmers their farmhands and their children must nowadays be offered free instruction in agriculture because the public and especially the urban public believes that by disseminating better methods of tillage better seed and appropriate manures the yield of the farms can be improved in quality and multiplied in quantity in regard to all material interests the free peoples are acting on the principle that science is the knowledge of most worth spencers doctrine of natural consequences in place of artificial penalties his view that all young people should be taught how to be wise parents and good citizens and his advocacy of instruction in public and private hygiene lie at the roots of many of the philanthropic and reformatory movements of the day  on the whole herbert spencer has been fortunate among educational philosophers he has not had to wait so long for the acceptance of his teachings as comenius montaigne or rousseau waited his ideas have been floated on a prodigious tide of industrial and social change which necessarily involved widespread and profound educational reform  this introduction deals with spencers four essays on education but in the present volume are included three other famous essays written by him during the same period 185459 which produced the essays on education all three are germane to the educational essays because they deal with the general law of human progress with the genesis of that science which spencer thought to be the knowledge of most worth and with the origin and function of music a subject which he maintained should play an important part in any scheme of education

the westminster review for july 1859 the second in the north british review for may 1854 and the remaining two in the british quarterly review for april 1858 and for april 1859 severally treating different divisions of the subject but together forming a tolerably complete whole i originally wrote them with a view to their republication in a united form and they would some time since have thus been issued had not a legal difficulty stood in the way this difficulty being now removed i hasten to fulfil the intention with which they were written  that in their first shape these chapters were severally independent is the reason to be assigned for some slight repetitions which occur in them one leading idea more especially reappearing twice as however this idea is on each occasion presented under a new form and as it can scarcely be too much enforced i have not thought well to omit any of the passages embodying it  some additions of importance will be found in the chapter on intellectual education and in the one on physical education there are a few minor alterations but the chief changes which have been made are changes of expression all of the essays having undergone a careful verbal revision                                                                      hs london may 1861     spencers essays     part ion education  what knowledge is of most worth   it has been truly remarked that in order of time decoration precedes dress among people who submit to great physical suffering that they may have themselves handsomely tattooed extremes of temperature are borne with but little attempt at mitigation humboldt tells us that an orinoco indian though quite regardless of bodily comfort will yet labour for a fortnight to purchase pigment wherewith to make himself admired and that the same woman who would not hesitate to leave her hut without a fragment of clothing on would not dare to commit such a breach of decorum as to go out unpainted voyagers find that coloured beads and trinkets are much more prized by wild tribes than are calicoes or broadcloths and the anecdotes we have of the ways in which when shirts and coats are given savages turn them to some ludicrous display show how completely the idea of ornament predominates over that of use nay there are still more extreme illustrations witness the fact narrated by capt speke of his african attendants who strutted about in their goatskin mantles when the weather was fine but when it was wet took them off folded them up and went about naked shivering in the rain indeed the facts of aboriginal life seem to indicate that dress is developed out of decorations and when we remember that even among ourselves most think more about the fineness of the fabric than its warmth and more about the cut than the conveniencewhen we see that the function is still in great measure subordinated to the appearancewe have further reason for inferring such an origin  it is curious that the like relations hold with the mind among mental as among bodily acquisitions the ornamental comes before the useful not only in times past but almost as much in our own era that knowledge which conduces to personal wellbeing has been postponed to that which brings applause in the greek schools music poetry rhetoric and a philosophy which until socrates taught had but little bearing upon action were the dominant subjects while knowledge aiding the arts of life had a very subordinate place and in our own universities and schools at the present moment the like antithesis holds we are guilty of something like a platitude when we say that throughout his aftercareer a boy in nine cases out of ten applies his latin and greek to no practical purposes the remark is trite that in his shop or his office in managing his estate or his family in playing his part as director of a bank or a railway he is very little aided by this knowledge he took so many years to acquireso little that generally the greater part of it drops out of his memory and if he occasionally vents a latin quotation or alludes to some greek myth it is less to throw light on the topic in hand than for the sake of effect if we inquire what is the real motive for giving boys a classical education we find it to be simply conformity to public opinion men dress their childrens minds as they do their bodies in the prevailing fashion as the orinoco indian puts on paint before leaving his hut not with a view to any direct benefit but because he would be ashamed to be seen without it so a boys drilling in latin and greek is insisted on not because of their intrinsic value but that he may not be disgraced by being found ignorant of themthat he may have the education of a gentlemanthe badge marking a certain social position and bringing a consequent respect  this parallel is still more clearly displayed in the case of the other sex in the treatment of both mind and body the decorative element has continued to predominate in a greater degree among women than among men originally personal adornment occupied the attention of both sexes equally in these latter days of civilisation however we see that in the dress of men the regard for appearance has in a considerable degree yielded to the regard for comfort while in their education the useful has of late been trenching on the ornamental in neither direction has this change gone so far with women the wearing of earrings fingerrings bracelets the elaborate dressings of the hair the still occasional use of paint the immense labour bestowed in making habiliments sufficiently attractive and the great discomfort that will be submitted to for the sake of conformity show how greatly in the attiring of women the desire of approbation overrides the desire for warmth and convenience and similarly in their education the immense preponderance of accomplishments proves how here too use is subordinated to display dancing deportment the piano singing drawingwhat a large space do these occupy if you ask why italian and german are learnt you will find that under all the sham reasons given the real reason is that a knowledge of those tongues is thought ladylike it is not that the books written in them may be utilised which they scarcely ever are but that italian and german songs may be sung and that the extent of attainment may bring whispered admiration the births deaths and marriages of kings and other like historic trivialities are committed to memory not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them but because society considers them parts of a good educationbecause the absence of such knowledge may bring the contempt of others when we have named reading writing spelling grammar arithmetic and sewing we have named about all the things a girl is taught with a view to their actual uses in life and even some of these have more reference to the good opinion of others than to immediate personal welfare  thoroughly to realise the truth that with the mind as with the body the ornamental precedes the useful it is requisite to glance at its rationale this lies in the fact that from the far past down even to the present social needs have subordinated individual needs and that the chief social need has been the control of individuals it is not as we commonly suppose that there are no governments but those of monarchs and parliaments and constituted authorities these acknowledged governments are supplemented by other unacknowledged ones that grow up in all circles in which every man or woman strives to be king or queen or lesser dignitary to get above some and be reverenced by them and to propitiate those who are above us is the universal struggle in which the chief energies of life are expended by the accumulation of wealth by style of living by beauty of dress by display of knowledge or intellect each tries to subjugate others and so aids in weaving that ramified network of restraints by which society is kept in order it is not the savage chief only who in formidable warpaint with scalps at his belt aims to strike awe into his inferiors it is not only the belle who by elaborate toilet polished manners and numerous accomplishments strives to make conquests but the scholar the historian the philosopher use their acquirements to the same end we are none of us content with quietly unfolding our own individualities to the full in all directions but have a restless craving to impress our individualities upon others and in some way subordinate them and this it is which determines the character of our education not what knowledge is of most real worth is the consideration but what will bring most applause honour respectwhat will most conduce to social position and influencewhat will be most imposing as throughout life not what we are but what we shall be thought is the question so in education the question is not the intrinsic value of knowledge so much as its extrinsic effects on others and this being our dominant idea direct utility is scarcely more regarded than by the barbarian when filing his teeth and staining his nails                                       if there requires further evidence of the rude undeveloped character of our education we have it in the fact that the comparative worths of different kinds of knowledge have been as yet scarcely even discussedmuch less discussed in a methodic way with definite results not only is it that no standard of relative values has yet been agreed upon but the existence of any such standard has not been conceived in a clear manner and not only is it that the existence of such a standard has not been clearly conceived but the need for it seems to have been scarcely even felt men read books on this topic and attend lectures on that decide that their children shall be instructed in these branches of knowledge and shall not be instructed in those and all under the guidance of mere custom or liking or prejudice without ever considering the enormous importance of determining in some rational way what things are really most worth learning it is true that in all circles we hear occasional remarks on the importance of this or the other order of information but whether the degree of its importance justifies the expenditure of the time needed to acquire it and whether there are not things of more importance to which such time might be better devoted are queries which if raised at all are disposed of quite summarily according to personal predilections it is true also that now and then we hear revived the standing controversy respecting the comparative merits of classics and mathematics this controversy however is carried on in an empirical manner with no reference to an ascertained criterion and the question at issue is insignificant when compared with the general question of which it is part to suppose that deciding whether a mathematical or a classical education is the best is deciding what is the proper curriculum is much the same thing as to suppose that the whole of dietetics lies in ascertaining whether or not bread is more nutritive than potatoes  the question which we contend is of such transcendent moment is not whether such or such knowledge is of worth but what is its relative worth when they have named certain advantages which a given course of study has secured them persons are apt to assume that they have justified themselves quite forgetting that the adequateness of the advantages is the point to be judged there is perhaps not a subject to which men devote attention that has not some value a year diligently spent in getting up heraldry would very possibly give a little further insight into ancient manners and morals any one who should learn the distances between all the towns in england might in the course of his life find one or two of the thousand facts he had acquired of some slight service when arranging a journey gathering together all the small gossip of a county profitless occupation as it would be might yet occasionally help to establish some useful factsay a good example of hereditary transmission but in these cases every one would admit that there was no proportion between the required labour and the probable benefit no one would tolerate the proposal to devote some years of a boys time to getting such information at the cost of much more valuable information which he might else have got and if here the test of relative value is appealed to and held conclusive then should it be appealed to and held conclusive throughout had we time to master all subjects we need not be particular to quote the old song    could a man be secure   that his day would endure   as of old for a thousand long years   what things might he know   what deeds might he do   and all without hurry or care  but we that have but spanlong lives must ever bear in mind our limited time for acquisition and remembering how narrowly this time is limited not only by the shortness of life but also still more by the business of life we ought to be especially solicitous to employ what time we have to the greatest advantage before devoting years to some subject which fashion or fancy suggests it is surely wise to weigh with great care the worth of the results as compared with the worth of various alternative results which the same years might bring if otherwise applied  in education then this is the question of questions which it is high time we discussed in some methodic way the first in importance though the last to be considered is the problemhow to decide among the conflicting claims of various subjects on our attention before there can be a rational curriculum we must settle which things it most concerns us to know or to use a word of bacons now unfortunately obsoletewe must determine the relative values of knowledges                                       to this end a measure of value is the first requisite and happily respecting the true measure of value as expressed in general terms there can be no dispute every one in contending for the worth of any particular order of information does so by showing its bearing upon some part of life in reply to the questionof what use is it the mathematician linguist naturalist or philosopher explains the way in which his learning beneficially influences actionsaves from evil or secures goodconduces to happiness when the teacher of writing has pointed out how great an aid writing is to success in businessthat is to the obtainment of sustenancethat is to satisfactory living he is held to have proved his case and when the collector of dead facts say a numismatist fails to make clear any appreciable effects which these facts can produce on human welfare he is obliged to admit that they are comparatively valueless all then either directly or by implication appeal to this as the ultimate test  how to livethat is the essential question for us not how to live in the mere material sense only but in the widest sense the general problem which comprehends every special problem isthe right ruling of conduct in all directions under all circumstances in what way to treat the body in what way to treat the mind in what way to manage our affairs in what way to bring up a family in what way to behave as a citizen in what way to utilise those sources of happiness which nature supplieshow to use all our faculties to the greatest advantage of ourselves and othershow to live completely and this being the great thing needful for us to learn is by consequence the great thing which education has to teach to prepare us for complete living is the function which education has to discharge and the only rational mode of judging of an educational course is to judge in what degree it discharges such function  this test never used in its entirety but rarely even partially used and used then in a vague half conscious way has to be applied consciously methodically and throughout all cases it behoves us to set before ourselves and ever to keep clearly in view complete living as the end to be achieved so that in bringing up our children we may choose subjects and methods of instruction with deliberate reference to this end not only ought we to cease from the mere unthinking adoption of the current fashion in education which has no better warrant than any other fashion but we must also rise above that rude empirical style of judging displayed by those more intelligent people who do bestow some care in overseeing the cultivation of their childrens minds it must not suffice simply to think that such or such information will be useful in after life or that this kind of knowledge is of more practical value than that but we must seek out some process of estimating their respective values so that as far as possible we may positively know which are most deserving of attention  doubtless the task is difficultperhaps never to be more than approximately achieved but considering the vastness of the interests at stake its difficulty is no reason for pusillanimously passing it by but rather for devoting every energy to its mastery and if we only proceed systematically we may very soon get at results of no small moment  our first step must obviously be to classify in the order of their importance the leading kinds of activity which constitute human life they may be naturally arranged into1 those activities which directly minister to selfpreservation 2 those activities which by securing the necessaries of life indirectly minister to selfpreservation 3 those activities which have for their end the rearing and discipline of offspring 4 those activities which are involved in the maintenance of proper social and political relations 5 those miscellaneous activities which fill up the leisure part of life devoted to the gratification of the tastes and feelings  that these stand in something like their true order of subordination it needs no long consideration to show the actions and precautions by which from moment to moment we secure personal safety must clearly take precedence of all others could there be a man ignorant as an infant of surrounding objects and movements or how to guide himself among them he would pretty certainly lose his life the first time he went into the street notwithstanding any amount of learning he might have on other matters and as entire ignorance in all other directions would be less promptly fatal than entire ignorance in this direction it must be admitted that knowledge immediately conducive to selfpreservation is of primary importance  that next after direct selfpreservation comes the indirect selfpreservation which consists in acquiring the means of living none will question that a mans industrial functions must be considered before his parental ones is manifest from the fact that speaking generally the discharge of the parental functions is made possible only by the previous discharge of the industrial ones the power of selfmaintenance necessarily preceding the power of maintaining offspring it follows that knowledge needful for selfmaintenance has stronger claims than knowledge needful for family welfareis second in value to none save knowledge needful for immediate selfpreservation  as the family comes before the state in order of timeas the bringing up of children is possible before the state exists or when it has ceased to be whereas the state is rendered possible only by the bringing up of children it follows that the duties of the parent demand closer attention than those of the citizen or to use a further argumentsince the goodness of a society ultimately depends on the nature of its citizens and since the nature of its citizens is more modifiable by early training than by anything else we must conclude that the welfare of the family underlies the welfare of society and hence knowledge directly conducing to the first must take precedence of knowledge directly conducing to the last  those various forms of pleasurable occupation which fill up the leisure left by graver occupationsthe enjoyments of music poetry painting etcmanifestly imply a preexisting society not only is a considerable development of them impossible without a longestablished social union but their very subjectmatter consists in great part of social sentiments and sympathies not only does society supply the conditions to their growth but also the ideas and sentiments they express and consequently that part of human conduct which constitutes good citizenship is of more moment than that which goes out in accomplishments or exercise of the tastes and in education preparation for the one must rank before preparation for the other  such then we repeat is something like the rational order of subordinationthat education which prepares for direct selfpreservation that which prepares for indirect selfpreservation that which prepares for parenthood that which prepares for citizenship that which prepares for the miscellaneous refinements of life we do not mean to say that these divisions are definitely separable we do not deny that they are intricately entangled with each other in such way that there can be no training for any that is not in some measure a training for all nor do we question that of each division there are portions more important than certain portions of the preceding divisions that for instance a man of much skill in business but little other faculty may fall further below the standard of complete living than one of but moderate ability in moneygetting but great judgment as a parent or that exhaustive information bearing on right social action joined with entire want of general culture in literature and the fine arts is less desirable than a more moderate share of the one joined with some of the other but after making due qualifications there still remain these broadlymarked divisions and it still continues substantially true that these divisions subordinate one another in the foregoing order because the corresponding divisions of life make one another possible in that order  of course the ideal of education iscomplete preparation in all these divisions but failing this ideal as in our phase of civilisation every one must do more or less the aim should be to maintain a due proportion between the degrees of preparation in each not exhaustive cultivation in any one supremely important though it may benot even an exclusive attention to the two three or four divisions of greatest importance but an attention to allgreatest where the value is greatest less where the value is less least where the value is least for the average man not to forget the cases in which peculiar aptitude for some one department of knowledge rightly makes pursuit of that one the breadwinning occupationfor the average man we say the desideratum is a training that approaches nearest to perfection in the things which most subserve complete living and falls more and more below perfection in the things that have more and more remote bearings on complete living  in regulating education by this standard there are some general considerations that should be ever present to us the worth of any kind of culture as aiding complete living may be either necessary or more or less contingent there is knowledge of intrinsic value knowledge of quasiintrinsic value and knowledge of conventional value such facts as that sensations of numbness and tingling commonly precede paralysis that the resistance of water to a body moving through it varies as the square of the velocity that chlorine is a disinfectantthese and the truths of science in general are of intrinsic value they will bear on human conduct ten thousand years hence as they do now the extra knowledge of our own language which is given by an acquaintance with latin and greek may be considered to have a value that is quasiintrinsic it must exist for us and for other races whose languages owe much to these sources but will last only as long as our languages last while that kind of information which in our schools usurps the name historythe mere tissue of names and dates and dead unmeaning eventshas a conventional value only it has not the remotest bearing on any of our actions and is of use only for the avoidance of those unpleasant criticisms which current opinion passes upon its absence of course as those facts which concern all mankind throughout all time must be held of greater moment than those which concern only a portion of them during a limited era and of far greater moment than those which concern only a portion of them during the continuance of a fashion it follows that in a rational estimate knowledge of intrinsic worth must other things equal take precedence of knowledge that is of quasiintrinsic or conventional worth  one further preliminary acquirement of every kind has two valuesvalue as knowledge and value as discipline besides its use for guiding conduct the acquisition of each order of facts has also its use as mental exercise and its effects as a preparative for complete living have to be considered under both these heads  these then are the general ideas with which we must set out in discussing a curriculumlife as divided into several kinds of activity of successively decreasing importance the worth of each order of facts as regulating these several kinds of activity intrinsically quasiintrinsically and conventionally and their regulative influences estimated both as knowledge and discipline                                       happily that allimportant part of education which goes to secure direct selfpreservation is in great part already provided for too momentous to be left to our blundering nature takes it into her own hands while yet in its nurses arms the infant by hiding its face and crying at the sight of a stranger shows the dawning instinct to attain safety by flying from that which is unknown and may be dangerous and when it can walk the terror it manifests if an unfamiliar dog comes near or the screams with which it runs to its mother after any startling sight or sound shows this instinct further developed moreover knowledge subserving direct selfpreservation is that which it is chiefly busied in acquiring from hour to hour how to balance its body how to control its movements so as to avoid collisions what objects are hard and will hurt if struck what objects are heavy and injure if they fall on the limbs which things will bear the weight of the body and which not the pains inflicted by fire by missiles by sharp instrumentsthese and various other pieces of information needful for the avoidance of death or accident it is ever learning and when a few years later the energies go out in running climbing and jumping in games of strength and games of skill we see in all these actions by which the muscles are developed the perceptions sharpened and the judgment quickened a preparation for the safe conduct of the body among surrounding objects and movements and for meeting those greater dangers that occasionally occur in the lives of all being thus as we say so well cared for by nature this fundamental education needs comparatively little care from us what we are chiefly called upon to see is that there shall be free scope for gaining this experience and receiving this disciplinethat there shall be no such thwarting of nature as that by which stupid schoolmistresses commonly prevent the girls in their charge from the spontaneous physical activities they would indulge in and so render them comparatively incapable of taking care of themselves in circumstances of peril  this however is by no means all that is comprehended in the education that prepares for direct selfpreservation besides guarding the body against mechanical damage or destruction it has to be guarded against injury from other causesagainst the disease and death that follow breaches of physiologic law for complete living it is necessary not only that sudden annihilations of life shall be warded off but also that there shall be escaped the incapacities and the slow annihilation which unwise habits entail as without health and energy the industrial the parental the social and all other activities become more or less impossible it is clear that this secondary kind of direct selfpreservation is only less important than the primary kind and that knowledge tending to secure it should rank very high  it is true that here too guidance is in some measure ready supplied by our various physical sensations and desires nature has insured a tolerable conformity to the chief requirements fortunately for us want of food great heat extreme cold produce promptings too peremptory to be disregarded and would men habitually obey these and all like promptings when less strong comparatively few evils would arise if fatigue of body or brain were in every case followed by desistance if the oppression produced by a close atmosphere always led to ventilation if there were no eating without hunger or drinking without thirst then would the system be but seldom out of working order but so profound an ignorance is there of the laws of life that men do not even know that their sensations are their natural guides and when not rendered morbid by longcontinued disobedience their trustworthy guides so that though to speak teleologically nature has provided efficient safeguards to health lack of knowledge makes them in a great measure useless  if any one doubts the importance of an acquaintance with the principles of physiology as a means to complete living let him look around and see how many men and women he can find in middle or later life who are thoroughly well only occasionally do we meet with an example of vigorous health continued to old age hourly do we meet with examples of acute disorder chronic ailment general debility premature decrepitude scarcely is there one to whom you put the question who has not in the course of his life brought upon himself illnesses which a little information would have saved him from here is a case of heartdisease consequent on a rheumatic fever that followed reckless exposure there is a case of eyes spoiled for life by overstudy yesterday the account was of one whose longenduring lameness was brought on by continuing spite of the pain to use a knee after it had been slightly injured and today we are told of another who has had to lie by for years because he did not know that the palpitation he suffered under resulted from overtaxed brain now we hear of an irremediable injury which followed some silly feat of strength and again of a constitution that has never recovered from the effects of excessive work needlessly undertaken while on every side we see the perpetual minor ailments which accompany feebleness not to dwell on the pain the weariness the gloom the waste of time and money thus entailed only consider how greatly illhealth hinders the discharge of all dutiesmakes business often impossible and always more difficult produces an irritability fatal to the right management of children puts the functions of citizenship out of the question and makes amusement a bore is it not clear that the physical sinspartly our forefathers and partly our ownwhich produce this illhealth deduct more from complete living than anything else and to a great extent make life a failure and a burden instead of a benefaction and a pleasure  nor is this all life besides being thus immensely deteriorated is also cut short it is not true as we commonly suppose that after a disorder or disease from which we have recovered we are as before no disturbance of the normal course of the functions can pass away and leave things exactly as they were a permanent damage is donenot immediately appreciable it may be but still there and along with other such items which nature in her strict accountkeeping never drops it will tell against us to the inevitable shortening of our days through the accumulation of small injuries it is that constitutions are commonly undermined and break down long before their time and if we call to mind how far the average duration of life falls below the possible duration we see how immense is the loss when to the numerous partial deductions which bad health entails we add this great final deduction it results that ordinarily onehalf of life is thrown away  hence knowledge which subserves direct selfpreservation by preventing this loss of health is of primary importance we do not contend that possession of such knowledge would by any means wholly remedy the evil it is clear that in our present phase of civilisation mens necessities often compel them to transgress and it is further clear that even in the absence of such compulsion their inclinations would frequently lead them spite of their convictions to sacrifice future good to present gratification but we do contend that the right knowledge impressed in the right way would effect much and we further contend that as the laws of health must be recognised before they can be fully conformed to the imparting of such knowledge must precede a more rational livingcome when that may we infer that as vigorous health and its accompanying high spirits are larger elements of happiness than any other things whatever the teaching how to maintain them is a teaching that yields in moment to no other whatever and therefore we assert that such a course of physiology as is needful for the comprehension of its general truths and their bearings on daily conduct is an allessential part of a rational education  strange that the assertion should need making stranger still that it should need defending yet are there not a few by whom such a proposition will be received with something approaching to derision men who would blush if caught saying iphigénia instead of iphigenía or would resent as an insult any imputation of ignorance respecting the fabled labours of a fabled demigod show not the slightest shame in confessing that they do not know where the eustachian tubes are what are the actions of the spinal cord what is the normal rate of pulsation or how the lungs are inflated while anxious that their sons should be well up in the superstitions of two thousand years ago they care not that they should be taught anything about the structure and functions of their own bodiesnay even wish them not to be so taught so overwhelming is the influence of established routine so terribly in our education does the ornamental override the useful                                       we need not insist on the value of that knowledge which aids indirect selfpreservation by facilitating the gaining of a livelihood this is admitted by all and indeed by the mass is perhaps too exclusively regarded as the end of education but while every one is ready to endorse the abstract proposition that instruction fitting youths for the business of life is of high importance or even to consider it of supreme importance yet scarcely any inquire what instruction will so fit them it is true that reading writing and arithmetic are taught with an intelligent appreciation of their uses but when we have said this we have said nearly all while the great bulk of what else is acquired has no bearing on the industrial activities an immensity of information that has a direct bearing on the industrial activities is entirely passed over  for leaving out only some very small classes what are all men employed in they are employed in the production preparation and distribution of commodities and on what does efficiency in the production preparation and distribution of commodities depend it depends on the use of methods fitted to the respective natures of these commodities it depends on an adequate acquaintance with their physical chemical or vital properties as the case may be that is it depends on science this order of knowledge which is in great part ignored in our schoolcourses is the order of knowledge underlying the right performance of those processes by which civilised life is made possible undeniable as is this truth there seems to be no living consciousness of it its very familiarity makes it unregarded to give due weight to our argument we must therefore realise this truth to the reader by a rapid review of the facts  passing over the most abstract science logic on the due guidance by which however the large producer or distributor depends knowingly or unknowingly for success in his businessforecasts we come first to mathematics of this the most general division dealing with number guides all industrial activities be they those by which processes are adjusted or estimates framed or commodities bought and sold or accounts kept no one needs to have the value of this division of abstract science insisted upon  for the higher arts of construction some acquaintance with the more special division of mathematics is indispensable the village carpenter who lays out his work by empirical rules equally with the builder of a britannia bridge makes hourly reference to the laws of spacerelations the surveyor who measures the land purchased the architect in designing a mansion to be built on it the builder when laying out the foundations the masons in cutting the stones and the various artizans who put up the fittings are all guided by geometrical truths railwaymaking is regulated from beginning to end by geometry alike in the preparation of plans and sections in staking out the line in the mensuration of cuttings and embankments in the designing and building of bridges culverts viaducts tunnels stations similarly with the harbours docks piers and various engineering and architectural works that fringe the coasts and overspread the country as well as the mines that run underneath it and nowadays even the farmer for the correct layingout of his drains has recourse to the levelthat is to geometrical principles  turn next to the abstractconcrete sciences on the application of the simplest of these mechanics depends the success of modern manufactures the properties of the lever the wheelandaxle etc are recognised in every machine and to machinery in these times we owe all production trace the history of the breakfastroll the soil out of which it came was drained with machinemade tiles the surface was turned over by a machine the wheat was reaped thrashed and winnowed by machines by machinery it was ground and bolted and had the flour been sent to gosport it might have been made into biscuits by a machine look round the room in which you sit if modern probably the bricks in its walls were machinemade and by machinery the flooring was sawn and planed the mantelshelf sawn and polished the paperhangings made and printed the veneer on the table the turned legs of the chairs the carpet the curtains are all products of machinery your clothingplain figured or printedis it not wholly woven nay perhaps even sewed by machinery and the volume you are readingare not its leaves fabricated by one machine and covered with these words by another add to which that for the means of distribution over both land and sea we are similarly indebted and then observe that according as knowledge of mechanics is well or ill applied to these ends comes success or failure the engineer who miscalculates the strength of materials builds a bridge that breaks down the manufacturer who uses a bad machine cannot compete with another whose machine wastes less in friction and inertia the shipbuilder adhering to the old model is outsailed by one who builds on the mechanicallyjustified waveline principle and as the ability of a nation to hold its own against other nations depends on the skilled activity of its units we see that on mechanical knowledge may turn the national fate  on ascending from the divisions of abstractconcrete science dealing with molar forces to those divisions of it which deal with molecular forces we come to another vast series of applications to this group of sciences joined with the preceding groups we owe the steamengine which does the work of millions of labourers that section of physics which formulates the laws of heat has taught us how to economise fuel in various industries how to increase the produce of smelting furnaces by substituting the hot for the cold blast how to ventilate mines how to prevent explosions by using the safetylamp and through the thermometer how to regulate innumerable processes that section which has the phenomena of light for its subject gives eyes to the old and the myopic aids through the microscope in detecting diseases and adulterations and by improved lighthouses prevents shipwrecks researches in electricity and magnetism have saved innumerable lives and incalculable property through the compass have subserved many arts by the electrotype and now in the telegraph have supplied us with an agency by which for the future mercantile transactions will be regulated and political intercourse carried on while in the details of indoor life from the improved kitchenrange up to the stereoscope on the drawingroom table the applications of advanced physics underlie our comforts and gratifications  still more numerous are the applications of chemistry the bleacher the dyer the calicoprinter are severally occupied in processes that are well or ill done according as they do or do not conform to chemical laws smelting of copper tin zinc lead silver iron must be guided by chemistry sugarrefining gasmaking soapboiling gunpowdermanufacture are operations all partly chemical as are likewise those which produce glass and porcelain whether the distillers wort stops at the alcoholic fermentation or passes into the acetous is a chemical question on which hangs his profit or loss and the brewer if his business is extensive finds it pay to keep a chemist on his premises indeed there is now scarcely any manufacture over some part of which chemistry does not preside nay in these times even agriculture to be profitably carried on must have like guidance the analysis of manures and soils the disclosure of their respective adaptations the use of gypsum or other substance for fixing ammonia the utilisation of coprolites the production of artificial manuresall these are boons of chemistry which it behoves the farmer to acquaint himself with be it in the lucifer match or in disinfected sewage or in photographsin bread made without fermentation or perfumes extracted from refuse we may perceive that chemistry affects all our industries and that therefore knowledge of it concerns every one who is directly or indirectly connected with our industries  of the concrete sciences we come first to astronomy out of this has grown that art of navigation which has made possible the enormous foreign commerce that supports a large part of our population while supplying us with many necessaries and most of our luxuries  geology again is a science knowledge of which greatly aids industrial success now that iron ores are so large a source of wealth now that the duration of our coalsupply has become a question of great interest now that we have a college of mines and a geological survey it is scarcely needful to enlarge on the truth that the study of the earths crust is important to our material welfare  and then the science of lifebiology does not this too bear fundamentally on these processes of indirect selfpreservation with what we ordinarily call manufactures it has indeed little connection but with the allessential manufacturethat of foodit is inseparably connected as agriculture must conform its methods to the phenomena of vegetal and animal life it follows that the science of these phenomena is the rational basis of agriculture various biological truths have indeed been empirically established and acted upon by farmers while yet there has been no conception of them as science such as that particular manures are suited to particular plants that crops of certain kinds unfit the soil for other crops that horses cannot do good work on poor food that such and such diseases of cattle and sheep are caused by such and such conditions these and the everyday knowledge which the agriculturist gains by experience respecting the management of plants and animals constitute his stock of biological facts on the largeness of which greatly depends his success and as these biological facts scanty indefinite rudimentary though they are aid him so essentially judge what must be the value to him of such facts when they become positive definite and exhaustive indeed even now we may see the benefits that rational biology is conferring on him the truth that the production of animal heat implies waste of substance and that therefore preventing loss of heat prevents the need for extra fooda purely theoretical conclusionnow guides the fattening of cattle it is found that by keeping cattle warm fodder is saved similarly with respect to variety of food the experiments of physiologists have shown that not only is change of diet beneficial but that digestion is facilitated by a mixture of ingredients in each meal the discovery that a disorder known as the staggers of which many thousands of sheep have died annually is caused by an entozoon which presses on the brain and that if the creature is extracted through the softened place in the skull which marks its position the sheep usually recovers is another debt which agriculture owes to biology  yet one more science have we to note as bearing directly on industrial successthe science of society men who daily look at the state of the moneymarket glance over prices current discuss the probable crops of corn cotton sugar wool silk weigh the chances of war and from these data decide on their mercantile operations are students of social science empirical and blundering students it may be but still students who gain the prizes or are plucked of their profits according as they do or do not reach the right conclusion not only the manufacturer and the merchant must guide their transactions by calculations of supply and demand based on numerous facts and tacitly recognising sundry general principles of social action but even the retailer must do the like his prosperity very greatly depending upon the correctness of his judgments respecting the future wholesale prices and the future rates of consumption manifestly whoever takes part in the entangled commercial activities of a community is vitally interested in understanding the laws according to which those activities vary  thus to all such as are occupied in the production exchange or distribution of commodities acquaintance with science in some of its departments is of fundamental importance each man who is immediately or remotely implicated in any form of industry and few are not has in some way to deal with the mathematical physical and chemical properties of things perhaps also has a direct interest in biology and certainly has in sociology whether he does or does not succeed well in that indirect selfpreservation which we call getting a good livelihood depends in a great degree on his knowledge of one or more of these sciences not it may be a rational knowledge but still a knowledge though empirical for what we call learning a business really implies learning the science involved in it though not perhaps under the name of science and hence a grounding in science is of great importance both because it prepares for all this and because rational knowledge has an immense superiority over empirical knowledge moreover not only is scientific culture requisite for each that he may understand the how and the why of the things and processes with which he is concerned as maker or distributor but it is often of much moment that he should understand the how and the why of various other things and processes in this age of jointstock undertakings nearly every man above the labourer is interested as capitalist in some other occupation than his own and as thus interested his profit or loss often depends on his knowledge of the sciences bearing on this other occupation here is a mine in the sinking of which many shareholders ruined themselves from not knowing that a certain fossil belonged to the old red sandstone below which no coal is found numerous attempts have been made to construct electromagnetic engines in the hope of superseding steam but had those who supplied the money understood the general law of the correlation and equivalence of forces they might have had better balances at their bankers daily are men induced to aid in carrying out inventions which a mere tyro in science could show to be futile scarcely a locality but has its history of fortunes thrown away over some impossible project  and if already the loss from want of science is so frequent and so great still greater and more frequent will it be to those who hereafter lack science just as fast as productive processes become more scientific which competition will inevitably make them do and just as fast as jointstock undertakings spread which they certainly will so fast must scientific knowledge grow necessary to every one  that which our schoolcourses leave almost entirely out we thus find to be that which most nearly concerns the business of life our industries would cease were it not for the information which men begin to acquire as they best may after their education is said to be finished and were it not for this information from age to age accumulated and spread by unofficial means these industries would never have existed had there been no teaching but such as goes on in our public schools england would now be what it was in feudal times that increasing acquaintance with the laws of phenomena which has through successive ages enabled us to subjugate nature to our needs and in these days gives the common labourer comforts which a few centuries ago kings could not purchase is scarcely in any degree owed to the appointed means of instructing our youth the vital knowledgethat by which we have grown as a nation to what we are and which now underlies our whole existence is a knowledge that has got itself taught in nooks and corners while the ordained agencies for teaching have been mumbling little else but dead formulas                                       we come now to the third great division of human activitiesa division for which no preparation whatever is made if by some strange chance not a vestige of us descended to the remote future save a pile of our schoolbooks or some college examination papers we may imagine how puzzled an antiquary of the period would be on finding in them no sign that the learners were ever likely to be parents this must have been the curriculum for their celibates we may fancy him concluding i perceive here an elaborate preparation for many things especially for reading the books of extinct nations and of coexisting nations from which indeed it seems clear that these people had very little worth reading in their own tongue but i find no reference whatever to the bringing up of children they could not have been so absurd as to omit all training for this gravest of responsibilities evidently then this was the schoolcourse of one of their monastic orders  seriously is it not an astonishing fact that though on the treatment of offspring depend their lives or deaths and their moral welfare or ruin yet not one word of instruction on the treatment of offspring is ever given to those who will by and by be parents is it not monstrous that the fate of a new generation should be left to the chances of unreasoning custom impulse fancyjoined with the suggestions of ignorant nurses and the prejudiced counsel of grandmothers if a merchant commenced business without any knowledge of arithmetic and bookkeeping we should exclaim at his folly and look for disastrous consequences or if before studying anatomy a man set up as a surgical operator we should wonder at his audacity and pity his patients but that parents should begin the difficult task of rearing children without ever having given a thought to the principlesphysical moral or intellectualwhich ought to guide them excites neither surprise at the actors nor pity for their victims  to tens of thousands that are killed add hundreds of thousand that survive with feeble constitutions and millions that grow up with constitutions not so strong as they should be and you will have some idea of the curse inflicted on their offspring by parents ignorant of the laws of life do but consider for a moment that the regimen to which children are subject is hourly telling upon them to their lifelong injury or benefit and that there are twenty ways of going wrong to one way of going right and you will get some idea of the enormous mischief that is almost everywhere inflicted by the thoughtless haphazard system in common use is it decided that a boy shall be clothed in some flimsy short dress and be allowed to go playing about with limbs reddened by cold the decision will tell on his whole future existenceeither in illnesses or in stunted growth or in deficient energy or in a maturity less vigorous than it ought to have been and in consequent hindrances to success and happiness are children doomed to a monotonous dietary or a dietary that is deficient in nutritiveness their ultimate physical power and their efficiency as men and women will inevitably be more or less diminished by it are they forbidden vociferous play or being too illclothed to bear exposure are they kept indoors in cold weather they are certain to fall below that measure of health and strength to which they would else have attained when sons and daughters grow up sickly and feeble parents commonly regard the event as a misfortuneas a visitation of providence thinking after the prevalent chaotic fashion they assume that these evils come without causes or that the causes are supernatural nothing of the kind in some cases the causes are doubtless inherited but in most cases foolish regulations are the causes very generally parents themselves are responsible for all this pain this debility this depression this misery they have undertaken to control the lives of their offspring from hour to hour with cruel carelessness they have neglected to learn anything about these vital processes which they are unceasingly affecting by their commands and prohibitions in utter ignorance of the simplest physiologic laws they have been year by year undermining the constitutions of their children and have so inflicted disease and premature death not only on them but on their descendants  equally great are the ignorance and the consequent injury when we turn from physical training to moral training consider the young mother and her nurserylegislation but a few years ago she was at school where her memory was crammed with words and names and dates and her reflective faculties scarcely in the slightest degree exercisedwhere not one idea was given her respecting the methods of dealing with the opening mind of childhood and where her discipline did not in the least fit her for thinking out methods of her own the intervening years have been passed in practising music in fancywork in novelreading and in partygoing no thought having yet been given to the grave responsibilities of maternity and scarcely any of that solid intellectual culture obtained which would be some preparation for such responsibilities and now see her with an unfolding human character committed to her chargesee her profoundly ignorant of the phenomena with which she has to deal undertaking to do that which can be done but imperfectly even with the aid of the profoundest knowledge she knows nothing about the nature of the emotions their order of evolution their functions or where use ends and abuse begins she is under the impression that some of the feelings are wholly bad which is not true of any one of them and that others are good however far they may be carried which is also not true of any one of them and then ignorant as she is of the structure she has to deal with she is equally ignorant of the effects produced on it by this or that treatment what can be more inevitable than the disastrous results we see hourly arising lacking knowledge of mental phenomena with their cause and consequences her interference is frequently more mischievous than absolute passivity would have been this and that kind of action which are quite normal and beneficial she perpetually thwarts and so diminishes the childs happiness and profit injures its temper and her own and produces estrangement deeds which she thinks it desirable to encourage she gets performed by threats and bribes or by exciting a desire for applause considering little what the inward motive may be so long as the outward conduct conforms and thus cultivating hypocrisy and fear and selfishness in place of good feeling while insisting on truthfulness she constantly sets an example of untruth by threatening penalties which she does not inflict while inculcating selfcontrol she hourly visits on her little ones angry scoldings for acts undeserving of them she has not the remotest idea that in the nursery as in the world that alone is the truly salutary discipline which visits on all conduct good and bad the natural consequencesthe consequences pleasurable or painful which in the nature of things such conduct tends to bring being thus without theoretic guidance and quite incapable of guiding herself by tracing the mental processes going on in her children her rule is impulsive inconsistent mischievous and would indeed be generally ruinous were it not that the overwhelming tendency of the growing mind to assume the moral type of the race usually subordinates all minor influences  and then the culture of the intellectis not this too mismanaged in a similar manner grant that the phenomena of intelligence conform to laws grant that the evolution of intelligence in a child also conforms to laws and it follows inevitably that education cannot be rightly guided without a knowledge of these laws to suppose that you can properly regulate this process of forming and accumulating ideas without understanding the nature of the process is absurd how widely then must teaching as it is differ from teaching as it should be when hardly any parents and but few tutors know anything about psychology as might be expected the established system is grievously at fault alike in matter and in manner while the right class of facts is withheld the wrong class is forcibly administered in the wrong way and in the wrong order under that common limited idea of education which confines it to knowledge gained from books parents thrust primers into the hands of their little ones years too soon to their great injury not recognising the truth that the function of books is supplementarythat they form an indirect means to knowledge when direct means faila means of seeing through other men what you cannot see for yourself teachers are eager to give secondhand facts in place of firsthand facts not perceiving the enormous value of that spontaneous education which goes on in early yearsnot perceiving that a childs restless observation instead of being ignored or checked should be diligently ministered to and made as accurate and complete as possible they insist on occupying its eyes and thoughts with things that are for the time being incomprehensible and repugnant possessed by a superstition which worships the symbols of knowledge instead of the knowledge itself they do not see that only when his acquaintance with the objects and processes of the household the streets and the fields is becoming tolerably exhaustiveonly then should a child be introduced to the new sources of information which books supply and this not only because immediate cognition is of far greater value than mediate cognition but also because the words contained in books can be rightly interpreted into ideas only in proportion to the antecedent experience of things observe next that this formal instruction far too soon commenced is carried on with but little reference to the laws of mental development intellectual progress is of necessity from the concrete to the abstract but regardless of this highly abstract studies such as grammar which should come quite late are begun quite early political geography dead and uninteresting to a child and which should be an appendage of sociological studies is commenced betimes while physical geography comprehensible and comparatively attractive to a child is in great part passed over nearly every subject dealt with is arranged in abnormal order definitions and rules and principles being put first instead of being disclosed as they are in the order of nature through the study of cases and then pervading the whole is the vicious system of rote learninga system of sacrificing the spirit to the letter see the results what with perceptions unnaturally dulled by early thwarting and a coerced attention to bookswhat with the mental confusion produced by teaching subjects before they can be understood and in each of them giving generalisations before the facts of which they are the generalisationswhat with making the pupil a mere passive recipient of others ideas and not in the least leading him to be an active inquirer or selfinstructorand what with taxing the faculties to excess there are very few minds that become as efficient as they might be examinations being once passed books are laid aside the greater part of what has been acquired being unorganised soon drops out of recollection what remains is mostly inertthe art of applying knowledge not having been cultivated and there is but little power either of accurate observation or independent thinking to all which add that while much of the information gained is of relatively small value an immense mass of information of transcendent value is entirely passed over  thus we find the facts to be such as might have been inferred à priori the training of childrenphysical moral and intellectualis dreadfully defective and in great measure it is so because parents are devoid of that knowledge by which this training can alone be rightly guided what is to be expected when one of the most intricate of problems is undertaken by those who have given scarcely a thought to the principles on which its solution depends for shoemaking or housebuilding for the management of a ship or a locomotive engine a long apprenticeship is needful is it then that the unfolding of a human being in body and mind is so comparatively simple a process that any one may superintend and regulate it with no preparation whatever if notif the process is with one exception more complex than any in nature and the task of ministering to it one of surpassing difficulty is it not madness to make no provision for such a task better sacrifice accomplishments than omit this allessential instruction when a father acting on false dogmas adopted without examination has alienated his sons driven them into rebellion by his harsh treatment ruined them and made himself miserable he might reflect that the study of ethology would have been worth pursuing even at the cost of knowing nothing about Æschylus when a mother is mourning over a firstborn that has sunk under the sequelæ of scarletfeverwhen perhaps a candid medical man has confirmed her suspicion that her child would have recovered had not its system been enfeebled by overstudywhen she is prostrate under the pangs of combined grief and remorse it is but a small consolation that she can read dante in the original  thus we see that for regulating the third great division of human activities a knowledge of the laws of life is the one thing needful some acquaintance with the first principles of physiology and the elementary truths of psychology is indispensable for the right bringing up of children we doubt not that many will read this assertion with a smile that parents in general should be expected to acquire a knowledge of subjects so abstruse will seem to them an absurdity and if we proposed that an exhaustive knowledge of these subjects should be obtained by all fathers and mothers the absurdity would indeed be glaring enough but we do not general principles only accompanied by such illustrations as may be needed to make them understood would suffice and these might be readily taughtif not rationally then dogmatically be this as it may however here are the indisputable factsthat the development of children in mind and body follows certain laws that unless these laws are in some degree conformed to by parents death is inevitable that unless they are in a great degree conformed to there must result serious physical and mental defects and that only when they are completely conformed to can a perfect maturity be reached judge then whether all who may one day be parents should not strive with some anxiety to learn what these laws are                                       from the parental functions let us pass now to the functions of the citizen we have here to inquire what knowledge fits a man for the discharge of these functions it cannot be alleged that the need for knowledge fitting him for these functions is wholly overlooked for our schoolcourses contain certain studies which nominally at least bear upon political and social duties of these the only one that occupies a prominent place is history  but as already hinted the information commonly given under this head is almost valueless for purposes of guidance scarcely any of the facts set down in our schoolhistories and very few of those contained in the more elaborate works written for adults illustrate the right principles of political action the biographies of monarchs and our children learn little else throw scarcely any light upon the science of society familiarity with court intrigues plots usurpations or the like and with all the personalities accompanying them aids very little in elucidating the causes of national progress we read of some squabble for power that it led to a pitched battle that such and such were the names of the generals and their leading subordinates that they had each so many thousand infantry and cavalry and so many cannon that they arranged their forces in this and that order that they manoeuvred attacked and fell back in certain ways that at this part of the day such disasters were sustained and at that such advantages gained that in one particular movement some leading officer fell while in another a certain regiment was decimated that after all the changing fortunes of the fight the victory was gained by this or that army and that so many were killed and wounded on each side and so many captured by the conquerors and now out of the accumulated details making up the narrative say which it is that helps you in deciding on your conduct as a citizen supposing even that you had diligently read not only the fifteen decisive battles of the world but accounts of all other battles that history mentions how much more judicious would your vote be at the next election but these are factsinteresting facts you say without doubt they are facts such at least as are not wholly or partially fictions and to many they may be interesting facts but this by no means implies that they are valuable factitious or morbid opinion often gives seeming value to things that have scarcely any a tulipomaniac will not part with a choice bulb for its weight in gold to another man an ugly piece of cracked old china seems his most desirable possession and there are those who give high prices for the relics of celebrated murderers will it be contended that these tastes are any measures of value in the things that gratify them if not then it must be admitted that the liking felt for certain classes of historical facts is no proof of their worth and that we must test their worth as we test the worth of other facts by asking to what uses they are applicable were some one to tell you that your neighbours cat kittened yesterday you would say the information was valueless fact though it might be you would call it an utterly useless facta fact that could in no way influence your actions in lifea fact that would not help you in learning how to live completely well apply the same test to the great mass of historical facts and you will get the same result they are facts from which no conclusions can be drawnunorganisable facts and therefore facts of no service in establishing principles of conduct which is the chief use of facts read them if you like for amusement but do not flatter your self they are instructive  that which constitutes history properly so called is in great part omitted from works on the subject only of late years have historians commenced giving us in any considerable quantity the truly valuable information as in past ages the king was everything and the people nothing so in past histories the doings of the king fill the entire picture to which the national life forms but an obscure background while only now when the welfare of nations rather than of rulers is becoming the dominant idea are historians beginning to occupy themselves with the phenomena of social progress the thing it really concerns us to know is the natural history of society we want all facts which help us to understand how a nation has grown and organised itself among these let us of course have an account of its government with as little as may be of gossip about the men who officered it and as much as possible about the structure principles methods prejudices corruptions etc which it exhibited and let this account include not only the nature and actions of the central government but also those of local governments down to their minutest ramifications let us of course also have a parallel description of the ecclesiastical governmentits organisation its conduct its power its relations to the state and accompanying this the ceremonial creed and religious ideasnot only those nominally believed but those really believed and acted upon let us at the same time be informed of the control exercised by class over class as displayed in social observancesin titles salutations and forms of address let us know too what were all the other customs which regulated the popular life out of doors and indoors including those concerning the relations of the sexes and the relations of parents to children the superstitions also from the more important myths down to the charms in common use should be indicated next should come a delineation of the industrial system showing to what extent the division of labour was carried how trades were regulated whether by caste guilds or otherwise what was the connection between employers and employed what were the agencies for distributing commodities what were the means of communication what was the circulating medium accompanying all which should be given an account of the industrial arts technically considered stating the processes in use and the quality of the products further the intellectual condition of the nation in its various grades should be depicted not only with respect to the kind and amount of education but with respect to the progress made in science and the prevailing manner of thinking the degree of æsthetic culture as displayed in architecture sculpture painting dress music poetry and fiction should be described nor should there be omitted a sketch of the daily lives of the peopletheir food their homes and their amusements and lastly to connect the whole should be exhibited the morals theoretical and practical of all classes as indicated in their laws habits proverbs deeds these facts given with as much brevity as consists with clearness and accuracy should be so grouped and arranged that they may be comprehended in their ensemble and contemplated as mutuallydependent parts of one great whole the aim should be so to present them that men may readily trace the consensus subsisting among them with the view of learning what social phenomena coexist with what other and then the corresponding delineations of succeeding ages should be so managed as to show how each belief institution custom and arrangement was modified and how the consensus of preceding structures and functions was developed into the consensus of succeeding ones such alone is the kind of information respecting past times which can be of service to the citizen for the regulation of his conduct the only history that is of practical value is what may be called descriptive sociology and the highest office which the historian can discharge is that of so narrating the lives of nations as to furnish materials for a comparative sociology and for the subsequent determination of the ultimate laws to which social phenomena conform  but now mark that even supposing an adequate stock of this truly valuable historical knowledge has been acquired it is of comparatively little use without the key and the key is to be found only in science in the absence of the generalisations of biology and psychology rational interpretation of social phenomena is impossible only in proportion as men draw certain rude empirical inferences respecting human nature are they enabled to understand even the simplest facts of social life as for instance the relation between supply and demand and if the most elementary truths of sociology cannot be reached until some knowledge is obtained of how men generally think feel and act under given circumstances then it is manifest that there can be nothing like a wide comprehension of sociology unless through a competent acquaintance with man in all his faculties bodily and mental consider the matter in the abstract and this conclusion is selfevident thussociety is made up of individuals all that is done in society is done by the combined actions of individuals and therefore in individual actions only can be found the solutions of social phenomena but the actions of individuals depend on the laws of their natures and their actions cannot be understood until these laws are understood these laws however when reduced to their simplest expressions prove to be corollaries from the laws of body and mind in general hence it follows that biology and psychology are indispensable as interpreters of sociology or to state the conclusions still more simplyall social phenomena are phenomena of lifeare the most complex manifestations of lifemust conform to the laws of lifeand can be understood only when the laws of life are understood thus then for the regulation of this fourth division of human activities we are as before dependent on science of the knowledge commonly imparted in educational courses very little is of service for guiding a man in his conduct as a citizen only a small part of the history he reads is of practical value and of this small part he is not prepared to make proper use he lacks not only the materials for but the very conception of descriptive sociology and he also lacks those generalisations of the organic sciences without which even descriptive sociology can give him but small aid                                       and now we come to that remaining division of human life which includes the relaxations and amusements filling leisure hours after considering what training best fits for selfpreservation for the obtainment of sustenance for the discharge of parental duties and for the regulation of social and political conduct we have now to consider what training best fits for the miscellaneous ends not included in thesefor the enjoyment of nature of literature and of the fine arts in all their forms postponing them as we do to things that bear more vitally upon human welfare and bringing everything as we have to the test of actual value it will perhaps be inferred that we are inclined to slight these less essential things no greater mistake could be made however we yield to none in the value we attach to aesthetic culture and its pleasures without painting sculpture music poetry and the emotions produced by natural beauty of every kind life would lose half its charm so far from regarding the training and gratification of the tastes as unimportant we believe that in time to come they will occupy a much larger share of human life than now when the forces of nature have been fully conquered to mans usewhen the means of production have been brought to perfectionwhen labour has been economised to the highest degreewhen education has been so systematised that a preparation for the more essential activities may be made with comparative rapidityand when consequently there is a great increase of spare time then will the beautiful both in art and nature rightly fill a large space in the minds of all  but it is one thing to approve of æsthetic culture as largely conducive to human happiness and another thing to admit that it is a fundamental requisite to human happiness however important it may be it must yield precedence to those kinds of culture which bear directly upon daily duties as before hinted literature and the fine arts are made possible by those activities which make individual and social life possible and manifestly that which is made possible must be postponed to that which makes it possible a florist cultivates a plant for the sake of its flower and regards the roots and leaves as of value chiefly because they are instrumental in producing the flower but while as an ultimate product the flower is the thing to which everything else is subordinate the florist has learnt that the root and leaves are intrinsically of greater importance because on them the evolution of the flower depends he bestows every care in rearing a healthy plant and knows it would be folly if in his anxiety to obtain the flower he were to neglect the plant similarly in the case before us architecture sculpture painting music and poetry may truly be called the efflorescence of civilised life but even supposing they are of such transcendent worth as to subordinate the civilised life out of which they grow which can hardly be asserted it will still be admitted that the production of a healthy civilised life must be the first consideration and that culture subserving this must occupy the highest place  and here we see most distinctly the vice of our educational system it neglects the plant for the sake of the flower in anxiety for elegance it forgets substance while it gives no knowledge conducive to selfpreservationwhile of knowledge that facilitates gaining a livelihood it gives but the rudiments and leaves the greater part to be picked up any how in after lifewhile for the discharge of parental functions it makes not the slightest provisionand while for the duties of citizenship it prepares by imparting a mass of facts most of which are irrelevant and the rest without a key it is diligent in teaching whatever adds to refinement polish éclat fully as we may admit that extensive acquaintance with modern languages is a valuable accomplishment which through reading conversation and travel aids in giving a certain finish it by no means follows that this result is rightly purchased at the cost of the vitally important knowledge sacrificed to it supposing it true that classical education conduces to elegance and correctness of style it cannot be said that elegance and correctness of style are comparable in importance to a familiarity with the principles that should guide the rearing of children grant that the taste may be improved by reading the poetry written in extinct languages yet it is not to be inferred that such improvement of taste is equivalent in value to an acquaintance with the laws of health accomplishments the fine arts belleslettres and all those things which as we say constitute the efflorescence of civilisation should be wholly subordinate to that instruction and discipline in which civilisation rests as they occupy the leisure part of life so should they occupy the leisure part of education  recognising thus the true position of aesthetics and holding that while the cultivation of them should form a part of education from its commencement such cultivation should be subsidiary we have now to inquire what knowledge is of most use to this endwhat knowledge best fits for this remaining sphere of activity to this question the answer is still the same as heretofore unexpected though the assertion may be it is nevertheless true that the highest art of every kind is based on sciencethat without science there can be neither perfect production nor full appreciation science in that limited acceptation current in society may not have been possessed by various artists of high repute but acute observers as such artists have been they have always possessed a stock of those empirical generalisations which constitute science in its lowest phase and they have habitually fallen far below perfection partly because their generalisations were comparatively few and inaccurate that science necessarily underlies the fine arts becomes manifest à priori when we remember that artproducts are all more or less representative of objective or subjective phenomena that they can be good only in proportion as they conform to the laws of these phenomena and that before they can thus conform the artist must know what these laws are that this à priori conclusion tallies with experience we shall soon see  youths preparing for the practice of sculpture have to acquaint themselves with the bones and muscles of the human frame in their distribution attachments and movements this is a portion of science and it has been found needful to impart it for the prevention of those many errors which sculptors who do not possess it commit a knowledge of mechanical principles is also requisite and such knowledge not being usually possessed grave mechanical mistakes are frequently made take an instance for the stability of a figure it is needful that the perpendicular from the centre of gravitythe line of direction as it is calledshould fall within the base of support and hence it happens that when a man assumes the attitude known as standing at ease in which one leg is straightened and the other relaxed the line of direction falls within the foot of the straightened leg but sculptors unfamiliar with the theory of equilibrium not uncommonly so represent this attitude that the line of direction falls midway between the feet ignorance of the law of momentum leads to analogous blunders as witness the admired discobolus which as it is posed must inevitably fall forward the moment the quoit is delivered  in painting the necessity for scientific information empirical if not rational is still more conspicuous what gives the grotesqueness of chinese pictures unless their utter disregard of the laws of appearancestheir absurd linear perspective and their want of aerial perspective in what are the drawings of a child so faulty if not in a similar absence of truthan absence arising in great part from ignorance of the way in which the aspects of things vary with the conditions do but remember the books and lectures by which students are instructed or consider the criticisms of ruskin or look at the doings of the preraffaelites and you will see that progress in painting implies increasing knowledge of how effects in nature are produced the most diligent observation if unaided by science fails to preserve from error every painter will endorse the assertion that unless it is known what appearances must exist under given circumstances they often will not be perceived and to know what appearances must exist is in so far to understand the science of appearances from want of science mr j lewis careful painter as he is casts the shadow of a latticewindow in sharplydefined lines upon an opposite wall which he would not have done had he been familiar with the phenomena of penumbræ from want of science mr rosetti catching sight of a peculiar iridescence displayed by certain hairy surfaces under particular lights an iridescence caused by the diffraction of light in passing the hairs commits the error of showing this iridescence on surfaces and in positions where it could not occur  to say that music too has need of scientific aid will cause still more surprise yet it may be shown that music is but an idealisation of the natural language of emotion and that consequently music must be good or bad according as it conforms to the laws of this natural language the various inflections of voice which accompany feelings of different kinds and intensities are the germs out of which music is developed it is demonstrable that these inflections and cadences are not accidental or arbitrary but that they are determined by certain general principles of vital action and that their expressiveness depends on this whence it follows that musical phrases and the melodies built of them can be effective only when they are in harmony with these general principles it is difficult here properly to illustrate this position but perhaps it will suffice to instance the swarms of worthless ballads that infest drawingrooms as compositions which science would forbid they sin against science by setting to music ideas that are not emotional enough to prompt musical expression and they also sin against science by using musical phrases that have no natural relations to the ideas expressed even where these are emotional they are bad because they are untrue and to say they are untrue is to say they are unscientific  even in poetry the same thing holds like music poetry has its root in those natural modes of expression which accompany deep feeling its rhythm its strong and numerous metaphors its hyperboles its violent inversions are simply exaggerations of the traits of excited speech to be good therefore poetry must pay attention to those laws of nervous action which excited speech obeys in intensifying and combining the traits of excited speech it must have due regard to proportionmust not use its appliances without restriction but where the ideas are least emotional must use the forms of poetical expression sparingly must use them more freely as the emotion rises and must carry them to their greatest extent only where the emotion reaches a climax the entire contravention of these principles results in bombast or doggerel the insufficient respect for them is seen in didactic poetry and it is because they are rarely fully obeyed that so much poetry is inartistic  not only is it that the artist of whatever kind cannot produce a truthful work without he understands the laws of the phenomena he represents but it is that he must also understand how the minds of spectators or listeners will be affected by the several peculiarities of his worka question in psychology what impression any artproduct generates manifestly depends upon the mental natures of those to whom it is presented and as all mental natures have certain characteristics in common there must result certain corresponding general principles on which alone artproducts can be successfully framed these general principles cannot be fully understood and applied unless the artist sees how they follow from the laws of mind to ask whether the composition of a picture is good is really to ask how the perceptions and feelings of observers will be affected by it to ask whether a drama is well constructed is to ask whether its situations are so arranged as duly to consult the power of attention of an audience and duly to avoid overtaxing any one class of feelings equally in arranging the leading divisions of a poem or fiction and in combining the words of a single sentence the goodness of the effect depends upon the skill with which the mental energies and susceptibilities of the reader are economised every artist in the course of his education and afterlife accumulates a stock of maxims by which his practice is regulated trace such maxims to their roots and they inevitably lead you down to psychological principles and only when the artist understands these psychological principles and their various corollaries can he work in harmony with them  we do not for a moment believe that science will make an artist while we contend that the leading laws both of objective and subjective phenomena must be understood by him we by no means contend that knowledge of such laws will serve in place of natural perception not the poet only but the artist of every type is born not made what we assert is that innate faculty cannot dispense with the aid of organised knowledge intuition will do much but it will not do all only when genius is married to science can the highest results be produced  as we have above asserted science is necessary not only for the most successful production but also for the full appreciation of the fine arts in what consists the greater ability of a man than of a child to perceive the beauties of a picture unless it is in his more extended knowledge of those truths in nature or life which the picture renders how happens the cultivated gentleman to enjoy a fine poem so much more than a boor does if it is not because his wider acquaintance with objects and actions enables him to see in the poem much that the boor cannot see and if as is here so obvious there must be some familiarity with the things represented before the representation can be appreciated then the representation can be completely appreciated only when the things represented are completely understood the fact is that every additional truth which a word of art expresses gives an additional pleasure to the percipient minda pleasure that is missed by those ignorant of this truth the more realities an artist indicates in any given amount of work the more faculties does he appeal to the more numerous ideas does he suggest the more gratification does he afford but to receive this gratification the spectator listener or reader must know the realities which the artist has indicated and to know these realities is to have that much science  and now let us not overlook the further great fact that not only does science underlie sculpture painting music poetry but that science is itself poetic the current opinion that science and poetry are opposed is a delusion it is doubtless true that as states of consciousness cognition and emotion tend to exclude each other and it is doubtless also true that an extreme activity of the reflective powers tends to deaden the feelings while an extreme activity of the feelings tends to deaden the reflective powers in which sense indeed all orders of activity are antagonistic to each other but it is not true that the facts of science are unpoetical or that the cultivation of science is necessarily unfriendly to the exercise of imagination and the love of the beautiful on the contrary science opens up realms of poetry where to the unscientific all is a blank those engaged in scientific researches constantly show us that they realise not less vividly but more vividly than others the poetry of their subjects whoso will dip into hugh millers works of geology or read mr lewess seaside studies will perceive that science excites poetry rather than extinguishes it and he who contemplates the life of goethe must see that the poet and the man of science can coexist in equal activity is it not indeed an absurd and almost a sacrilegious belief that the more a man studies nature the less he reveres it think you that a drop of water which to the vulgar eye is but a drop of water loses anything in the eye of the physicist who knows that its elements are held together by a force which if suddenly liberated would produce a flash of lightning think you that what is carelessly looked upon by the uninitiated as a mere snowflake does not suggest higher associations to one who had seen through a microscope the wondrouslyvaried and elegant forms of snowcrystals think you that the rounded rock marked with parallel scratches calls up as much poetry in an ignorant mind as in the mind of a geologist who knows that over this rock a glacier slid a million years ago the truth is that those who have never entered upon scientific pursuits are blind to most of the poetry by which they are surrounded whoever has not in youth collected plants and insects knows not half the halo of interest which lanes and hedgerows can assume whoever has not sought for fossils has little idea of the poetical associations that surround the places where imbedded treasures were found whoever at the seaside has not had a microscope and aquarium has yet to learn what the highest pleasures of the seaside are sad indeed is it to see how men occupy themselves with trivialities and are indifferent to the grandest phenomenacare not to understand the architecture of the heavens but are deeply interested in some contemptible controversy about the intrigues of mary queen of scotsare learnedly critical over a greek ode and pass by without a glance that grand epic written by the finger of god upon the strata of the earth  we find then that even for this remaining division of human activities scientific culture is the proper preparation we find that aesthetics in general are necessarily based upon scientific principles and can be pursued with complete success only through an acquaintance with these principles we find that for the criticism and due appreciation of works of art a knowledge of the constitution of things or in other words a knowledge of science is requisite and we not only find that science is the handmaid to all forms of art and poetry but that rightly regarded science is itself poetic                                       thus far our question has been the worth of knowledge of this or that kind for purposes of guidance we have now to judge the relative value of different kinds of knowledge for purposes of discipline this division of our subject we are obliged to treat with comparative brevity and happily no very lengthened treatment of it is needed having found what is best for the one end we have by implication found what is best for the other we may be quite sure that the acquirement of those classes of facts which are most useful for regulating conduct involves a mental exercise best fitted for strengthening the faculties it would be utterly contrary to the beautiful economy of nature if one kind of culture were needed for the gaining of information and another kind were needed as a mental gymnastic everywhere throughout creation we find faculties developed through the performance of those functions which it is their office to perform not through the performance of artificial exercises devised to fit them for those functions the red indian acquires the swiftness and agility which make him a successful hunter by the actual pursuit of animals and through the miscellaneous activities of his life he gains a better balance of physical powers than gymnastics ever give that skill in tracking enemies and prey which he had reached after long practice implies a subtlety of perception far exceeding anything produced by artificial training and similarly in all cases from the bushman whose eye habitually employed in identifying distant objects that are to be pursued or fled from has acquired a telescopic range to the accountant whose daily practice enables him to add up several columns of figures simultaneously we find that the highest power of a faculty results from the discharge of those duties which the conditions of life require it to discharge and we may be certain à priori that the same law holds throughout education the education of most value for guidance must at the same time be the education of most value for discipline let us consider the evidence  one advantage claimed for that devotion to languagelearning which forms so prominent a feature in the ordinary curriculum is that the memory is thereby strengthened this is assumed to be an advantage peculiar to the study of words but the truth is that the sciences afford far wider fields for the exercise of memory it is no slight task to remember everything about our solar system much more to remember all that is known concerning the structure of our galaxy the number of compound substances to which chemistry daily adds is so great that few save professors can enumerate them and to recollect the atomic constitutions and affinities of all these compounds is scarcely possible without making chemistry the occupation of life in the enormous mass of phenomena presented by the earths crust and in the still more enormous mass of phenomena presented by the fossils it contains there is matter which it takes the geological student years of application to master each leading division of physicssound heat light electricityincludes facts numerous enough to alarm any one proposing to learn them all and when we pass to the organic sciences the effort of memory required becomes still greater in human anatomy alone the quantity of detail is so great that the young surgeon has commonly to get it up halfadozen times before he can permanently retain it the number of species of plants which botanists distinguish amounts to some 320000 while the varied forms of animal life with which the zoologist deals are estimated at some 2000000 so vast is the accumulation of facts which men of science have before them that only by dividing and subdividing their labours can they deal with it to a detailed knowledge of his own division each adds but a general knowledge of the allied ones joined perhaps to a rudimentary acquaintance with some others surely then science cultivated even to a very moderate extent affords adequate exercise for memory to say the very least it involves quite as good a discipline for this faculty as language does  but now mark that while for the training of mere memory science is as good as if not better than language it has an immense superiority in the kind of memory it trains in the acquirement of a language the connections of ideas to be established in the mind correspond to facts that are in great measure accidental whereas in the acquirement of science the connections of ideas to be established in the mind correspond to facts that are mostly necessary it is true that the relations of words to their meanings are in one sense natural that the genesis of these relations may be traced back a certain distance though rarely to the beginning and that the laws of this genesis form a branch of mental sciencethe science of philology but since it will not be contended that in the acquisition of languages as ordinarily carried on these natural relations between words and their meanings are habitually traced and their laws explained it must be admitted that they are commonly learned as fortuitous relations on the other hand the relations which science presents are causal relations and when properly taught are understood as such while language familiarises with nonrational relations science familiarises with rational relations while the one exercises memory only the other exercises both memory and understanding  observe next that a great superiority of science over language as a means of discipline is that it cultivates the judgment as in a lecture on mental education delivered at the royal institution professor faraday well remarks the most common intellectual fault is deficiency of judgment society speaking generally he says is not only ignorant as respects education of the judgment but it is also ignorant of its ignorance and the cause to which he ascribes this state is want of scientific culture the truth of his conclusion is obvious correct judgment with regard to surrounding objects events and consequences becomes possible only through knowledge of the way in which surrounding phenomena depend on each other no extent of acquaintance with the meanings of words will guarantee correct inferences respecting causes and effects the habit of drawing conclusions from data and then of verifying those conclusions by observation and experiment can alone give the power of judging correctly and that it necessitates this habit is one of the immense advantages of science  not only however for intellectual discipline is science the best but also for moral discipline the learning of languages tends if anything further to increase the already undue respect for authority such and such are the meanings of these words says the teacher of the dictionary so and so is the rule in this case says the grammar by the pupil these dicta are received as unquestionable his constant attitude of mind is that of submission to dogmatic teaching and a necessary result is a tendency to accept without inquiry whatever is established quite opposite is the mental tone generated by the cultivation of science science makes constant appeal to individual reason its truths are not accepted on authority alone but all are at liberty to test themnay in many cases the pupil is required to think out his own conclusions every step in a scientific investigation is submitted to his judgment he is not asked to admit it without seeing it to be true and the trust in his own powers thus produced is further increased by the uniformity with which nature justifies his inferences when they are correctly drawn from all which there flows that independence which is a most valuable element in character nor is this the only moral benefit bequeathed by scientific culture when carried on as it should always be as much as possible under the form of original research it exercises perseverance and sincerity as says professor tyndall of inductive inquiry it requires patient industry and an humble and conscientious acceptance of what nature reveals the first condition of success is an honest receptivity and a willingness to abandon all preconceived notions however cherished if they be found to contradict the truth believe me a selfrenunciation which has something noble in it and of which the world never hears is often enacted in the private experience of the true votary of science  lastly we have to assertand the assertion will we doubt not cause extreme surprisethat the discipline of science is superior to that of our ordinary education because of the religious culture that it gives of course we do not here use the words scientific and religious in their ordinary limited acceptations but in their widest and highest acceptations doubtless to the superstitions that pass under the name of religion science is antagonistic but not to the essential religion which these superstitions merely hide doubtless too in much of the science that is current there is a pervading spirit of irreligion but not in that true science which had passed beyond the superficial into the profound       true science and true religion says professor huxley at the      close of a recent course of lectures are twinsisters and the      separation of either from the other is sure to prove the death of      both science prospers exactly in proportion as it is religious      and religion flourishes in exact proportion to the scientific depth      and firmness of its basis the great deeds of philosophers have      been less the fruit of their intellect than of the direction of      that intellect by an eminently religious tone of mind truth has      yielded herself rather to their patience their love their      singleheartedness and their selfdenial than to their logical      acumen  so far from science being irreligious as many think it is the neglect of science that is irreligiousit is the refusal to study the surrounding creation that is irreligious take a humble simile suppose a writer were daily saluted with praises couched in superlative language suppose the wisdom the grandeur the beauty of his works were the constant topics of the eulogies addressed to him suppose those who unceasingly uttered these eulogies on his works were content with looking at the outsides of them and had never opened them much less tried to understand them what value should we put upon their praises what should we think of their sincerity yet comparing small things to great such is the conduct of mankind in general in reference to the universe and its cause nay it is worse not only do they pass by without study these things which they daily proclaim to be so wonderful but very frequently they condemn as mere triflers those who give time to the observation of naturethey actually scorn those who show any active interest in these marvels we repeat then that not science but the neglect of science is irreligious devotion to science is a tacit worshipa tacit recognition of worth in the things studied and by implication in their cause it is not a mere liphomage but a homage expressed in actionsnot a mere professed respect but a respect proved by the sacrifice of time thought and labour  nor is it thus only that true science is essentially religious it is religious too inasmuch as it generates a profound respect for and an implicit faith in those uniformities of action which all things disclose by accumulated experiences the man of science acquires a thorough belief in the unchanging relations of phenomenain the invariable connection of cause and consequencein the necessity of good or evil results instead of the rewards and punishments of traditional belief which people vaguely hope they may gain or escape spite of their disobedience he finds that there are rewards and punishments in the ordained constitution of things and that the evil results of disobedience are inevitable he sees that the laws to which we must submit are both inexorable and beneficent he sees that in conforming to them the process of things is ever towards a greater perfection and a higher happiness hence he is led constantly to insist on them and is indignant when they are disregarded and thus does he by asserting the eternal principles of things and the necessity of obeying them prove himself intrinsically religious  add lastly the further religious aspect of science that it alone can give us true conceptions of ourselves and our relation to the mysteries of existence at the same time that it shows us all which can be known it shows us the limits beyond which we can know nothing not by dogmatic assertion does it teach the impossibility of comprehending the ultimate cause of things but it leads us clearly to recognise this impossibility by bringing us in every direction to boundaries we cannot cross it realises to us in a way which nothing else can the littleness of human intelligence in the face of that which transcends human intelligence while towards the traditions and authorities of men its attitude may be proud before the impenetrable veil which hides the absolute its attitude is humblea true pride and a true humility only the sincere man of science and by this title we do not mean the mere calculator of distances or analyser of compounds or labeller of species but him who through lower truths seeks higher and eventually the highestonly the genuine man of science we say can truly know how utterly beyond not only human knowledge but human conception is the universal power of which nature and life and thought are manifestations  we conclude then that for discipline as well as for guidance science is of chiefest value in all its effects learning the meanings of things is better than learning the meanings of words whether for intellectual moral or religious training the study of surrounding phenomena is immensely superior to the study of grammars and lexicons                                       thus to the question we set out withwhat knowledge is of most worththe uniform reply isscience this is the verdict on all the counts for direct selfpreservation or the maintenance of life and health the allimportant knowledge isscience for that indirect selfpreservation which we call gaining a livelihood the knowledge of greatest value isscience for the due discharge of parental functions the proper guidance is to be found only inscience for that interpretation of national life past and present without which the citizen cannot rightly regulate his conduct the indispensable key isscience alike for the most perfect production and highest enjoyment of art in all its forms the needful preparation is stillscience and for purposes of disciplineintellectual moral religiousthe most efficient study is once morescience the question which at first seemed so perplexed has become in the course of our inquiry comparatively simple we have not to estimate the degrees of importance of different orders of human activity and different studies as severally fitting us for them since we find that the study of science in its most comprehensive meaning is the best preparation for all these orders of activity we have not to decide between the claims of knowledge of great though conventional value and knowledge of less though intrinsic value seeing that the knowledge which proves to be of most value in all other respects is intrinsically most valuable its worth is not dependent upon opinion but is as fixed as is the relation of man to the surrounding world necessary and eternal as are its truths all science concerns all mankind for all time equally at present and in the remotest future must it be of incalculable importance for the regulation of their conduct that men should understand the science of life physical mental and social and that they should understand all other science as a key to the science of life  and yet this study immensely transcending all other in importance is that which in an age of boasted education receives the least attention while what we call civilisation could never have arisen had it not been for science science forms scarcely an appreciable element in our socalled civilised training though to the progress of science we owe it that millions find support where once there was food only for thousands yet of these millions but a few thousands pay any respect to that which has made their existence possible though increasing knowledge of the properties and relations of things has not only enabled wandering tribes to grow into populous nations but has given to the countless members of these populous nations comforts and pleasures which their few naked ancestors never even conceived or could have believed yet is this kind of knowledge only now receiving a grudging recognition in our highest educational institutions to the slowly growing acquaintance with the uniform coexistences and sequences of phenomenato the establishment of invariable laws we owe our emancipation from the grossest superstitions but for science we should be still worshipping fetishes or with hecatombs of victims propitiating diabolical deities and yet this science which in place of the most degrading conceptions of things has given us some insight into the grandeurs of creation is written against in our theologies and frowned upon from our pulpits  paraphrasing an eastern fable we may say that in the family of knowledges science is the household drudge who in obscurity hides unrecognised perfections to her has been committed all the works by her skill intelligence and devotion have all conveniences and gratifications been obtained and while ceaselessly ministering to the rest she has been kept in the background that her haughty sisters might flaunt their fripperies in the eyes of the world the parallel holds yet further for we are fast coming to the dénouement when the positions will be changed and while these haughty sisters sink into merited neglect science proclaimed as highest alike in worth and beauty will reign supreme     intellectual education   there cannot fail to be a relationship between the successive systems of education and the successive social states with which they have coexisted having a common origin in the national mind the institutions of each epoch whatever be their special functions must have a family likeness when men received their creed and its interpretations from an infallible authority deigning no explanations it was natural that the teaching of children should be purely dogmatic while believe and ask no questions was the maxim of the church it was fitly the maxim of the school conversely now that protestantism has gained for adults a right of private judgment and established the practice of appealing to reason there is harmony in the change that has made juvenile instruction a process of exposition addressed to the understanding along with political despotism stern in its commands ruling by force of terror visiting trifling crimes with death and implacable in its vengeance on the disloyal there necessarily grew up an academic discipline similarly harsha discipline of multiplied injunctions and blows for every breach of thema discipline of unlimited autocracy upheld by rods and ferules and the blackhole on the other hand the increase of political liberty the abolition of laws restricting individual action and the amelioration of the criminal code have been accompanied by a kindred progress towards noncoercive education the pupil is hampered by fewer restraints and other means than punishments are used to govern him in those ascetic days when men acting on the greatestmisery principle held that the more gratifications they denied themselves the more virtuous they were they as a matter of course considered that the best education which most thwarted the wishes of their children and cut short all spontaneous activity withyou mustnt do so while on the contrary now that happiness is coming to be regarded as a legitimate aimnow that hours of labour are being shortened and popular recreations providedparents and teachers are beginning to see that most childish desires may rightly be gratified that childish sports should be encouraged and that the tendencies of the growing mind are not altogether so diabolical as was supposed the age in which all believed that trades must be established by bounties and prohibitions that manufacturers needed their materials and qualities and prices to be prescribed and that the value of money could be determined by law was an age which unavoidably cherished the notions that a childs mind could be made to order that its powers were to be imparted by the schoolmaster that it was a receptacle into which knowledge was to be put and there built up after the teachers ideal in this freetrade era however when we are learning that there is much more selfregulation in things than was supposed that labour and commerce and agriculture and navigation can do better without management than with it that political governments to be efficient must grow up from within and not be imposed from without we are also being taught that there is a natural process of mental evolution which is not to be disturbed without injury that we may not force on the unfolding mind our artificial forms but that psychology also discloses to us a law of supply and demand to which if we would not do harm we must conform thus alike in its oracular dogmatism in its harsh discipline in its multiplied restrictions in its professed asceticism and in its faith in the devices of men the old educational regime was akin to the social systems with which it was contemporaneous and similarly in the reverse of these characteristics our modern modes of culture correspond to our more liberal religious and political institutions  but there remain further parallelisms to which we have not yet adverted that namely between the processes by which these respective changes have been wrought out and that between the several states of heterogeneous opinion to which they have led some centuries ago there was uniformity of beliefreligious political and educational all men were romanists all were monarchists all were disciples of aristotle and no one thought of calling in question that grammarschool routine under which all were brought up the same agency has in each case replaced this uniformity by a constantlyincreasing diversity that tendency towards assertion of the individuality which after contributing to produce the great protestant movement has since gone on to produce an everincreasing number of sectsthat tendency which initiated political parties and out of the two primary ones has in these modern days evolved a multiplicity to which every year addsthat tendency which led to the baconian rebellion against the schools and has since originated here and abroad sundry new systems of thoughtis a tendency which in education also has caused divisions and the accumulation of methods as external consequences of the same internal change these processes have necessarily been more or less simultaneous the decline of authority whether papal philosophic kingly or tutorial is essentially one phenomenon in each of its aspects a leaning towards free action is seen alike in the working out of the change itself and in the new forms of theory and practice to which the change has given birth  while many will regret this multiplication of schemes of juvenile culture the catholic observer will discern in it a means of ensuring the final establishment of a rational system whatever may be thought of theological dissent it is clear that dissent in education results in facilitating inquiry by the division in labour were we in possession of the true method divergence from it would of course be prejudicial but the true method having to be found the efforts of numerous independent seekers carrying out their researches in different directions constitute a better agency for finding it than any that could be devised each of them struck by some new thought which probably contains more or less of basis in factseach of them zealous on behalf of his plan fertile in expedients to test its correctness and untiring in his efforts to make known its successeach of them merciless in his criticism on the rest there cannot fail by composition of forces to be a gradual approximation of all towards the right course whatever portion of the normal method any one has discovered must by the constant exhibition of its results force itself into adoption whatever wrong practices he has joined with it must by repeated experiment and failure be exploded and by this aggregation of truths and elimination of errors there must eventually be developed a correct and complete body of doctrine of the three phases through which human opinion passesthe unanimity of the ignorant the disagreement of the inquiring and the unanimity of the wiseit is manifest that the second is the parent of the third they are not sequences in time only they are sequences in causation however impatiently therefore we may witness the present conflict of educational systems and however much we may regret its accompanying evils we must recognise it as a transition stage needful to be passed through and beneficent in its ultimate effects  meanwhile may we not advantageously take stock of our progress after fifty years of discussion experiment and comparison of results may we not expect a few steps towards the goal to be already made good some old methods must by this time have fallen out of use some new ones must have become established and many others must be in process of general abandonment or adoption probably we may see in these various changes when put side by side similar characteristicsmay find in them a common tendency and so by inference may get a clue to the direction in which experience is leading us and gather hints how we may achieve yet further improvements let us then as a preliminary to a deeper consideration of the matter glance at the leading contrasts between the education of the past and that of the present                                       the suppression of every error is commonly followed by a temporary ascendency of the contrary one and so it happened that after the ages when physical development alone was aimed at there came an age when culture of the mind was the sole solicitudewhen children had lessonbooks put before them at between two and three years old and the getting of knowledge was thought the one thing needful as further it usually happens that after one of these reactions the next advance is achieved by coordinating the antagonist errors and perceiving that they are opposite sides of one truth so we are now coming to the conviction that body and mind must both be cared for and the whole thing being unfolded the forcingsystem has been by many given up and precocity is discouraged people are beginning to see that the first requisite to success in life is to be a good animal the best brain is found of little service if there be not enough vital energy to work it and hence to obtain the one by sacrificing the source of the other is now considered a follya folly which the eventual failure of juvenile prodigies constantly illustrates thus we are discovering the wisdom of the saying that one secret in education is to know how wisely to lose time  the once universal practice of learning by rote is daily falling more into discredit all modern authorities condemn the old mechanical way of teaching the alphabet the multiplication table is now frequently taught experimentally in the acquirement of languages the grammarschool plan is being superseded by plans based on the spontaneous process followed by the child in gaining its mother tongue describing the methods there used the reports on the training school at battersea saythe instruction in the whole preparatory course is chiefly oral and is illustrated as much as possible by appeals to nature and so throughout the rotesystem like ether systems of its age made more of the forms and symbols than of the things symbolised to repeat the words correctly was everything to understand their meaning nothing and thus the spirit was sacrificed to the letter it is at length perceived that in this case as in others such a result is not accidental but necessarythat in proportion as there is attention to the signs there must be inattention to the things signified or that as montaigne long ago saidsçavoir par coeur nest pas sçavoir  along with roteteaching is declining also the nearlyallied teaching by rules the particulars first and then the generalisation is the new methoda method as the battersea school reports remarks which though the reverse of the method usually followed which consists in giving the pupil the rule first is yet proved by experience to be the right one ruleteaching is now condemned as imparting a merely empirical knowledgeas producing an appearance of understanding without the reality to give the net product of inquiry without the inquiry that leads to it is found to be both enervating and inefficient general truths to be of due and permanent use must be earned easy come easy go is a saying as applicable to knowledge as to wealth while rules lying isolated in the mindnot joined to its other contents as outgrowths from themare continually forgotten the principles which those rules express piecemeal become when once reached by the understanding enduring possessions while the ruletaught youth is at sea when beyond his rules the youth instructed in principles solves a new case as readily as an old one between a mind of rules and a mind of principles there exists a difference such as that between a confused heap of materials and the same materials organised into a complete whole with all its parts bound together of which types this last has not only the advantage that its constituent parts are better retained but the much greater advantage that it forms an efficient agent for inquiry for independent thought for discoveryends for which the first is useless nor let it be supposed that this is a simile only it is the literal truth the union of facts into generalisations is the organisation of knowledge whether considered as an objective phenomenon or a subjective one and the mental grasp may be measured by the extent to which this organisation is carried  from the substitution of principles for rules and the necessarily coordinate practice of leaving abstractions untaught till the mind has been familiarised with the facts from which they are abstracted has resulted the postponement of some once early studies to a late period this is exemplified in the abandonment of that intensely stupid custom the teaching of grammar to children as m marcel saysit may without hesitation be affirmed that grammar is not the steppingstone but the finishing instrument as mr wyse arguesgrammar and syntax are a collection of laws and rules rules are gathered from practice they are the results of induction to which we come by long observation and comparison of facts it is in fine the science the philosophy of language in following the process of nature neither individuals nor nations ever arrive at the science first a language is spoken and poetry written many years before either a grammar or prosody is even thought of men did not wait till aristotle had constructed his logic to reason in short as grammar was made after language so ought it to be taught after language an inference which all who recognise the relationship between the evolution of the race and that of the individual will see to be unavoidable  of new practices that have grown up during the decline of these old ones the most important is the systematic culture of the powers of observation after long ages of blindness men are at last seeing that the spontaneous activity of the observing faculties in children has a meaning and a use what was once thought mere purposeless action or play or mischief as the case might be is now recognised as the process of acquiring a knowledge on which all afterknowledge is based hence the wellconceived but illconducted system of objectlessons the saying of bacon that physics is the mother of the sciences has come to have a meaning in education without an accurate acquaintance with the visible and tangible properties of things our conceptions must be erroneous our inferences fallacious and our operations unsuccessful the education of the senses neglected all after education partakes of a drowsiness a haziness an insufficiency which it is impossible to cure indeed if we consider it we shall find that exhaustive observation is an element in all great success it is not to artists naturalists and men of science only that it is needful it is not only that the physician depends on it for the correctness of his diagnosis and that to the engineer it is so important that some years in the workshop are prescribed for him but we may see that the philosopher also is fundamentally one who observes relationships of things which others had overlooked and that the poet too is one who sees the fine facts in nature which all recognise when pointed out but did not before remark nothing requires more to be insisted on than that vivid and complete impressions are allessential no sound fabric of wisdom can be woven out of a rotten rawmaterial  while the old method of presenting truths in the abstract has been falling out of use there has been a corresponding adoption of the new method of presenting them in the concrete the rudimentary facts of exact science are now being learnt by direct intuition as textures and tastes and colours are learnt employing the ballframe for first lessons in arithmetic exemplifies this it is well illustrated too in professor de morgans mode of explaining the decimal notation m marcel rightly repudiating the old system of tables teaches weights and measures by referring to the actual yard and foot pound and ounce gallon and quart and lets the discovery of their relationships be experimental the use of geographical models and models of the regular bodies etc as introductory to geography and geometry respectively are facts of the same class manifestly a common trait of these methods is that they carry each childs mind through a process like that which the mind of humanity at large has gone through the truths of number of form of relationship in position were all originally drawn from objects and to present these truths to the child in the concrete is to let him learn them as the race learnt them by and by perhaps it will be seen that he cannot possibly learn them in any other way for that if he is made to repeat them as abstractions the abstractions can have no meaning for him until he finds that they are simply statements of what he intuitively discerns  but of all the changes taking place the most significant is the growing desire to make the acquirement of knowledge pleasurable rather than painfula desire based on the more or less distinct perception that at each age the intellectual action which a child likes is a healthful one for it and conversely there is a spreading opinion that the rise of an appetite for any kind of information implies that the unfolding mind has become fit to assimilate it and needs it for purposes of growth and that on the other hand the disgust felt towards such information is a sign either that it is prematurely presented or that it is presented in an indigestible form hence the efforts to make early education amusing and all education interesting hence the lectures on the value of play hence the defence of nursery rhymes and fairy tales daily we more and more conform our plans to juvenile opinion does the child like this or that kind of teachingdoes he take to it we constantly ask his natural desire of variety should be indulged says m marcel and the gratification of his curiosity should be combined with his improvement lessons he again remarks should cease before the child evinces symptoms of weariness and so with later education short breaks during schoolhours excursions into the country amusing lectures choral songsin these and many like traits the change may be discerned asceticism is disappearing out of education as out of life and the usual test of political legislationits tendency to promote happinessis beginning to be in a great degree the test of legislation for the school and the nursery  what now is the common characteristic of these several changes is it not an increasing conformity to the methods of nature the relinquishment of early forcing against which nature rebels and the leaving of the first years for exercise of the limbs and senses show this the superseding of rotelearnt lessons by lessons orally and experimentally given like those of the field and playground shows this the disuse of ruleteaching and the adoption of teaching by principlesthat is the leaving of generalisations until there are particulars to base them onshow this the system of objectlessons shows this the teaching of the rudiments of science in the concrete instead of the abstract shows this and above all this tendency is shown in the variouslydirected efforts to present knowledge in attractive forms and so to make the acquirement of it pleasurable for as it is the order of nature in all creatures that the gratification accompanying the fulfilment of needful functions serves as a stimulus to their fulfilmentas during the selfeducation of the young child the delight taken in the biting of corals and the pulling to pieces of toys becomes the prompter to actions which teach it the properties of matter it follows that in choosing the succession of subjects and the modes of instruction which most interest the pupil we are fulfilling natures behests and adjusting our proceedings to the laws of life  thus then we are on the highway towards the doctrine long ago enunciated by pestalozzi that alike in its order and its methods education must conform to the natural process of mental evolutionthat there is a certain sequence in which the faculties spontaneously develop and a certain kind of knowledge which each requires during its development and that it is for us to ascertain this sequence and supply this knowledge all the improvements above alluded to are partial applications of this general principle a nebulous perception of it now prevails among teachers and it is daily more insisted on in educational works the method of nature is the archetype of all methods says m marcel the vital principle in the pursuit is to enable the pupil rightly to instruct himself writes mr wyse the more science familiarises us with the constitution of things the more do we see in them an inherent selfsufficingness a higher knowledge tends continually to limit our interference with the processes of life as in medicine the old heroic treatment has given place to mild treatment and often no treatment save a normal regimenas we have found that it is not needful to mould the bodies of babes by bandaging them in papoosefashion or otherwiseas in gaols it is being discovered that no cunninglydevised discipline of ours is so efficient in producing reformation as the natural discipline of selfmaintenance by productive labour so in education we are finding that success is to be achieved only by making our measures subservient to that spontaneous unfolding which all minds go through in their progress to maturity  of course this fundamental principle of tuition that the arrangement of matter and method must correspond with the order of evolution and mode of activity of the facultiesa principle so obviously true that once stated it seems almost selfevidenthas never been wholly disregarded teachers have unavoidably made their schoolcourses coincide with it in some degree for the simple reason that education is possible only on that condition boys were never taught the ruleofthree until after they had learnt addition they were not set to write exercises before they had got into their copybooks conic sections have always been preceded by euclid but the error of the old methods consists in this that they do not recognise in detail what they are obliged to recognise in general yet the principle applies throughout if from the time when a child is able to conceive two things as related in position years must elapse before it can form a true concept of the earth as a sphere made up of land and sea covered with mountains forests rivers and cities revolving on its axis and sweeping round the sunif it gets from the one concept to the other by degreesif the intermediate concepts which it forms are consecutively larger and more complicated is it not manifest that there is a general succession through which alone it can pass that each larger concept is made by the combination of smaller ones and presupposes them and that to present any of these compound concepts before the child is in possession of its constituent ones is only less absurd than to present the final concept of the series before the initial one in the mastering of every subject some course of increasingly complex ideas has to be gone through the evolution of the corresponding faculties consists in the assimilation of these which in any true sense is impossible without they are put into the mind in the normal order and when this order is not followed the result is that they are received with apathy or disgust and that unless the pupil is intelligent enough eventually to fill up the gaps himself they lie in his memory as dead facts capable of being turned to little or no use  but why trouble ourselves about any curriculum at all it may be asked if it be true that the mind like the body has a predetermined course of evolutionif it unfolds spontaneouslyif its successive desires for this or that kind of information arise when these are severally required for its nutritionif there thus exists in itself a prompter to the right species of activity at the right time why interfere in any way why not leave children wholly to the discipline of naturewhy not remain quite passive and let them get knowledge as they best canwhy not be consistent throughout this is an awkwardlooking question plausibly implying as it does that a system of complete laissezfaire is the logical outcome of the doctrines set forth it seems to furnish a disproof of them by reductio ad absurdum in truth however they do not when rightly understood commit us to any such untenable position a glance at the physical analogies will clearly show this it is a general law of life that the more complex the organism to be produced the longer the period during which it is dependent on a parent organism for food and protection the difference between the minute rapidlyformed and selfmoving spore of a conferva and the slowlydeveloped seed of a tree with its multiplied envelopes and large stock of nutriment laid by to nourish the germ during its first stages of growth illustrates this law in its application to the vegetal world among animals we may trace it in a series of contrasts from the monad whose spontaneouslydivided halves are as selfsufficing the moment after their separation as was the original whole up to man whose offspring not only passes through a protracted gestation and subsequently long depends on the breast for sustenance but after that must have its food artificially administered must when it has learned to feed itself continue to have bread clothing and shelter provided and does not acquire the power of complete selfsupport until a time varying from fifteen to twenty years after its birth now this law applies to the mind as to the body for mental pabulum also every higher creature and especially man is at first dependent on adult aid lacking the ability to move about the babe is almost as powerless to get materials on which to exercise its perceptions as it is to get supplies for its stomach unable to prepare its own food it is in like manner unable to reduce many kinds of knowledge to a fit form for assimilation the language through which all higher truths are to be gained it wholly derives from those surrounding it and we see in such an example as the wild boy of aveyron the arrest of development that results when no help is received from parents and nurses thus in providing from day to day the right kind of facts prepared in the right manner and giving them in due abundance at appropriate intervals there is as much scope for active ministration to a childs mind as to its body in either case it is the chief function of parents to see that the conditions requisite to growth are maintained and as in supplying aliment and clothing and shelter they may fulfil this function without at all interfering with the spontaneous development of the limbs and viscera either in their order or mode so they may supply sounds for imitation objects for examination books for reading problems for solution and if they use neither direct nor indirect coercion may do this without in any way disturbing the normal process of mental evolution or rather may greatly facilitate that process hence the admission of the doctrines enunciated does not as some might argue involve the abandonment of teaching but leaves ample room for an active and elaborate course of culture                                       passing from generalities to special considerations it is to be remarked that in practice the pestalozzian system seems scarcely to have fulfilled the promise of its theory we hear of children not at all interested in its lessonsdisgusted with them rather and so far as we can gather the pestalozzian school have not turned out any unusual proportion of distinguished men if even they have reached the average we are not surprised at this the success of every appliance depends mainly upon the intelligence with which it is used it is a trite remark that having the choicest tools an unskilful artisan will botch his work and bad teachers will fail even with the best methods indeed the goodness of the method becomes in such case a cause of failure as to continue the simile the perfection of the tool becomes in undisciplined hands a source of imperfection in results a simple unchanging almost mechanical routine of tuition may be carried out by the commonest intellects with such small beneficial effect as it is capable of producing but a complete systema system as heterogeneous in its appliances as the mind in its facultiesa system proposing a special means for each special end demands for its right employment powers such as few teachers possess the mistress of a dameschool can hear spellinglessons and any hedgeschoolmaster can drill boys in the multiplicationtable but to teach spelling rightly by using the powers of the letters instead of their names or to instruct in numerical combinations by experimental synthesis a modicum of understanding is needful and to pursue a like rational course throughout the entire range of studies asks an amount of judgment of invention of intellectual sympathy of analytical faculty which we shall never see applied to it while the tutorial official is held in such small esteem true education is practicable only by a true philosopher judge then what prospect a philosophical method now has of being acted out knowing so little as we yet do of psychology and ignorant as our teachers are of that little what chance has a system which requires psychology for its basis  further hindrance and discouragement has arisen from confounding the pestalozzian principle with the forms in which it has been embodied because particular plans have not answered expectation discredit has been cast upon the doctrine associated with them no inquiry being made whether these plans truly conform to the doctrine judging as usual by the concrete rather than the abstract men have blamed the theory for the bunglings of the practice it is as though the first futile attempt to construct a steamengine had been held to prove that steam could not be used as a motive power let it be constantly borne in mind that while right in his fundamental ideas pestalozzi was not therefore right in all his applications of them as described even by his admirers pestalozzi was a man of partial intuitionsa man who had occasional flashes of insight rather than a man of systematic thought his first great success at stantz was achieved when he had no books or appliances of ordinary teaching and when the only object of his attention was to find out at each moment what instruction his children stood peculiarly in need of and what was the best manner of connecting it with the knowledge they already possessed much of his power was due not to calmly reasonedout plans of culture but to his profound sympathy which gave him a quick perception of childish needs and difficulties he lacked the ability logically to coordinate and develop the truths which he thus from time to time laid hold of and had in great measure to leave this to his assistants kruesi tobler buss niederer and schmid the result is that in their details his own plans and those vicariously devised contain numerous crudities and inconsistencies his nurserymethod described in the mothers manual beginning as it does with a nomenclature of the different parts of the body and proceeding next to specify their relative positions and next their connections may be proved not at all in accordance with the initial stages of mental evolution his process of teaching the mothertongue by formal exercises in the meanings of words and in the construction of sentences is quite needless and must entail on the pupil loss of time labour and happiness his proposed lessons in geography are utterly unpestalozzian and often where his plans are essentially sound they are either incomplete or vitiated by some remnant of the old regime while therefore we would defend in its entire extent the general doctrine which pestalozzi inaugurated we think great evil likely to result from an uncritical reception of his specific methods that tendency constantly exhibited by mankind to canonise the forms and practices along with which any great truth has been bequeathed to themtheir liability to prostrate their intellects before the prophet and swear by his every wordtheir proneness to mistake the clothing of the idea for the idea itself renders it needful to insist strongly upon the distinction between the fundamental principle of the pestalozzian system and the set of expedients devised for its practice and to suggest that while the one may be considered as established the other is probably nothing but an adumbration of the normal course indeed on looking at the state of our knowledge we may be quite sure that is the case before educational methods can be made to harmonise in character and arrangement with the faculties in their mode and order of unfolding it is first needful that we ascertain with some completeness how the faculties do unfold at present we have acquired on this point only a few general notions these general notions must be developed in detailmust be transformed into a multitude of specific propositions before we can be said to possess that science on which the art of education must be based and then when we have definitely made out in what succession and in what combinations the mental powers become active it remains to choose out of the many possible ways of exercising each of them that which best conforms to its natural mode of action evidently therefore it is not to be supposed that even our most advanced modes of teaching are the right ones or nearly the right ones  bearing in mind then this distinction between the principle and the practice of pestalozzi and inferring from the grounds assigned that the last must necessarily be very defective the reader will rate at its true worth the dissatisfaction with the system which some have expressed and will see that the realisation of the pestalozzian idea remains to be achieved should he argue however from what has just been said that no such realisation is at present practicable and that all effort ought to be devoted to the preliminary inquiry we reply that though it is not possible for a scheme of culture to be perfected either in matter or form until a rational psychology has been established it is possible with the aid of certain guiding principles to make empirical approximations towards a perfect scheme to prepare the way for further research we will now specify these principles some of them have been more or less distinctly implied in the foregoing pages but it will be well here to state them all in logical order  1 that in education we should proceed from the simple to the complex is a truth which has always been to some extent acted upon not professedly indeed nor by any means consistently the mind develops like all things that develop it progresses from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous and a normal training system being an objective counterpart of this subjective process must exhibit a like progression moreover thus interpreting it we may see that this formula has much wider application than at first appears for its rationale involves not only that we should proceed from the single to the combined in the teaching of each branch of knowledge but that we should do the like with knowledge as a whole as the mind consisting at first of but few active faculties has its latercompleted faculties successively brought into play and ultimately comes to have all its faculties in simultaneous action it follows that our teaching should begin with but few subjects at once and successively adding to these should finally carry on all subjects abreast not only in its details should education proceed from the simple to the complex but in its ensemble also  2 the development of the mind as all other development is an advance from the indefinite to the definite in common with the rest of the organism the brain reaches its finished structure only at maturity and in proportion as its structure is unfinished its actions are wanting in precision hence like the first movements and the first attempts at speech the first perceptions and thoughts are extremely vague as from a rudimentary eye discerning only the difference between light and darkness the progress is to an eye that distinguishes kinds and gradations of colour and details of form with the greatest exactness so the intellect as a whole and in each faculty beginning with the rudest discriminations among objects and actions advances towards discriminations of increasing nicety and distinctness to this general law our educational course and methods must conform it is not practicable nor would it be desirable if practicable to put precise ideas into the undeveloped mind we may indeed at an early age communicate the verbal forms in which such ideas are wrapped up and teachers who habitually do this suppose that when the verbal forms have been correctly learnt the ideas which should fill them have been acquired but a brief crossexamination of the pupil proves the contrary it turns out either that the words have been committed to memory with little or no thought about their meaning or else that the perception of their meaning which has been gained is a very cloudy one only as the multiplication of experiences gives materials for definite conceptionsonly as observation year by year discloses the less conspicuous attributes which distinguish things and processes previously confounded togetheronly as each class of coexistences and sequences becomes familiar through the recurrence of cases coming under itonly as the various classes of relations get accurately marked off from each other by mutual limitation can the exact definitions of advanced knowledge become truly comprehensible thus in education we must be content to set out with crude notions these we must aim to make gradually clearer by facilitating the acquisition of experiences such as will correct first their greatest errors and afterwards their successively less marked errors and the scientific formulæ must be given only as fast as the conceptions are perfected  3 to say that our lessons ought to start from the concrete and end in the abstract may be considered as in part a repetition of the first of the foregoing principles nevertheless it is a maxim that must be stated if with no other view then with the view of showing in certain cases what are truly the simple and the complex for unfortunately there has been much misunderstanding on this point general formulas which men have devised to express groups of details and which have severally simplified their conceptions by uniting many facts into one fact they have supposed must simplify the conceptions of a child also they have forgotten that a generalisation is simple only in comparison with the whole mass of particular truths it comprehendsthat it is more complex than any one of these truths taken singlythat only after many of these single truths have been acquired does the generalisation ease the memory and help the reasonand that to a mind not possessing these single truths it is necessarily a mystery thus confounding two kinds of simplification teachers have constantly erred by setting out with first principles a proceeding essentially though not apparently at variance with the primary rule which implies that the mind should be introduced to principles through the medium of examples and so should be led from the particular to the generalfrom the concrete to the abstract  4 the education of the child must accord both in mode and arrangement with the education of mankind considered historically in other words the genesis of knowledge in the individual must follow the same course as the genesis of knowledge in the race in strictness this principle may be considered as already expressed by implication since both being processes of evolution must conform to those same general laws of evolution above insisted on and must therefore agree with each other nevertheless this particular parallelism is of value for the specific guidance it affords to m comte we believe society owes the enunciation of it and we may accept this item of his philosophy without at all committing ourselves to the rest this doctrine may be upheld by two reasons quite independent of any abstract theory and either of them sufficient to establish it one is deducible from the law of hereditary transmission as considered in its wider consequences for if it be true that men exhibit likeness to ancestry both in aspect and characterif it be true that certain mental manifestations as insanity occur in successive members of the same family at the same ageif passing from individual cases in which the traits of many dead ancestors mixing with those of a few living ones greatly obscure the law we turn to national types and remark how the contrasts between them are persistent from age to ageif we remember that these respective types came from a common stock and that hence the present marked differences between them must have arisen from the action of modifying circumstances upon successive generations who severally transmitted the accumulated effects to their descendantsif we find the differences to be now organic so that a french child grows into a french man even when brought up among strangersand if the general fact thus illustrated is true of the whole nature intellect inclusive then it follows that if there be an order in which the human race has mastered its various kinds of knowledge there will arise in every child an aptitude to acquire these kinds of knowledge in the same order so that even were the order intrinsically indifferent it would facilitate education to lead the individual mind through the steps traversed by the general mind but the order is not intrinsically indifferent and hence the fundamental reason why education should be a repetition of civilisation in little it is provable both that the historical sequence was in its main outlines a necessary one and that the causes which determined it apply to the child as to the race not to specify these causes in detail it will suffice here to point out that as the mind of humanity placed in the midst of phenomena and striving to comprehend them has after endless comparisons speculations experiments and theories reached its present knowledge of each subject by a specific route it may rationally be inferred that the relationship between mind and phenomena is such as to prevent this knowledge from being reached by any other route and that as each childs mind stands in this same relationship to phenomena they can be accessible to it only through the same route hence in deciding upon the right method of education an inquiry into the method of civilisation will help to guide us  5 one of the conclusions to which such an inquiry leads is that in each branch of instruction we should proceed from the empirical to the rational during human progress every science is evolved out of its corresponding art it results from the necessity we are under both individually and as a race of reaching the abstract by way of the concrete that there must be practice and an accruing experience with its empirical generalisation before there can be science science is organised knowledge and before knowledge can be organised some of it must be possessed every study therefore should have a purely experimental introduction and only after an ample fund of observations has been accumulated should reasoning begin as illustrative applications of this rule we may instance the modern course of placing grammar not before language but after it or the ordinary custom of prefacing perspective by practical drawing by and by further applications of it will be indicated  6 a second corollary from the foregoing general principle and one which cannot be too strenuously insisted on is that in education the process of selfdevelopment should be encouraged to the uttermost children should be led to make their own investigations and to draw their own inferences they should be told as little as possible and induced to discover as much as possible humanity has progressed solely by selfinstruction and that to achieve the best results each mind must progress somewhat after the same fashion is continually proved by the marked success of selfmade men those who have been brought up under the ordinary schooldrill and have carried away with them the idea that education is practicable only in that style will think it hopeless to make children their own teachers if however they will consider that the allimportant knowledge of surrounding objects which a child gets in its early years is got without helpif they will remember that the child is selftaught in the use of its mother tongueif they will estimate the amount of that experience of life that outofschool wisdom which every boy gathers for himselfif they will mark the unusual intelligence of the uncaredfor london gamin as shown in whatever directions his faculties have been taskedif further they will think how many minds have struggled up unaided not only through the mysteries of our irrationallyplanned curriculum but through hosts of other obstacles besides they will find it a not unreasonable conclusion that if the subjects be put before him in right order and right form any pupil of ordinary capacity will surmount his successive difficulties with but little assistance who indeed can watch the ceaseless observation and inquiry and inference going on in a childs mind or listen to its acute remarks on matters within the range of its faculties without perceiving that these powers it manifests if brought to bear systematically upon studies within the same range would readily master them without help this need for perpetual telling results from our stupidity not from the childs we drag it away from the facts in which it is interested and which it is actively assimilating of itself we put before it facts far too complex for it to understand and therefore distasteful to it finding that it will not voluntarily acquire these facts we thrust them into its mind by force of threats and punishment by thus denying the knowledge it craves and cramming it with knowledge it cannot digest we produce a morbid state of its faculties and a consequent disgust for knowledge in general and when as a result partly of the stolid indolence we have brought on and partly of stillcontinued unfitness in its studies the child can understand nothing without explanation and becomes a mere passive recipient of our instruction we infer that education must necessarily be carried on thus having by our method induced helplessness we make the helplessness a reason for our method clearly then the experience of pedagogues cannot rationally be quoted against the system we are advocating and whoever sees this will see that we may safely follow the discipline of nature throughoutmay by a skilful ministration make the mind as selfdeveloping in its later stages as it is in its earlier ones and that only by doing this can we produce the highest power and activity  7 as a final test by which to judge any plan of culture should come the questiondoes it create a pleasurable excitement in the pupils when in doubt whether a particular mode or arrangement is or is not more in harmony with the foregoing principles than some other we may safely abide by this criterion even when as considered theoretically the proposed course seems the best yet if it produces no interest or less interest than some other course we should relinquish it for a childs intellectual instincts are more trustworthy than our reasonings in respect to the knowingfaculties we may confidently trust in the general law that under normal conditions healthful action is pleasurable while action which gives pain is not healthful though at present very incompletely conformed to by the emotional nature yet by the intellectual nature or at least by those parts of it which the child exhibits this law is almost wholly conformed to the repugnances to this and that study which vex the ordinary teacher are not innate but result from his unwise system fellenberg says experience has taught me that indolence in young persons is so directly opposite to their natural disposition to activity that unless it is the consequence of bad education it is almost invariably connected with some constitutional defect and the spontaneous activity to which children are thus prone is simply the pursuit of those pleasures which the healthful exercise of the faculties gives it is true that some of the higher mental powers as yet but little developed in the race and congenitally possessed in any considerable degree only by the most advanced are indisposed to the amount of exertion required of them but these in virtue of their very complexity will in a normal course of culture come last into exercise and will therefore have no demands made on them until the pupil has arrived at an age when ulterior motives can be brought into play and an indirect pleasure made to counterbalance a direct displeasure with all faculties lower than these however the immediate gratification consequent on activity is the normal stimulus and under good management the only needful stimulus when we have to fall back on some other we must take the fact as evidence that we are on the wrong track experience is daily showing with greater clearness that there is always a method to be found productive of interesteven of delight and it ever turns out that this is the method proved by all other tests to be the right one  with most these guiding principles will weigh but little if left in this abstract form partly therefore to exemplify their application and partly with a view of making sundry specific suggestions we propose now to pass from the theory of education to the practice of it                                       it was the opinion of pestalozzi and one which has ever since his day been gaining ground that education of some kind should begin from the cradle whoever has watched with any discernment the wideeyed gaze of the infant at surrounding objects knows very well that education does begin thus early whether we intend it or not and that these fingerings and suckings of everything it can lay hold of these openmouthed listenings to every sound are first steps in the series which ends in the discovery of unseen planets the invention of calculating engines the production of great paintings or the composition of symphonies and operas this activity of the faculties from the very first being spontaneous and inevitable the question is whether we shall supply in due variety the materials on which they may exercise themselves and to the question so put none but an affirmative answer can be given as before said however agreement with pestalozzis theory does not involve agreement with his practice and here occurs a case in point treating of instruction in spelling he says       the spellingbook ought therefore to contain all the sounds of      the language and these ought to be taught in every family from the      earliest infancy the child who learns his spelling book ought to      repeat them to the infant in the cradle before it is able to      pronounce even one of them so that they may be deeply impressed      upon its mind by frequent repetition  joining this with the suggestions for a nursery method set down in his mothers manual in which he makes the names positions connections numbers properties and uses of the limbs and body his first lessons it becomes clear that pestalozzis notions on early mental development were too crude to enable him to devise judicious plans let us consider the course which psychology dictates  the earliest impressions which the mind can assimilate are the undecomposable sensations produced by resistance light sound etc manifestly decomposable states of consciousness cannot exist before the states of consciousness out of which they are composed there can be no idea of form until some familiarity with light in its gradations and qualities or resistance in its different intensities has been acquired for as has been long known we recognise visible form by means of varieties of light and tangible form by means of varieties of resistance similarly no articulate sound is cognisable until the inarticulate sounds which go to make it up have been learned and thus must it be in every other case following therefore the necessary law of progression from the simple to the complex we should provide for the infant a sufficiency of objects presenting different degrees and kinds of resistance a sufficiency of objects reflecting different amounts and qualities of light and a sufficiency of sounds contrasted in their loudness their pitch and their timbre how fully this à priori conclusion is confirmed by infantile instincts all will see on being reminded of the delight which every young child has in biting its toys in feeling its brothers bright jacketbuttons and pulling papas whiskershow absorbed it becomes in gazing at any gaudilypainted object to which it applies the word pretty when it can pronounce it wholly because of the bright coloursand how its face broadens into a laugh at the tattlings of its nurse the snapping of a visitors fingers or any sound which it has not before heard fortunately the ordinary practices of the nursery fulfil these early requirements of education to a considerable degree much however remains to be done and it is of more importance that it should be done than at first appears every faculty during that spontaneous activity which accompanies its evolution is capable of receiving more vivid impressions than at any other period moreover as these simplest elements have to be mastered and as the mastery of them whenever achieved must take time it becomes an economy of time to occupy this first stage of childhood during which no other intellectual action is possible in gaining a complete familiarity with them in all their modifications nor let us omit the fact that both temper and health will be improved by the continual gratification resulting from a due supply of these impressions which every child so greedily assimilates space could it be spared might here be well filled by some suggestions towards a more systematic ministration to these simplest of the perceptions but it must suffice to point out that any such ministration recognising the general law of evolution from the indefinite to the definite should proceed upon the corollary that in the development of every faculty markedly contrasted impressions are the first to be distinguished that hence sounds greatly differing in loudness and pitch colours very remote from each other and substances widely unlike in hardness or texture should be the first supplied and that in each case the progression must be by slow degrees to impressions more nearly allied  passing on to objectlessons which manifestly form a natural continuation of this primary culture of the senses it is to be remarked that the system commonly pursued is wholly at variance with the method of nature as exhibited alike in infancy in adult life and in the course of civilisation the child says m marcel must be shown how all the parts of an object are connected etc and the various manuals of these objectlessons severally contain lists of the facts which the child is to be told respecting each of the things put before it now it needs but a glance at the daily life of the infant to see that all the knowledge of things which is gained before the acquirement of speech is selfgainedthat the qualities of hardness and weight associated with certain appearances the possession of particular forms and colours by particular persons the production of special sounds by animals of special aspects are phenomena which it observes for itself in manhood too when there are no longer teachers at hand the observations and inferences hourly required for guidance must be made unhelped and success in life depends upon the accuracy and completeness with which they are made is it probable then that while the process displayed in the evolution of humanity at large is repeated alike by the infant and the man a reverse process must be followed during the period between infancy and manhood and that too even in so simple a thing as learning the properties of objects is it not obvious on the contrary that one method must be pursued throughout and is not nature perpetually thrusting this method upon us if we had but the wit to see it and the humility to adopt it what can be more manifest than the desire of children for intellectual sympathy mark how the infant sitting on your knee thrusts into your face the toy it holds that you too may look at it see when it makes a creak with its wet finger on the table how it turns and looks at you does it again and again looks at you thus saying as clearly as it canhear this new sound watch the elder children coming into the room exclaimingmamma see what a curious thing mamma look at this mamma look at that a habit which they would continue did not the silly mamma tell them not to tease her observe that when out with the nursemaid each little one runs up to her with the new flower it has gathered to show her how pretty it is and to get her also to say it is pretty listen to the eager volubility with which every urchin describes any novelty he has been to see if only he can find some one who will attend with any interest does not the induction lie on the surface is it not clear that we must conform our course to these intellectual instinctsthat we must just systematise the natural processthat we must listen to all the child has to tell us about each object must induce it to say everything it can think of about such object must occasionally draw its attention to facts it has not yet observed with the view of leading it to notice them itself whenever they recur and must go on by and by to indicate or supply new series of things for a like exhaustive examination note the way in which on this method the intelligent mother conducts her lessons step by step she familiarises her little boy with the names of the simpler attributes hardness softness colour taste size in doing which she finds him eagerly help by bringing this to show her that it is red and the other to make her feel that it is hard as fast as she gives him words for these properties each additional property as she draws his attention to it in some fresh thing which he brings her she takes care to mention in connection with those he already knows so that by the natural tendency to imitate he may get into the habit of repeating them one after another gradually as there occur cases in which he omits to name one or more of the properties he has become acquainted with she introduces the practice of asking him whether there is not something more that he can tell her about the thing he has got probably he does not understand after letting him puzzle awhile she tells him perhaps laughing at him a little for his failure a few recurrences of this and he perceives what is to be done when next she says she knows something more about the object than he has told her his pride is roused he looks at it intently he thinks over all that he has heard and the problem being easy presently finds it out he is full of glee at his success and she sympathises with him in common with every child he delights in the discovery of his powers he wishes for more victories and goes in quest of more things about which to tell her as his faculties unfold she adds quality after quality to his list progressing from hardness and softness to roughness and smoothness from colour to polish from simple bodies to composite onesthus constantly complicating the problem as he gains competence constantly taxing his attention and memory to a greater extent constantly maintaining his interest by supplying him with new impressions such as his mind can assimilate and constantly gratifying him by conquests over such small difficulties as he can master in doing this she is manifestly but following out that spontaneous process which was going on during a still earlier periodsimply aiding selfevolution and is aiding it in the mode suggested by the boys instinctive behaviour to her manifestly too the course she is adopting is the one best calculated to establish a habit of exhaustive observation which is the professed aim of these lessons to tell a child this and to show it the other is not to teach it how to observe but to make it a mere recipient of anothers observations a proceeding which weakens rather than strengthens its powers of selfinstructionwhich deprives it of the pleasures resulting from successful activitywhich presents this allattractive knowledge under the aspect of formal tuitionand which thus generates that indifference and even disgust not unfrequently felt towards these objectlessons on the other hand to pursue the course above described is simply to guide the intellect to its appropriate food to join with the intellectual appetites their natural adjunctsamour propre and the desire for sympathy to induce by the union of all these an intensity of attention which insures perceptions both vivid and complete and to habituate the mind from the beginning to that practice of selfhelp which it must ultimately follow  objectlessons should not only be carried on after quite a different fashion from that commonly pursued but should be extended to a range of things far wider and continued to a period far later than now they should not be limited to the contents of the house but should include those of the fields and the hedges the quarry and the seashore they should not cease with early childhood but should be so kept up during youth as insensibly to merge into the investigations of the naturalist and the man of science here again we have but to follow natures leadings where can be seen an intenser delight than that of children picking up new flowers and watching new insects or hoarding pebbles and shells and who is there but perceives that by sympathising with them they may be led on to any extent of inquiry into the qualities and structures of these things every botanist who has had children with him in the woods and lanes must have noticed how eagerly they joined in his pursuits how keenly they searched out plants for him how intently they watched while he examined them how they overwhelmed him with questions the consistent follower of baconthe servant and interpreter of nature will see that we ought modestly to adopt the course of culture thus indicated having become familiar with the simpler properties of inorganic objects the child should by the same process be led on to an exhaustive examination of the things it picks up in its daily walksthe less complex facts they present being alone noticed at first in plants the colours numbers and forms of the petals and shapes of the stalks and leaves in insects the numbers of the wings legs and antennæ and their colours as these become fully appreciated and invariably observed further facts may be successively introduced in the one case the numbers of stamens and pistils the forms of the flowers whether radial or bilateral in symmetry the arrangement and character of the leaves whether opposite or alternate stalked or sessile smooth or hairy serrated toothed or crenate in the other the divisions of the body the segments of the abdomen the markings of the wings the number of joints in the legs and the forms of the smaller organsthe system pursued throughout being that of making it the childs ambition to say respecting everything it finds all that can be said then when a fit age has been reached the means of preserving these plants which have become so interesting in virtue of the knowledge obtained of them may as a great favour be supplied and eventually as a still greater favour may also be supplied the apparatus needful for keeping the larvæ of our common butterflies and moths through their transformationsa practice which as we can personally testify yields the highest gratification is continued with ardour for years when joined with the formation of an entomological collection adds immense interest to saturdayafternoon rambles and forms an admirable introduction to the study of physiology  we are quite prepared to hear from many that all this is throwing away time and energy and that children would be much better occupied in writing their copies or learning their pencetables and so fitting themselves for the business of life we regret that such crude ideas of what constitutes education and such a narrow conception of utility should still be prevalent saying nothing on the need for a systematic culture of the perceptions and the value of the practices above inculcated as subserving that need we are prepared to defend them even on the score of the knowledge gained if men are to be mere cits mere porers over ledgers with no ideas beyond their tradesif it is well that they should be as the cockney whose conception of rural pleasures extends no further than sitting in a teagarden smoking pipes and drinking porter or as the squire who thinks of woods as places for shooting in of uncultivated plants as nothing but weeds and who classifies animals into game vermin and stockthen indeed it is needless to learn anything that does not directly help to replenish the till and fill the larder but if there is a more worthy aim for us than to be drudgesif there are other uses in the things around than their power to bring moneyif there are higher faculties to be exercised than acquisitive and sensual onesif the pleasures which poetry and art and science and philosophy can bring are of any moment then is it desirable that the instinctive inclination which every child shows to observe natural beauties and investigate natural phenomena should be encouraged but this gross utilitarianism which is content to come into the world and quit it again without knowing what kind of a world it is or what it contains may be met on its own ground it will by and by be found that a knowledge of the laws of life is more important than any other knowledge whateverthat the laws of life underlie not only all bodily and mental processes but by implication all the transactions of the house and the street all commerce all politics all moralsand that therefore without a comprehension of them neither personal nor social conduct can be rightly regulated it will eventually be seen too that the laws of life are essentially the same throughout the whole organic creation and further that they cannot be properly understood in their complex manifestations until they have been studied in their simpler ones and when this is seen it will be also seen that in aiding the child to acquire the outofdoor information for which it shows so great an avidity and in encouraging the acquisition of such information throughout youth we are simply inducing it to store up the raw material for future organisationthe facts that will one day bring home to it with due force those great generalisations of science by which actions may be rightly guided  the spreading recognition of drawing as an element of education is one among many signs of the more rational views on mental culture now beginning to prevail once more it may be remarked that teachers are at length adopting the course which nature has perpetually been pressing on their notice the spontaneous attempts made by children to represent the men houses trees and animals around themon a slate if they can get nothing better or with leadpencil on paper if they can beg themare familiar to all to be shown through a picturebook is one of their highest gratifications and as usual their strong imitative tendency presently generates in them the ambition to make pictures themselves also this effort to depict the striking things they see is a further instinctive exercise of the perceptionsa means whereby still greater accuracy and completeness of observation are induced and alike by trying to interest us in their discoveries of the sensible properties of things and by their endeavours to draw they solicit from us just that kind of culture which they most need  had teachers been guided by natures hints not only in making drawing a part of education but in choosing modes of teaching it they would have done still better than they have done what is that the child first tries to represent things that are large things that are attractive in colour things round which its pleasurable associations most clusterhuman beings from whom it has received so many emotions cows and dogs which interest by the many phenomena they present houses that are hourly visible and strike by their size and contrast of parts and which of the processes of representation gives it most delight colouring paper and pencil are good in default of something better but a box of paints and a brushthese are the treasures the drawing of outlines immediately becomes secondary to colouringis gone through mainly with a view to the colouring and if leave can be got to colour a book of prints how great is the favour now ridiculous as such a position will seem to drawingmasters who postpone colouring and who teach form by a dreary discipline of copying lines we believe that the course of culture thus indicated is the right one the priority of colour to form which as already pointed out has a psychological basis should be recognised from the beginning and from the beginning also the things imitated should be real that greater delight in colour which is not only conspicuous in children but persists in most persons throughout life should be continuously employed as the natural stimulus to the mastery of the comparatively difficult and unattractive form the pleasure of the subsequent tinting should be the prospective reward for the labour of delineation and these efforts to represent interesting actualities should be encouraged in the conviction that as by a widening experience simpler and more practicable objects become interesting they too will be attempted and that so a gradual approximation will be made towards imitations having some resemblance to the realities the extreme indefiniteness which in conformity with the law of evolution these first attempts exhibit is anything but a reason for ignoring them no matter how grotesque the shapes produced no matter how daubed and glaring the colours the question is not whether the child is producing good drawings the question is whether it is developing its faculties it has first to gain some command over its fingers some crude notions of likeness and this practice is better than any other for these ends since it is the spontaneous and interesting one during early childhood no formal drawinglessons are possible shall we therefore repress or neglect to aid these efforts at selfculture or shall we encourage and guide them as normal exercises of the perceptions and the powers of manipulation if by furnishing cheap woodcuts to be painted and simple contourmaps to have their boundary lines tinted we can not only pleasurably draw out the faculty of colour but can incidentally produce some familiarity with the outlines of things and countries and some ability to move the brush steadily and if by the supply of tempting objects we can keep up the instinctive practice of making representations however rough it must happen that when the age for lessons in drawing is reached there will exist a facility that would else have been absent time will have been gained and trouble both to teacher and pupil saved  from what has been said it may be readily inferred that we condemn the practice of drawing from copies and still more so that formal discipline in making straight lines and curved lines and compound lines with which it is the fashion of some teachers to begin we regret that the society of arts has recently in its series of manuals on rudimentary art instruction given its countenance to an elementary drawingbook which is the most vicious in principle that we have seen we refer to the outline from outline or from the flat by john bell sculptor as explained in the prefatory note this publication proposes to place before the student a simple yet logical mode of instruction and to this end sets out with a number of definitions thus       a simple line in drawing is a thin mark drawn from one point to      another       lines may be divided as to their nature in drawing into two      classes       1 straight which are marks that go the shortest road between      two points as a b       2 or curved which are marks which do not go the shortest road      between two points as c d  and so the introduction progresses to horizontal lines perpendicular lines oblique lines angles of the several kinds and the various figures which lines and angles make up the work is in short a grammar of form with exercises and thus the system of commencing with a dry analysis of elements which in the teaching of language has been exploded is to be reinstituted in the teaching of drawing we are to set out with the definite instead of with the indefinite the abstract is to be preliminary to the concrete scientific conceptions are to precede empirical experiences that this is an inversion of the normal order we need scarcely repeat it has been well said concerning the custom of prefacing the art of speaking any tongue by a drilling in the parts of speech and their functions that it is about as reasonable as prefacing the art of walking by a course of lessons on the bones muscles and nerves of the legs and much the same thing may be said of the proposal to preface the art of representing objects by a nomenclature and definitions of the lines which they yield on analysis these technicalities are alike repulsive and needless they render the study distasteful at the very outset and all with the view of teaching that which in the course of practice will be learnt unconsciously just as the child incidentally gathers the meanings of ordinary words from the conversations going on around it without the help of dictionaries so from the remarks on objects pictures and its own drawings will it presently acquire not only without effort but even pleasurably those same scientific terms which when taught at first are a mystery and a weariness  if any dependence is to be placed on the general principles of education that have been laid down the process of learning to draw should be throughout continuous with those efforts of early childhood described above as so worthy of encouragement by the time that the voluntary practice thus initiated has given some steadiness of hand and some tolerable ideas of proportion there will have arisen a vague notion of body as presenting its three dimensions in perspective and when after sundry abortive chineselike attempts to render this appearance on paper there has grown up a pretty clear perception of the thing to be done and a desire to do it a first lesson in empirical perspective may be given by means of the apparatus occasionally used in explaining perspective as a science this sounds alarming but the experiment is both comprehensible and interesting to any boy or girl of ordinary intelligence a plate of glass so framed as to stand vertically on the table being placed before the pupil and a book or like simple object laid on the other side of it he is requested while keeping the eye in one position to make inkdots on the glass so that they may coincide with or hide the corners of this object he is next told to join these dots by lines on doing which he perceives that the lines he makes hide or coincide with the outlines of the object and then by putting a sheet of paper on the other side of the glass it is made manifest to him that the lines he has thus drawn represent the object as he saw it they not only look like it but he perceives that they must be like it because he made them agree with its outlines and by removing the paper he can convince himself that they do agree with its outlines the fact is new and striking and serves him as an experimental demonstration that lines of certain lengths placed in certain directions on a plane can represent lines of other lengths and having other directions in space by gradually changing the position of the object he may be led to observe how some lines shorten and disappear while others come into sight and lengthen the convergence of parallel lines and indeed all the leading facts of perspective may from time to time be similarly illustrated to him if he has been duly accustomed to selfhelp he will gladly when it is suggested attempt to draw one of these outlines on paper by the eye only and it may soon be made an exciting aim to produce unassisted a representation as like as he can to one subsequently sketched on the glass thus without the unintelligent mechanical practice of copying other drawings but by a method at once simple and attractiverational yet not abstracta familiarity with the linear appearances of things and a faculty of rendering them may be step by step acquired to which advantages add thesethat even thus early the pupil learns almost unconsciously the true theory of a picture namely that it is a delineation of objects as they appear when projected on a plane placed between them and the eye and that when he reaches a fit age for commencing scientific perspective he is already thoroughly acquainted with the facts which form its logical basis  as exhibiting a rational mode of conveying primary conceptions in geometry we cannot do better than quote the following passage from mr wyse       a child has been in the habit of using cubes for arithmetic let      him use them also for the elements of geometry i would begin with      solids the reverse of the usual plan it saves all the difficulty      of absurd definitions and bad explanations on points lines and      surfaces which are nothing but abstractions a cube presents      many of the principal elements of geometry it at once exhibits      points straight lines parallel lines angles parallelograms      etc etc these cubes are divisible into various parts the pupil      has already been familiarised with such divisions in numeration      and he now proceeds to a comparison of their several parts and of      the relation of these parts to each other from thence he      advances to globes which furnish him with elementary notions of      the circle of curves generally etc etc       being tolerably familiar with solids he may now substitute      planes the transition may be made very easy let the cube for      instance be cut into thin divisions and placed on paper he will      then see as many plane rectangles as he has divisions so with all      the others globes may be treated in the same manner he will thus      see how surfaces really are generated and be enabled to abstract      them with facility in every solid       he has thus acquired the alphabet and reading of geometry he now      proceeds to write it       the simplest operation and therefore the first is merely to      place these planes on a piece of paper and pass the pencil round      them when this has been frequently done the plane may be put at a      little distance and the child required to copy it and so on  a stock of geometrical conceptions having been obtained in some such manner as this recommended by mr wyse a further step may be taken by introducing the practice of testing the correctness of figures drawn by eye thus both exciting an ambition to make them exact and continually illustrating the difficulty of fulfilling that ambition there can be little doubt that geometry had its origin as indeed the word implies in the methods discovered by artizans and others of making accurate measurements for the foundations of buildings areas of inclosures and the like and that its truths came to be treasured up merely with a view to their immediate utility they would be introduced to the pupil under analogous relationships in cutting out pieces for his cardhouses in drawing ornamental diagrams for colouring and in those various instructive occupations which an inventive teacher will lead him into he may for a length of time be advantageously left like the primitive builder to tentative processes and so will learn through experience the difficulty of achieving his aims by the unaided senses when having meanwhile undergone a valuable discipline of the perceptions he has reached a fit age for using a pair of compasses he will while duly appreciating these as enabling him to verify his ocular guesses be still hindered by the imperfections of the approximative method in this stage he may be left for a further period partly as being yet too young for anything higher partly because it is desirable that he should be made to feel still more strongly the want of systematic contrivances if the acquisition of knowledge is to be made continuously interesting and if in the early civilisation of the child as in the early civilisation of the race science is valued only as ministering to art it is manifest that the proper preliminary to geometry is a long practice in those constructive processes which geometry will facilitate observe that here too nature points the way children show a strong propensity to cut out things in paper to make to builda propensity which if encouraged and directed will not only prepare the way for scientific conceptions but will develop those powers of manipulation in which most people are so deficient  when the observing and inventive faculties have attained the requisite power the pupil may be introduced to empirical geometry that isgeometry dealing with methodical solutions but not with the demonstrations of them like all other transitions in education this should be made not formally but incidentally and the relationship to constructive art should still be maintained to make out of cardboard a tetrahedron like one given to him is a problem which will interest the pupil and serve as a convenient startingpoint in attempting this he finds it needful to draw four equilateral triangles arranged in special positions being unable in the absence of an exact method to do this accurately he discovers on putting the triangles into their respective positions that he cannot make their sides fit and that their angles do not meet at the apex he may now be shown how by describing a couple of circles each of these triangles may be drawn with perfect correctness and without guessing and after his failure he will value the information having thus helped him to the solution of his first problem with the view of illustrating the nature of geometrical methods he is in future to be left to solve the questions put to him as best he can to bisect a line to erect a perpendicular to describe a square to bisect an angle to draw a line parallel to a given line to describe a hexagon are problems which a little patience will enable him to find out and from these he may be led on step by step to more complex questions all of which under judicious management he will puzzle through unhelped doubtless many of those brought up under the old regime will look upon this assertion sceptically we speak from facts however and those neither few nor special we have seen a class of boys become so interested in making out solutions to such problems as to look forward to their geometrylesson as a chief event of the week within the last month we have heard of one girls school in which some of the young ladies voluntarily occupy themselves with geometrical questions out of schoolhours and of another where they not only do this but where one of them is begging for problems to find out during the holidays both which facts we state on the authority of the teacher strong proofs these of the practicability and the immense advantage of selfdevelopment a branch of knowledge which as commonly taught is dry and even repulsive is thus by following the method of nature made extremely interesting and profoundly beneficial we say profoundly beneficial because the effects are not confined to the gaining of geometrical facts but often revolutionise the whole state of mind it has repeatedly occurred that those who have been stupefied by the ordinary schooldrillby its abstract formulas its wearisome tasks its cramminghave suddenly had their intellects roused by thus ceasing to make them passive recipients and inducing them to become active discoverers the discouragement caused by bad teaching having been diminished by a little sympathy and sufficient perseverance excited to achieve a first success there arises a revulsion of feeling affecting the whole nature they no longer find themselves incompetent they too can do something and gradually as success follows success the incubus of despair disappears and they attack the difficulties of their other studies with a courage insuring conquest  a few weeks after the foregoing remarks were originally published professor tyndall in a lecture at the royal institution on the importance of the study of physics as a branch of education gave some conclusive evidence to the same effect his testimony based on personal observation is of such great value that we cannot refrain from quoting it here it is       one of the duties which fell to my share during the period to      which i have referred was the instruction of a class in      mathematics and i usually found that euclid and the ancient      geometry generally when addressed to the understanding formed a      very attractive study for youth but it was my habitual practice to      withdraw the boys from the routine of the book and to appeal to      their selfpower in the treatment of questions not comprehended in      that routine at first the change from the beaten track usually      excited a little aversion the youth felt like a child amid      strangers but in no single instance have i found this aversion to      continue when utterly disheartened i have encouraged the boy by      that anecdote of newton where he attributes the difference between      him and other men mainly to his own patience or of mirabeau when      he ordered his servant who had stated something to be impossible      never to use that stupid word again thus cheered he has returned      to his task with a smile which perhaps had something of doubt in      it but which nevertheless evinced a resolution to try again i      have seen the boys eye brighten and at length with a pleasure of      which the ecstasy of archimedes was but a simple expansion heard      him exclaim i have it sir the consciousness of selfpower      thus awakened was of immense value and animated by it the      progress of the class was truly astonishing it was often my custom      to give the boys their choice of pursuing their propositions in the      book or of trying their strength at others not to be found there      never in a single instance have i known the book to be chosen i      was ever ready to assist when i deemed help needful but my offers      of assistance were habitually declined the boys had tasted the      sweets of intellectual conquest and demanded victories of their      own i have seen their diagrams scratched on the walls cut into      the beams upon the play ground and numberless other illustrations      of the living interest they took in the subject for my own part      as far as experience in teaching goes i was a mere fledgling i      knew nothing of the rules of pedagogics as the germans name it      but i adhered to the spirit indicated at the commencement of this      discourse and endeavoured to make geometry a means and not a      branch of education the experiment was successful and some of      the most delightful hours of my existence have been spent in      marking the vigorous and cheerful expansion of mental power when      appealed to in the manner i have described  this empirical geometry which presents an endless series of problems should be continued along with other studies for years and may throughout be advantageously accompanied by those concrete applications of its principles which serve as its preliminary after the cube the octahedron and the various forms of pyramid and prism have been mastered may come the more complex regular bodiesthe dodecahedron and icosahedronto construct which out of single pieces of cardboard requires considerable ingenuity from these the transition may naturally be made to such modified forms of the regular bodies as are met with in crystalsthe truncated cube the cube with its dihedral as well as its solid angles truncated the octahedron and the various prisms as similarly modified in imitating which numerous forms assumed by different metals and salts an acquaintance with the leading facts of mineralogy will be incidentally gained1  after long continuance in exercises of this kind rational geometry as may be supposed presents no obstacles habituated to contemplate relationships of form and quantity and vaguely perceiving from time to time the necessity of certain results as reached by certain means the pupil comes to regard the demonstrations of euclid as the missing supplements to his familiar problems his welldisciplined faculties enable him easily to master its successive propositions and to appreciate their value and he has the occasional gratification of finding some of his own methods proved to be true thus he enjoys what is to the unprepared a dreary task it only remains to add that his mind will presently arrive at a fit condition for that most valuable of all exercises for the reflective facultiesthe making of original demonstrations such theorems as those appended to the successive books of the messrs chamberss euclid will soon become practicable to him and in proving them the process of selfdevelopment will be not intellectual only but moral  to continue these suggestions much further would be to write a detailed treatise on education which we do not purpose the foregoing outlines of plans for exercising the perceptions in early childhood for conducting objectlessons for teaching drawing and geometry must be considered simply as illustrations of the method dictated by the general principles previously specified we believe that on examination they will be found not only to progress from the simple to the complex from the indefinite to the definite from the concrete to the abstract from the empirical to the rational but to satisfy the further requirements that education shall be a repetition of civilisation in little that it shall be as much as possible a process of selfevolution and that it shall be pleasurable the fulfilment of all these conditions by one type of method tends alike to verify the conditions and to prove that type of the method the right one mark too that this method is the logical outcome of the tendency characterising all modern improvements in tuitionthat it is but an adoption in full of the natural system which they adopt partiallythat it displays this complete adoption of the natural system both by conforming to the above principles and by following the suggestions which the unfolding mind itself gives facilitating its spontaneous activities and so aiding the developments which nature is busy with thus there seems abundant reason to conclude that the mode of procedure above exemplified closely approximates to the true one                                       a few paragraphs must be added in further inculcation of the two general principles that are alike the most important and the least attended to namely the principle that throughout youth as in early childhood and in maturity the process shall be one of selfinstruction and the obverse principle that the mental action induced shall be throughout intrinsically grateful if progression from simple to complex from indefinite to definite and from concrete to abstract be considered the essential requirements as dictated by abstract psychology then do the requirements that knowledge shall be selfmastered and pleasurably mastered become tests by which we may judge whether the dictates of abstract psychology are being obeyed if the first embody the leading generalisations of the science of mental growth the last are the chief canons of the art of fostering mental growth for manifestly if the steps in our curriculum are so arranged that they can be successively ascended by the pupil himself with little or no help they must correspond with the stages of evolution in his faculties and manifestly if the successive achievements of these steps are intrinsically gratifying to him it follows that they require no more than a normal exercise of his powers  but making education a process of selfevolution has other advantages than this of keeping our lessons in the right order in the first place it guarantees a vividness and permanency of impression which the usual methods can never produce any piece of knowledge which the pupil has himself acquiredany problem which he has himself solved becomes by virtue of the conquest much more thoroughly his than it could else be the preliminary activity of mind which his success implies the concentration of thought necessary to it and the excitement consequent on his triumph conspire to register the facts in his memory in a way that no mere information heard from a teacher or read in a schoolbook can be registered even if he fails the tension to which his faculties have been wound up insures his remembrance of the solution when given to him better than halfadozen repetitions would observe again that this discipline necessitates a continuous organisation of the knowledge he acquires it is in the very nature of facts and inferences assimilated in this normal manner that they successively become the premises of further conclusionsthe means of solving further questions the solution of yesterdays problem helps the pupil in mastering todays thus the knowledge is turned into faculty as soon as it is taken in and forthwith aids in the general function of thinkingdoes not lie merely written on the pages of an internal library as when rotelearnt mark further the moral culture which this constant selfhelp involves courage in attacking difficulties patient concentration of the attention perseverance through failuresthese are characteristics which afterlife specially requires and these are characteristics which this system of making the mind work for its food specially produces that it is thoroughly practicable to carry out instruction after this fashion we can ourselves testify having been in youth thus led to solve the comparatively complex problems of perspective and that leading teachers have been tending in this direction is indicated alike in the saying of fellenberg that the individual independent activity of the pupil is of much greater importance than the ordinary busy officiousness of many who assume the office of educators in the opinion of horace mann that unfortunately education amongst us at present consists too much in telling not in training and in the remark of m marcel that what the learner discovers by mental exertion is better known than what is told to him  similarly with the correlative requirement that the method of culture pursued shall be one productive of an intrinsically happy activityan activity not happy because of extrinsic rewards to be obtained but because of its own healthfulness conformity to this requirement besides preventing us from thwarting the normal process of evolution incidentally secures positive benefits of importance unless we are to return to an ascetic morality or rather immorality the maintenance of youthful happiness must be considered as in itself a worthy aim not to dwell upon this however we go on to remark that a pleasurable state of feeling is far more favourable to intellectual action than a state of indifference or disgust every one knows that things read heard or seen with interest are better remembered than things read heard or seen with apathy in the one case the faculties appealed to are actively occupied with the subject presented in the other they are inactively occupied with it and the attention is continually drawn away by more attractive thoughts hence the impressions are respectively strong and weak moreover to the intellectual listlessness which a pupils lack of interest in any study involves must be added the paralysing fear of consequences this by distracting his attention increases the difficulty he finds in bringing his faculties to bear upon facts that are repugnant to them clearly therefore the efficiency of tuition will other things equal be proportionate to the gratification with which tasks are performed  it should be considered also that grave moral consequences depend upon the habitual pleasure or pain which daily lessons produce no one can compare the faces and manners of two boysthe one made happy by mastering interesting subjects and the other made miserable by disgust with his studies by consequent inability by cold looks by threats by punishmentwithout seeing that the disposition of the one is being benefited and that of the other injured whoever has marked the effects of success and failure upon the mind and the power of the mind over the body will see that in the one case both temper and health are favourably affected while in the other there is danger of permanent moroseness or permanent timidity and even of permanent constitutional depression there remains yet another indirect result of no small moment the relationship between teachers and their pupils is other things equal rendered friendly and influential or antagonistic and powerless according as the system of culture produces happiness or misery human beings are at the mercy of their associated ideas a daily minister of pain cannot fail to be regarded with secret dislike and if he causes no emotions but painful ones will inevitably be hated conversely he who constantly aids children to their ends hourly provides them with the satisfactions of conquest hourly encourages them through their difficulties and sympathises in their successes will be liked nay if his behaviour is consistent throughout must be loved and when we remember how efficient and benign is the control of a master who is felt to be a friend when compared with the control of one who is looked upon with aversion or at best indifference we may infer that the indirect advantages of conducting education on the happiness principle do not fall far short of the direct ones to all who question the possibility of acting out the system here advocated we reply as before that not only does theory point to it but experience commends it to the many verdicts of distinguished teachers who since pestalozzis time have testified this may be here added that of professor pillans who asserts that where young people are taught as they ought to be they are quite as happy in school as at play seldom less delighted nay often more with the welldirected exercise of their mental energies than with that of their muscular powers  as suggesting a final reason for making education a process of selfinstruction and by consequence a process of pleasurable instruction we may advert to the fact that in proportion as it is made so is there a probability that it will not cease when schooldays end as long as the acquisition of knowledge is rendered habitually repugnant so long will there be a prevailing tendency to discontinue it when free from the coercion of parents and masters and when the acquisition of knowledge has been rendered habitually gratifying then will there be as prevailing a tendency to continue without superintendence that selfculture previously carried on under superintendence these results are inevitable while the laws of mental association remain truewhile men dislike the things and places that suggest painful recollections and delight in those which call to mind bygone pleasurespainful lessons will make knowledge repulsive and pleasurable lessons will make it attractive the men to whom in boyhood information came in dreary tasks along with threats of punishment and who were never led into habits of independent inquiry are unlikely to be students in after years while those to whom it came in the natural forms at the proper times and who remember its facts as not only interesting in themselves but as the occasions of a long series of gratifying successes are likely to continue through life that selfinstruction commenced in youth  1 those who seek aid in carrying out the system of culture above described will find it in a little work entitled inventional geometry published by j and c mozley paternoster row london      moral education   the greatest defect in our programmes of education is entirely overlooked while much is being done in the detailed improvement of our systems in respect both of matter and manner the most pressing desideratum has not yet been even recognised as a desideratum to prepare the young for the duties of life is tacitly admitted to be the end which parents and schoolmasters should have in view and happily the value of the things taught and the goodness of the methods followed in teaching them are now ostensibly judged by their fitness to this end the propriety of substituting for an exclusively classical training a training in which the modern languages shall have a share is argued on this ground the necessity of increasing the amount of science is urged for like reasons but though some care is taken to fit youth of both sexes for society and citizenship no care whatever is taken to fit them for the position of parents while it is seen that for the purpose of gaining a livelihood an elaborate preparation is needed it appears to be thought that for the bringing up of children no preparation whatever is needed while many years are spent by a boy in gaining knowledge of which the chief value is that it constitutes the education of a gentleman and while many years are spent by a girl in those decorative acquirements which fit her for evening parties not an hour is spent by either in preparation for that gravest of all responsibilitiesthe management of a family is it that this responsibility is but a remote contingency on the contrary it is sure to devolve on nine out of ten is it that the discharge of it is easy certainly not of all functions which the adult has to fulfil this is the most difficult is it that each may be trusted by selfinstruction to fit himself or herself for the office of parent no not only is the need for such selfinstruction unrecognised but the complexity of the subject renders it the one of all others in which selfinstruction is least likely to succeed no rational plea can be put forward for leaving the art of education out of our curriculum whether as bearing on the happiness of parents themselves or whether as affecting the characters and lives of their children and remote descendants we must admit that a knowledge of the right methods of juvenile culture physical intellectual and moral is a knowledge of extreme importance this topic should be the final one in the course of instruction passed through by each man and woman as physical maturity is marked by the ability to produce offspring so mental maturity is marked by the ability to train those offspring the subject which involves all other subjects and therefore the subject in which education should culminate is the theory and practice of education  in the absence of this preparation the management of children and more especially the moral management is lamentably bad parents either never think about the matter at all or else their conclusions are crude and inconsistent in most cases and especially on the part of mothers the treatment adopted on every occasion is that which the impulse of the moment prompts it springs not from any reasonedout conviction as to what will most benefit the child but merely expresses the dominant parental feelings whether good or ill and varies from hour to hour as these feelings vary or if the dictates of passion are supplemented by any definite doctrines and methods they are those handed down from the past or those suggested by the remembrances of childhood or those adopted from nurses and servantsmethods devised not by the enlightenment but by the ignorance of the time commenting on the chaotic state of opinion and practice relative to family government richter writes       if the secret variances of a large class of ordinary fathers were      brought to light and laid down as a plan of studies and reading      catalogued for a moral education they would run somewhat after      this fashionin the first hour pure morality must be read to the      child either by myself or the tutor in the second mixed      morality or that which may be applied to ones own advantage in      the third do you not see that your father does so and so in the      fourth you are little and this is only fit for grownup people      in the fifth the chief matter is that you should succeed in the      world and become something in the state in the sixth not the      temporary but the eternal determines the worth of a man in the      seventh therefore rather suffer injustice and be kind in the      eighth but defend yourself bravely if any one attack you in the      ninth do not make a noise dear child in the tenth a boy must      not sit so quiet in the eleventh you must obey your parents      better in the twelfth and educate yourself so by the hourly      change of his principles the father conceals their untenableness      and onesidedness as for his wife she is neither like him nor yet      like that harlequin who came on to the stage with a bundle of      papers under each arm and answered to the inquiry what he had      under his right arm orders and to what he had under his left      arm counterorders but the mother might be much better compared      to a giant briareus who had a hundred arms and a bundle of papers      under each  this state of things is not to be readily changed generations must pass before a great amelioration of it can be expected like political constitutions educational systems are not made but grow and within brief periods growth is insensible slow however as must be any improvement even that improvement implies the use of means and among the means is discussion                                       we are not among those who believe in lord palmerstons dogma that all children are born good on the whole the opposite dogma untenable as it is seems to us less wide of the truth nor do we agree with those who think that by skilful discipline children may be made altogether what they should be contrariwise we are satisfied that though imperfections of nature may be diminished by wise management they cannot be removed by it the notion that an ideal humanity might be forthwith produced by a perfect system of education is near akin to that implied in the poems of shelley that would mankind give up their old institutions and prejudices all the evils in the world would at once disappear neither notion being acceptable to such as have dispassionately studied human affairs  nevertheless we may fitly sympathise with those who entertain these too sanguine hopes enthusiasm pushed even to fanaticism is a useful motivepowerperhaps an indispensable one it is clear that the ardent politician would never undergo the labours and make the sacrifices he does did he not believe that the reform he fights for is the one thing needful but for his conviction that drunkenness is the root of all social evils the teetotaler would agitate far less energetically in philanthropy as in other things great advantage results from division of labour and that there may be division of labour each class of philanthropists must be more or less subordinated to its functionmust have an exaggerated faith in its work hence of those who regard education intellectual or moral as the panacea we may say that their undue expectations are not without use and that perhaps it is part of the beneficent order of things that their confidence cannot be shaken  even were it true however that by some possible system of moral control children could be moulded into the desired form and even could every parent be indoctrinated with this system we should still be far from achieving the object in view it is forgotten that the carrying out of any such system presupposes on the part of adults a degree of intelligence of goodness of selfcontrol possessed by no one the error made by those who discuss questions of domestic discipline lies in ascribing all the faults and difficulties to the children and none to the parents the current assumption respecting family government as respecting national government is that the virtues are with the rulers and the vices with the ruled judging by educational theories men and women are entirely transfigured in their relations to offspring the citizens we do business with the people we meet in the world we know to be very imperfect creatures in the daily scandals in the quarrels of friends in bankruptcy disclosures in lawsuits in police reports we have constantly thrust before us the pervading selfishness dishonesty brutality yet when we criticise nurserymanagement and canvass the misbehaviour of juveniles we habitually take for granted that these culpable persons are free from moral delinquency in the treatment of their boys and girls so far is this from the truth that we do not hesitate to blame parental misconduct for a great part of the domestic disorder commonly ascribed to the perversity of children we do not assert this of the more sympathetic and selfrestrained among whom we hope most of our readers may be classed but we assert it of the mass what kind of moral culture is to be expected from a mother who time after time angrily shakes her infant because it will not suck which we once saw a mother do how much sense of justice is likely to be instilled by a father who on having his attention drawn by a scream to the fact that his childs finger is jammed between the windowsash and sill begins to beat the child instead of releasing it yet that there are such fathers is testified to us by an eyewitness or to take a still stronger case also vouched for by direct testimonywhat are the educational prospects of the boy who on being taken home with a dislocated thigh is saluted with a castigation it is true that these are extreme instancesinstances exhibiting in human beings that blind instinct which impels brutes to destroy the weakly and injured of their own race but extreme though they are they typify feelings and conduct daily observable in many families who has not repeatedly seen a child slapped by nurse or parent for a fretfulness probably resulting from bodily derangement who when watching a mother snatch up a fallen little one has not often traced both in the rough manner and in the sharplyuttered exclamationyou stupid little thingan irascibility foretelling endless future squabbles is there not in the harsh tones in which a father bids his children be quiet evidence of a deficient fellowfeeling with them are not the constant and often quite needless thwartings that the young experiencethe injunctions to sit still which an active child cannot obey without suffering great nervous irritation the commands not to look out of the window when travelling by railway which on a child of any intelligence entails serious deprivationare not these thwartings we ask signs of a terrible lack of sympathy the truth is that the difficulties of moral education are necessarily of dual originnecessarily result from the combined faults of parents and children if hereditary transmission is a law of nature as every naturalist knows it to be and as our daily remarks and current proverbs admit it to be then on the average of cases the defects of children mirror the defects of their parentson the average of cases we say because complicated as the results are by the transmitted traits of remoter ancestors the correspondence is not special but only general and if on the average of cases this inheritance of defects exists then the evil passions which parents have to check in their children imply like evil passions in themselves hidden it may be from the public eye or perhaps obscured by other feelings but still there evidently therefore the general practice of any ideal system of discipline is hopeless parents are not good enough  moreover even were there methods by which the desired end could be at once effected and even had fathers and mothers sufficient insight sympathy and selfcommand to employ these methods consistently it might still be contended that it would be of no use to reform familygovernment faster than other things are reformed what is it that we aim to do is it not that education of whatever kind has for its proximate end to prepare a child for the business of lifeto produce a citizen who while he is well conducted is also able to make his way in the world and does not making his way in the world by which we mean not the acquirement of wealth but of the funds requisite for bringing up a familydoes not this imply a certain fitness for the world as it now is and if by any system of culture an ideal human being could be produced is it not doubtful whether he would be fit for the world as it now is may we not on the contrary suspect that his too keen sense of rectitude and too elevated standard of conduct would make life intolerable or even impossible and however admirable the result might be considered individually would it not be selfdefeating in so far as society and posterity are concerned there is much reason for thinking that as in a nation so in a family the kind of government is on the whole about as good as the general state of human nature permits it to be we may argue that in the one case as in the other the average character of the people determines the quality of the control exercised in both cases it may be inferred that amelioration of the average character leads to an amelioration of system and further that were it possible to ameliorate the system without the average character being first ameliorated evil rather than good would follow such degree of harshness as children now experience from their parents and teachers may be regarded as but a preparation for that greater harshness which they will meet on entering the world and it may be urged that were it possible for parents and teachers to treat them with perfect equity and entire sympathy it would but intensify the sufferings which the selfishness of men must in after life inflict on them1  but does not this prove too much some one will ask if no system of moral training can forthwith make children what they should be if even were there a system that would do this existing parents are too imperfect to carry it out and if even could such a system be successfully carried out its results would be disastrously incongruous with the present state of society does it not follow that to reform the system now in use is neither practicable nor desirable no it merely follows that reform in domestic government must go on pari passu with other reforms it merely follows that methods of discipline neither can be nor should be ameliorated except by instalments it merely follows that the dictates of abstract rectitude will in practice inevitably be subordinated by the present state of human natureby the imperfections alike of children of parents and of society and can only be better fulfilled as the general character becomes better  at any rate then may rejoin our critic it is clearly useless to set up any ideal standard of family discipline there can be no advantage in elaborating and recommending methods that are in advance of the time again we contend for the contrary just as in the case of political government though pure rectitude may be at present impracticable it is requisite to know where the right lies in order that the changes we make may be towards the right instead of away from it so in the case of domestic government an ideal must be upheld that there may be gradual approximations to it we need fear no evil consequences from the maintenance of such an ideal on the average the constitutional conservatism of mankind is strong enough to prevent too rapid a change things are so organised that until men have grown up to the level of a higher belief they cannot receive it nominally they may hold it but not virtually and even when the truth gets recognised the obstacles to conformity with it are so persistent as to outlive the patience of philanthropists and even of philosophers we may be sure therefore that the difficulties in the way of a normal government of children will always put an adequate check upon the efforts to realise it  with these preliminary explanations let us go on to consider the true aims and methods of moral education after a few pages devoted to the settlement of general principles during the perusal of which we bespeak the readers patience we shall aim by illustrations to make clear the right methods of parental behaviour in the hourly occurring difficulties of family government                                       when a child falls or runs its head against the table it suffers a pain the remembrance of which tends to make it more careful and by repetition of such experiences it is eventually disciplined into proper guidance of its movements if it lays hold of the firebars thrusts its hand into a candleflame or spills boiling water on any part of its skin the resulting burn or scald is a lesson not easily forgotten so deep an impression is produced by one or two events of this kind that no persuasion will afterwards induce it thus to disregard the laws of its constitution  now in these cases nature illustrates to us in the simplest way the true theory and practice of moral disciplinea theory and practice which however much they may seem to the superficial like those commonly received we shall find on examination to differ from them very widely  observe first that in bodily injuries and their penalties we have misconduct and its consequences reduced to their simplest forms though according to their popular acceptations right and wrong are words scarcely applicable to actions that have none but direct bodily effects yet whoever considers the matter will see that such actions must be as much classifiable under these heads as any other actions from whatever assumption they start all theories of morality agree that conduct whose total results immediate and remote are beneficial is good conduct while conduct whose total results immediate and remote are injurious is bad conduct the ultimate standards by which all men judge of behaviour are the resulting happiness or misery we consider drunkenness wrong because of the physical degeneracy and accompanying moral evils entailed on the drunkard and his dependents did theft give pleasure both to taker and loser we should not find it in our catalogue of sins were it conceivable that kind actions multiplied human sufferings we should condemn themshould not consider them kind it needs but to read the first newspaperleader or listen to any conversation on social affairs to see that acts of parliament political movements philanthropic agitations in common with the doings of individuals are judged by their anticipated results in augmenting the pleasures or pains of men and if on analysing all secondary superinduced ideas we find these to be our final tests of right and wrong we cannot refuse to class bodily conduct as right or wrong according to the beneficial or detrimental results produced  note in the second place the character of the punishments by which these physical transgressions are prevented punishments we call them in the absence of a better word for they are not punishments in the literal sense they are not artificial and unnecessary inflictions of pain but are simply the beneficent checks to actions that are essentially at variance with bodily welfarechecks in the absence of which life would be quickly destroyed by bodily injuries it is the peculiarity of these penalties if we must so call them that they are simply the unavoidable consequences of the deeds which they follow they are nothing more than the inevitable reactions entailed by the childs actions  let it be further borne in mind that these painful reactions are proportionate to the transgressions a slight accident brings a slight pain a more serious one a severer pain it is not ordained that an urchin who tumbles over the doorstep shall suffer in excess of the amount necessary with the view of making it still more cautious than the necessary suffering will make it but from its daily experience it is left to learn the greater or less penalties of greater or less errors and to behave accordingly  and then mark lastly that these natural reactions which follow the childs wrong actions are constant direct unhesitating and not to be escaped no threats but a silent rigorous performance if a child runs a pin into its finger pain follows if it does it again there is again the same result and so on perpetually in all its dealing with inorganic nature it finds this unswerving persistence which listens to no excuse and from which there is no appeal and very soon recognising this stern though beneficent discipline it becomes extremely careful not to transgress  still more significant will these general truths appear when we remember that they hold throughout adult life as well as throughout infantine life it is by an experimentallygained knowledge of the natural consequences that men and women are checked when they go wrong after homeeducation has ceased and when there are no longer parents and teachers to forbid this or that kind of conduct there comes into play a discipline like that by which the young child is trained to selfguidance if the youth entering on the business of life idles away his time and fulfils slowly or unskilfully the duties entrusted to him there by and by follows the natural penalty he is discharged and left to suffer for awhile the evils of a relative poverty on the unpunctual man ever missing his appointments of business and pleasure there continually fall the consequent inconveniences losses and deprivations the tradesmen who charges too high a rate of profit loses his customers and so is checked in his greediness diminishing practice teaches the inattentive doctor to bestow more trouble on his patients the too credulous creditor and the oversanguine speculator alike learn by the difficulties which rashness entails on them the necessity of being more cautious in their engagements and so throughout the life of every citizen in the quotation so often made apropos of such casesthe burnt child dreads the firewe see not only that the analogy between this social discipline and natures early discipline of infants is universally recognised but we also see an implied conviction that this discipline is of the most efficient kind nay indeed this conviction is more than implied it is distinctly stated every one has heard others confess that only by dearly bought experience had they been induced to give up some bad or foolish course of conduct formerly pursued every one has heard in the criticism passed on the doings of this spendthrift or the other schemer the remark that advice was useless and that nothing but bitter experience would produce any effect nothing that is but suffering the unavoidable consequences and if further proof be needed that the natural reaction is not only the most efficient penalty but that no humanlydevised penalty can replace it we have such further proof in the notorious illsuccess of our various penal systems out of the many methods of criminal discipline that have been proposed and legally enforced none have answered the expectations of their advocates artificial punishments have failed to produce reformation and have in many cases increased the criminality the only successful reformatories are those privatelyestablished ones which approximate their regime to the method of naturewhich do little more than administer the natural consequences of criminal conduct diminishing the criminals liberty of action as much as is needful for the safety of society and requiring him to maintain himself while living under this restraint thus we see both that the discipline by which the young child is taught to regulate its movements is the discipline by which the great mass of adults are kept in order and more or less improved and that the discipline humanlydevised for the worst adults fails when it diverges from this divinelyordained discipline and begins to succeed on approximating to it                                       have we not here then the guiding principle of moral education must we not infer that the system so beneficent in its effects during infancy and maturity will be equally beneficent throughout youth can any one believe that the method which answers so well in the first and the last divisions of life will not answer in the intermediate division is it not manifest that as ministers and interpreters of nature it is the function of parents to see that their children habitually experience the true consequences of their conductthe natural reactions neither warding them off nor intensifying them nor putting artificial consequences in place of them no unprejudiced reader will hesitate in his assent  probably however not a few will contend that already most parents do thisthat the punishments they inflict are in the majority of cases the true consequences of illconductthat parental anger venting itself in harsh words and deeds is the result of a childs transgressionand that in the suffering physical or moral which the child is subject to it experiences the natural reaction of its misbehaviour along with much error this assertion contains some truth it is unquestionable that the displeasure of fathers and mothers is a true consequence of juvenile delinquency and that the manifestation of it is a normal check upon such delinquency the scoldings and threats and blows which a passionate parent visits on offending little ones are doubtless effects actually drawn from such a parent by their offences and so are in some sort to be considered as among the natural reactions of their wrong actions nor are we prepared to say that these modes of treatment are not relatively rightright that is in relation to the uncontrollable children of illcontrolled adults and right in relation to a state of society in which such illcontrolled adults make up the mass of the people as already suggested educational systems like political and other institutions are generally as good as the state of human nature permits the barbarous children of barbarous parents are probably only to be restrained by the barbarous methods which such parents spontaneously employ while submission to these barbarous methods is perhaps the best preparation such children can have for the barbarous society in which they are presently to play a part conversely the civilised members of a civilised society will spontaneously manifest their displeasure in less violent wayswill spontaneously use milder measuresmeasures strong enough for their betternatured children thus it is true that in so far as the expression of parental feeling is concerned the principle of the natural reaction is always more or less followed the system of domestic government ever gravitates towards its right form  but now observe two important facts the first fact is that in states of rapid transition like ours which witness a continuous battle between old and new theories and old and new practices the educational methods in use are apt to be considerably out of harmony with the times in deference to dogmas fit only for the ages that uttered them many parents inflict punishments that do violence to their own feelings and so visit on their children unnatural reactions while other parents enthusiastic in their hopes of immediate perfection rush to the opposite extreme the second fact is that the discipline of chief value is not the experience of parental approbation or disapprobation but it is the experience of those results which would ultimately flow from the conduct in the absence of parental opinion or interference the truly instructive and salutary consequences are not those inflicted by parents when they take upon themselves to be natures proxies but they are those inflicted by nature herself we will endeavour to make this distinction clear by a few illustrations which while they show what we mean by natural reactions as contrasted with artificial ones will afford some practical suggestions  in every family where there are young children there daily occur cases of what mothers and servants call making a litter a child has had out its box of toys and leaves them scattered about the floor or a handful of flowers brought in from a morning walk is presently seen dispersed over tables and chairs or a little girl making dollsclothes disfigures the room with shreds in most cases the trouble of rectifying this disorder falls anywhere but where it should occurring in the nursery the nurse herself with many grumblings about tiresome little things undertakes the task if belowstairs the task usually devolves either on one of the elder children or on the housemaid the transgressor being visited with nothing more than a scolding in this very simple case however there are many parents wise enough to follow out more or less consistently the normal coursethat of making the child itself collect the toys or shreds the labour of putting things in order is the true consequence of having put them in disorder every trader in his office every wife in her household has daily experience of this fact and if education be a preparation for the business of life then every child should also from the beginning have daily experience of this fact if the natural penalty be met by refractory behaviour which it may perhaps be where the system of moral discipline previously pursued has been bad then the proper course is to let the child feel the ulterior reaction caused by its disobedience having refused or neglected to pick up and put away the things it has scattered about and having thereby entailed the trouble of doing this on some one else the child should on subsequent occasions be denied the means of giving this trouble when next it petitions for its toybox the reply of its mamma should bethe last time you had your toys you left them lying on the floor and jane had to pick them up jane is too busy to pick up every day the things you leave about and i cannot do it myself so that as you will not put away your toys when you have done with them i cannot let you have them this is obviously a natural consequence neither increased nor lessened and must be so recognised by a child the penalty comes too at the moment when it is most keenly felt a newborn desire is balked at the moment of anticipated gratification and the strong impression so produced can scarcely fail to have an effect on the future conduct an effect which by consistent repetition will do whatever can be done in curing the fault add to which that by this method a child is early taught the lesson which cannot be learnt too soon that in this world of ours pleasures are rightly to be obtained only by labour  take another case not long since we had frequently to hear the reprimands visited on a little girl who was scarcely ever ready in time for the daily walk of eager disposition and apt to become absorbed in the occupation of the moment constance never thought of putting on her things till the rest were ready the governess and the other children had almost invariably to wait and from the mamma there almost invariably came the same scolding utterly as this system failed it never occurred to the mamma to let constance experience the natural penalty nor indeed would she try it when it was suggested to her in the world unreadiness entails the loss of some advantage that would else have been gained the train is gone or the steamboat is just leaving its moorings or the best things in the market are sold or all the good seats in the concertroom are filled and every one in cases perpetually occurring may see that it is the prospective deprivations which prevent people from being too late is not the inference obvious should not the prospective deprivations control a childs conduct also if constance is not ready at the appointed time the natural result is that of being left behind and losing her walk and after having once or twice remained at home while the rest were enjoying themselves in the fieldsafter having felt that this loss of a muchprized gratification was solely due to want of promptitude amendment would in all probability take place at any rate the measure would be more effective than that perpetual scolding which ends only in producing callousness  again when children with more than usual carelessness break or lose the things given to them the natural penaltythe penalty which makes grownup persons more carefulis the consequent inconvenience the lack of the lost or damaged article and the cost of replacing it are the experiences by which men and women are disciplined in these matters and the experiences of children should be as much as possible assimilated to theirs we do not refer to that early period at which toys are pulled to pieces in the process of learning their physical properties and at which the results of carelessness cannot be understood but to a later period when the meaning and advantages of property are perceived when a boy old enough to possess a penknife uses it so roughly as to snap the blade or leaves it in the grass by some hedgeside where he was cutting a stick a thoughtless parent or some indulgent relative will commonly forthwith buy him another not seeing that by doing this a valuable lesson is prevented in such a case a father may properly explain that penknives cost money and that to get money requires labour that he cannot afford to purchase new penknives for one who loses or breaks them and that until he sees evidence of greater carefulness he must decline to make good the loss a parallel discipline will serve to check extravagance  these few familiar instances here chosen because of the simplicity with which they illustrate our point will make clear to every one the distinction between those natural penalties which we contend are the truly efficient ones and those artificial penalties commonly substituted for them before going on to exhibit the higher and subtler applications of the principle exemplified let us note its many and great superiorities over the principle or rather the empirical practice which prevails in most families  one superiority is that the pursuance of it generates right conceptions of cause and effect which by frequent and consistent experience are eventually rendered definite and complete proper conduct in life is much better guaranteed when the good and evil consequences of actions are understood than when they are merely believed on authority a child who finds that disorderliness entails the trouble of putting things in order or who misses a gratification from dilatoriness or whose carelessness is followed by the want of some muchprized possession not only suffers a keenlyfelt consequence but gains a knowledge of causation both the one and the other being just like those which adult life will bring whereas a child who in such cases receives a reprimand or some factitious penalty not only experiences a consequence for which it often cares very little but misses that instruction respecting the essential natures of good and evil conduct which it would else have gathered it is a vice of the common system of artificial rewards and punishments long since noticed by the clearsighted that by substituting for the natural results of misbehaviour certain tasks or castigations it produces a radically wrong moral standard having throughout infancy and boyhood always regarded parental or tutorial displeasure as the chief result of a forbidden action the youth has gained an established association of ideas between such action and such displeasure as cause and effect hence when parents and tutors have abdicated and their displeasure is not to be feared the restraints on forbidden actions are in great measure removed the true restraints the natural reactions having yet to be learnt by sad experience as writes one who has had personal knowledge of this shortsighted systemyoung men let loose from school particularly those whose parents have neglected to exert their influence plunge into every description of extravagance they know no rule of actionthey are ignorant of the reasons for moral conductthey have no foundation to rest uponand until they have been severely disciplined by the world are extremely dangerous members of society  another great advantage of this natural discipline is that it is a discipline of pure justice and will be recognised as such by every child whoso suffers nothing more than the evil which in the order of nature results from his own misbehaviour is much less likely to think himself wrongly treated than if he suffers an artificially inflicted evil and this will hold of children as of men take the case of a boy who is habitually reckless of his clothesscrambles through hedges without caution or is utterly regardless of mud if he is beaten or sent to bed he is apt to consider himself illused and is more likely to brood over his injuries than to repent of his transgressions but suppose he is required to rectify as far as possible the harm he has doneto clean off the mud with which he has covered himself or to mend the tear as well as he can will he not feel that the evil is one of his own producing will he not while paying this penalty be continuously conscious of the connection between it and its cause and will he not spite his irritation recognise more or less clearly the justice of the arrangement if several lessons of this kind fail to produce amendmentif suits of clothes are prematurely spoiledif the father pursuing this same system of discipline declines to spend money for new ones until the ordinary time has elapsedand if meanwhile there occur occasions on which having no decent clothes to go in the boy is debarred from joining the rest of the family on holiday excursions and fête days it is manifest that while he will keenly feel the punishment he can scarcely fail to trace the chain of causation and to perceive that his own carelessness is the origin of it and seeing this he will not have any such sense of injustice as if there were no obvious connection between the transgression and its penalty  again the tempers both of parents and children are much less liable to be ruffled under this system than under the ordinary system when instead of letting children experience the painful results which naturally follow from wrong conduct parents themselves inflict certain other painful results they produce double mischief making as they do multiplied family laws and identifying their own supremacy and dignity with the maintenance of these laws every transgression is regarded as an offence against themselves and a cause of anger on their part and then come the further vexations which result from taking upon themselves in the shape of extra labour or cost those evil consequences which should have been allowed to fall on the wrongdoers similarly with the children penalties which the necessary reaction of things brings round upon thempenalties which are inflicted by impersonal agency produce an irritation that is comparatively slight and transient whereas penalties voluntarily inflicted by a parent and afterwards thought of as caused by him or her produce an irritation both greater and more continued just consider how disastrous would be the result if this empirical method were pursued from the beginning suppose it were possible for parents to take upon themselves the physical sufferings entailed on their children by ignorance and awkwardness and that while bearing these evil consequences they visited on their children certain other evil consequences with the view of teaching them the impropriety of their conduct suppose that when a child who had been forbidden to meddle with the kettle spilt boiling water on its foot the mother vicariously assumed the scald and gave a blow in place of it and similarly in all other cases would not the daily mishaps be sources of far more anger than now would there not be chronic illtemper on both sides yet an exactly parallel policy is pursued in afteryears a father who beats his boy for carelessly or wilfully breaking a sisters toy and then himself pays for a new toy does substantially this same thinginflicts an artificial penalty on the transgressor and takes the natural penalty on himself his own feelings and those of the transgressor being alike needlessly irritated did he simply require restitution to be made he would produce far less heartburning if he told the boy that a new toy must be bought at his the boys cost and that his supply of pocketmoney must be withheld to the needful extent there would be much less disturbance of temper on either side while in the deprivation afterwards felt the boy would experience the equitable and salutary consequence in brief the system of discipline by natural reactions is less injurious to temper both because it is perceived to be nothing more than pure justice and because it in great part substitutes the impersonal agency of nature for the personal agency of parents  whence also follows the manifest corollary that under this system the parental and filial relation being a more friendly will be a more influential one whether in parent or child anger however caused and to whomsoever directed is detrimental but anger in a parent towards a child and in a child towards a parent is especially detrimental because it weakens that bond of sympathy which is essential to beneficent control from the law of association of ideas it inevitably results both in young and old that dislike is contracted towards things which in experience are habitually connected with disagreeable feelings or where attachment originally existed it is diminished or turned into repugnance according to the quantity of painful impressions received parental wrath venting itself in reprimands and castigations cannot fail if often repeated to produce filial alienation while the resentment and sulkiness of children cannot fail to weaken the affection felt for them and may even end in destroying it hence the numerous cases in which parents and especially fathers who are commonly deputed to inflict the punishment are regarded with indifference if not with aversion and hence the equally numerous cases in which children are looked upon as inflictions seeing then as all must do that estrangement of this kind is fatal to a salutary moral culture it follows that parents cannot be too solicitous in avoiding occasions of direct antagonism with their children and therefore they cannot too anxiously avail themselves of this discipline of natural consequences which by relieving them from penal functions prevents mutual exasperations and estrangements  the method of moral culture by experience of the normal reactions which is the divinelyordained method alike for infancy and for adult life we thus find to be equally applicable during the intermediate childhood and youth among the advantages of this method we seefirst that it gives that rational knowledge of right and wrong conduct which results from personal experience of their good and bad consequences second that the child suffering nothing more than the painful effects of its own wrong actions must recognise more or less clearly the justice of the penalties third that recognising the justice of the penalties and receiving them through the working of things rather than at the hands of an individual its temper is less disturbed while the parent fulfilling the comparatively passive duty of letting the natural penalties be felt preserves a comparative equanimity fourth that mutual exasperations being thus prevented a much happier and a more influential relation will exist between parent and child                                       but what is to be done in cases of more serious misconduct some will ask how is this plan to be carried out when a petty theft has been committed or when a lie has been told or when some younger brother or sister has been illused  before replying to these questions let us consider the bearings of a few illustrative facts  living in the family of his brotherinlaw a friend of ours had undertaken the education of his little nephew and niece this he had conducted more perhaps from natural sympathy than from reasonedout conclusions in the spirit of the method above set forth the two children were in doors his pupils and out of doors his companions they daily joined him in walks and botanising excursions eagerly sought plants for him looked on while he examined and identified them and in this and other ways were ever gaining pleasure and instruction in his society in short morally considered he stood to them much more in the position of parent than either their father or mother did describing to us the results of this policy he gave among other instances the following one evening having need for some article lying in another part of the house he asked his nephew to fetch it interested as the boy was in some amusement of the moment he contrary to his wont either exhibited great reluctance or refused we forget which his uncle disapproving of a coercive course went himself for that which he wanted merely exhibiting by his manner the annoyance this illbehaviour gave him and when later in the evening the boy made overtures for the usual play they were gravely repelledthe uncle manifested just that coldness naturally produced in him and so let the boy feel the necessary consequences of his conduct next morning at the usual time for rising our friend heard a new voice outside the door and in walked his little nephew with the hot water peering about the room to see what else could be done the boy then exclaimed oh you want your boots and forthwith rushed downstairs to fetch them in this and other ways he showed a true penitence for his misconduct he endeavoured by unusual services to make up for the service he had refused his better feelings had made a real conquest over his lower ones and acquired strength by the victory and having felt what it was to be without it he valued more than before the friendship he thus regained  this gentleman is now himself a father acts on the same system and finds it answer completely he makes himself thoroughly his childrens friend the evening is longed for by them because he will be at home and they especially enjoy sunday because he is with them all day thus possessing their perfect confidence and affection he finds that the simple display of his approbation or disapprobation gives him abundant power of control if on his return home he hears that one of his boys has been naughty he behaves towards him with that coolness which the consciousness of the boys misconduct naturally produces and he finds this a most efficient punishment the mere withholding of the usual caresses is a source of much distressproduces a more prolonged fit of crying than a beating would do and the dread of this purely moral penalty is he says ever present during his absence so much so that frequently during the day his children ask their mamma how they have behaved and whether the report will be good recently the eldest an active urchin of five in one of those bursts of animal spirits common in healthy children committed sundry extravagances during his mammas absencecut off part of his brothers hair and wounded himself with a razor taken from his fathers dressingcase hearing of these occurrences on his return the father did not speak to the boy either that night or next morning besides the immediate tribulation the effect was that when a few days after the mamma was about to go out she was entreated by the boy not to do so and on inquiry it appeared his fear was that he might again transgress in her absence  we have introduced these facts before replying to the questionwhat is to be done with the graver offences for the purpose of first exhibiting the relation that may and ought to be established between parents and children for on the existence of this relation depends the successful treatment of these graver offences and as a further preliminary we must now point out that the establishment of this relation will result from adopting the system here advocated already we have shown that by simply letting a child experience the painful reactions of its own wrong actions a parent avoids antagonism and escapes being regarded as an enemy but it remains to be shown that where this course has been consistently pursued from the beginning a feeling of active friendship will be generated  at present mothers and fathers are mostly considered by their offspring as friend enemies determined as the impressions of children inevitably are by the treatment they receive and oscillating as that treatment does between bribery and thwarting between petting and scolding between gentleness and castigation they necessarily acquire conflicting beliefs respecting the parental character a mother commonly thinks it sufficient to tell her little boy that she is his best friend and assuming that he ought to believe her concludes that he will do so it is all for your good i know what is proper for you better than you do yourself you are not old enough to understand it now but when you grow up you will thank me for doing what i dothese and like assertions are daily reiterated meanwhile the boy is daily suffering positive penalties and is hourly forbidden to do this that and the other which he wishes to do by words he hears that his happiness is the end in view but from the accompanying deeds he habitually receives more or less pain incompetent as he is to understand that future which his mother has in view or how this treatment conduces to the happiness of that future he judges by the results he feels and finding such results anything but pleasurable he becomes sceptical respecting her professions of friendship and is it not folly to expect any other issue must not the child reason from the evidence he has got and does not this evidence seem to warrant his conclusion the mother would reason in just the same way if similarly placed if among her acquaintance she found some one who was constantly thwarting her wishes uttering sharp reprimands and occasionally inflicting actual penalties on her she would pay small attention to any professions of anxiety for her welfare which accompanied these acts why then does she suppose that her boy will do otherwise  but now observe how different will be the results if the system we contend for be consistently pursuedif the mother not only avoids becoming the instrument of punishment but plays the part of a friend by warning her boy of the punishments which nature will inflict take a case and that it may illustrate the mode in which this policy is to be early initiated let it be one of the simplest cases suppose that prompted by the experimental spirit so conspicuous in children whose proceedings instinctively conform to the inductive method of inquirysuppose that so prompted the boy is amusing himself by lighting pieces of paper in the candle and watching them burn a mother of the ordinary unreflective stamp will either on the plea of keeping him out of mischief or from fear that he will burn himself command him to desist and in case of noncompliance will snatch the paper from him but should he be fortunate enough to have a mother of some rationality who knows that this interest with which he is watching the paper burn results from a healthy inquisitiveness and who has also the wisdom to consider the results of interference she will reason thusif i put a stop to this i shall prevent the acquirement of a certain amount of knowledge it is true that i may save the child from a burn but what then he is sure to burn himself sometime and it is quite essential to his safety in life that he should learn by experience the properties of flame if i forbid him from running this present risk he will certainly hereafter run the same or a greater risk when no one is present to prevent him whereas should he have an accident now that i am by i can save him from any great injury moreover were i to make him desist i should thwart him in the pursuit of what is in itself a purely harmless and indeed instructive gratification and he would regard me with more or less illfeeling ignorant as he is of the pain from which i would save him and feeling only the pain of a balked desire he could not fail to look on me as the cause of that pain to save him from a hurt which he cannot conceive and which has therefore no existence for him i hurt him in a way which he feels keenly enough and so become from his point of view a minister of evil my best course then is simply to warn him of the danger and to be ready to prevent any serious damage and following out this conclusion she says to the childi fear you will hurt yourself if you do that suppose now that the boy persevering as he will probably do ends by burning his hand what are the results in the first place he has gained an experience which he must gain eventually and which for his own safety he cannot gain too soon and in the second place he has found that his mothers disapproval or warning was meant for his welfare he has a further positive experience of her benevolencea further reason for placing confidence in her judgment and kindnessa further reason for loving her  of course in those occasional hazards where there is a risk of broken limbs or other serious injury forcible prevention is called for but leaving out extreme cases the system pursued should be not that of guarding a child from the small risks which it daily runs but that of advising and warning it against them and by pursuing this course a much stronger filial affection will be generated than commonly exists if here as elsewhere the discipline of the natural reactions is allowed to come into playif in those outdoor scramblings and indoor experiments by which children are liable to injure themselves they are allowed to persist subject only to dissuasion more or less earnest according to the danger there cannot fail to arise an everincreasing faith in the parental friendship and guidance not only as before shown does the adoption of this course enable fathers and mothers to avoid the odium which attaches to the infliction of positive punishment but as we here see it enables them to avoid the odium which attaches to constant thwartings and even to turn those incidents that commonly cause squabbles into a means of strengthening the mutual good feeling instead of being told in words which deeds seem to contradict that their parents are their best friends children will learn this truth by a consistent daily experience and so learning it will acquire a degree of trust and attachment which nothing else can give  and now having indicated the more sympathetic relation which must result from the habitual use of this method let us return to the question above puthow is this method to be applied to the graver offences  note in the first place that these graver offences are likely to be both less frequent and less grave under the régime we have described than under the ordinary régime the illbehaviour of many children is itself a consequence of that chronic irritation in which they are kept by bad management the state of isolation and antagonism produced by frequent punishment necessarily deadens the sympathies necessarily therefore opens the way to those transgressions which the sympathies check that harsh treatment which children of the same family inflict on each other is often in great measure a reflex of the harsh treatment they receive from adultspartly suggested by direct example and partly generated by the illtemper and the tendency to vicarious retaliation which follow chastisements and scoldings it cannot be questioned that the greater activity of the affections and happier state of feeling maintained in children by the discipline we have described must prevent them from sinning against each other so gravely and so frequently the still more reprehensible offences as lies and petty thefts will by the same causes be diminished domestic estrangement is a fruitful source of such transgressions it is a law of human nature visible enough to all who observe that those who are debarred the higher gratifications fall back upon the lower those who have no sympathetic pleasures seek selfish ones and hence conversely the maintenance of happier relations between parents and children is calculated to diminish the number of those offences of which selfishness is the origin  when however such offences are committed as they will occasionally be even under the best system the discipline of consequences may still be resorted to and if there exists that bond of confidence and affection above described this discipline will be efficient for what are the natural consequences say of a theft they are of two kindsdirect and indirect the direct consequence as dictated by pure equity is that of making restitution a just ruler and every parent should aim to be one will demand that when possible a wrong act shall be undone by a right one and in the case of theft this implies either the restoration of the thing stolen or if it is consumed the giving of an equivalent which in the case of a child may be effected out of its pocketmoney the indirect and more serious consequence is the grave displeasure of parentsa consequence which inevitably follows among all peoples civilised enough to regard theft as a crime but it will be said the manifestation of parental displeasure either in words or blows is the ordinary course in these cases the method leads here to nothing new very true already we have admitted that in some directions this method is spontaneously pursued already we have shown that there is a tendency for educational systems to gravitate towards the true system and here we may remark as before that the intensity of this natural reaction will in the beneficent order of things adjust itself to the requirementsthat this parental displeasure will vent itself in violent measures during comparatively barbarous times when children are also comparatively barbarous and will express itself less cruelly in those more advanced social states in which by implication the children are amenable to milder treatment but what it chiefly concerns us here to observe is that the manifestation of strong parental displeasure produced by one of these graver offences will be potent for good just in proportion to the warmth of the attachment existing between parent and child just in proportion as the discipline of natural consequences has been consistently pursued in other cases will it be efficient in this case proof is within the experience of all if they will look for it  for does not every one know that when he has offended another the amount of regret he feels of course leaving worldly considerations out of the question varies with the degree of sympathy he has for that other is he not conscious that when the person offended is an enemy the having given him annoyance is apt to be a source rather of secret satisfaction than of sorrow does he not remember that where umbrage has been taken by some total stranger he has felt much less concern than he would have done had such umbrage been taken by one with whom he was intimate while conversely has not the anger of an admired and cherished friend been regarded by him as a serious misfortune long and keenly regretted well the effects of parental displeasure on children must similarly vary with the preexisting relationship where there is an established alienation the feeling of a child who has transgressed is a purely selfish fear of the impending physical penalties or deprivations and after these have been inflicted the injurious antagonism and dislike which result add to the alienation on the contrary where there exists a warm filial affection produced by a consistent parental friendship the state of mind caused by parental displeasure is not only a salutary check to future misconduct of like kind but is intrinsically salutary the moral pain consequent on having for the time being lost so loved a friend stands in place of the physical pain usually inflicted and proves equally if not more efficient while instead of the fear and vindictiveness excited by the one course there are excited by the other a sympathy with parental sorrow a genuine regret for having caused it and a desire by some atonement to reestablish the friendly relationship instead of bringing into play those egotistic feelings whose predominance is the cause of criminal acts there are brought into play those altruistic feelings which check criminal acts thus the discipline of natural consequences is applicable to grave as well as trivial faults and the practice of it conduces not simply to the repression but to the eradication of such faults  in brief the truth is that savageness begets savageness and gentleness begets gentleness children who are unsympathetically treated become unsympathetic whereas treating them with due fellowfeeling is a means of cultivating their fellowfeeling with family governments as with political ones a harsh despotism itself generates a great part of the crimes it has to repress while on the other hand a mild and liberal rule both avoids many causes of dissension and so ameliorates the tone of feeling as to diminish the tendency to transgression as john locke long since remarked great severity of punishment does but very little good nay great harm in education and i believe it will be found that cæteris paribus those children who have been most chastised seldom make the best men in confirmation of which opinion we may cite the fact not long since made public by mr rogers chaplain of the pentonville prison that those juvenile criminals who have been whipped are those who most frequently return to prison conversely the beneficial effects of a kinder treatment are well illustrated in a fact stated to us by a french lady in whose house we recently stayed in paris apologising for the disturbance daily caused by a little boy who was unmanageable both at home and at school she expressed her fear that there was no remedy save that which had succeeded in the case of an elder brother namely sending him to an english school she explained that at various schools in paris this elder brother had proved utterly untractable that in despair they had followed the advice to send him to england and that on his return home he was as good as he had before been bad this remarkable change she ascribed entirely to the comparative mildness of the english discipline                                       after the foregoing exposition of principles our remaining space may best be occupied by a few of the chief maxims and rules deducible from them and with a view to brevity we will put these in a hortatory form  do not expect from a child any great amount of moral goodness during early years every civilised man passes through that phase of character exhibited by the barbarous race from which he is descended as the childs featuresflat nose forwardopening nostrils large lips wideapart eyes absent frontal sinus etcresemble for a time those of the savage so too do his instincts hence the tendencies to cruelty to thieving to lying so general among childrentendencies which even without the aid of discipline will become more or less modified just as the features do the popular idea that children are innocent while it is true with respect to evil knowledge is totally false with respect to evil impulses as half an hours observation in the nursery will prove to any one boys when left to themselves as at public schools treat each other more brutally than men do and were they left to themselves at an earlier age their brutality would be still more conspicuous  not only is it unwise to set up a high standard of good conduct for children but it is even unwise to use very urgent incitements to good conduct already most people recognise the detrimental results of intellectual precocity but there remains to be recognised the fact that moral precocity also has detrimental results our higher moral faculties like our higher intellectual ones are comparatively complex by consequence both are comparatively late in their evolution and with the one as with the other an early activity produced by stimulation will be at the expense of the future character hence the not uncommon anomaly that those who during childhood were models of juvenile goodness by and by undergo a seemingly inexplicable change for the worse and end by being not above but below par while relatively exemplary men are often the issue of a childhood by no means promising  be content therefore with moderate measures and moderate results bear in mind that a higher morality like a higher intelligence must be reached by slow growth and you will then have patience with those imperfections which your child hourly displays you will be less prone to that constant scolding and threatening and forbidding by which many parents induce a chronic domestic irritation in the foolish hope that they will thus make their children what they should be  this liberal form of domestic government which does not seek despotically to regulate all the details of a childs conduct necessarily results from the system we advocate satisfy yourself with seeing that your child always suffers the natural consequences of his actions and you will avoid that excess of control in which so many parents err leave him wherever you can to the discipline of experience and you will save him from that hothouse virtue which overregulation produces in yielding natures or that demoralising antagonism which it produces in independent ones  by aiming in all cases to insure the natural reactions to your childs actions you will put an advantageous check on your own temper the method of moral education pursued by many we fear by most parents is little else than that of venting their anger in the way that first suggests itself the slaps and rough shakings and sharp words with which a mother commonly visits her offsprings small offences many of them not offences considered intrinsically are generally but the manifestations of her illcontrolled feelingsresult much more from the promptings of those feelings than from a wish to benefit the offenders but by pausing in each case of transgression to consider what is the normal consequence and how it may best be brought home to the transgressor some little time is obtained for the mastery of yourself the mere blind anger first aroused settles down into a less vehement feeling and one not so likely to mislead you  do not however seek to behave as a passionless instrument remember that besides the natural reactions to your childs actions which the working of things tends to bring round on him your own approbation or disapprobation is also a natural reaction and one of the ordained agencies for guiding him the error we have been combating is that of substituting parental displeasure and its artificial penalties for the penalties which nature has established but while it should not be substituted for these natural penalties we by no means argue that it should not in some form accompany them though the secondary kind of punishment should not usurp the place of the primary kind it may in moderation rightly supplement the primary kind such amount of sorrow or indignation as you feel should be expressed in words or manner subject of course to the approval of your judgment the kind and degree of feeling produced in you will necessarily depend on your own character and it is therefore useless to say it should be this or that nevertheless you may endeavour to modify the feeling into that which you believe ought to be entertained beware however of the two extremes not only in respect of the intensity but in respect of the duration of your displeasure on the one hand avoid that weak impulsiveness so general among mothers which scolds and forgives almost in the same breath on the other hand do not unduly continue to show estrangement of feeling lest you accustom your child to do without your friendship and so lose your influence over him the moral reactions called forth from you by your childs actions you should as much as possible assimilate to those which you conceive would be called forth from a parent of perfect nature  be sparing of commands command only when other means are inapplicable or have failed in frequent orders the parents advantage is more considered than the childs says richter as in primitive societies a breach of law is punished not so much because it is intrinsically wrong as because it is a disregard of the kings authoritya rebellion against him so in many families the penalty visited on a transgressor is prompted less by reprobation of the offence than by anger at the disobedience listen to the ordinary speecheshow dare you disobey me i tell you ill make you do it sir ill soon teach you who is masterand then consider what the words the tone and the manner imply a determination to subjugate is far more conspicuous in them than anxiety for the childs welfare for the time being the attitude of mind differs but little from that of a despot bent on punishing a recalcitrant subject the rightfeeling parent however like the philanthropic legislator will rejoice not in coercion but in dispensing with coercion he will do without law wherever other modes of regulating conduct can be successfully employed and he will regret the having recourse to law when law is necessary as richter remarksthe best rule in politics is said to be pas trop gouverner it is also true in education and in spontaneous conformity with this maxim parents whose lust of dominion is restrained by a true sense of duty will aim to make their children control themselves as much as possible and will fall back upon absolutism only as a last resort  but whenever you do command command with decision and consistency if the case is one which really cannot be otherwise dealt with then issue your fiat and having issued it never afterwards swerve from it consider well what you are going to do weigh all the consequences think whether you have adequate firmness of purpose and then if you finally make the law enforce obedience at whatever cost let your penalties be like the penalties inflicted by inanimate natureinevitable the hot cinder burns a child the first time he seizes it it burns him the second time it burns him the third time it burns him every time and he very soon learns not to touch the hot cinder if you are equally consistentif the consequences which you tell your child will follow specified acts follow with like uniformity he will soon come to respect your laws as he does those of nature and this respect once established will prevent endless domestic evils of errors in education one of the worst is inconsistency as in a community crimes multiply when there is no certain administration of justice so in a family an immense increase of transgressions results from a hesitating or irregular infliction of punishments a weak mother who perpetually threatens and rarely performswho makes rules in haste and repents of them at leisurewho treats the same offence now with severity and now with leniency as the passing humour dictates is laying up miseries for herself and her children she is making herself contemptible in their eyes she is setting them an example of uncontrolled feelings she is encouraging them to transgress by the prospect of probable impunity she is entailing endless squabbles and accompanying damage to her own temper and the tempers of her little ones she is reducing their minds to a moral chaos which after years of bitter experience will with difficulty bring into order better even a barbarous form of domestic government carried out consistently than a humane one inconsistently carried out again we say avoid coercive measures whenever it is possible to do so but when you find despotism really necessary be despotic in good earnest  remember that the aim of your discipline should be to produce a selfgoverning being not to produce a being to be governed by others were your children fated to pass their lives as slaves you could not too much accustom them to slavery during their childhood but as they are by and by to be free men with no one to control their daily conduct you cannot too much accustom them to selfcontrol while they are still under your eye this it is which makes the system of discipline by natural consequences so especially appropriate to the social state which we in england have now reached in feudal times when one of the chief evils the citizen had to fear was the anger of his superiors it was well that during childhood parental vengeance should be a chief means of government but now that the citizen has little to fear from any onenow that the good or evil which he experiences is mainly that which in the order of things results from his own conduct he should from his first years begin to learn experimentally the good or evil consequences which naturally follow this or that conduct aim therefore to diminish the parental government as fast as you can substitute for it in your childs mind that selfgovernment arising from a foresight of results during infancy a considerable amount of absolutism is necessary a threeyear old urchin playing with an open razor cannot be allowed to learn by this discipline of consequences for the consequences may be too serious but as intelligence increases the number of peremptory interferences may be and should be diminished with the view of gradually ending them as maturity is approached all transitions are dangerous and the most dangerous is the transition from the restraint of the family circle to the nonrestraint of the world hence the importance of pursuing the policy we advocate which by cultivating a boys faculty of selfrestraint by continually increasing the degree in which he is left to his selfrestraint and by so bringing him step by step to a state of unaided selfrestraint obliterates the ordinary sudden and hazardous change from externallygoverned youth to internallygoverned maturity let the history of your domestic rule typify in little the history of our political rule at the outset autocratic control where control is really needful by and by an incipient constitutionalism in which the liberty of the subject gains some express recognition successive extensions of this liberty of the subject gradually ending in parental abdication  do not regret the display of considerable selfwill on the part of your children it is the correlative of that diminished coerciveness so conspicuous in modern education the greater tendency to assert freedom of action on the one side corresponds to the smaller tendency to tyrannise on the other they both indicate an approach to the system of discipline we contend for under which children will be more and more led to rule themselves by the experience of natural consequences and they are both accompaniments of our more advanced social state the independent english boy is the father of the independent english man and you cannot have the last without the first german teachers say that they had rather manage a dozen german boys than one english one shall we therefore wish that our boys had the manageableness of german ones and with it the submissiveness and political serfdom of adult germans or shall we not rather tolerate in our boys those feelings which make them free men and modify our methods accordingly  lastly always recollect that to educate rightly is not a simple and easy thing but a complex and extremely difficult thing the hardest task which devolves on adult life the roughandready style of domestic government is indeed practicable by the meanest and most uncultivated intellects slaps and sharp words are penalties that suggest themselves alike to the least reclaimed barbarian and the stolidest peasant even brutes can use this method of discipline as you may see in the growl and halfbite with which a bitch will check a tooexigeant puppy but if you would carry out with success a rational and civilised system you must be prepared for considerable mental exertionfor some study some ingenuity some patience some selfcontrol you will have habitually to consider what are the results which in adult life follow certain kinds of acts and you must then devise methods by which parallel results shall be entailed on the parallel acts of your children it will daily be needful to analyse the motives of juvenile conductto distinguish between acts that are really good and those which though simulating them proceed from inferior impulses while you will have to be ever on your guard against the cruel mistake not unfrequently made of translating neutral acts into transgressions or ascribing worse feelings than were entertained you must more or less modify your method to suit the disposition of each child and must be prepared to make further modifications as each childs disposition enters on a new phase your faith will often be taxed to maintain the requisite perseverance in a course which seems to produce little or no effect especially if you are dealing with children who have been wrongly treated you must be prepared for a lengthened trial of patience before succeeding with better methods since that which is not easy even where a right state of feeling has been established from the beginning becomes doubly difficult when a wrong state of feeling has to be set right not only will you have constantly to analyse the motives of your children but you will have to analyse your own motivesto discriminate between those internal suggestions springing from a true parental solicitude and those which spring from your own selfishness your love of ease your lust of dominion and then more trying still you will have not only to detect but to curb these baser impulses in brief you will have to carry on your own higher education at the same time that you are educating your children intellectually you must cultivate to good purpose that most complex of subjectshuman nature and its laws as exhibited in your children in yourself and in the world morally you must keep in constant exercise your higher feelings and restrain your lower it is a truth yet remaining to be recognised that the last stage in the mental development of each man and woman is to be reached only through a proper discharge of the parental duties and when this truth is recognised it will be seen how admirable is the arrangement through which human beings are led by their strongest affections to subject themselves to a discipline that they would else elude  while some will regard this conception of education as it should be with doubt and discouragement others will we think perceive in the exalted ideal which it involves evidence of its truth that it cannot be realised by the impulsive the unsympathetic and the shortsighted but demands the higher attributes of human nature they will see to be evidence of its fitness for the more advanced states of humanity though it calls for much labour and selfsacrifice they will see that it promises an abundant return of happiness immediate and remote they will see that while in its injurious effects on both parent and child a bad system is twice cursed a good system is twice blessedit blesses him that trains and him thats trained  1 of this nature is the plea put in by some for the rough treatment experienced by boys at our public schools where as it is said they are introduced to a miniature world whose hardships prepare them for those of the real world it must be admitted that the plea has some force but it is a very insufficient plea for whereas domestic and school discipline though they should not be much better than the discipline of adult life should be somewhat better the discipline which boys meet with at eton winchester harrow etc is worse than that of adult lifemore unjust and cruel instead of being an aid to human progress which all culture should be the culture of our public schools by accustoming boys to a despotic form of government and an intercourse regulated by brute force tends to fit them for a lower state of society than that which exists and chiefly recruited as our legislature is from among those who are brought up at such schools this barbarising influence becomes a hindrance to national progress     physical education   equally at the squires table after the withdrawal of the ladies at the farmers marketordinary and at the village alehouse the topic which after the political question of the day excites the most general interest is the management of animals riding home from hunting the conversation usually gravitates towards horsebreeding and pedigrees and comments on this or that good point while a day on the moors is very unlikely to end without something being said on the treatment of dogs when crossing the fields together from church the tenants of adjacent farms are apt to pass from criticisms on the sermon to criticisms on the weather the crops and the stock and thence to slide into discussions on the various kinds of fodder and their feeding qualities hodge and giles after comparing notes over their respective pigstyes show by their remarks that they have been observant of their masters beasts and sheep and of the effects produced on them by this or that kind of treatment nor is it only among the rural population that the regulations of the kennel the stable the cowshed and the sheeppen are favourite subjects in towns too the numerous artisans who keep dogs the young men who are rich enough to now and then indulge their sporting tendencies and their more staid seniors who talk over agricultural progress or read mr mechis annual reports and mr cairds letters to the times form when added together a large portion of the inhabitants take the adult males throughout the kingdom and a great majority will be found to show some interest in the breeding rearing or training of animals of one kind or other  but during afterdinner conversations or at other times of like intercourse who hears anything said about the rearing of children when the country gentleman has paid his daily visit to the stable and personally inspected the condition and treatment of his horses when he has glanced at his minor live stock and given directions about them how often does he go up to the nursery and examine into its dietary its hours its ventilation on his libraryshelves may be found whites farriery stephenss book of the farm nimrod on the condition of hunters and with the contents of these he is more or less familiar but how many books has he read on the management of infancy and childhood the fattening properties of oilcake the relative values of hay and chopped straw the dangers of unlimited clover are points on which every landlord farmer and peasant has some knowledge but what percentage of them inquire whether the food they give their children is adapted to the constitutional needs of growing boys and girls perhaps the businessinterests of these classes will be assigned as accounting for this anomaly the explanation is inadequate however seeing that the same contrast holds among other classes of a score of townspeople few if any would prove ignorant of the fact that it is undesirable to work a horse soon after it has eaten and yet of this same score supposing them all to be fathers probably not one would be found who had considered whether the time elapsing between his childrens dinner and their resumption of lessons was sufficient indeed on crossexamination nearly every man would disclose the latent opinion that the regimen of the nursery was no concern of his oh i leave all those things to the women would probably be the reply and in most cases the tone of this reply would convey the implication that such cares are not consistent with masculine dignity  regarded from any but a conventional point of view the fact seems strange that while the raising of firstrate bullocks is an occupation on which educated men willingly bestow much time and thought the bringing up of fine human beings is an occupation tacitly voted unworthy of their attention mammas who have been taught little but languages music and accomplishments aided by nurses full of antiquated prejudices are held competent regulators of the food clothing and exercise of children meanwhile the fathers read books and periodicals attend agricultural meetings try experiments and engage in discussions all with the view of discovering how to fatten prize pigs we see infinite pains taken to produce a racer that shall win the derby none to produce a modern athlete had gulliver narrated of the laputans that the men vied with each other in learning how best to rear the offspring of other creatures and were careless of learning how best to rear their own offspring he would have paralleled any of the other absurdities he ascribes to them  the matter is a serious one however ludicrous as is the antithesis the fact it expresses is not less disastrous as remarks a suggestive writer the first requisite to success in life is to be a good animal and to be a nation of good animals is the first condition to national prosperity not only is it that the event of a war often turns on the strength and hardiness of soldiers but it is that the contests of commerce are in part determined by the bodily endurance of producers thus far we have found no reason to fear trials of strength with other races in either of these fields but there are not wanting signs that our powers will presently be taxed to the uttermost the competition of modern life is so keen that few can bear the required application without injury already thousands break down under the high pressure they are subject to if this pressure continues to increase as it seems likely to do it will try severely even the soundest constitutions hence it is becoming of especial importance that the training of children should be so carried on as not only to fit them mentally for the struggle before them but also to make them physically fit to bear its excessive wear and tear  happily the matter is beginning to attract attention the writings of mr kingsley indicate a reaction against overculture carried perhaps as reactions usually are somewhat too far occasional letters and leaders in the newspapers have shown an awakening interest in physical training and the formation of a school significantly nicknamed that of muscular christianity implies a growing opinion that our present methods of bringing up children do not sufficiently regard the welfare of the body the topic is evidently ripe for discussion  to conform the regimen of the nursery and the school to the established truths of modern sciencethis is the desideratum it is time that the benefits which our sheep and oxen are deriving from the investigations of the laboratory should be participated in by our children without calling in question the great importance of horsetraining and pigfeeding we would suggest that as the rearing of wellgrown men and women is also of some moment these conclusions which theory indicates and practice indorses ought to be acted on in the last case as in the first probably not a few will be startledperhaps offendedby this collocation of ideas but it is a fact not to be disputed and to which we must reconcile ourselves that man is subject to the same organic laws as inferior creatures no anatomist no physiologist no chemist will for a moment hesitate to assert that the general principles which are true of the vital processes in animals are equally true of the vital processes in man and a candid admission of this fact is not without its reward namely that the generalisations established by observation and experiment on brutes become available for human guidance rudimentary as is the science of life it has already attained to certain fundamental principles underlying the development of all organisms the human included that which has now to be done and that which we shall endeavour in some measure to do is to trace the bearings of these fundamental principles on the physical training of childhood and youth                                       the rhythmical tendency which is traceable in all departments of social lifewhich is illustrated in the access of despotism after revolution or among ourselves in the alternation of reforming epochs and conservative epochswhich after a dissolute age brings an age of asceticism and converselywhich in commerce produces the recurring inflations and panicswhich carries the devotees of fashion from one absurd extreme to the opposite onethis rhythmical tendency affects also our tablehabits and by implication the dietary of the young after a period distinguished by hard drinking and hard eating has come a period of comparative sobriety which in teetotalism and vegetarianism exhibits extreme forms of protest against the riotous living of the past and along with this change in the regimen of adults has come a parallel change in the regimen for boys and girls in past generations the belief was that the more a child could be induced to eat the better and even now among farmers and in remote districts where traditional ideas most linger parents may be found who tempt their children into repletion but among the educated classes who chiefly display this reaction towards abstemiousness there may be seen a decided leaning to the underfeeding rather than the overfeeding of children indeed their disgust for bygone animalism is more clearly shown in the treatment of their offspring than in the treatment of themselves for while their disguised asceticism is in so far as their personal conduct is concerned kept in check by their appetites it has full play in legislating for juveniles  that overfeeding and underfeeding are both bad is a truism of the two however the last is the worst as writes a high authority the effects of casual repletion are less prejudicial and more easily corrected than those of inanition1 besides where there has been no injudicious interference repletion seldom occurs excess is the vice rather of adults than of the young who are rarely either gourmands or epicures unless through the fault of those who rear them2 this system of restriction which many parents think so necessary is based upon inadequate observation and erroneous reasoning there is an overlegislation in the nursery as well as an overlegislation in the state and one of the most injurious forms of it is this limitation in the quantity of food  but are children to be allowed to surfeit themselves shall they be suffered to take their fill of dainties and make themselves ill as they certainly will do as thus put the question admits of but one reply but as thus put it assumes the point at issue we contend that as appetite is a good guide to all the lower creationas it is a good guide to the infantas it is a good guide to the invalidas it is a good guide to the differentlyplaced races of menand as it is a good guide for every adult who leads a healthful life it may safely be inferred that it is a good guide for childhood it would be strange indeed were it here alone untrustworthy  perhaps some will read this reply with impatience being able as they think to cite facts totally at variance with it it may appear absurd if we deny the relevancy of these facts and yet the paradox is quite defensible the truth is that the instances of excess which such persons have in mind are usually the consequences of the restrictive system they seem to justify they are the sensual reactions caused by an ascetic regimen they illustrate on a small scale that commonlyremarked truth that those who during youth have been subject to the most rigorous discipline are apt afterwards to rush into the wildest extravagances they are analogous to those frightful phenomena once not uncommon in convents where nuns suddenly lapsed from the extremest austerities into an almost demoniac wickedness they simply exhibit the uncontrollable vehemence of longdenied desires consider the ordinary tastes and the ordinary treatment of children the love of sweets is conspicuous and almost universal among them probably ninetynine people in a hundred presume that there is nothing more in this than gratification of the palate and that in common with other sensual desires it should be discouraged the physiologist however whose discoveries lead him to an everincreasing reverence for the arrangements of things suspects something more in this love of sweets than is currently supposed and inquiry confirms the suspicion he finds that sugar plays an important part in the vital processes both saccharine and fatty matters are eventually oxidised in the body and there is an accompanying evolution of heat sugar is the form to which sundry other compounds have to be reduced before they are available as heatmaking food and this formation of sugar is carried on in the body not only is starch changed into sugar in the course of digestion but it has been proved by m claude bernard that the liver is a factory in which other constituents of food are transformed into sugar the need for sugar being so imperative that it is even thus produced from nitrogenous substances when no others are given now when to the fact that children have a marked desire for this valuable heatfood we join the fact that they have usually a marked dislike to that food which gives out the greatest amount of heat during oxidation namely fat we have reason for thinking that excess of the one compensates for defect of the otherthat the organism demands more sugar because it cannot deal with much fat again children are fond of vegetable acids fruits of all kinds are their delight and in the absence of anything better they will devour unripe gooseberries and the sourest of crabs now not only are vegetable acids in common with mineral ones very good tonics and beneficial as such when taken in moderation but they have when administered in their natural forms other advantages ripe fruit says dr andrew combe is more freely given on the continent than in this country and particularly when the bowels act imperfectly it is often very useful see then the discord between the instinctive wants of children and their habitual treatment here are two dominant desires which in all probability express certain needs of the childs constitution and not only are they ignored in the nurseryregimen but there is a general tendency to forbid the gratification of them breadandmilk in the morning tea and breadandbutter at night or some dietary equally insipid is rigidly adhered to and any ministration to the palate is thought needless or rather wrong what is the consequence when on fêtedays there is unlimited access to good thingswhen a gift of pocketmoney brings the contents of the confectioners window within reach or when by some accident the free run of a fruitgarden is obtained then the longdenied and therefore intense desires lead to great excesses there is an impromptu carnival due partly to release from past restraints and partly to the consciousness that a long lent will begin on the morrow and then when the evils of repletion display themselves it is argued that children must not be left to the guidance of their appetites these disastrous results of artificial restrictions are themselves cited as proving the need for further restrictions we contend therefore that the reasoning used to justify this system of interference is vicious we contend that were children allowed daily to partake of these more sapid edibles for which there is a physiological requirement they would rarely exceed as they now mostly do when they have the opportunity were fruit as dr combe recommends to constitute a part of the regular food given as he advises not between meals but along with them there would be none of that craving which prompts the devouring of crabs and sloes and similarly in other cases  not only is it that the à priori reasons for trusting the appetites of children are strong and that the reasons assigned for distrusting them are invalid but it is that no other guidance is worthy of confidence what is the value of this parental judgment set up as an alternative regulator when to oliver asking for more the mamma or governess says no on what data does she proceed she thinks he has had enough but where are her grounds for so thinking has she some secret understanding with the boys stomachsome clairvoyant power enabling her to discern the needs of his body if not how can she safely decide does she not know that the demand of the system for food is determined by numerous and involved causesvaries with the temperature with the hygrometric state of the air with the electric state of the airvaries also according to the exercise taken according to the kind and quantity of food eaten at the last meal and according to the rapidity with which the last meal was digested how can she calculate the result of such a combination of causes as we heard said by the father of a fiveyearsold boy who stands a head taller than most of his age and is proportionately robust rosy and activei can see no artificial standard by which to mete out his food if i say this much is enough it is a mere guess and the guess is as likely to be wrong as right consequently having no faith in guesses i let him eat his fill and certainly any one judging of his policy by its effects would be constrained to admit its wisdom in truth this confidence with which most parents legislate for the stomachs of their children proves their unacquaintance with physiology if they knew more they would be more modest the pride of science is humble when compared with the pride of ignorance if any one would learn how little faith is to be placed in human judgments and how much in the preestablished arrangements of things let him compare the rashness of the inexperienced physician with the caution of the most advanced or let him dip into sir john forbess work on nature and art in the cure of disease and he will see that in proportion as men gain knowledge of the laws of life they come to have less confidence in themselves and more in nature  turning from the question of quantity of food to that of quality we may discern the same ascetic tendency not simply a restricted diet but a comparatively low diet is thought proper for children the current opinion is that they should have but little animal food among the less wealthy classes economy seems to have dictated this opinionthe wish has been father to the thought parents not affording to buy much meat answer the petitions of juveniles withmeat is not good for little boys and girls and this at first probably nothing but a convenient excuse has by repetition grown into an article of faith while the classes with whom cost is no consideration have been swayed partly by the example of the majority partly by the influence of nurses drawn from the lower classes and in some measure by the reaction against past animalism  if however we inquire for the basis of this opinion we find little or none it is a dogma repeated and received without proof like that which for thousands of years insisted on swaddlingclothes very probably for the infants stomach not yet endowed with much muscular power meat which requires considerable trituration before it can be made into chyme is an unfit aliment but this objection does not tell against animal food from which the fibrous part has been extracted nor does it apply when after the lapse of two or three years considerable muscular vigour has been acquired and while the evidence in support of this dogma partially valid in the case of very young children is not valid in the case of older children who are nevertheless ordinarily treated in conformity with it the adverse evidence is abundant and conclusive the verdict of science is exactly opposite to the popular opinion we have put the question to two of our leading physicians and to several of the most distinguished physiologists and they uniformly agree in the conclusion that children should have a diet not less nutritive but if anything more nutritive than that of adults  the grounds for this conclusion are obvious and the reasoning simple it needs but to compare the vital processes of a man with those of a boy to see that the demand for sustenance is relatively greater in the boy than in the man what are the ends for which a man requires food each day his body undergoes more or less wearwear through muscular exertion wear of the nervous system through mental actions wear of the viscera in carrying on the functions of life and the tissue thus wasted has to be renewed each day too by radiation his body loses a large amount of heat and as for the continuance of the vital actions the temperature of the body must be maintained this loss has to be compensated by a constant production of heat to which end certain constituents of the body are ever undergoing oxidation to make up for the days waste and to supply fuel for the days expenditure of heat are then the sole purposes for which the adult requires food consider now the case of the boy he too wastes the substance of his body by action and it needs but to note his restless activity to see that in proportion to his bulk he probably wastes as much as a man he too loses heat by radiation and as his body exposes a greater surface in proportion to its mass than does that of a man and therefore loses heat more rapidly the quantity of heatfood he requires is bulk for bulk greater than that required by a man so that even had the boy no other vital processes to carry on than the man has he would need relatively to his size a somewhat larger supply of nutriment but besides repairing his body and maintaining its heat the boy has to make new tissueto grow after waste and thermal loss have been provided for such surplus of nutriment as remains goes to the further building up of the frame and only in virtue of this surplus is normal growth possible the growth that sometimes takes place in the absence of it causing a manifest prostration consequent upon defective repair it is true that because of a certain mechanical law which cannot be here explained a small organism has an advantage over a large one in the ratio between the sustaining and destroying forcesan advantage indeed to which the very possibility of growth is owing but this admission only makes it the more obvious that though much adverse treatment may be borne without this excess of vitality being quite outbalanced yet any adverse treatment by diminishing it must diminish the size or structural perfection reached how peremptory is the demand of the unfolding organism for materials is seen alike in that schoolboy hunger which afterlife rarely parallels in intensity and in the comparatively quick return of appetite and if there needs further evidence of this extra necessity for nutriment we have it in the fact that during the famines following shipwrecks and other disasters the children are the first to die  this relatively greater need for nutriment being admitted as it must be the question that remains isshall we meet it by giving an excessive quantity of what may be called dilute food or a more moderate quantity of concentrated food the nutriment obtainable from a given weight of meat is obtainable only from a larger weight of bread or from a still larger weight of potatoes and so on to fulfil the requirement the quantity must be increased as the nutritiveness is diminished shall we then respond to the extra wants of the growing child by giving an adequate quantity of food as good as that of adults or regardless of the fact that its stomach has to dispose of a relatively larger quantity even of this good food shall we further tax it by giving an inferior food in still greater quantity  the answer is tolerably obvious the more the labour of digestion is economised the more energy is left for the purposes of growth and action the functions of the stomach and intestines cannot be performed without a large supply of blood and nervous power and in the comparative lassitude that follows a hearty meal every adult has proof that this supply of blood and nervous power is at the expense of the system at large if the requisite nutriment is obtained from a great quantity of innutritious food more work is entailed on the viscera than when it is obtained from a moderate quantity of nutritious food this extra work is so much lossa loss which in children shows itself either in diminished energy or in smaller growth or in both the inference is then that they should have a diet which combines as much as possible nutritiveness and digestibility  it is doubtless true that boys and girls may be reared upon an exclusively or almost exclusively vegetable diet among the upper classes are to be found children to whom comparatively little meat is given and who nevertheless grow and appear in good health animal food is scarcely tasted by the offspring of labouring people and yet they reach a healthy maturity but these seemingly adverse facts have by no means the weight commonly supposed in the first place it does not follow that those who in early years flourish on bread and potatoes will eventually reach a fine development and a comparison between the agricultural labourers and the gentry in england or between the middle and lower classes in france is by no means in favour of vegetable feeders in the second place the question is not simply a question of bulk but also a question of quality a soft flabby flesh makes as good a show as a firm one but though to the careless eye a child of full flaccid tissue may appear the equal of one whose fibres are well toned a trial of strength will prove the difference obesity in adults is often a sign of feebleness men lose weight in training hence the appearance of these lowfed children is far from conclusive in the third place besides size we have to consider energy between children of the meateating classes and those of the breadandpotatoeating classes there is a marked contrast in this respect both in mental and physical vivacity the peasantboy is greatly inferior to the son of a gentleman  if we compare different kinds of animals or different races of men or the same animals or men when differently fed we find still more distinct proof that the degree of energy essentially depends on the nutritiveness of the food  in a cow subsisting on so innutritive a food as grass we see that the immense quantity required necessitates an enormous digestive system that the limbs small in comparison with the body are burdened by its weight that in carrying about this heavy body and digesting this excessive quantity of food much force is expended and that having but little remaining the creature is sluggish compare with the cow a horsean animal of nearly allied structure but habituated to a more concentrated diet here the body and more especially its abdominal region bears a smaller ratio to the limbs the powers are not taxed by the support of such massive viscera nor the digestion of so bulky a food and as a consequence there is greater locomotive energy and considerable vivacity if again we contrast the stolid inactivity of the graminivorous sheep with the liveliness of the dog subsisting on flesh or farinaceous matters or a mixture of the two we see a difference similar in kind but still greater in degree and after walking through the zoological gardens and noting the restlessness with which the carnivorous animals pace up and down their cages it needs but to remember that none of the herbivorous animals habitually display this superfluous energy to see how clear is the relation between concentration of food and degree of activity  that these differences are not directly consequent on differences of constitution as some may argue but are directly consequent on differences in the food which the creatures are constituted to subsist on is proved by the fact that they are observable between different divisions of the same species the varieties of the horse furnish an illustration compare the bigbellied inactive spiritless carthorse with a racer or hunter small in the flanks and full of energy and then call to mind how much less nutritive is the diet of the one than that of the other or take the case of mankind australians bushmen and others of the lowest savages who live on roots and berries varied by larvae of insects and the like meagre fare are comparatively puny in stature have large abdomens soft and undeveloped muscles and are quite unable to cope with europeans either in a struggle or in prolonged exertion count up the wild races who are well grown strong and active as the kaffirs northamerican indians and patagonians and you find them large consumers of flesh the illfed hindoo goes down before the englishman fed on more nutritive food to whom he is as inferior in mental as in physical energy and generally we think the history of the world shows that the wellfed races have been the energetic and dominant races  still stronger however becomes the argument when we find that the same individual animal is capable of more or less exertion according as its food is more or less nutritious this has been demonstrated in the case of the horse though flesh may be gained by a grazing horse strength is lost as putting him to hard work proves the consequence of turning horses out to grass is relaxation of the muscular system grass is a very good preparation for a bullock for smithfield market but a very bad one for a hunter it was well known of old that after passing the summer in the fields hunters required some months of stablefeeding before becoming able to follow the hounds and that they did not get into good condition till the beginning of the next spring and the modern practice is that insisted on by mr apperleynever to give a hunter what is called a summers run at grass and except under particular and very favourable circumstances never to turn him out at all that is to say never give him poor food great energy and endurance are to be obtained only by the continued use of nutritive food so true is this that as proved by mr apperley prolonged highfeeding enables a middling horse to equal in his performances a firstrate horse fed in the ordinary way to which various evidences add the familiar fact that when a horse is required to do double duty it is the practice to give him beansa food containing a larger proportion of nitrogenous or fleshmaking material than his habitual oats  once more in the case of individual men the truth has been illustrated with equal or still greater clearness we do not refer to men in training for feats of strength whose regimen however thoroughly conforms to the doctrine we refer to the experience of railwaycontractors and their labourers it has been for years a wellestablished fact that an english navvy eating largely of flesh is far more efficient than a continental navvy living on farinaceous food so much more efficient that english contractors for continental railways found it pay to take their labourers with them that difference of diet and not difference of race caused this superiority has been of late distinctly shown for it has turned out that when the continental navvies live in the same style as their english competitors they presently rise more or less nearly to a par with them in efficiency and to this fact let us here add the converse one to which we can give personal testimony based upon six months experience of vegetarianism that abstinence from meat entails diminished energy of both body and mind  do not these various evidences endorse our argument respecting the feeding of children do they not imply that even supposing the same stature and bulk to be attained on an innutritive as on a nutritive diet the quality of tissue is greatly inferior do they not establish the position that where energy as well as growth has to be maintained it can only be done by high feeding do they not confirm the à priori conclusion that though a child of whom little is expected in the way of bodily or mental activity may thrive tolerably well on farinaceous substances a child who is daily required not only to form the due amount of new tissue but to supply the waste consequent on great muscular action and the further waste consequent on hard exercise of brain must live on substances containing a larger ratio of nutritive matter and is it not an obvious corollary that denial of this better food will be at the expense either of growth or of bodily activity or of mental activity as constitution and circumstances determine we believe no logical intellect will question it to think otherwise is to entertain in a disguised form the old fallacy of the perpetualmotion schemersthat it is possible to get power out of nothing  before leaving the question of food a few words must be said on another requisitevariety in this respect the dietary of the young is very faulty if not like our soldiers condemned to twenty years of boiled beef our children have mostly to bear a monotony which though less extreme and less lasting is quite as clearly at variance with the laws of health at dinner it is true they usually have food that is more or less mixed and that is changed day by day but week after week month after month year after year comes the same breakfast of breadandmilk or it may be oatmealporridge and with like persistence the day is closed perhaps with a second edition of the breadandmilk perhaps with tea and breadandbutter  this practice is opposed to the dictates of physiology the satiety produced by an oftenrepeated dish and the gratification caused by one long a stranger to the palate are not meaningless as people carelessly assume but they are the incentives to a wholesome diversity of diet it is a fact established by numerous experiments that there is scarcely any one food however good which supplies in due proportions or right forms all the elements required for carrying on the vital processes in a normal manner whence it follows that frequent change of food is desirable to balance the supplies of all the elements it is a further fact known to physiologists that the enjoyment given by a muchliked food is a nervous stimulus which by increasing the action of the heart and so propelling the blood with increased vigour aids in the subsequent digestion and these truths are in harmony with the maxims of modern cattlefeeding which dictate a rotation of diet  not only however is periodic change of food very desirable but for the same reasons it is very desirable that a mixture of food should be taken at each meal the better balance of ingredients and the greater nervous stimulation are advantages which hold here as before if facts are asked for we may name as one the comparative ease with which the stomach disposes of a french dinner enormous in quantity but extremely varied in materials few will contend that an equal weight of one kind of food however well cooked could be digested with as much facility if any desire further facts they may find them in every modern book on the management of animals animals thrive best when each meal is made up of several things the experiments of goss and stark afford the most decisive proof of the advantage or rather the necessity of a mixture of substances in order to produce the compound which is the best adapted for the action of the stomach3  should any object as probably many will that a rotating dietary for children and one which also requires a mixture of food at each meal would entail too much trouble we reply that no trouble is thought too great which conduces to the mental development of children and that for their future welfare good bodily development is of still higher importance moreover it seems alike sad and strange that a trouble which is cheerfully taken in the fattening of pigs should be thought too great in the rearing of children  one more paragraph with the view of warning those who may propose to adopt the regimen indicated the change must not be made suddenly for continued lowfeeding so enfeebles the system as to disable it from at once dealing with a high diet deficient nutrition is itself a cause of dyspepsia this is true even of animals when calves are fed with skimmed milk or whey or other poor food they are liable to indigestion4 hence therefore where the energies are low the transition to a generous diet must be gradual each increment of strength gained justifying a fresh addition of nutriment further it should be borne in mind that the concentration of nutriment may be carried too far a bulk sufficient to fill the stomach is one requisite of a proper meal and this requisite negatives a diet deficient in those matters which give adequate mass though the size of the digestive organs is less in the wellfed civilised races than in the illfed savage ones and though their size may eventually diminish still further yet for the time being the bulk of the ingesta must be determined by the existing capacity but paying due regard to these two qualifications our conclusions arethat the food of children should be highly nutritive that it should be varied at each meal and at successive meals and that it should be abundant                                       with clothing as with food the usual tendency is towards an improper scantiness here too asceticism peeps out there is a current theory vaguely entertained if not put into a definite formula that the sensations are to be disregarded they do not exist for our guidance but to mislead us seems to be the prevalent belief reduced to its naked form it is a grave error we are much more beneficently constituted it is not obedience to the sensations but disobedience to them which is the habitual cause of bodily evils it is not the eating when hungry but the eating in the absence of hunger which is bad it is not drinking when thirsty but continuing to drink when thirst has ceased that is the vice harm does not result from breathing that fresh air which every healthy person enjoys but from breathing foul air spite of the protest of the lungs harm does not result from taking that active exercise which as every child shows us nature strongly prompts but from a persistent disregard of natures promptings not that mental activity which is spontaneous and enjoyable does the mischief but that which is persevered in after a hot or aching head commands desistance not that bodily exertion which is pleasant or indifferent does injury but that which is continued when exhaustion forbids it is true that in those who have long led unhealthy lives the sensations are not trustworthy guides people who have for years been almost constantly indoors who have exercised their brains very much and their bodies scarcely at all who in eating have obeyed their clocks without consulting their stomachs may very likely be misled by their vitiated feelings but their abnormal state is itself the result of transgressing their feelings had they from childhood never disobeyed what we may term the physical conscience it would not have been seared but would have remained a faithful monitor  among the sensations serving for our guidance are those of heat and cold and a clothing for children which does not carefully consult these sensations is to be condemned the common notion about hardening is a grievous delusion not a few children are hardened out of the world and those who survive permanently suffer either in growth or constitution their delicate appearance furnishes ample indication of the mischief thus produced and their frequent attacks of illness might prove a warning even to unreflecting parents says dr combe the reasoning on which this hardeningtheory rests is extremely superficial wealthy parents seeing little peasant boys and girls playing about in the open air only halfclothed and joining with this fact the general healthiness of labouring people draw the unwarrantable conclusion that the healthiness is the result of the exposure and resolve to keep their own offspring scantily covered it is forgotten that these urchins who gambol upon villagegreens are in many respects favourably circumstancedthat their lives are spent in almost perpetual play that they are all day breathing fresh air and that their systems are not disturbed by overtaxed brains for aught that appears to the contrary their good health may be maintained not in consequence of but in spite of their deficient clothing this alternative conclusion we believe to be the true one and that an inevitable detriment results from the loss of animal heat to which they are subject  for when the constitution being sound enough to bear it exposure does produce hardness it does so at the expense of growth this truth is displayed alike in animals and in man shetland ponies bear greater inclemencies than the horses of the south but are dwarfed highland sheep and cattle living in a colder climate are stunted in comparison with english breeds in both the arctic and antarctic regions the human race falls much below its ordinary height the laplander and esquimaux are very short and the terra del fuegians who go naked in a wintry land are described by darwin as so stunted and hideous that one can hardly make onesself believe they are fellowcreatures  science explains this dwarfishness produced by great abstraction of heat showing that food and other things being equal it unavoidably results for as before pointed out to make up for that cooling by radiation which the body is ever undergoing there must be a constant oxidation of certain matters forming part of the food and in proportion as the thermal loss is great must the quantity of these matters required for oxidation be great but the power of the digestive organs is limited consequently when they have to prepare a large quantity of this material needful for maintaining the temperature they can prepare but a small quantity of the material which goes to build up the frame excessive expenditure for fuel entails diminished means for other purposes wherefore there necessarily results a body small in size or inferior in texture or both  hence the great importance of clothing as liebig saysour clothing is in reference to the temperature of the body merely an equivalent for a certain amount of food by diminishing the loss of heat it diminishes the amount of fuel needful for maintaining the heat and when the stomach has less to do in preparing fuel it can do more in preparing other materials this deduction is confirmed by the experience of those who manage animals cold can be borne by animals only at an expense of fat or muscle or growth as the case may be if fattening cattle are exposed to a low temperature either their progress must be retarded or a great additional expenditure of food incurred5 mr apperley insists strongly that to bring hunters into good condition it is necessary that the stable should be kept warm and among those who rear racers it is an established doctrine that exposure is to be avoided  the scientific truth thus illustrated by ethnology and recognised by agriculturists and sportsmen applies with double force to children in proportion to their smallness and the rapidity of their growth is the injury from cold great in france newborn infants often die in winter from being carried to the office of the maire for registration m quetelet has pointed out that in belgium two infants die in january for one that dies in july and in russia the infant mortality is something enormous even when near maturity the undeveloped frame is comparatively unable to bear exposure as witness the quickness with which young soldiers succumb in a trying campaign the rationale is obvious we have already adverted to the fact that in consequence of the varying relation between surface and bulk a child loses a relatively larger amount of heat than an adult and here we must point out that the disadvantage under which the child thus labours is very great lehmann saysif the carbonic acid excreted by children or young animals is calculated for an equal bodily weight it results that children produce nearly twice as much acid as adults now the quantity of carbonic acid given off varies with tolerable accuracy as the quantity of heat produced and thus we see that in children the system even when not placed at a disadvantage is called upon to provide nearly double the proportion of material for generating heat  see then the extreme folly of clothing the young scantily what father fullgrown though he is losing heat less rapidly as he does and having no physiological necessity but to supply the waste of each daywhat father we ask would think it salutary to go about with bare legs bare arms and bare neck yet this tax on the system from which he would shrink he inflicts on his little ones who are so much less able to bear it or if he does not inflict it sees it inflicted without protest let him remember that every ounce of nutriment needlessly expended for the maintenance of temperature is so much deducted from the nutriment going to build up the frame and that even when colds congestions or other consequent disorders are escaped diminished growth or less perfect structure is inevitable  the rule is therefore not to dress in an invariable way in all cases but to put on clothing in kind and quantity sufficient in the individual case to protect the body effectually from an abiding sensation of cold however slight this rule the importance of which dr combe indicates by the italics is one in which men of science and practitioners agree we have met with none competent to form a judgment on the matter who do not strongly condemn the exposure of childrens limbs if there is one point above others in which pestilent custom should be ignored it is this  lamentable indeed is it to see mothers seriously damaging the constitutions of their children out of compliance with an irrational fashion it is bad enough that they should themselves conform to every folly which our gallic neighbours please to initiate but that they should clothe their children in any mountebank dress which le petit courrier des dames indicates regardless of its insufficiency and unfitness is monstrous discomfort more or less great is inflicted frequent disorders are entailed growth is checked or stamina undermined premature death not uncommonly caused and all because it is thought needful to make frocks of a size and material dictated by french caprice not only is it that for the sake of conformity mothers thus punish and injure their little ones by scantiness of covering but it is that from an allied motive they impose a style of dress which forbids healthful activity to please the eye colours and fabrics are chosen totally unfit to bear that rough usage which unrestrained play involves and then to prevent damage the unrestrained play is interdicted get up this moment you will soil your clean frock is the mandate issued to some urchin creeping about on the floor come back you will dirty your stockings calls out the governess to one of her charges who has left the footpath to scramble up a bank thus is the evil doubled that they may come up to their mammas standard of prettiness and be admired by her visitors children must have habiliments deficient in quantity and unfit in texture and that these easilydamaged habiliments may be kept clean and uninjured the restless activity so natural and needful for the young is restrained the exercise which becomes doubly requisite when the clothing is insufficient is cut short lest it should deface the clothing would that the terrible cruelty of this system could be seen by those who maintain it we do not hesitate to say that through enfeebled health defective energies and consequent nonsuccess in life thousands are annually doomed to unhappiness by this unscrupulous regard for appearances even when they are not by early death literally sacrificed to the moloch of maternal vanity we are reluctant to counsel strong measures but really the evils are so great as to justify or even to demand a peremptory interference on the part of fathers  our conclusions are thenthat while the clothing of children should never be in such excess as to create oppressive warmth it should always be sufficient to prevent any general feeling of cold6 that instead of the flimsy cotton linen or mixed fabrics commonly used it should be made of some good nonconductor such as coarse woollen cloth that it should be so strong as to receive little damage from the hard wear and tear which childish sports will give it and that its colours should be such as will not soon suffer from use and exposure                                       to the importance of bodily exercise most people are in some degree awake perhaps less needs saying on this requisite of physical education than on most others at any rate in so far as boys are concerned public schools and private schools alike furnish tolerably adequate playgrounds and there is usually a fair share of time for outdoor games and a recognition of them as needful in this if in no other direction it seems admitted that the promptings of boyish instinct may advantageously be followed and indeed in the modern practice of breaking the prolonged mornings and afternoons lessons by a few minutes openair recreation we see an increasing tendency to conform schoolregulations to the bodily sensations of the pupils here then little needs be said in the way of expostulation or suggestion  but we have been obliged to qualify this admission by inserting the clause in so far as boys are concerned unfortunately the fact is quite otherwise with girls it chances somewhat strangely that we have daily opportunity of drawing a comparison we have both a boys school and a girls school within view and the contrast between them is remarkable in the one case nearly the whole of a large garden is turned into an open gravelled space affording ample scope for games and supplied with poles and horizontal bars for gymnastic exercises every day before breakfast again towards eleven oclock again at midday again in the afternoon and once more after school is over the neighbourhood is awakened by a chorus of shouts and laughter as the boys rush out to play and for as long as they remain both eyes and ears give proof that they are absorbed in that enjoyable activity which makes the pulse bound and ensures the healthful activity of every organ how unlike is the picture offered by the establishment for young ladies until the fact was pointed out we actually did not know that we had a girls school as close to us as the school for boys the garden equally large with the other affords no sign whatever of any provision for juvenile recreation but is entirely laid out with prim grassplots gravelwalks shrubs and flowers after the usual suburban style during five months we have not once had our attention drawn to the premises by a shout or a laugh occasionally girls may be observed sauntering along the paths with lessonbooks in their hands or else walking arminarm once indeed we saw one chase another round the garden but with this exception nothing like vigorous exertion has been visible  why this astounding difference is it that the constitution of a girl differs so entirely from that of a boy as not to need these active exercises is it that a girl has none of the promptings to vociferous play by which boys are impelled or is it that while in boys these promptings are to be regarded as stimuli to a bodily activity without which there cannot be adequate development to their sisters nature has given them for no purpose whateverunless it be for the vexation of schoolmistresses perhaps however we mistake the aim of those who train the gentler sex we have a vague suspicion that to produce a robust physique is thought undesirable that rude health and abundant vigour are considered somewhat plebeian that a certain delicacy a strength not competent to more than a mile or twos walk an appetite fastidious and easily satisfied joined with that timidity which commonly accompanies feebleness are held more ladylike we do not expect that any would distinctly avow this but we fancy the governessmind is haunted by an ideal young lady bearing not a little resemblance to this type if so it must be admitted that the established system is admirably calculated to realise this ideal but to suppose that such is the ideal of the opposite sex is a profound mistake that men are not commonly drawn towards masculine women is doubtless true that such relative weakness as asks the protection of superior strength is an element of attraction we quite admit but the difference thus responded to by the feelings of men is the natural preestablished difference which will assert itself without artificial appliances and when by artificial appliances the degree of this difference is increased it becomes an element of repulsion rather than of attraction  then girls should be allowed to run wildto become as rude as boys and grow up into romps and hoydens exclaims some defender of the proprieties this we presume is the everpresent dread of schoolmistresses it appears on inquiry that at establishments for young ladies noisy play like that daily indulged in by boys is a punishable offence and we infer that it is forbidden lest unladylike habits should be formed the fear is quite groundless however for if the sportive activity allowed to boys does not prevent them from growing up into gentlemen why should a like sportive activity prevent girls from growing up into ladies rough as may have been their playground frolics youths who have left school do not indulge in leapfrog in the street or marbles in the drawingroom abandoning their jackets they abandon at the same time boyish games and display an anxietyoften a ludicrous anxietyto avoid whatever is not manly if now on arriving at the due age this feeling of masculine dignity puts so efficient a restraint on the sports of boyhood will not the feeling of feminine modesty gradually strengthening as maturity is approached put an efficient restraint on the like sports of girlhood have not women even a greater regard for appearances than men and will there not consequently arise in them even a stronger check to whatever is rough or boisterous how absurd is the supposition that the womanly instincts would not assert themselves but for the rigorous discipline of schoolmistresses  in this as in other cases to remedy the evils of one artificiality another artificiality has been introduced the natural spontaneous exercise having been forbidden and the bad consequences of no exercise having become conspicuous there has been adopted a system of factitious exercisegymnastics that this is better than nothing we admit but that it is an adequate substitute for play we deny the defects are both positive and negative in the first place these formal muscular motions necessarily less varied than those accompanying juvenile sports do not secure so equable a distribution of action to all parts of the body whence it results that the exertion falling on special parts produces fatigue sooner than it would else have done to which in passing let us add that if constantly repeated this exertion of special parts leads to a disproportionate development again the quantity of exercise thus taken will be deficient not only in consequence of uneven distribution but there will be a further deficiency in consequence of lack of interest even when not made repulsive as they sometimes are by assuming the shape of appointed lessons these monotonous movements are sure to become wearisome from the absence of amusement competition it is true serves as a stimulus but it is not a lasting stimulus like that enjoyment which accompanies varied play the weightiest objection however still remains besides being inferior in respect of the quantity of muscular exertion which they secure gymnastics are still more inferior in respect of the quality this comparative want of enjoyment which we have named as a cause of early desistance from artificial exercises is also a cause of inferiority in the effects they produce on the system the common assumption that so long as the amount of bodily action is the same it matters not whether it be pleasurable or otherwise is a grave mistake an agreeable mental excitement has a highly invigorating influence see the effect produced upon an invalid by good news or by the visit of an old friend mark how careful medical men are to recommend lively society to debilitated patients remember how beneficial to health is the gratification produced by change of scene the truth is that happiness is the most powerful of tonics by accelerating the circulation of the blood it facilitates the performance of every function and so tends alike to increase health when it exists and to restore it when it has been lost hence the intrinsic superiority of play to gymnastics the extreme interest felt by children in their games and the riotous glee with which they carry on their rougher frolics are of as much importance as the accompanying exertion and as not supplying these mental stimuli gymnastics must be radically defective  granting then as we do that formal exercises of the limbs are better than nothinggranting further that they may be used with advantage as supplementary aids we yet contend that they can never serve in place of the exercises prompted by nature for girls as well as boys the sportive activities to which the instincts impel are essential to bodily welfare whoever forbids them forbids the divinelyappointed means to physical development                                       a topic still remainsone perhaps more urgently demanding consideration than any of the foregoing it is asserted by not a few that among the educated classes the younger adults and those who are verging on maturity are neither so well grown nor so strong as their seniors on first hearing this assertion we were inclined to class it as one of the many manifestations of the old tendency to exalt the past at the expense of the present calling to mind the facts that as measured by ancient armour modern men are proved to be larger than ancient men and that the tables of mortality show no diminution but rather an increase in the duration of life we paid little attention to what seemed a groundless belief detailed observation however has shaken our opinion omitting from the comparison the labouring classes we have noticed a majority of cases in which the children do not reach the stature of their parents and in massiveness making due allowance for difference of age there seems a like inferiority medical men say that nowadays people cannot bear nearly so much depletion as in times gone by premature baldness is far more common than it used to be and an early decay of teeth occurs in the rising generation with startling frequency in general vigour the contrast appears equally striking men of past generations living riotously as they did could bear more than men of the present generation who live soberly can bear though they drank hard kept irregular hours were regardless of fresh air and thought little of cleanliness our recent ancestors were capable of prolonged application without injury even to a ripe old age witness the annals of the bench and the bar yet we who think much about our bodily welfare who eat with moderation and do not drink to excess who attend to ventilation and use frequent ablutions who make annual excursions and have the benefit of greater medical knowledgewe are continually breaking down under our work paying considerable attention to the laws of health we seem to be weaker than our grandfathers who in many respects defied the laws of health and judging from the appearance and frequent ailments of the rising generation they are likely to be even less robust than ourselves  what is the meaning of this is it that past overfeeding alike of adults and children was less injurious than the underfeeding to which we have adverted as now so general is it that the deficient clothing which this delusive hardeningtheory has encouraged is to blame is it that the greater or less discouragement of juvenile sports in deference to a false refinement is the cause from our reasonings it may be inferred that each of these has probably had a share in producing the evil7 but there has been yet another detrimental influence at work perhaps more potent than any of the others we meanexcess of mental application  on old and young the pressure of modern life puts a stillincreasing strain in all businesses and professions intenser competition taxes the energies and abilities of every adult and to fit the young to hold their places under this intenser competition they are subject to severer discipline than heretofore the damage is thus doubled fathers who find themselves run hard by their multiplying competitors and while labouring under this disadvantage have to maintain a more expensive style of living are all the year round obliged to work early and late taking little exercise and getting but short holidays the constitutions shaken by this continued overapplication they bequeath to their children and then these comparatively feeble children predisposed to break down even under ordinary strains on their energies are required to go through a curriculum much more extended than that prescribed for the unenfeebled children of past generations  the disastrous consequences that might be anticipated are everywhere visible go where you will and before long there come under your notice cases of children or youths of either sex more or less injured by undue study here to recover from a state of debility thus produced a years rustication has been found necessary there you find a chronic congestion of the brain that has already lasted many months and threatens to last much longer now you hear of a fever that resulted from the overexcitement in some way brought on at school and again the instance is that of a youth who has already had once to desist from his studies and who since his return to them is frequently taken out of his class in a fainting fit we state factsfacts not sought for but which have been thrust on our observation during the last two years and that too within a very limited range nor have we by any means exhausted the list quite recently we had the opportunity of marking how the evil becomes hereditary the case being that of a lady of robust parentage whose system was so injured by the régime of a scotch boardingschool where she was underfed and overworked that she invariably suffers from vertigo on rising in the morning and whose children inheriting this enfeebled brain are several of them unable to bear even a moderate amount of study without headache or giddiness at the present time we have daily under our eyes a young lady whose system has been damaged for life by the collegecourse through which she has passed taxed as she was to such an extent that she had no energy left for exercise she is now that she has finished her education a constant complainant appetite small and very capricious mostly refusing meat extremities perpetually cold even when the weather is warm a feebleness which forbids anything but the slowest walking and that only for a short time palpitation on going upstairs greatly impaired visionthese joined with checked growth and lax tissue are among the results entailed and to her case we may add that of her friend and fellowstudent who is similarly weak who is liable to faint even under the excitement of a quiet party of friends and who has at length been obliged by her medical attendant to desist from study entirely  if injuries so conspicuous are thus frequent how very general must be the smaller and inconspicuous injuries to one case where positive illness is traceable to overapplication there are probably at least halfadozen cases where the evil is unobtrusive and slowly accumulatingcases where there is frequent derangement of the functions attributed to this or that special cause or to constitutional delicacy cases where there is retardation and premature arrest of bodily growth cases where a latent tendency to consumption is brought out and established cases where a predisposition is given to that now common cerebral disorder brought on by the labour of adult life how commonly health is thus undermined will be clear to all who after noting the frequent ailments of hardworked professional and mercantile men will reflect on the much worse effects which undue application must produce on the undeveloped systems of children the young can bear neither so much hardship nor so much physical exertion nor so much mental exertion as the full grown judge then if the full grown manifestly suffer from the excessive mental exertion required of them how great must be the damage which a mental exertion often equally excessive inflicts on the young  indeed when we examine the merciless school drill frequently enforced the wonder is not that it does extreme injury but that it can be borne at all take the instance given by sir john forbes from personal knowledge and which he asserts after much inquiry to be an average sample of the middleclass girlsschool system throughout england omitting detailed divisions of time we quote the summary of the twentyfour hours  in bed                                          9 hours the younger 10 in school at their studies and tasks           9    in school or in the house the elder at     optional studies or work the younger at     play                                       3½      the younger 2½ at meals                                       1½    exercise in the open air in the shape of a     formal walk often with lessonbooks in     hand and even this only when the weather     is fine at the appointed time             1                                                                                                 24  and what are the results of this astounding regimen as sir john forbes terms it of course feebleness pallor want of spirits general illhealth but he describes something more this utter disregard of physical welfare out of extreme anxiety to cultivate the mindthis prolonged exercise of brain and deficient exercise of limbshe found to be habitually followed not only by disordered functions but by malformation he sayswe lately visited in a large town a boardingschool containing forty girls and we learnt on close and accurate inquiry that there was not one of the girl who had been at the school two years and the majority had been as long that was not more or less crooked8  it may be that since 1833 when this was written some improvement has taken place we hope it has but that the system is still commonnay that it is in some cases carried to a greater extreme than ever we can personally testify we recently went over a trainingcollege for young men one of those instituted of late years for the purpose of supplying schools with welldisciplined teachers here under official supervision where something better than the judgment of private schoolmistresses might have been looked for we found the daily routine to be as follows  at 6 oclock the students are called   7 to 8 studies   8 to 9 scripturereading prayers and breakfast   9 to 12 studies   12 to 1¼ leisure nominally devoted to walking or other exercise but      often spent in study   1¼ to 2 dinner the meal commonly occupying twenty minutes   2 to 5 studies   5 to 6 tea and relaxation   6 to 8½ studies   8½ to 9½ private studies in preparing lessons for the next day   10 to bed  thus out of the twentyfour hours eight are devoted to sleep four and a quarter are occupied in dressing prayers meals and the brief periods of rest accompanying them ten and a half are given to study and one and a quarter to exercise which is optional and often avoided not only however are the tenandahalf hours of recognised study frequently increased to elevenandahalf by devoting to books the time set apart for exercise but some of the students get up at four oclock in the morning to prepare their lessons and are actually encouraged by their teachers to do this the course to be passed through in a given time is so extensive and the teachers whose credit is at stake in getting their pupils well through the examinations are so urgent that pupils are not uncommonly induced to spend twelve and thirteen hours a day in mental labour  it needs no prophet to see that the bodily injury inflicted must be great as we were told by one of the inmates those who arrive with fresh complexions quickly become blanched illness is frequent there are always some on the sicklist failure of appetite and indigestion are very common diarrhoea is a prevalent disorder not uncommonly a third of the whole number of students suffering under it at the same time headache is generally complained of and by some is borne almost daily for months while a certain percentage break down entirely and go away  that this should be the regimen of what is in some sort a model institution established and superintended by the embodied enlightenment of the age is a startling fact that the severe examinations joined with the short period assigned for preparation should compel recourse to a system which inevitably undermines the health of all who pass through it is proof if not of cruelty then of woeful ignorance  the case is no doubt in a great degree exceptionalperhaps to be paralleled only in other institutions of the same class but that cases so extreme should exist at all goes far to show that the minds of the rising generation are greatly overtasked expressing as they do the ideas of the educated community the requirements of these training colleges even in the absence of other evidence would imply a prevailing tendency to an unduly urgent system of culture  it seems strange that there should be so little consciousness of the dangers of overeducation during youth when there is so general a consciousness of the dangers of overeducation during childhood most parents are partially aware of the evil consequences that follow infantprecocity in every society may be heard reprobation of those who too early stimulate the minds of their little ones and the dread of this early stimulation is great in proportion as there is adequate knowledge of the effects witness the implied opinion of one of our most distinguished professors of physiology who told us that he did not intend his little boy to learn any lessons until he was eight years old but while to all it is a familiar truth that a forced development of intelligence in childhood entails either physical feebleness or ultimate stupidity or early death it appears not to be perceived that throughout youth the same truth holds yet it unquestionably does so there is a given order in which and a given rate at which the faculties unfold if the course of education conforms itself to that order and rate well if notif the higher faculties are early taxed by presenting an order of knowledge more complex and abstract than can be readily assimilated or if by excess of culture the intellect in general is developed to a degree beyond that which is natural to its age the abnormal advantage gained will inevitably be accompanied by some equivalent or more than equivalent evil  for nature is a strict accountant and if you demand of her in one direction more than she is prepared to lay out she balances the account by making a deduction elsewhere if you will let her follow her own course taking care to supply in right quantities and kinds the raw materials of bodily and mental growth required at each age she will eventually produce an individual more or less evenly developed if however you insist on premature or undue growth of any one part she will with more or less protest concede the point but that she may do your extra work she must leave some of her more important work undone let it never be forgotten that the amount of vital energy which the body at any moment possesses is limited and that being limited it is impossible to get from it more than a fixed quantity of results in a child or youth the demands upon this vital energy are various and urgent as before pointed out the waste consequent on the days bodily exercise has to be met the wear of brain entailed by the days study has to be made good a certain additional growth of body has to be provided for and also a certain additional growth of brain to which must be added the amount of energy absorbed in digesting the large quantity of food required for meeting these many demands now that to divert an excess of energy into any one of these channels is to abstract it from the others is both manifest à priori and proved à posteriori by the experience of every one every one knows for instance that the digestion of a heavy meal makes such a demand on the system as to produce lassitude of mind and body frequently ending in sleep every one knows too that excess of bodily exercise diminishes the power of thoughtthat the temporary prostration following any sudden exertion or the fatigue produced by a thirty miles walk is accompanied by a disinclination to mental effort that after a months pedestrian tour the mental inertia is such that some days are required to overcome it and that in peasants who spend their lives in muscular labour the activity of mind is very small again it is a familiar truth that during those fits of rapid growth which sometimes occur in childhood the great abstraction of energy is shown in an attendant prostration bodily and mental once more the facts that violent muscular exertion after eating will stop digestion and that children who are early put to hard labour become stunted similarly exhibit the antagonismsimilarly imply that excess of activity in one direction involves deficiency of it in other directions now the law which is thus manifest in extreme cases holds in all cases these injurious abstractions of energy as certainly take place when the undue demands are slight and constant as when they are great and sudden hence if during youth the expenditure in mental labour exceeds that which nature has provided for the expenditure for other purposes falls below what it should have been and evils of one kind or other are inevitably entailed let us briefly consider these evils  supposing the overactivity of brain to exceed the normal activity only in a moderate degree there will be nothing more than some slight reaction on the development of the body the stature falling a little below that which it would else have reached or the bulk being less than it would have been or the quality of tissue not being so good one or more of these effects must necessarily occur the extra quantity of blood supplied to the brain during mental exertion and during the subsequent period in which the waste of cerebral substance is being made good is blood that would else have been circulating through the limbs and viscera and the growth or repair for which that blood would have supplied materials is lost the physical reaction being certain the question is whether the gain resulting from the extra culture is equivalent to the losswhether defect of bodily growth or the want of that structural perfection which gives vigour and endurance is compensated by the additional knowledge acquired  when the excess of mental exertion is greater there follow results far more serious telling not only against bodily perfection but against the perfection of the brain itself it is a physiological law first pointed out by m isidore st hilaire and to which attention has been drawn by mr lewes in his essay on dwarfs and giants that there is an antagonism between growth and development by growth as used in this antithetical sense is to be understood increase of size by development increase of structure and the law is that great activity in either of these processes involves retardation or arrest of the other a familiar example is furnished by the cases of the caterpillar and the chrysalis in the caterpillar there is extremely rapid augmentation of bulk but the structure is scarcely at all more complex when the caterpillar is fullgrown than when it is small in the chrysalis the bulk does not increase on the contrary weight is lost during this stage of the creatures life but the elaboration of a more complex structure goes on with great activity the antagonism here so clear is less traceable in higher creatures because the two processes are carried on together but we see it pretty well illustrated among ourselves when we contrast the sexes a girl develops in body and mind rapidly and ceases to grow comparatively early a boys bodily and mental development is slower and his growth greater at the age when the one is mature finished and having all faculties in full play the other whose vital energies have been more directed towards increase of size is relatively incomplete in structure and shows it in a comparative awkwardness bodily and mental now this law is true of each separate part of the organism as well as of the whole the abnormally rapid advance of any organ in respect of structure involves premature arrest of its growth and this happens with the organ of the mind as certainly as with any other organ the brain which during early years is relatively large in mass but imperfect in structure will if required to perform its functions with undue activity undergo a structural advance greater than is appropriate to its age but the ultimate effect will be a falling short of the size and power that would else have been attained and this is a partcauseprobably the chief causewhy precocious children and youths who up to a certain time were carrying all before them so often stop short and disappoint the high hopes of their parents  but these results of overeducation disastrous as they are are perhaps less disastrous than the effects produced on the healththe undermined constitution the enfeebled energies the morbid feelings recent discoveries in physiology have shown how immense is the influence of the brain over the functions of the body digestion circulation and through these all other organic processes are profoundly affected by cerebral excitement whoever has seen repeated as we have the experiment first performed by weber showing the consequence of irritating the vagus nerve which connects the brain with the viscerawhoever has seen the action of the heart suddenly arrested by irritating this nerve slowly recommencing when the irritation is suspended and again arrested the moment it is renewed will have a vivid conception of the depressing influence which an overwrought brain exercises on the body the effects thus physiologically explained are indeed exemplified in ordinary experience there is no one but has felt the palpitation accompanying hope fear anger joyno one but has observed how laboured becomes the action of the heart when these feelings are violent and though there are many who have never suffered that extreme emotional excitement which is followed by arrest of the hearts action and fainting yet every one knows these to be cause and effect it is a familiar fact too that disturbance of the stomach results from mental excitement exceeding a certain intensity loss of appetite is a common consequence alike of very pleasurable and very painful states of mind when the event producing a pleasurable or painful state of mind occurs shortly after a meal it not unfrequently happens either that the stomach rejects what has been eaten or digests it with great difficulty and under protest and as every one who taxes his brain much can testify even purely intellectual action will when excessive produce analogous effects now the relation between brain and body which is so manifest in these extreme cases holds equally in ordinary lessmarked cases just as these violent but temporary cerebral excitements produce violent but temporary disturbances of the viscera so do the less violent but chronic cerebral excitements produce less violent but chronic visceral disturbances this is not simply an inferenceit is a truth to which every medical man can bear witness and it is one to which a long and sad experience enables us to give personal testimony various degrees and forms of bodily derangement often taking years of enforced idleness to set partially right result from this prolonged overexertion of mind sometimes the heart is chiefly affected habitual palpitations a pulse much enfeebled and very generally a diminution in the number of beats from seventytwo to sixty or even fewer sometimes the conspicuous disorder is of the stomach a dyspepsia which makes life a burden and is amenable to no remedy but time in many cases both heart and stomach are implicated mostly the sleep is short and broken and very generally there is more or less mental depression  consider then how great must be the damage inflicted by undue mental excitement on children and youths more or less of this constitutional disturbance will inevitably follow an exertion of brain beyond the normal amount and when not so excessive as to produce absolute illness is sure to entail a slowly accumulating degeneracy of physique with a small and fastidious appetite an imperfect digestion and an enfeebled circulation how can the developing body flourish the due performance of every vital process depends on an adequate supply of good blood without enough good blood no gland can secrete properly no viscus can fully discharge its office without enough good blood no nerve muscle membrane or other tissue can be efficiently repaired without enough good blood growth will neither be sound nor sufficient judge then how bad must be the consequences when to a growing body the weakened stomach supplies blood that is deficient in quantity and poor in quality while the debilitated heart propels this poor and scanty blood with unnatural slowness  and if as all who investigate the matter must admit physical degeneracy is a consequence of excessive study how grave is the condemnation to be passed on this crammingsystem above exemplified it is a terrible mistake from whatever point of view regarded it is a mistake in so far as the mere acquirement of knowledge is concerned for the mind like the body cannot assimilate beyond a certain rate and if you ply it with facts faster than it can assimilate them they are soon rejected again instead of being built into the intellectual fabric they fall out of recollection after the passing of the examination for which they were got up it is a mistake too because it tends to make study distasteful either through the painful associations produced by ceaseless mental toil or through the abnormal state of brain it leaves behind it often generates an aversion to books and instead of that subsequent selfculture induced by rational education there comes continued retrogression it is a mistake also inasmuch as it assumes that the acquisition of knowledge is everything and forgets that a much more important thing is the organisation of knowledge for which time and spontaneous thinking are requisite as humboldt remarks respecting the progress of intelligence in general that the interpretation of nature is obscured when the description languishes under too great an accumulation of insulated facts so it may be remarked respecting the progress of individual intelligence that the mind is overburdened and hampered by an excess of illdigested information it is not the knowledge stored up as intellectual fat which is of value but that which is turned into intellectual muscle the mistake goes still deeper however even were the system good as producing intellectual efficiency which it is not it would still be bad because as we have shown it is fatal to that vigour of physique needful to make intellectual training available in the struggle of life those who in eagerness to cultivate their pupils minds are reckless of their bodies do not remember that success in the world depends more on energy than on information and that a policy which in cramming with information undermines energy is selfdefeating the strong will and untiring activity due to abundant animal vigour go far to compensate even great defects of education and when joined with that quite adequate education which may be obtained without sacrificing health they ensure an easy victory over competitors enfeebled by excessive study prodigies of learning though they may be a comparatively small and illmade engine worked at high pressure will do more than a large and wellfinished one worked at lowpressure what folly is it then while finishing the engine so to damage the boiler that it will not generate steam once more the system is a mistake as involving a false estimate of welfare in life even supposing it were a means to worldly success instead of a means to worldly failure yet in the entailed illhealth it would inflict a more than equivalent curse what boots it to have attained wealth if the wealth is accompanied by ceaseless ailments what is the worth of distinction if it has brought hypochondria with it surely no one needs telling that a good digestion a bounding pulse and high spirits are elements of happiness which no external advantages can outbalance chronic bodily disorder casts a gloom over the brightest prospects while the vivacity of strong health gilds even misfortune we contend then that this overeducation is vicious in every wayvicious as giving knowledge that will soon be forgotten vicious as producing a disgust for knowledge vicious as neglecting that organisation of knowledge which is more important than its acquisition vicious as weakening or destroying that energy without which a trained intellect is useless vicious as entailing that illhealth for which even success would not compensate and which makes failure doubly bitter on women the effects of this forcing system are if possible even more injurious than on men being in great measure debarred from those vigorous and enjoyable exercises of body by which boys mitigate the evils of excessive study girls feel these evils in their full intensity hence the much smaller proportion of them who grow up wellmade and healthy in the pale angular flatchested young ladies so abundant in london drawingrooms we see the effect of merciless application unrelieved by youthful sports and this physical degeneracy hinders their welfare far more than their many accomplishments aid it mammas anxious to make their daughters attractive could scarcely choose a course more fatal than this which sacrifices the body to the mind either they disregard the tastes of the opposite sex or else their conception of those tastes is erroneous men care little for erudition in women but very much for physical beauty good nature and sound sense how many conquests does the bluestocking make through her extensive knowledge of history what man ever fell in love with a woman because she understood italian where is the edwin who was brought to angelinas feet by her german but rosy cheeks and laughing eyes are great attractions a finely rounded figure draws admiring glances the liveliness and good humour that overflowing health produces go a great way towards establishing attachments every one knows cases where bodily perfections in the absence of all other recommendations have incited a passion that carried all before it but scarcely any one can point to a case where intellectual acquirements apart from moral or physical attributes have aroused such a feeling the truth is that out of the many elements uniting in various proportions to produce in a mans breast the complex emotion we call love the strongest are those produced by physical attractions the next in order of strength are those produced by moral attractions the weakest are those produced by intellectual attractions and even these are dependent less on acquired knowledge than on natural facultyquickness wit insight if any think the assertion a derogatory one and inveigh against the masculine character for being thus swayed we reply that they little know what they say when they thus call in question the divine ordinations even were there no obvious meaning in the arrangement we might be sure that some important end was subserved but the meaning is quite obvious to those who examine when we remember that one of natures ends or rather her supreme end is the welfare of posterity further that in so far as posterity are concerned a cultivated intelligence based on a bad physique is of little worth since its descendants will die out in a generation or two and conversely that a good physique however poor the accompanying mental endowments is worth preserving because throughout future generations the mental endowments may be indefinitely developed we perceive how important is the balance of instincts above described but advantage apart the instincts being thus balanced it is folly to persist in a system which undermines a girls constitution that it may overload her memory educate as highly as possiblethe higher the betterproviding no bodily injury is entailed and we may remark in passing that a sufficiently high standard might be reached were the parrotfaculty cultivated less and the human faculty more and were the discipline extended over that now wasted period between leaving school and being married but to educate in such manner or to such extent as to produce physical degeneracy is to defeat the chief end for which the toil and cost and anxiety are submitted to by subjecting their daughters to this highpressure system parents frequently ruin their prospects in life besides inflicting on them enfeebled health with all its pains and disabilities and gloom they not unfrequently doom them to celibacy                                       the physical education of children is thus in various ways seriously faulty it errs in deficient feeding in deficient clothing in deficient exercise among girls at least and in excessive mental application considering the regime as a whole its tendency is too exacting it asks too much and gives too little in the extent to which it taxes the vital energies it makes the juvenile life far more like the adult life than it should be it overlooks the truth that as in the foetus the entire vitality is expended in growthas in the infant the expenditure of vitality in growth is so great as to leave extremely little for either physical or mental action so throughout childhood and youth growth is the dominant requirement to which all others must be subordinated a requirement which dictates the giving of much and the taking away of littlea requirement which therefore restricts the exertion of body and mind in proportion to the rapidity of growtha requirement which permits the mental and physical activities to increase only as fast as the rate of growth diminishes  the rationale of this highpressure education is that it results from our passing phase of civilisation in primitive times when aggression and defence were the leading social activities bodily vigour with its accompanying courage were the desiderata and then education was almost wholly physical mental cultivation was little cared for and indeed as in feudal ages was often treated with contempt but now that our state is relatively peacefulnow that muscular power is of use for little else than manual labour while social success of nearly every kind depends very much on mental power our education has become almost exclusively mental instead of respecting the body and ignoring the mind we now respect the mind and ignore the body both these attitudes are wrong we do not yet realise the truth that as in this life of ours the physical underlies the mental the mental must not be developed at the expense of the physical the ancient and modern conceptions must be combined  perhaps nothing will so much hasten the time when body and mind will both be adequately cared for as a diffusion of the belief that the preservation of health is a duty few seem conscious that there is such a thing as physical morality mens habitual words and acts imply the idea that they are at liberty to treat their bodies as they please disorders entailed by disobedience to natures dictates they regard simply as grievances not as the effects of a conduct more or less flagitious though the evil consequences inflicted on their dependents and on future generations are often as great as those caused by crime yet they do not think themselves in any degree criminal it is true that in the case of drunkenness the viciousness of a bodily transgression is recognised but none appear to infer that if this bodily transgression is vicious so too is every bodily transgression the fact is that all breaches of the laws of health are physical sins when this is generally seen then and perhaps not till then will the physical training of the young receive the attention it deserves  1 cyclopædia of practical medicine  2 cyclopædia of practical medicine  3 cyclopædia of anatomy and physiology  4 mortons cyclopædia of agriculture  5 mortons cyclopædia of agriculture  6 it is needful to remark that children whose legs and arms have been from the beginning habitually without covering cease to be conscious that the exposed surfaces are cold just as by use we have all ceased to be conscious that our faces are cold even when out of doors but though in such children the sensations no longer protest it does not follow that the system escapes injury any more than it follows that the fuegian is undamaged by exposure because he bears with indifference the melting of the falling snow on his naked body  7 we are not certain that the propagation of subdued forms of constitutional disease through the agency of vaccination is not a part cause sundry facts in pathology suggest the inference that when the system of a vaccinated child is excreting the vaccine virus by means of pustules it will tend also to excrete through such pustules other morbific matters especially if these morbific matters are of a kind ordinarily got rid of by the skin as are some of the worst of them hence it is very possibleprobable eventhat a child with a constitutional taint too slight to show itself in visible disease may through the medium of vitiated vaccine lymph taken from it convey a like constitutional taint to other children and these to others  8 cyclopædia of practical medicine vol i pp 697 698     part ii     progress its law and cause1   the current conception of progress is somewhat shifting and indefinite sometimes it comprehends little more than simple growthas of a nation in the number of its members and the extent of territory over which it has spread sometimes it has reference to quantity of material productsas when the advance of agriculture and manufactures is the topic sometimes the superior quality of these products is contemplated and sometimes the new or improved appliances by which they are produced when again we speak of moral or intellectual progress we refer to the state of the individual or people exhibiting it while when the progress of knowledge of science of art is commented upon we have in view certain abstract results of human thought and action not only however is the current conception of progress more or less vague but it is in great measure erroneous it takes in not so much the reality of progress as its accompanimentsnot so much the substance as the shadow that progress in intelligence seen during the growth of the child into the man or the savage into the philosopher is commonly regarded as consisting in the greater number of facts known and laws understood whereas the actual progress consists in those internal modifications of which this increased knowledge is the expression social progress is supposed to consist in the produce of a greater quantity and variety of the articles required for satisfying mens wants in the increasing security of person and property in widening freedom of action whereas rightly understood social progress consists in those changes of structure in the social organism which have entailed these consequences the current conception is a teleological one the phenomena are contemplated solely as bearing on human happiness only those changes are held to constitute progress which directly or indirectly tend to heighten human happiness and they are thought to constitute progress simply because they tend to heighten human happiness but rightly to understand progress we must inquire what is the nature of these changes considered apart from our interests ceasing for example to regard the successive geological modifications that have taken place in the earth as modifications that have gradually fitted it for the habitation of man and as therefore a geological progress we must seek to determine the character common to the modificationsthe law to which they all conform and similarly in every other case leaving out of sight concomitants and beneficial consequences let us ask what progress is in itself  in respect to that progress which individual organisms display in the course of their evolution this question has been answered by the germans the investigations of wolff goethe and von baer have established the truth that the series of changes gone through during the development of a seed into a tree or an ovum into an animal constitute an advance from homogeneity of structure to heterogeneity of structure in its primary stage every germ consists of a substance that is uniform throughout both in texture and chemical composition the first step is the appearance of a difference between two parts of this substance or as the phenomenon is called in physiological language a differentiation each of these differentiated divisions presently begins itself to exhibit some contrast of parts and by and by these secondary differentiations become as definite as the original one this process is continuously repeatedis simultaneously going on in all parts of the growing embryo and by endless such differentiations there is finally produced that complex combination of tissues and organs constituting the adult animal or plant this is the history of all organisms whatever it is settled beyond dispute that organic progress consists in a change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous  now we propose in the first place to show that this law of organic progress is the law of all progress whether it be in the development of the earth in the development of life upon its surface in the development of society of government of manufactures of commerce of language literature science art this same evolution of the simple into the complex through successive differentiations holds throughout from the earliest traceable cosmical changes down to the latest results of civilisation we shall find that the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous is that in which progress essentially consists  with the view of showing that if the nebular hypothesis be true the genesis of the solar system supplies one illustration of this law let us assume that the matter of which the sun and planets consist was once in a diffused form and that from the gravitation of its atoms there resulted a gradual concentration by the hypothesis the solar system in its nascent state existed as an indefinitely extended and nearly homogeneous mediuma medium almost homogeneous in density in temperature and in other physical attributes the first advance towards consolidation resulted in a differentiation between the occupied space which the nebulous mass still filled and the unoccupied space which it previously filled there simultaneously resulted a contrast in density and a contrast in temperature between the interior and the exterior of this mass and at the same time there arose throughout it rotatory movements whose velocities varied according to their distances from its centre these differentiations increased in number and degree until there was the organised group of sun planets and satellites which we now knowa group which represents numerous contrasts of structure and action among its members there are the immense contrasts between the sun and planets in bulk and in weight as well as the subordinate contrasts between one planet and another and between the planets and their satellites there is the similarly marked contrast between the sun as almost stationary and the planets as moving round him with great velocity while there are the secondary contrasts between the velocities and periods of the several planets and between their simple revolutions and the double ones of their satellites which have to move round their primaries while moving round the sun there is the yet further strong contrast between the sun and the planets in respect of temperature and there is reason to suppose that the planets and satellites differ from each other in their proper heat as well as in the heat they receive from the sun  when we bear in mind that in addition to these various contrasts the planets and satellites also differ in respect to their distances from each other and their primary in respect to the inclinations of their orbits the inclinations of their axes their times of rotation on their axes their specific gravities and their physical constitutions we see what a high degree of heterogeneity the solar system exhibits when compared with the almost complete homogeneity of the nebulous mass out of which it is supposed to have originated  passing from this hypothetical illustration which must be taken for what it is worth without prejudice to the general argument let us descend to a more certain order of evidence it is now generally agreed among geologists that the earth was at first a mass of molten matter and that it is still fluid and incandescent at the distance of a few miles beneath its surface originally then it was homogeneous in consistence and in virtue of the circulation that takes place in heated fluids must have been comparatively homogeneous in temperature and it must have been surrounded by an atmosphere consisting partly of the elements of air and water and partly of those various other elements which assume a gaseous form at high temperatures that slow cooling by radiation which is still going on at an inappreciable rate and which though originally far more rapid than now necessarily required an immense time to produce any decided change must ultimately have resulted in the solidification of the portion most able to part with its heatnamely the surface in the thin crust thus formed we have the first marked differentiation a still further cooling a consequent thickening of this crust and an accompanying deposition of all solidifiable elements contained in the atmosphere must finally have been followed by the condensation of the water previously existing as vapour a second marked differentiation must thus have arisen and as the condensation must have taken place on the coolest parts of the surfacenamely about the polesthere must thus have resulted the first geographical distinction of parts to these illustrations of growing heterogeneity which though deduced from the known laws of matter may be regarded as more or less hypothetical geology adds an extensive series that have been inductively established its investigations show that the earth has been continually becoming more heterogeneous in virtue of the multiplication of the strata which form its crust further that it has been becoming more heterogeneous in respect of the composition of these strata the latter of which being made from the detritus of the older ones are many of them rendered highly complex by the mixture of materials they contain and that this heterogeneity has been vastly increased by the action of the earths still molten nucleus upon its envelope whence have resulted not only a great variety of igneous rocks but the tilting up of sedimentary strata at all angles the formation of faults and metallic veins the production of endless dislocations and irregularities yet again geologists teach us that the earths surface has been growing more varied in elevationthat the most ancient mountain systems are the smallest and the andes and himalayas the most modern while in all probability there have been corresponding changes in the bed of the ocean as a consequence of these ceaseless differentiations we now find that no considerable portion of the earths exposed surface is like any other portion either in contour in geologic structure or in chemical composition and that in most parts it changes from mile to mile in all these characteristics  moreover it must not be forgotten that there has been simultaneously going on a gradual differentiation of climates as fast as the earth cooled and its crust solidified there arose appreciable differences in temperature between those parts of its surface most exposed to the sun and those less exposed gradually as the cooling progressed these differences became more pronounced until there finally resulted those marked contrasts between regions of perpetual ice and snow regions where winter and summer alternately reign for periods varying according to the latitude and regions where summer follows summer with scarcely an appreciable variation at the same time the successive elevations and subsidences of different portions of the earths crust tending as they have done to the present irregular distribution of land and sea have entailed various modifications of climate beyond those dependent on latitude while a yet further series of such modifications have been produced by increasing differences of elevation in the land which have in sundry places brought arctic temperate and tropical climates to within a few miles of each other and the general result of these changes is that not only has every extensive region its own meteorologic conditions but that every locality in each region differs more or less from others in those conditions as in its structure its contour its soil thus between our existing earth the phenomena of whose varied crust neither geographers geologists mineralogists nor meteorologists have yet enumerated and the molten globe out of which it was evolved the contrast in heterogeneity is sufficiently striking  when from the earth itself we turn to the plants and animals that have lived or still live upon its surface we find ourselves in some difficulty from lack of facts that every existing organism has been developed out of the simple into the complex is indeed the first established truth of all and that every organism that has existed was similarly developed is an inference which no physiologist will hesitate to draw but when we pass from individual forms of life to life in general and inquire whether the same law is seen in the ensemble of its manifestationswhether modern plants and animals are of more heterogeneous structure than ancient ones and whether the earths present flora and fauna are more heterogeneous than the flora and fauna of the pastwe find the evidence so fragmentary that every conclusion is open to dispute twothirds of the earths surface being covered by water a great part of the exposed land being inaccessible to or untravelled by the geologist the greater part of the remainder having been scarcely more than glanced at and even the most familiar portions as england having been so imperfectly explored that a new series of strata has been added within these four yearsit is manifestly impossible for us to say with any certainty what creatures have and what have not existed at any particular period considering the perishable nature of many of the lower organic forms the metamorphosis of many sedimentary strata and the gaps that occur among the rest we shall see further reason for distrusting our deductions on the one hand the repeated discovery of vertebrate remains in strata previously supposed to contain noneof reptiles where only fish were thought to existof mammals where it was believed there were no creatures higher than reptilesrenders it daily more manifest how small is the value of negative evidence  on the other hand the worthlessness of the assumption that we have discovered the earliest or anything like the earliest organic remains is becoming equally clear that the oldest known sedimentary rocks have been greatly changed by igneous action and that still older ones have been totally transformed by it is becoming undeniable and the fact that sedimentary strata earlier than any we know have been melted up being admitted it must also be admitted that we cannot say how far back in time this destruction of sedimentary strata has been going on thus it is manifest that the title palæozoic as applied to the earliest known fossiliferous strata involves a petitio principii and that for aught we know to the contrary only the last few chapters of the earths biological history may have come down to us on neither side therefore is the evidence conclusive nevertheless we cannot but think that scanty as they are the facts taken altogether tend to show both that the more heterogeneous organisms have been evolved in the later geologic periods and that life in general has been more heterogeneously manifested as time has advanced let us cite in illustration the one case of the vertebrata the earliest known vertebrate remains are those of fishes and fishes are the most homogeneous of the vertebrata later and more heterogeneous are reptiles later still and more heterogeneous still are mammals and birds if it be said as it may fairly be said that the palæozoic deposits not being estuary deposits are not likely to contain the remains of terrestrial vertebrata which may nevertheless have existed at that era we reply that we are merely pointing to the leading facts such as they are  but to avoid any such criticism let us take the mammalian subdivision only the earliest known remains of mammals are those of small marsupials which are the lowest of the mammalian type while conversely the highest of the mammalian typemanis the most recent the evidence that the vertebrate fauna as a whole has become more heterogeneous is considerably stronger to the argument that the vertebrate fauna of the palæozoic period consisting so far as we know entirely of fishes was less heterogeneous than the modern vertebrate fauna which includes reptiles birds and mammals of multitudinous genera it may be replied as before that estuary deposits of the palæozoic period could we find them might contain other orders of vertebrata but no such reply can be made to the argument that whereas the marine vertebrata of the palæozoic period consisted entirely of cartilaginous fishes the marine vertebrata of later periods include numerous genera of osseous fishes and that therefore the later marine vertebrate faunas are more heterogeneous than the oldest known one nor again can any such reply be made to the fact that there are far more numerous orders and genera of mammalian remains in the tertiary formations than in the secondary formations did we wish merely to make out the best case we might dwell upon the opinion of dr carpenter who says that the general facts of palæontology appear to sanction the belief that the same plan may be traced out in what may be called the general life of the globe as in the individual life of every one of the forms of organised being which now people it or we might quote as decisive the judgment of professor owen who holds that the earlier examples of each group of creatures severally departed less widely from archetypal generality than the later oneswere severally less unlike the fundamental form common to the group as a whole that is to sayconstituted a less heterogeneous group of creatures and who further upholds the doctrine of a biological progression but in deference to an authority for whom we have the highest respect who considers that the evidence at present obtained does not justify a verdict either way we are content to leave the question open  whether an advance from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is or is not displayed in the biological history of the globe it is clearly enough displayed in the progress of the latest and most heterogeneous creatureman it is alike true that during the period in which the earth has been peopled the human organism has grown more heterogeneous among the civilised divisions of the species and that the species as a whole has been growing more heterogeneous in virtue of the multiplication of races and the differentiation of these races from each other  in proof of the first of these positions we may cite the fact that in the relative development of the limbs the civilised man departs more widely from the general type of the placental mammalia than do the lower human races while often possessing welldeveloped body and arms the papuan has extremely small legs thus reminding us of the quadrumana in which there is no great contrast in size between the hind and fore limbs but in the european the greater length and massiveness of the legs has become very markedthe fore and hind limbs are relatively more heterogeneous again the greater ratio which the cranial bones bear to the facial bones illustrates the same truth among the vertebrata in general progress is marked by an increasing heterogeneity in the vertebral column and more especially in the vertebræ constituting the skull the higher forms being distinguished by the relatively larger size of the bones which cover the brain and the relatively smaller size of those which form the jaw etc now this characteristic which is stronger in man than in any other creature is stronger in the european than in the savage moreover judging from the greater extent and variety of faculty he exhibits we may infer that the civilised man has also a more complex or heterogeneous nervous system than the uncivilised man and indeed the fact is in part visible in the increased ratio which his cerebrum bears to the subjacent ganglia  if further elucidation be needed we may find it in every nursery the infant european has sundry marked points of resemblance to the lower human races as in the flatness of the alæ of the nose the depression of its bridge the divergence and forward opening of the nostrils the form of the lips the absence of a frontal sinus the width between the eyes the smallness of the legs now as the development process by which these traits are turned into those of the adult european is a continuation of that change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous displayed during the previous evolution of the embryo which every physiologist will admit it follows that the parallel developmental process by which the like traits of the barbarous races have been turned into those of the civilised races has also been a continuation of the change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous the truth of the second positionthat mankind as a whole have become more heterogeneousis so obvious as scarcely to need illustration every work on ethnology by its divisions and subdivisions of races bears testimony to it even were we to admit the hypothesis that mankind originated from several separate stocks it would still remain true that as from each of these stocks there have sprung many now widely different tribes which are proved by philological evidence to have had a common origin the race as a whole is far less homogeneous than it once was add to which that we have in the angloamericans an example of a new variety arising within these few generations and that if we may trust to the description of observers we are likely soon to have another such example in australia  on passing from humanity under its individual form to humanity as socially embodied we find the general law still more variously exemplified the change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is displayed equally in the progress of civilisation as a whole and in the progress of every tribe or nation and is still going on with increasing rapidity as we see in existing barbarous tribes society in its first and lowest form is a homogeneous aggregation of individuals having like powers and like functions the only marked difference of function being that which accompanies difference of sex every man is warrior hunter fisherman toolmaker builder every woman performs the same drudgeries every family is selfsufficing and save for purposes of aggression and defence might as well live apart from the rest very early however in the process of social evolution we find an incipient differentiation between the governing and the governed some kind of chieftainship seems coeval with the first advance from the state of separate wandering families to that of a nomadic tribe the authority of the strongest makes itself felt among a body of savages as in a herd of animals or a posse of schoolboys at first however it is indefinite uncertain is shared by others of scarcely inferior power and is unaccompanied by any difference in occupation or style of living the first ruler kills his own game makes his own weapons builds his own hut and economically considered does not differ from others of his tribe gradually as the tribe progresses the contrast between the governing and the governed grows more decided supreme power becomes hereditary in one family the head of that family ceasing to provide for his own wants is served by others and he begins to assume the sole office of ruling  at the same time there has been arising a coordinate species of governmentthat of religion as all ancient records and traditions prove the earliest rulers are regarded as divine personages the maxims and commands they uttered during their lives are held sacred after their deaths and are enforced by their divinelydescended successors who in their turns are promoted to the pantheon of the race there to be worshipped and propitiated along with their predecessors the most ancient of whom is the supreme god and the rest subordinate gods for a long time these connate forms of governmentcivil and religiouscontinue closely associated for many generations the king continues to be the chief priest and the priesthood to be members of the royal race for many ages religious law continues to contain more or less of civil regulation and civil law to possess more or less of religious sanction and even among the most advanced nations these two controlling agencies are by no means completely differentiated from each other  having a common root with these and gradually diverging from them we find yet another controlling agencythat of manners or ceremonial usages all titles of honour are originally the names of the godking afterwards of god and the king still later of persons of high rank and finally come some of them to be used between man and man all forms of complimentary address were at first the expressions of submission from prisoners to their conqueror or from subjects to their ruler either human or divineexpressions that were afterwards used to propitiate subordinate authorities and slowly descended into ordinary intercourse all modes of salutation were once obeisances made before the monarch and used in worship of him after his death presently others of the goddescended race were similarly saluted and by degrees some of the salutations have become the due of all2 thus no sooner does the originally homogeneous social mass differentiate into the governed and the governing parts than this last exhibits an incipient differentiation into religious and secularchurch and state while at the same time there begins to be differentiated from both that less definite species of government which rules our daily intercoursea species of government which as we may see in heralds colleges in books of the peerage in masters of ceremonies is not without a certain embodiment of its own each of these is itself subject to successive differentiations in the course of ages there arises as among ourselves a highly complex political organisation of monarch ministers lords and commons with their subordinate administrative departments courts of justice revenue offices etc supplemented in the provinces by municipal governments county governments parish or union governmentsall of them more or less elaborated by its side there grows up a highly complex religious organisation with its various grades of officials from archbishops down to sextons its colleges convocations ecclesiastical courts etc to all which must be added the ever multiplying independent sects each with its general and local authorities and at the same time there is developed a highly complex aggregation of customs manners and temporary fashions enforced by society at large and serving to control those minor transactions between man and man which are not regulated by civil and religious law moreover it is to be observed that this ever increasing heterogeneity in the governmental appliances of each nation has been accompanied by an increasing heterogeneity in the governmental appliances of different nations all of which are more or less unlike in their political systems and legislation in their creeds and religious institutions in their customs and ceremonial usages  simultaneously there has been going on a second differentiation of a more familiar kind that namely by which the mass of the community has been segregated into distinct classes and orders of workers while the governing part has undergone the complex development above detailed the governed part has undergone an equally complex development which has resulted in that minute division of labour characterising advanced nations it is needless to trace out this progress from its first stages up through the caste divisions of the east and the incorporated guilds of europe to the elaborate producing and distributing organisation existing among ourselves political economists have long since described the evolution which beginning with a tribe whose members severally perform the same actions each for himself ends with a civilised community whose members severally perform different actions for each other and they have further pointed out the changes through which the solitary producer of any one commodity is transformed into a combination of producers who united under a master take separate parts in the manufacture of such commodity but there are yet other and higher phases of this advance from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous in the industrial organisation of society  long after considerable progress has been made in the division of labour among different classes of workers there is still little or no division of labour among the widely separated parts of the community the nation continues comparatively homogeneous in the respect that in each district the same occupations are pursued but when roads and other means of transit become numerous and good the different districts begin to assume different functions and to become mutually dependent the calico manufacture locates itself in this county the woollencloth manufacture in that silks are produced here lace there stockings in one place shoes in another pottery hardware cutlery come to have their special towns and ultimately every locality becomes more or less distinguished from the rest by the leading occupation carried on in it nay more this subdivision of functions shows itself not only among the different parts of the same nation but among different nations that exchange of commodities which freetrade promises so greatly to increase will ultimately have the effect of specialising in a greater or less degree the industry of each people so that beginning with a barbarous tribe almost if not quite homogeneous in the functions of its members the progress has been and still is towards an economic aggregation of the whole human race growing ever more heterogeneous in respect of the separate functions assumed by separate nations the separate functions assumed by the local sections of each nation the separate functions assumed by the many kinds of makers and traders in each town and the separate functions assumed by the workers united in producing each commodity  not only is the law thus clearly exemplified in the evolution of the social organism but it is exemplified with equal clearness in the evolution of all products of human thought and action whether concrete or abstract real or ideal let us take language as our first illustration  the lowest form of language is the exclamation by which an entire idea is vaguely conveyed through a single sound as among the lower animals that human language ever consisted solely of exclamations and so was strictly homogeneous in respect of its parts of speech we have no evidence but that language can be traced down to a form in which nouns and verbs are its only elements is an established fact in the gradual multiplication of parts of speech out of these primary onesin the differentiation of verbs into active and passive of nouns into abstract and concretein the rise of distinctions of mood tense person of number and casein the formation of auxiliary verbs of adjectives adverbs pronouns prepositions articlesin the divergence of those orders genera species and varieties of parts of speech by which civilised races express minute modifications of meaningwe see a change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous and it may be remarked in passing that it is more especially in virtue of having carried this subdivision of function to a greater extent and completeness that the english language is superior to all others  another aspect under which we may trace the development of language is the differentiation of words of allied meanings philology early disclosed the truth that in all languages words may be grouped into families having a common ancestry an aboriginal name applied indiscriminately to each of an extensive and illdefined class of things or actions presently undergoes modifications by which the chief divisions of the class are expressed these several names springing from the primitive root themselves become the parents of other names still further modified and by the aid of those systematic modes which presently arise of making derivations and forming compound terms expressing still smaller distinctions there is finally developed a tribe of words so heterogeneous in sound and meaning that to the uninitiated it seems incredible that they should have had a common origin meanwhile from other roots there are being evolved other such tribes until there results a language of some sixty thousand or more unlike words signifying as many unlike objects qualities acts  yet another way in which language in general advances from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is in the multiplication of languages whether as max müller and bunsen think all languages have grown from one stock or whether as some philologists say they have grown from two or more stocks it is clear that since large families of languages as the indoeuropean are of one parentage they have become distinct through a process of continuous divergence the same diffusion over the earths surface which has led to the differentiation of the race has simultaneously led to a differentiation of their speech a truth which we see further illustrated in each nation by the peculiarities of dialect found in several districts thus the progress of language conforms to the general law alike in the evolution of languages in the evolution of families of words and in the evolution of parts of speech  on passing from spoken to written language we come upon several classes of facts all having similar implications written language is connate with painting and sculpture and at first all three are appendages of architecture and have a direct connection with the primary form of all governmentthe theocratic merely noting by the way the fact that sundry wild races as for example the australians and the tribes of south africa are given to depicting personages and events upon the walls of caves which are probably regarded as sacred places let us pass to the case of the egyptians among them as also among the assyrians we find mural paintings used to decorate the temple of the god and the palace of the king which were indeed originally identical and as such they were governmental appliances in the same sense that statepageants and religious feasts were further they were governmental appliances in virtue of representing the worship of the god the triumphs of the godking the submission of his subjects and the punishment of the rebellious and yet again they were governmental as being the products of an art reverenced by the people as a sacred mystery from the habitual use of this pictorial representations there naturally grew up the but slightlymodified practice of picturewritinga practice which was found still extant among the mexicans at the time they were discovered by abbreviations analogous to those still going on in our own written and spoken language the most familiar of these pictured figures were successively simplified and ultimately there grew up a system of symbols most of which had but a distant resemblance to the things for which they stood the inference that the hieroglyphics of the egyptians were thus produced is confirmed by the fact that the picturewriting of the mexicans was found to have given birth to a like family of ideographic forms and among them as among the egyptians these had been partially differentiated into the kuriological or imitative and the tropical or symbolic which were however used together in the same record in egypt written language underwent a further differentiation whence resulted the hieratic and the epistolographic or enchorial both of which are derived from the original hieroglyphic at the same time we find that for the expression of proper names which could not be otherwise conveyed phonetic symbols were employed and though it is alleged that the egyptians never actually achieved complete alphabetic writing yet it can scarcely be doubted that these phonetic symbols occasionally used in aid of their ideographic ones were the germs out of which alphabetic writing grew once having become separate from hieroglyphics alphabetic writing itself underwent numerous differentiationsmultiplied alphabets were produced between most of which however more or less connection can still be traced and in each civilised nation there has now grown up for the representation of one set of sounds several sets of written signs used for distinct purposes finally through a yet more important differentiation came printing which uniform in kind as it was at first has since become multiform  while written language was passing through its earlier stages of development the mural decoration which formed its root was being differentiated into painting and sculpture the gods kings men and animals represented were originally marked by indented outlines and coloured in most cases these outlines were of such depth and the object they circumscribed so far rounded and marked out in its leading parts as to form a species of work intermediate between intaglio and basrelief in other cases we see an advance upon this the raised spaces between the figures being chiselled off and the figures themselves appropriately tinted a painted basrelief was produced the restored assyrian architecture at sydenham exhibits this style of art carried to greater perfectionthe persons and things represented though still barbarously coloured are carved out with more truth and in greater detail and in the winged lions and bulls used for the angles of gateways we may see a considerable advance towards a completely sculptured figure which nevertheless is still coloured and still forms part of the building but while in assyria the production of a statue proper seems to have been little if at all attempted we may trace in egyptian art the gradual separation of the sculptured figure from the wall a walk through the collection in the british museum will clearly show this while it will at the same time afford an opportunity of observing the evident traces which the independent statues bear of their derivation from basrelief seeing that nearly all of them not only display that union of the limbs with the body which is the characteristic of basrelief but have the back of the statue united from head to foot with a block which stands in place of the original wall greece repeated the leading stages of this progress as in egypt and assyria these twin arts were at first united with each other and with their parent architecture and were the aids of religion and government on the friezes of greek temples we see coloured basreliefs representing sacrifices battles processions gamesall in some sort religious on the pediments we see painted sculptures more or less united with the tympanum and having for subjects the triumphs of gods or heroes even when we come to statues that are definitely separated from the buildings to which they pertain we still find them coloured and only in the later periods of greek civilisation does the differentiation of sculpture from painting appear to have become complete  in christian art we may clearly trace a parallel regenesis all early paintings and sculptures throughout europe were religious in subjectrepresented christs crucifixions virgins holy families apostles saints they formed integral parts of church architecture and were among the means of exciting worship as in roman catholic countries they still are moreover the early sculptures of christ on the cross of virgins of saints were coloured and it needs but to call to mind the painted madonnas and crucifixes still abundant in continental churches and highways to perceive the significant fact that painting and sculpture continue in closest connection with each other where they continue in closest connection with their parent even when christian sculpture was pretty clearly differentiated from painting it was still religious and governmental in its subjectswas used for tombs in churches and statues of kings while at the same time painting where not purely ecclesiastical was applied to the decoration of palaces and besides representing royal personages was almost wholly devoted to sacred legends only in quite recent times have painting and sculpture become entirely secular arts only within these few centuries has painting been divided into historical landscape marine architectural genre animal stilllife etc and sculpture grown heterogeneous in respect of the variety of real and ideal subjects with which it occupies itself  strange as it seems then we find it no less true that all forms of written language of painting and of sculpture have a common root in the politicoreligious decorations of ancient temples and palaces little resemblance as they now have the bust that stands on the console the landscape that hangs against the wall and the copy of the times lying upon the table are remotely akin not only in nature but by extraction the brazen face of the knocker which the postman has just lifted is related not only to the woodcuts of the illustrated london news which he is delivering but to the characters of the billetdoux which accompanies it between the painted window the prayerbook on which its light falls and the adjacent monument there is consanguinity the effigies on our coins the signs over shops the figures that fill every ledger the coats of arms outside the carriage panel and the placards inside the omnibus are in common with dolls bluebooks paperhangings lineally descended from the rude sculpturepaintings in which the egyptians represented the triumphs and worship of their godkings perhaps no example can be given which more vividly illustrates the multiplicity and heterogeneity of the products that in course of time may arise by successive differentiations from a common stock  before passing to other classes of facts it should be observed that the evolution of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous is displayed not only in the separation of painting and sculpture from architecture and from each other and in the greater variety of subjects they embody but it is further shown in the structure of each work a modern picture or statue is of far more heterogeneous nature than an ancient one an egyptian sculpturefresco represents all its figures as on one planethat is at the same distance from the eye and so is less heterogeneous than a painting that represents them as at various distances from the eye it exhibits all objects as exposed to the same degree of light and so is less heterogeneous than a painting which exhibits different objects and different parts of each object as in different degrees of light it uses scarcely any but the primary colours and these in their full intensity and so is less heterogeneous than a painting which introducing the primary colours but sparingly employs an endless variety of intermediate tints each of heterogeneous composition and differing from the rest not only in quality but in intensity moreover we see in these earliest works a great uniformity of conception the same arrangement of figures is perpetually reproducedthe same actions attitudes faces dresses in egypt the modes of representation were so fixed that it was sacrilege to introduce a novelty and indeed it could have been only in consequence of a fixed mode of representation that a system of hieroglyphics became possible the assyrian basreliefs display parallel characters deities kings attendants winged figures and animals are severally depicted in like positions holding like implements doing like things and with like expression or nonexpression of face if a palmgrove is introduced all the trees are of the same height have the same number of leaves and are equidistant when water is imitated each wave is a counterpart of the rest and the fish almost always of one kind are evenly distributed over the surface the beards of the kings the gods and the winged figures are every where similar as are the names of the lions and equally so those of the horses hair is represented throughout by one form of curl the kings beard is quite architecturally built up of compound tiers of uniform curls alternating with twisted tiers placed in a transverse direction and arranged with perfect regularity and the terminal tufts of the bulls tails are represented in exactly the same manner without tracing out analogous facts in early christian art in which though less striking they are still visible the advance in heterogeneity will be sufficiently manifest on remembering that in the pictures of our own day the composition is endlessly varied the attitudes faces expressions unlike the subordinate objects different in size form position texture and more or less of contrast even in the smallest details or if we compare an egyptian statue seated bolt upright on a block with hands on knees fingers outspread and parallel eyes looking straight forward and the two sides perfectly symmetrical in every particular with a statue of the advanced greek or the modern school which is asymmetrical in respect of the position of the head the body the limbs the arrangement of the hair dress appendages and in its relations to neighbouring objects we shall see the change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous clearly manifested  in the coordinate origin and gradual differentiation of poetry music and dancing we have another series of illustrations rhythm in speech rhythm in sound and rhythm in motion were in the beginning parts of the same thing and have only in process of time become separate things among various existing barbarous tribes we find them still united the dances of savages are accompanied by some kind of monotonous chant the clapping of hands the striking of rude instruments there are measured movements measured words and measured tones and the whole ceremony usually having reference to war or sacrifice is of governmental character in the early records of the historic races we similarly find these three forms of metrical action united in religious festivals in the hebrew writings we read that the triumphal ode composed by moses on the defeat of the egyptians was sung to an accompaniment of dancing and timbrels the israelites danced and sung at the inauguration of the golden calf and as it is generally agreed that this representation of the deity was borrowed from the mysteries of apis it is probable that the dancing was copied from that of the egyptians on those occasions there was an annual dance in shiloh on the sacred festival and david danced before the ark again in greece the like relation is everywhere seen the original type being there as probably in other cases a simultaneous chanting and mimetic representation of the life and adventures of the god the spartan dances were accompanied by hymns and songs and in general the greeks had no festivals or religious assemblies but what were accompanied with songs and dancesboth of them being forms of worship used before altars among the romans too there were sacred dances the salian and lupercalian being named as of that kind and even in christian countries as at limoges in comparatively recent times the people have danced in the choir in honour of a saint the incipient separation of these once united arts from each other and from religion was early visible in greece probably diverging from dances partly religious partly warlike as the corybantian came the war dances proper of which there were various kinds and from these resulted secular dances meanwhile music and poetry though still united came to have an existence separate from dancing the aboriginal greek poems religious in subject were not recited but chanted and though at first the chant of the poet was accompanied by the dance of the chorus it ultimately grew into independence later still when the poem had been differentiated into epic and lyricwhen it became the custom to sing the lyric and recite the epicpoetry proper was born as during the same period musical instruments were being multiplied we may presume that music came to have an existence apart from words and both of them were beginning to assume other forms besides the religious facts having like implications might be cited from the histories of later times and people as the practices of our own early minstrels who sang to the harp heroic narratives versified by themselves to music of their own composition thus uniting the now separate offices of poet composer vocalist and instrumentalist but without further illustration the common origin and gradual differentiation of dancing poetry and music will be sufficiently manifest  the advance from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is displayed not only in the separation of these arts from each other and from religion but also in the multiplied differentiations which each of them afterwards undergoes not to dwell upon the numberless kinds of dancing that have in course of time come into use and not to occupy space in detaining the progress of poetry as seen in the development of the various forms of metre of rhyme and of general organisation let us confine our attention to music as a type of the group as argued by dr burney and as implied by the customs of still extant barbarous races the first musical instruments were without doubt percussivesticks calabashes tomtomsand were used simply to mark the time of the dance and in this constant repetition of the same sound we see music in its most homogeneous form  the egyptians had a lyre with three strings the early lyre of the greeks had four constituting their tetrachord in course of some centuries lyres of seven and eight strings were employed and by the expiration of a thousand years they had advanced to their great system of the double octave through all which changes there of course arose a greater heterogeneity of melody simultaneously there came into use the different modesdorian ionian phrygian Æolian and lydiananswering to our keys and of these there were ultimately fifteen as yet however there was but little heterogeneity in the time of their music  instrumental music during this period being merely the accompaniment of vocal music and vocal music being completely subordinated to words the singer being also the poet chanting his own compositions and making the lengths of his notes agree with the feet of his versesthere unavoidably arose a tiresome uniformity of measure which as dr burney says no resources of melody could disguise lacking the complex rhythm obtained by our equal bars and unequal notes the only rhythm was that produced by the quantity of the syllables and was of necessity comparatively monotonous and further it may be observed that the chant thus resulting being like recitative was much less clearly differentiated from ordinary speech than is our modern song  nevertheless in virtue of the extended range of notes in use the variety of modes the occasional variations of time consequent on changes of metre and the multiplication of instruments music had towards the close of greek civilisation attained to considerable heterogeneitynot indeed as compared with our music but as compared with that which preceded it as yet however there existed nothing but melody harmony was unknown it was not until christian churchmusic had reached some development that music in parts was evolved and then it came into existence through a very unobtrusive differentiation difficult as it may be to conceive à priori how the advance from melody to harmony could take place without a sudden leap it is none the less true that it did so the circumstance which prepared the way for it was the employment of two choirs singing alternately the same air afterwards it became the practicevery possibly first suggested by a mistakefor the second choir to commence before the first had ceased thus producing a fugue  with the simple airs then in use a partially harmonious fugue might not improbably thus result and a very partially harmonious fugue satisfied the ears of that age as we know from still preserved examples the idea having once been given the composing of airs productive of fugal harmony would naturally grow up as in some way it did grow up out of this alternate choirsinging and from the fugue to concerted music of two three four and more parts the transition was easy without pointing out in detail the increasing complexity that resulted from introducing notes of various lengths from the multiplication of keys from the use of accidentals from varieties of time and so forth it needs but to contrast music as it is with music as it was to see how immense is the increase of heterogeneity we see this if looking at music in its ensemble we enumerate its many different genera and speciesif we consider the divisions into vocal instrumental and mixed and their subdivisions into music for different voices and different instrumentsif we observe the many forms of sacred music from the simple hymn the chant the canon motet anthem etc up to the oratorio and the still more numerous forms of secular music from the ballad up to the serenata from the instrumental solo up to the symphony  again the same truth is seen on comparing any one sample of aboriginal music with a sample of modern musiceven an ordinary song for the piano which we find to be relatively highly heterogeneous not only in respect of the varieties in the pitch and in the length of the notes the number of different notes sounding at the same instant in company with the voice and the variations of strength with which they are sounded and sung but in respect of the changes of key the changes of time the changes of timbre of the voice and the many other modifications of expression while between the old monotonous dancechant and a grand opera of our own day with its endless orchestral complexities and vocal combinations the contrast in heterogeneity is so extreme that it seems scarcely credible that the one should have been the ancestor of the other  were they needed many further illustrations might be cited going back to the early time when the deeds of the godking chanted and mimetically represented in dances round his altar were further narrated in picturewritings on the walls of temples and palaces and so constituted a rude literature we might trace the development of literature through phases in which as in the hebrew scriptures it presents in one work theology cosmogony history biography civil law ethics poetry through other phases in which as in the iliad the religious martial historical the epic dramatic and lyric elements are similarly commingled down to its present heterogeneous development in which its divisions and subdivisions are so numerous and varied as to defy complete classification or we might trace out the evolution of science beginning with the era in which it was not yet differentiated from art and was in union with art the handmaid of religion passing through the era in which the sciences were so few and rudimentary as to be simultaneously cultivated by the same philosophers and ending with the era in which the genera and species are so numerous that few can enumerate them and no one can adequately grasp even one genus or we might do the like with architecture with the drama with dress  but doubtless the reader is already weary of illustrations and our promise has been amply fulfilled we believe we have shown beyond question that that which the german physiologists have found to be the law of organic development is the law of all development the advance from the simple to the complex through a process of successive differentiations is seen alike in the earliest changes of the universe to which we can reason our way back and in the earliest changes which we can inductively establish it is seen in the geologic and climatic evolution of the earth and of every single organism on its surface it is seen in the evolution of humanity whether contemplated in the civilised individual or in the aggregation of races it is seen in the evolution of society in respect alike of its political its religious and its economical organisation and it is seen in the evolution of all those endless concrete and abstract products of human activity which constitute the environment of our daily life from the remotest past which science can fathom up to the novelties of yesterday that in which progress essentially consists is the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous                                       and now from this uniformity of procedure may we not infer some fundamental necessity whence it results may we not rationally seek for some allpervading principle which determines this allpervading process of things does not the universality of the law imply a universal cause  that we can fathom such cause noumenally considered is not to be supposed to do this would be to solve that ultimate mystery which must ever transcend human intelligence but it still may be possible for us to reduce the law of all progress above established from the condition of an empirical generalisation to the condition of a rational generalisation just as it was possible to interpret keplers laws as necessary consequences of the law of gravitation so it may be possible to interpret this law of progress in its multiform manifestations as the necessary consequence of some similarly universal principle as gravitation was assignable as the cause of each of the groups of phenomena which kepler formulated so may some equally simple attribute of things be assignable as the cause of each of the groups of phenomena formulated in the foregoing pages we may be able to affiliate all these varied and complex evolutions of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous upon certain simple facts of immediate experience which in virtue of endless repetition we regard as necessary  the probability of a common cause and the possibility of formulating it being granted it will be well before going further to consider what must be the general characteristics of such cause and in what direction we ought to look for it we can with certainty predict that it has a high degree of generality seeing that it is common to such infinitely varied phenomena just in proportion to the universality of its application must be the abstractness of its character we need not expect to see in it an obvious solution of this or that form of progress because it equally refers to forms of progress bearing little apparent resemblance to them its association with multiform orders of facts involves its dissociation from any particular order of facts being that which determines progress of every kindastronomic geologic organic ethnologic social economic artistic etcit must be concerned with some fundamental attribute possessed in common by these and must be expressible in terms of this fundamental attribute the only obvious respect in which all kinds of progress are alike is that they are modes of change and hence in some characteristic of changes in general the desired solution will probably be found we may suspect à priori that in some law of change lies the explanation of this universal transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous  thus much premised we pass at once to the statement of the law which is thisevery active force produces more than one changeevery cause produces more than one effect  before this law can be duly comprehended a few examples must be looked at when one body is struck against another that which we usually regard as the effect is a change of position or motion in one or both bodies but a moments thought shows us that this is a careless and very incomplete view of the matter besides the visible mechanical result sound is produced or to speak accurately a vibration in one or both bodies and in the surrounding air and under some circumstances we call this the effect moreover the air has not only been made to vibrate but has had sundry currents caused in it by the transit of the bodies further there is a disarrangement of the particles of the two bodies in the neighbourhood of their point of collision amounting in some cases to a visible condensation yet more this condensation is accompanied by the disengagement of heat in some cases a sparkthat is lightresults from the incandescence of a portion struck off and sometimes this incandescence is associated with chemical combination  thus by the original mechanical force expended in the collision at least five and often more different kinds of changes have been produced take again the lighting of a candle primarily this is a chemical change consequent on a rise of temperature the process of combination having once been set going by extraneous heat there is a continued formation of carbonic acid water etcin itself a result more complex than the extraneous heat that first caused it but accompanying this process of combination there is a production of heat there is a production of light there is an ascending column of hot gases generated there are currents established in the surrounding air moreover the decomposition of one force into many forces does not end here each of the several changes produced becomes the parent of further changes the carbonic acid given off will by and by combine with some base or under the influence of sunshine give up its carbon to the leaf of a plant the water will modify the hygrometric state of the air around or if the current of hot gases containing it come against a cold body will be condensed altering the temperature and perhaps the chemical state of the surface it covers the heat given out melts the subjacent tallow and expands whatever it warms the light falling on various substances calls forth from them reactions by which it is modified and so divers colours are produced similarly even with these secondary actions which may be traced out into evermultiplying ramifications until they become too minute to be appreciated and thus it is with all changes whatever no case can be named in which an active force does not evolve forces of several kinds and each of these other groups of forces universally the effect is more complex than the cause  doubtless the reader already foresees the course of our argument this multiplication of results which is displayed in every event of today has been going on from the beginning and is true of the grandest phenomena of the universe as of the most insignificant from the law that every active force produces more than one change it is an inevitable corollary that through all time there has been an evergrowing complication of things starting with the ultimate fact that every cause produces more than one effect we may readily see that throughout creation there must have gone on and must still go on a neverceasing transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous but let us trace out this truth in detail  without committing ourselves to it as more than a speculation though a highly probable one let us again commence with the evolution of the solar system out of a nebulous medium3 from the mutual attraction of the atoms of a diffused mass whose form is unsymmetrical there results not only condensation but rotation gravitation simultaneously generates both the centripetal and the centrifugal forces while the condensation and the rate of rotation are progressively increasing the approach of the atoms necessarily generates a progressively increasing temperature as this temperature rises light begins to be evolved and ultimately there results a revolving sphere of fluid matter radiating intense heat and lighta sun  there are good reasons for believing that in consequence of the high tangential velocity and consequent centrifugal force acquired by the outer parts of the condensing nebulous mass there must be a periodical detachment of rotating rings and that from the breaking up of these nebulous rings there must arise masses which in the course of their condensation repeat the actions of the parent mass and so produce planets and their satellitesan inference strongly supported by the still extant rings of saturn  should it hereafter be satisfactorily shown that planets and satellites were thus generated a striking illustration will be afforded of the highly heterogeneous effects produced by the primary homogeneous cause but it will serve our present purpose to point to the fact that from the mutual attraction of the particles of an irregular nebulous mass there result condensation rotation heat and light  it follows as a corollary from the nebular hypothesis that the earth must at first have been incandescent and whether the nebular hypothesis be true or not this original incandescence of the earth is now inductively establishedor if not established at least rendered so highly probable that it is a generally admitted geological doctrine let us look first at the astronomical attributes of this once molten globe from its rotation there result the oblateness of its form the alternations of day and night and under the influence of the moon the tides aqueous and atmospheric from the inclination of its axis there result the precession of the equinoxes and the many differences of the seasons both simultaneous and successive that pervade its surface thus the multiplication of effects is obvious several of the differentiations due to the gradual cooling of the earth have been already noticedas the formation of a crust the solidification of sublimed elements the precipitation of water etcand we here again refer to them merely to point out that they are simultaneous effects of the one cause diminishing heat  let us now however observe the multiplied changes afterwards arising from the continuance of this one cause the cooling of the earth involves its contraction hence the solid crust first formed is presently too large for the shrinking nucleus and as it cannot support itself inevitably follows the nucleus but a spheroidal envelope cannot sink down into contact with a smaller internal spheroid without disruption it must run into wrinkles as the rind of an apple does when the bulk of its interior decreases from evaporation as the cooling progresses and the envelope thickens the ridges consequent on these contractions must become greater rising ultimately into hills and mountains and the later systems of mountains thus produced must not only be higher as we find them to be but they must be longer as we also find them to be thus leaving out of view other modifying forces we see what immense heterogeneity of surface has arisen from the one cause loss of heata heterogeneity which the telescope shows us to be paralleled on the face of the moon where aqueous and atmospheric agencies have been absent  but we have yet to notice another kind of heterogeneity of surface similarly and simultaneously caused while the earths crust was still thin the ridges produced by its contraction must not only have been small but the spaces between these ridges must have rested with great evenness upon the subjacent liquid spheroid and the water in those arctic and antarctic regions in which it first condensed must have been evenly distributed but as fast as the crust grew thicker and gained corresponding strength the lines of fracture from time to time caused in it must have occurred at greater distances apart the intermediate surfaces must have followed the contracting nucleus with less uniformity and there must have resulted larger areas of land and water if any one after wrapping up an orange in wet tissue paper and observing not only how small are the wrinkles but how evenly the intervening spaces lie upon the surface of the orange will then wrap it up in thick cartridgepaper and note both the greater height of the ridges and the much larger spaces throughout which the paper does not touch the orange he will realise the fact that as the earths solid envelope grew thicker the areas of elevation and depression must have become greater in place of islands more or less homogeneously scattered over an allembracing sea there must have gradually arisen heterogeneous arrangements of continent and ocean such as we now know  once more this double change in the extent and in the elevation of the lands involved yet another species of heterogeneity that of coastline a tolerably even surface raised out of the ocean must have a simple regular seamargin but a surface varied by tablelands and intersected by mountainchains must when raised out of the ocean have an outline extremely irregular both in its leading features and in its details thus endless is the accumulation of geological and geographical results slowly brought about by this one causethe contraction of the earth  when we pass from the agency which geologists term igneous to aqueous and atmospheric agencies we see the like ever growing complications of effects the denuding actions of air and water have from the beginning been modifying every exposed surface everywhere causing many different changes oxidation heat wind frost rain glaciers rivers tides waves have been unceasingly producing disintegration varying in kind and amount according to local circumstances acting upon a tract of granite they here work scarcely an appreciable effect there cause exfoliations of the surface and a resulting heap of débris and boulders and elsewhere after decomposing the feldspar into a white clay carry away this and the accompanying quartz and mica and deposit them in separate beds fluviatile and marine when the exposed land consists of several unlike formations sedimentary and igneous the denudation produces changes proportionably more heterogeneous the formations being disintegrable in different degrees there follows an increased irregularity of surface the areas drained by different rivers being differently constituted these rivers carry down to the sea different combinations of ingredients and so sundry new strata of distinct composition are formed  and here indeed we may see very simply illustrated the truth which we shall presently have to trace out in more involved cases that in proportion to the heterogeneity of the object or objects on which any force expends itself is the heterogeneity of the results a continent of complex structure exposing many strata irregularly distributed raised to various levels tilted up at all angles must under the same denuding agencies give origin to immensely multiplied results each district must be differently modified each river must carry down a different kind of detritus each deposit must be differently distributed by the entangled currents tidal and other which wash the contorted shores and this multiplication of results must manifestly be greatest where the complexity of the surface is greatest  it is out of the question here to trace in detail the genesis of those endless complications described by geology and physical geography else we might show how the general truth that every active force produces more than one change is exemplified in the highly involved flow of the tides in the ocean currents in the winds in the distribution of rain in the distribution of heat and so forth but not to dwell upon these let us for the fuller elucidation of this truth in relation to the inorganic world consider what would be the consequences of some extensive cosmical revolutionsay the subsidence of central america  the immediate results of the disturbance would themselves be sufficiently complex besides the numberless dislocations of strata the ejections of igneous matter the propagation of earthquake vibrations thousands of miles around the loud explosions and the escape of gases there would be the rush of the atlantic and pacific oceans to supply the vacant space the subsequent recoil of enormous waves which would traverse both these oceans and produce myriads of changes along their shores the corresponding atmospheric waves complicated by the currents surrounding each volcanic vent and the electrical discharges with which such disturbances are accompanied but these temporary effects would be insignificant compared with the permanent ones the complex currents of the atlantic and pacific would be altered in direction and amount the distribution of heat achieved by these ocean currents would be different from what it is the arrangement of the isothermal lines not even on the neighbouring continents but even throughout europe would be changed the tides would flow differently from what they do now there would be more or less modification of the winds in their periods strengths directions qualities rain would fall scarcely anywhere at the same times and in the same quantities as at present in short the meteorological conditions thousands of miles off on all sides would be more or less revolutionised  thus without taking into account the infinitude of modifications which these changes of climate would produce upon the flora and fauna both of land and sea the reader will see the immense heterogeneity of the results wrought out by one force when that force expends itself upon a previously complicated area and he will readily draw the corollary that from the beginning the complication has advanced at an increasing rate  before going on to show how organic progress also depends upon the universal law that every force produces more than one change we have to notice the manifestation of this law in yet another species of inorganic progressnamely chemical the same general causes that have wrought out the heterogeneity of the earth physically considered have simultaneously wrought out its chemical heterogeneity without dwelling upon the general fact that the forces which have been increasing the variety and complexity of geological formations have at the same time been bringing into contact elements not previously exposed to each other under conditions favourable to union and so have been adding to the number of chemical compounds let us pass to the more important complications that have resulted from the cooling of the earth  there is every reason to believe that at an extreme heat the elements cannot combine even under such heat as can be artificially produced some very strong affinities yield as for instance that of oxygen for hydrogen and the great majority of chemical compounds are decomposed at much lower temperatures but without insisting upon the highly probable inference that when the earth was in its first state of incandescence there were no chemical combinations at all it will suffice our purpose to point to the unquestionable fact that the compounds that can exist at the highest temperatures and which must therefore have been the first that were formed as the earth cooled are those of the simplest constitutions the protoxidesincluding under that head the alkalies earths etcare as a class the most stable compounds we know most of them resisting decomposition by any heat we can generate these consisting severally of one atom of each component element are combinations of the simplest orderare but one degree less homogeneous than the elements themselves more heterogeneous than these less stable and therefore later in the earths history are the deutoxides tritoxides peroxides etc in which two three four or more atoms of oxygen are united with one atom of metal or other element higher than these in heterogeneity are the hydrates in which an oxide of hydrogen united with an oxide of some other element forms a substance whose atoms severally contain at least four ultimate atoms of three different kinds yet more heterogeneous and less stable still are the salts which present us with compound atoms each made up of five six seven eight ten twelve or more atoms of three if not more kinds then there are the hydrated salts of a yet greater heterogeneity which undergo partial decomposition at much lower temperatures after them come the furthercomplicated supersalts and double salts having a stability again decreased and so throughout without entering into qualifications for which we lack space we believe no chemist will deny it to be a general law of these inorganic combinations that other things equal the stability decreases as the complexity increases  and then when we pass to the compounds of organic chemistry we find this general law still further exemplified we find much greater complexity and much less stability an atom of albumen for instance consists of 482 ultimate atoms of five different kinds fibrine still more intricate in constitution contains in each atom 298 atoms of carbon 40 of nitrogen 2 of sulphur 228 of hydrogen and 92 of oxygenin all 660 atoms or more strictly speakingequivalents and these two substances are so unstable as to decompose at quite ordinary temperatures as that to which the outside of a joint of roast meat is exposed thus it is manifest that the present chemical heterogeneity of the earths surface has arisen by degrees as the decrease of heat has permitted and that it has shown itself in three formsfirst in the multiplication of chemical compounds second in the greater number of different elements contained in the more modern of these compounds and third in the higher and more varied multiples in which these more numerous elements combine  to say that this advance in chemical heterogeneity is due to the one cause diminution of the earths temperature would be to say too much for it is clear that aqueous and atmospheric agencies have been concerned and further that the affinities of the elements themselves are implied the cause has all along been a composite one the cooling of the earth having been simply the most general of the concurrent causes or assemblage of conditions and here indeed it may be remarked that in the several classes of facts already dealt with excepting perhaps the first and still more in those with which we shall presently deal the causes are more or less compound as indeed are nearly all causes with which we are acquainted scarcely any change can with logical accuracy be wholly ascribed to one agency to the neglect of the permanent or temporary conditions under which only this agency produces the change but as it does not materially affect our argument we prefer for simplicitys sake to use throughout the popular mode of expression  perhaps it will be further objected that to assign loss of heat as the cause of any changes is to attribute these changes not to a force but to the absence of a force and this is true strictly speaking the changes should be attributed to those forces which come into action when the antagonist force is withdrawn but though there is an inaccuracy in saying that the freezing of water is due to the loss of its heat no practical error arises from it nor will a parallel laxity of expression vitiate our statements respecting the multiplication of effects indeed the objection serves but to draw attention to the fact that not only does the exertion of a force produce more than one change but the withdrawal of a force produces more than one change and this suggests that perhaps the most correct statement of our general principle would be its most abstract statementevery change is followed by more than one other change  returning to the thread of our exposition we have next to trace out in organic progress this same allpervading principle and here where the evolution of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous was first observed the production of many changes by one cause is least easy to demonstrate the development of a seed into a plant or an ovum into an animal is so gradual while the forces which determine it are so involved and at the same time so unobtrusive that it is difficult to detect the multiplication of effects which is elsewhere so obvious nevertheless guided by indirect evidence we may pretty safely reach the conclusion that here too the law holds  observe first how numerous are the effects which any marked change works upon an adult organisma human being for instance an alarming sound or sigh besides the impressions on the organs of sense and the nerves may produce a start a scream a distortion of the face a trembling consequent upon a general muscular relaxation a burst of perspiration an excited action of the heart a rush of blood to the brain followed possibly by arrest of the hearts action and by syncope and if the system be feeble an indisposition with its long train of complicated symptoms may set in similarly in cases of disease a minute portion of the smallpox virus introduced into the system will in a severe case cause during the first stage rigors heat of skin accelerated pulse furred tongue loss of appetite thirst epigastric uneasiness vomiting headache pains in the back and limbs muscular weakness convulsions delirium etc in the second stage cutaneous eruption itching tingling sore throat swelled fauces salivation cough hoarseness dyspnoea etc and in the third stage oedematous inflammations pneumonia pleurisy diarrhoea inflammation of the brain ophthalmia erysipelas etc each of which enumerated symptoms is itself more or less complex medicines special foods better air might in like manner be instanced as producing multiplied results  now it needs only to consider that the many changes thus wrought by one force upon an adult organism will be in part paralleled in an embryo organism to understand how here also the evolution of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous may be due to the production of many effects by one cause the external heat and other agencies which determine the first complications of the germ may by acting upon these superinduce further complications upon these still higher and more numerous ones and so on continually each organ as it is developed serving by its actions and reactions upon the rest to initiate new complexities the first pulsations of the foetal heart must simultaneously aid the unfolding of every part the growth of each tissue by taking from the blood special proportions of elements must modify the constitution of the blood and so must modify the nutrition of all the other tissues the hearts action implying as it does a certain waste necessitates an addition to the blood of effete matters which must influence the rest of the system and perhaps as some think cause the formation of excretory organs the nervous connections established among the viscera must further multiply their mutual influences and so continually  still stronger becomes the probability of this view when we call to mind the fact that the same germ may be evolved into different forms according to circumstances thus during its earlier stages every embryo is sexlessbecomes either male or female as the balance of forces acting upon it determines again it is a wellestablished fact that the larva of a workingbee will develop into a queenbee if before it is too late its food be changed to that on which the larvæ of queenbees are fed even more remarkable is the case of certain entozoa the ovum of a tapeworm getting into its natural habitat the intestine unfolds into the wellknown form of its parent but if carried as it frequently is into other parts of the system it becomes a saclike creature called by naturalists the echinococcusa creature so extremely different from the tapeworm in aspect and structure that only after careful investigations has it been proved to have the same origin all which instances imply that each advance in embryonic complication results from the action of incident forces upon the complication previously existing  indeed we may find à priori reason to think that the evolution proceeds after this manner for since it is now known that no germ animal or vegetable contains the slightest rudiment trace or indication of the future organismnow that the microscope has shown us that the first process set up in every fertilised germ is a process of repeated spontaneous fissions ending in the production of a mass of cells not one of which exhibits any special character there seems no alternative but to suppose that the partial organisation at any moment subsisting in a growing embryo is transformed by the agencies acting upon it into the succeeding phase of organisation and this into the next until through everincreasing complexities the ultimate form is reached thus though the subtilty of the forces and the slowness of the results prevent us from directly showing that the stages of increasing heterogeneity through which every embryo passes severally arise from the production of many changes by one force yet indirectly we have strong evidence that they do so  we have marked how multitudinous are the effects which one cause may generate in an adult organism that a like multiplication of effects must happen in the unfolding organism we have observed in sundry illustrative cases further it has been pointed out that the ability which like germs have to originate unlike forms implies that the successive transformations result from the new changes superinduced on previous changes and we have seen that structureless as every germ originally is the development of an organism out of it is otherwise incomprehensible not indeed that we can thus really explain the production of any plant or animal we are still in the dark respecting those mysterious properties in virtue of which the germ when subject to fit influences undergoes the special changes that begin the series of transformations all we aim to show is that given a germ possessing these mysterious properties the evolution of an organism from it probably depends upon that multiplication of effects which we have seen to be the cause of progress in general so far as we have yet traced it  when leaving the development of single plants and animals we pass to that of the earths flora and fauna the course of our argument again becomes clear and simple though as was admitted in the first part of this article the fragmentary facts palæontology has accumulated do not clearly warrant us in saying that in the lapse of geologic time there have been evolved more heterogeneous organisms and more heterogeneous assemblages of organisms yet we shall now see that there must ever have been a tendency towards these results we shall find that the production of many effects by one cause which as already shown has been all along increasing the physical heterogeneity of the earth has further involved an increasing heterogeneity in its flora and fauna individually and collectively an illustration will make this clear  suppose that by a series of upheavals occurring as they are now known to do at long intervals the east indian archipelago were to be step by step raised into a continent and a chain of mountains formed along the axis of elevation by the first of these upheavals the plants and animals inhabiting borneo sumatra new guinea and the rest would be subjected to slightly modified sets of conditions the climate in general would be altered in temperature in humidity and in its periodical variations while the local differences would be multiplied these modifications would affect perhaps inappreciably the entire flora and fauna of the region the change of level would produce additional modifications varying in different species and also in different members of the same species according to their distance from the axis of elevation plants growing only on the seashore in special localities might become extinct others living only in swamps of a certain humidity would if they survived at all probably undergo visible changes of appearance while still greater alterations would occur in the plants gradually spreading over the lands newly raised above the sea the animals and insects living on these modified plants would themselves be in some degree modified by change of food as well as by change of climate and the modification would be more marked where from the dwindling or disappearance of one kind of plant an allied kind was eaten in the lapse of the many generations arising before the next upheaval the sensible or insensible alterations thus produced in each species would become organisedthere would be a more or less complete adaptation to the new conditions the next upheaval would superinduce further organic changes implying wider divergences from the primary forms and so repeatedly  but now let it be observed that the revolution thus resulting would not be a substitution of a thousand more or less modified species for the thousand original species but in place of the thousand original species there would arise several thousand species or varieties or changed forms each species being distributed over an area of some extent and tending continually to colonise the new area exposed its different members would be subject to different sets of changes plants and animals spreading towards the equator would not be affected in the same way with others spreading from it those spreading towards the new shores would undergo changes unlike the changes undergone by those spreading into the mountains thus each original race of organisms would become the root from which diverged several races differing more or less from it and from each other and while some of these might subsequently disappear probably more than one would survive in the next geologic period the very dispersion itself increasing the chances of survival not only would there be certain modifications thus caused by change of physical conditions and food but also in some cases other modifications caused by change of habit the fauna of each island peopling step by step the newlyraised tracts would eventually come in contact with the faunas of other islands and some members of these other faunas would be unlike any creatures before seen herbivores meeting with new beasts of prey would in some cases be led into modes of defence or escape differing from those previously used and simultaneously the beasts of prey would modify their modes of pursuit and attack we know that when circumstances demand it such changes of habit do take place in animals and we know that if the new habits become the dominant ones they must eventually in some degree alter the organisation  observe now however a further consequence there must arise not simply a tendency towards the differentiation of each race of organisms into several races but also a tendency to the occasional production of a somewhat higher organism taken in the mass these divergent varieties which have been caused by fresh physical conditions and habits of life will exhibit changes quite indefinite in kind and degree and changes that do not necessarily constitute an advance probably in most cases the modified type will be neither more nor less heterogeneous than the original one in some cases the habits of life adopted being simpler than before a less heterogeneous structure will result there will be a retrogradation but it must now and then occur that some division of a species falling into circumstances which give it rather more complex experiences and demand actions somewhat more involved will have certain of its organs further differentiated in proportionately small degreeswill become slightly more heterogeneous  thus in the natural course of things there will from time to time arise an increased heterogeneity both of the earths flora and fauna and of individual races included in them omitting detailed explanations and allowing for the qualifications which cannot here be specified we think it is clear that geological mutations have all along tended to complicate the forms of life whether regarded separately or collectively the same causes which have led to the evolution of the earths crust from the simple into the complex have simultaneously led to a parallel evolution of the life upon its surface in this case as in previous ones we see that the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous is consequent upon the universal principle that every active force produces more than one change  the deduction here drawn from the established truths of geology and the general laws of life gains immensely in weight on finding it to be in harmony with an induction drawn from direct experience just that divergence of many races from one race which we inferred must have been continually occurring during geologic time we know to have occurred during the prehistoric and historic periods in man and domestic animals and just that multiplication of effects which we concluded must have produced the first we see has produced the last single causes as famine pressure of population war have periodically led to further dispersions of mankind and of dependent creatures each such dispersion initiating new modifications new varieties of type whether all the human races be or be not derived from one stock philology makes it clear that whole groups of races now easily distinguishable from each other were originally one racethat the diffusion of one race into different climates and conditions of existence has produced many modified forms of it  similarly with domestic animals though in some casesas that of dogscommunity of origin will perhaps be disputed yet in other casesas that of the sheep or the cattle of our own countryit will not be questioned that local differences of climate food and treatment have transformed one original breed into numerous breeds now become so far distinct as to produce unstable hybrids moreover through the complications of effects flowing from single causes we here find what we before inferred not only an increase of general heterogeneity but also of special heterogeneity while of the divergent divisions and subdivisions of the human race many have undergone changes not constituting an advance while in some the type may have degraded in others it has become decidedly more heterogeneous the civilised european departs more widely from the vertebrate archetype than does the savage thus both the law and the cause of progress which from lack of evidence can be but hypothetically substantiated in respect of the earlier forms of life on our globe can be actually substantiated in respect of the latest forms  if the advance of man towards greater heterogeneity is traceable to the production of many effects by one cause still more clearly may the advance of society towards greater heterogeneity be so explained consider the growth of an industrial organisation when as must occasionally happen some individual of a tribe displays unusual aptitude for making an article of general usea weapon for instancewhich was before made by each man for himself there arises a tendency towards the differentiation of that individual into a maker of such weapon his companionswarriors and hunters all of themseverally feel the importance of having the best weapons that can be made and are therefore certain to offer strong inducements to this skilled individual to make weapons for them he on the other hand having not only an unusual faculty but an unusual liking for making such weapons the talent and the desire for any occupation being commonly associated is predisposed to fulfil these commissions on the offer of an adequate reward especially as his love of distinction is also gratified this first specialisation of function once commenced tends ever to become more decided on the side of the weaponmaker continued practice gives increased skillincreased superiority to his products on the side of his clients cessation of practice entails decreased skill thus the influences that determine this division of labour grow stronger in both ways and the incipient heterogeneity is on the average of cases likely to become permanent for that generation if no longer  observe now however that this process not only differentiates the social mass into two parts the one monopolising or almost monopolising the performance of a certain function and the other having lost the habit and in some measure the power of performing that function but it tends to imitate other differentiations the advance we have described implies the introduction of barterthe maker of weapons has on each occasion to be paid in such other articles as he agrees to take in exchange but he will not habitually take in exchange one kind of article but many kinds he does not want mats only or skins or fishing gear but he wants all these and on each occasion will bargain for the particular things he most needs what follows if among the members of the tribe there exist any slight differences of skill in the manufacture of these various things as there are almost sure to do the weaponmaker will take from each one the thing which that one excels in making he will exchange for mats with him whose mats are superior and will bargain for the fishing gear of whoever has the best but he who has bartered away his mats or his fishing gear must make other mats or fishing gear for himself and in so doing must in some degree further develop his aptitude thus it results that the small specialities of faculty possessed by various members of the tribe will tend to grow more decided if such transactions are from time to time repeated these specialisations may become appreciable and whether or not there ensue distinct differentiations of other individuals into makers of particular articles it is clear that incipient differentiations take place throughout the tribe the one original cause produces not only the first dual effect but a number of secondary dual effects like in kind but minor in degree this process of which traces may be seen among groups of schoolboys cannot well produce any lasting effects in an unsettled tribe but where there grows up a fixed and multiplying community these differentiations become permanent and increase with each generation a larger population involving a greater demand for every commodity intensifies the functional activity of each specialised person or class and this renders the specialisation more definite where it already exists and establishes it where it is nascent by increasing the pressure on the means of subsistence a larger population again augments these results seeing that each person is forced more and more to confine himself to that which he can do best and by which he can gain most this industrial progress by aiding future production opens the way for a further growth of population which reacts as before in all which the multiplication of effects is manifest presently under these same stimuli new occupations arise competing workers ever aiming to produce improved articles occasionally discover better processes or raw materials in weapons and cutting tools the substitution of bronze for stone entails upon him who first makes it a great increase of demandso great an increase that he presently finds all his time occupied in making the bronze for the articles he sells and is obliged to depute the fashioning of these to others and eventually the making of bronze thus gradually differentiated from a preexisting occupation becomes an occupation by itself  but now mark the ramified changes which follow this change bronze soon replaces stone not only in the articles it was first used for but in many othersin arms tools and utensils of various kinds and so affects the manufacture of these things further it affects the processes which these utensils subserve and the resulting productsmodifies buildings carvings dress personal decorations yet again it sets going sundry manufactures which were before impossible from lack of a material fit for the requisite tools and all these changes react on the peopleincrease their manipulative skill their intelligence their comfortrefine their habits and tastes thus the evolution of a homogeneous society into a heterogeneous one is clearly consequent on the general principle that many effects are produced by one cause  our limits will not allow us to follow out this process in its higher complications else might we show how the localisation of special industries in special parts of a kingdom as well as the minute subdivision of labour in the making of each commodity are similarly determined or turning to a somewhat different order of illustrations we might dwell on the multitudinous changesmaterial intellectual moralcaused by printing or the further extensive series of changes wrought by gunpowder but leaving the intermediate phases of social development let us take a few illustrations from its most recent and its passing phases to trace the effects of steampower in its manifold applications to mining navigation and manufactures of all kinds would carry us into unmanageable detail let us confine ourselves to the latest embodiment of steampowerthe locomotive engine  this as the proximate cause of our railway system has changed the face of the country the course of trade and the habits of the people consider first the complicated sets of changes that precede the making of every railwaythe provisional arrangements the meetings the registration the trial section the parliamentary survey the lithographed plans the books of reference the local deposits and notices the application to parliament the passing standingorders committee the first second and third readings each of which brief heads indicates a multiplicity of transactions and the development of sundry occupationsas those of engineers surveyors lithographers parliamentary agents sharebrokers and the creation of sundry othersas those of traffictakers referencetakers consider next the yet more marked changes implied in railway constructionthe cuttings embankings tunnellings diversions of roads the building of bridges and stations the laying down of ballast sleepers and rails the making of engines tenders carriages and waggons which processes acting upon numerous trades increase the importation of timber the quarrying of stone the manufacture of iron the mining of coal the burning of bricks institute a variety of special manufactures weekly advertised in the railway times and finally open the way to sundry new occupations as those of drivers stokers cleaners platelayers etc etc and then consider the changes more numerous and involved still which railways in action produce on the community at large the organisation of every business is more or less modified ease of communication makes it better to do directly what was before done by proxy agencies are established where previously they would not have paid goods are obtained from remote wholesale houses instead of near retail ones and commodities are used which distance once rendered inaccessible again the rapidity and small cost of carriage tend to specialise more than ever the industries of different districtsto confine each manufacture to the parts in which from local advantages it can be best carried on further the diminished cost of carriage facilitating distribution equalises prices and also on the average lowers prices thus bringing divers articles within the means of those before unable to buy them and so increasing their comforts and improving their habits at the same time the practice of travelling is immensely extended classes who never before thought of it take annual trips to the sea visit their distant relations make tours and so we are benefited in body feelings and intellect moreover the more prompt transmission of letters and of news produces further changesmakes the pulse of the nation faster yet more there arises a wide dissemination of cheap literature through railway bookstalls and of advertisements in railway carriages both of them aiding ulterior progress  and all the innumerable changes here briefly indicated are consequent on the invention of the locomotive engine the social organism has been rendered more heterogeneous in virtue of the many new occupations introduced and the many old ones further specialised prices in every place have been altered each trader has more or less modified his way of doing business and almost every person has been affected in his actions thoughts emotions  illustrations to the same effect might be indefinitely accumulated that every influence brought to bear upon society works multiplied effects and that increase of heterogeneity is due to this multiplication of effects may be seen in the history of every trade every custom every belief but it is needless to give additional evidence of this the only further fact demanding notice is that we here see still more clearly than ever the truth before pointed out that in proportion as the area on which any force expends itself becomes heterogeneous the results are in a yet higher degree multiplied in number and kind while among the primitive tribes to whom it was first known caoutchouc caused but a few changes among ourselves the changes have been so many and varied that the history of them occupies a volume4 upon the small homogeneous community inhabiting one of the hebrides the electric telegraph would produce were it used scarcely any results but in england the results it produces are multitudinous the comparatively simple organisation under which our ancestors lived five centuries ago could have undergone but few modifications from an event like the recent one at canton but now the legislative decision respecting it sets up many hundreds of complex modifications each of which will be the parent of numerous future ones  space permitting we could willingly have pursued the argument in relation to all the subtler results of civilisation as before we showed that the law of progress to which the organic and inorganic worlds conform is also conformed to by language sculpture music etc so might we here show that the cause which we have hitherto found to determine progress holds in these cases also we might demonstrate in detail how in science an advance of one division presently advances other divisionshow astronomy has been immensely forwarded by discoveries in optics while other optical discoveries have initiated microscopic anatomy and greatly aided the growth of physiologyhow chemistry has indirectly increased our knowledge of electricity magnetism biology geologyhow electricity has reacted on chemistry and magnetism developed our views of light and heat and disclosed sundry laws of nervous action  in literature the same truth might be exhibited in the manifold effects of the primitive mysteryplay not only as originating the modern drama but as affecting through it other kinds of poetry and fiction or in the still multiplying forms of periodical literature that have descended from the first newspaper and which have severally acted and reacted on other forms of literature and on each other the influence which a new school of paintingas that of the preraffaelitesexercises upon other schools the hints which all kinds of pictorial art are deriving from photography the complex results of new critical doctrines as those of mr ruskin might severally be dwelt upon as displaying the like multiplication of effects but it would needlessly tax the readers patience to pursue in their many ramifications these various changes here become so involved and subtle as to be followed with some difficulty  without further evidence we venture to think our case is made out the imperfections of statement which brevity has necessitated do not we believe militate against the propositions laid down the qualifications here and there demanded would not if made affect the inferences though in one instance where sufficient evidence is not attainable we have been unable to show that the law of progress applies yet there is high probability that the same generalisation holds which holds throughout the rest of creation though in tracing the genesis of progress we have frequently spoken of complex causes as if they were simple ones it still remains true that such causes are far less complex than their results detailed criticisms cannot affect our main position endless facts go to show that every kind of progress is from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous and that it is so because each change is followed by many changes and it is significant that where the facts are most accessible and abundant there are these truths most manifest  however to avoid committing ourselves to more than is yet proved we must be content with saying that such are the law and the cause of all progress that is known to us should the nebular hypothesis ever be established then it will become manifest that the universe at large like every organism was once homogeneous that as a whole and in every detail it has unceasingly advanced towards greater heterogeneity and that its heterogeneity is still increasing it will be seen that as in each event of today so from the beginning the decomposition of every expended force into several forces has been perpetually producing a higher complication that the increase of heterogeneity so brought about is still going on and must continue to go on and that thus progress is not an accident not a thing within human control but a beneficent necessity  a few words must be added on the ontological bearings of our argument probably not a few will conclude that here is an attempted solution of the great questions with which philosophy in all ages has perplexed itself let none thus deceive themselves only such as know not the scope and the limits of science can fall into so grave an error the foregoing generalisations apply not to the genesis of things in themselves but to their genesis as manifested to the human consciousness after all that has been said the ultimate mystery remains just as it was the explanation of that which is explicable does but bring out into greater clearness the inexplicableness of that which remains behind however we may succeed in reducing the equation to its lowest terms we are not thereby enabled to determine the unknown quantity on the contrary it only becomes more manifest that the unknown quantity can never be found  little as it seems to do so fearless inquiry tends continually to give a firmer basis to all true religion the timid sectarian alarmed at the progress of knowledge obliged to abandon one by one the superstitions of his ancestors and daily finding his cherished beliefs more and more shaken secretly fears that all things may some day be explained and has a corresponding dread of science thus evincing the profoundest of all infidelitythe fear lest the truth be bad on the other hand the sincere man of science content to follow wherever the evidence leads him becomes by each new inquiry more profoundly convinced that the universe is an insoluble problem alike in the external and the internal worlds he sees himself in the midst of perpetual changes of which he can discover neither the beginning nor the end if tracing back the evolution of things he allows himself to entertain the hypothesis that all matter once existed in a diffused form he finds it utterly impossible to conceive how this came to be so and equally if he speculates on the future he can assign no limit to the grand succession of phenomena ever unfolding themselves before him on the other hand if he looks inward he perceives that both terminations of the thread of consciousness are beyond his grasp he cannot remember when or how consciousness commenced and he cannot examine the consciousness that at any moment exists for only a state of consciousness that is already past can become the object of thought and never one which is passing  when again he turns from the succession of phenomena external or internal to their essential nature he is equally at fault though he may succeed in resolving all properties of objects into manifestations of force he is not thereby enabled to realise what force is but finds on the contrary that the more he thinks about it the more he is baffled similarly though analysis of mental actions may finally bring him down to sensations as the original materials out of which all thought is woven he is none the forwarder for he cannot in the least comprehend sensationcannot even conceive how sensation is possible inward and outward things he thus discovers to be alike inscrutable in their ultimate genesis and nature he sees that the materialist and spiritualist controversy is a mere war of words the disputants being equally absurdeach believing he understands that which it is impossible for any man to understand in all directions his investigations eventually bring him face to face with the unknowable and he ever more clearly perceives it to be the unknowable he learns at once the greatness and the littleness of human intellectits power in dealing with all that comes within the range of experience its impotence in dealing with all that transcends experience he feels with a vividness which no others can the utter incomprehensibleness of the simplest fact considered in itself he alone truly sees that absolute knowledge is impossible he alone knows that under all things there lies an impenetrable mystery  1 westminster review april 1857  2 for detailed proof of these assertions see essay on manners and fashion  3 the idea that the nebular hypothesis has been disproved because what were thought to be existing nebulæ have been resolved into clusters of stars is almost beneath notice a priori it was highly improbable if not impossible that nebulous masses should still remain uncondensed while others have been condensed millions of years ago  4 personal narrative of the origin of the caoutchouc or indiarubber manufacture in england by thomas hancock     on manners and fashion1   whoever has studied the physiognomy of political meetings cannot fail to have remarked a connection between democratic opinions and peculiarities of costume at a chartist demonstration a lecture on socialism or a soirée of the friends of italy there will be seen many among the audience and a still larger ratio among the speakers who get themselves up in a style more or less unusual one gentleman on the platform divides his hair down the centre instead of on one side another brushes it back off the forehead in the fashion known as bringing out the intellect a third has so long forsworn the scissors that his locks sweep his shoulders a considerable sprinkling of moustaches may be observed here and there an imperial and occasionally some courageous breaker of conventions exhibits a fullgrown beard2 this nonconformity in hair is countenanced by various nonconformities in dress shown by others of the assemblage bare necks shirtcollars à la byron waistcoats cut quaker fashion wonderfully shaggy great coats numerous oddities in form and colour destroy the monotony usual in crowds even those exhibiting no conspicuous peculiarity frequently indicate by something in the pattern or makeup of their clothes that they pay small regard to what their tailors tell them about the prevailing taste and when the gathering breaks up the varieties of headgear displayedthe number of caps and the abundance of felt hatssuffice to prove that were the world at large likeminded the black cylinders which tyrannise over us would soon be deposed  the foreign correspondence of our daily press shows that this relationship between political discontent and the disregard of customs exists on the continent also red republicanism has always been distinguished by its hirsuteness the authorities of prussia austria and italy alike recognise certain forms of hat as indicative of disaffection and fulminate against them accordingly in some places the wearer of a blouse runs a risk of being classed among the suspects and in others he who would avoid the bureau of police must beware how he goes out in any but the ordinary colours thus democracy abroad as at home tends towards personal singularity  nor is this association of characteristics peculiar to modern times or to reformers of the state it has always existed and it has been manifested as much in religious agitations as in political ones along with dissent from the chief established opinions and arrangements there has ever been some dissent from the customary social practices the puritans disapproving of the long curls of the cavaliers as of their principles cut their own hair short and so gained the name of roundheads the marked religious nonconformity of the quakers was accompanied by an equallymarked nonconformity of mannersin attire in speech in salutation the early moravians not only believed differently but at the same time dressed differently and lived differently from their fellow christians  that the association between political independence and independence of personal conduct is not a phenomenon of today only we may see alike in the appearance of franklin at the french court in plain clothes and in the white hats worn by the last generation of radicals originality of nature is sure to show itself in more ways than one the mention of george foxs suit of leather or pestalozzis school name harry oddity will at once suggest the remembrance that men who have in great things diverged from the beaten track have frequently done so in small things likewise minor illustrations of this truth may be gathered in almost every circle we believe that whoever will number up his reforming and rationalist acquaintances will find among them more than the usual proportion of those who in dress or behaviour exhibit some degree of what the world calls eccentricity  if it be a fact that men of revolutionary aims in politics or religion are commonly revolutionists in custom also it is not less a fact that those whose office it is to uphold established arrangements in state and church are also those who most adhere to the social forms and observances bequeathed to us by past generations practices elsewhere extinct still linger about the headquarters of government the monarch still gives assent to acts of parliament in the old french of the normans and norman french terms are still used in law wigs such as those we see depicted in old portraits may yet be found on the heads of judges and barristers the beefeaters at the tower wear the costume of henry viiths bodyguard the university dress of the present year varies but little from that worn soon after the reformation the claretcoloured coat kneebreeches lace shirt frills ruffles white silk stockings and buckled shoes which once formed the usual attire of a gentleman still survive as the courtdress and it need scarcely be said that at levées and drawingrooms the ceremonies are prescribed with an exactness and enforced with a rigour not elsewhere to be found  can we consider these two series of coincidences as accidental and unmeaning must we not rather conclude that some necessary relationship obtains between them are there not such things as a constitutional conservatism and a constitutional tendency to change is there not a class which clings to the old in all things and another class so in love with progress as often to mistake novelty for improvement do we not find some men ready to bow to established authority of whatever kind while others demand of every such authority its reason and reject it if it fails to justify itself and must not the minds thus contrasted tend to become respectively conformist and nonconformist not only in politics and religion but in other things submission whether to a government to the dogmas of ecclesiastics or to that code of behaviour which society at large has set up is essentially of the same nature and the sentiment which induces resistance to the despotism of rulers civil or spiritual likewise induces resistance to the despotism of the worlds opinion look at them fundamentally and all enactments alike of the legislature the consistory and the saloonall regulations formal or virtual have a common character they are all limitations of mens freedom do thisrefrain from that are the blank formulas into which they may all be written and in each case the understanding is that obedience will bring approbation here and paradise hereafter while disobedience will entail imprisonment or sending to coventry or eternal torments as the case may be and if restraints however named and through whatever apparatus of means exercised are one in their action upon men it must happen that those who are patient under one kind of restraint are likely to be patient under another and conversely that those impatient of restraint in general will on the average tend to show their impatience in all directions  that law religion and manners are thus relatedthat their respective kinds of operation come under one generalisationthat they have in certain contrasted characteristics of men a common support and a common dangerwill however be most clearly seen on discovering that they have a common origin little as from present appearances we should suppose it we shall yet find that at first the control of religion the control of laws and the control of manners were all one control however incredible it may now seem we believe it to be demonstrable that the rules of etiquette the provisions of the statutebook and the commands of the decalogue have grown from the same root if we go far enough back into the ages of primeval fetishism it becomes manifest that originally deity chief and master of the ceremonies were identical to make good these positions and to show their bearing on what is to follow it will be necessary here to traverse ground that is in part somewhat beaten and at first sight irrelevant to our topic we will pass over it as quickly as consists with the exigencies of the argument                                       that the earliest social aggregations were ruled solely by the will of the strong man few dispute that from the strong man proceeded not only monarchy but the conception of a god few admit much as carlyle and others have said in evidence of it if however those who are unable to believe this will lay aside the ideas of god and man in which they have been educated and study the aboriginal ideas of them they will at least see some probability in the hypothesis let them remember that before experience had yet taught men to distinguish between the possible and the impossible and while they were ready on the slightest suggestion to ascribe unknown powers to any object and make a fetish of it their conceptions of humanity and its capacities were necessarily vague and without specific limits the man who by unusual strength or cunning achieved something that others had failed to achieve or something which they did not understand was considered by them as differing from themselves and as we see in the belief of some polynesians that only their chiefs have souls or in that of the ancient peruvians that their nobles were divine by birth the ascribed difference was apt to be not one of degree only but one of kind  let them remember next how gross were the notions of god or rather of gods prevalent during the same era and afterwardshow concretely gods were conceived as men of specific aspects dressed in specific wayshow their names were literally the strong the destroyer the powerful onehow according to the scandinavian mythology the sacred duty of bloodrevenge was acted on by the gods themselvesand how they were not only human in their vindictiveness their cruelty and their quarrels with each other but were supposed to have amours on earth and to consume the viands placed on their altars add to which that in various mythologies greek scandinavian and others the oldest beings are giants that according to a traditional genealogy the gods demigods and in some cases men are descended from these after the human fashion and that while in the east we hear of sons of god who saw the daughters of men that they were fair the teutonic myths tell of unions between the sons of men and the daughters of the gods  let them remember too that at first the idea of death differed widely from that which we have that there are still tribes who on the decease of one of their number attempt to make the corpse stand and put food into his mouth that the peruvians had feasts at which the mummies of their dead incas presided when as prescott says they paid attention to these insensible remains as if they were instinct with life that among the fejees it is believed that every enemy has to be killed twice that the eastern pagans give extension and figure to the soul and attribute to it all the same substances both solid and liquid of which our bodies are composed and that it is the custom among most barbarous races to bury food weapons and trinkets along with the dead body under the manifest belief that it will presently need them  lastly let them remember that the other world as originally conceived is simply some distant part of this worldsome elysian fields some happy huntingground accessible even to the living and to which after death men travel in anticipation of a life analogous in general character to that which they led before then coordinating these general factsthe ascription of unknown powers to chiefs and medicine men the belief in deities having human forms passions and behaviour the imperfect comprehension of death as distinguished from life and the proximity of the future abode to the present both in position and characterlet them reflect whether they do not almost unavoidably suggest the conclusion that the aboriginal god is the dead chief the chief not dead in our sense but gone away carrying with him food and weapons to some rumoured region of plenty some promised land whither he had long intended to lead his followers and whence he will presently return to fetch them  this hypothesis once entertained is seen to harmonise with all primitive ideas and practices the sons of the deified chief reigning after him it necessarily happens that all early kings are held descendants of the gods and the fact that alike in assyria egypt among the jews phoenicians and ancient britons kings names were formed out of the names of the gods is fully explained the genesis of polytheism out of fetishism by the successive migrations of the race of godkings to the other worlda genesis illustrated in the greek mythology alike by the precise genealogy of the deities and by the specifically asserted apotheosis of the later onestends further to bear it out it explains the fact that in the old creeds as in the still extant creed of the otaheitans every family has its guardian spirit who is supposed to be one of their departed relatives and that they sacrifice to these as minor godsa practice still pursued by the chinese and even by the russians it is perfectly congruous with the grecian myths concerning the wars of the gods with the titans and their final usurpation and it similarly agrees with the fact that among the teutonic gods proper was one freir who came among them by adoption but was born among the vanes a somewhat mysterious other dynasty of gods who had been conquered and superseded by the stronger and more warlike odin dynasty it harmonises too with the belief that there are different gods to different territories and nations as there were different chiefs that these gods contend for supremacy as chiefs do and it gives meaning to the boast of neighbouring tribesour god is greater than your god it is confirmed by the notion universally current in early times that the gods come from this other abode in which they commonly live and appear among menspeak to them help them punish them and remembering this it becomes manifest that the prayers put up by primitive peoples to their gods for aid in battle are meant literallythat their gods are expected to come back from the other kingdom they are reigning over and once more fight the old enemies they had before warred against so implacably and it needs but to name the iliad to remind every one how thoroughly they believed the expectation fulfilled  all government then being originally that of the strong man who has become a fetish by some manifestation of superiority there arises at his deathhis supposed departure on a long projected expedition in which he is accompanied by his slaves and concubines sacrificed at his tombtheir arises then the incipient division of religious from political control of civil rule from spiritual his son becomes deputed chief during his absence his authority is cited as that by which his son acts his vengeance is invoked on all who disobey his son and his commands as previously known or as asserted by his son become the germ of a moral code a fact we shall the more clearly perceive if we remember that early moral codes inculcate mainly the virtues of the warrior and the duty of exterminating some neighbouring tribe whose existence is an offence to the deity  from this point onwards these two kinds of authority at first complicated together as those of principal and agent become slowly more and more distinct as experience accumulates and ideas of causation grow more precise kings lose their supernatural attributes and instead of godking become goddescended king godappointed king the lords anointed the vicegerent of heaven ruler reigning by divine right the old theory however long clings to men in feeling after it has disappeared in name and such divinity doth hedge a king that even now many on first seeing one feel a secret surprise at finding him an ordinary sample of humanity the sacredness attaching to royalty attaches afterwards to its appended institutionsto legislatures to laws legal and illegal are synonymous with right and wrong the authority of parliament is held unlimited and a lingering faith in governmental power continually generates unfounded hopes from its enactments political scepticism however having destroyed the divine prestige of royalty goes on ever increasing and promises ultimately to reduce the state to a purely secular institution whose regulations are limited in their sphere and have no other authority than the general will meanwhile the religious control has been little by little separating itself from the civil both in its essence and in its forms while from the godking of the savage have arisen in one direction secular rulers who age by age have been losing the sacred attributes men ascribed to them there has arisen in another direction the conception of a deity who at first human in all things has been gradually losing human materiality human form human passions human modes of action until now anthropomorphism has become a reproach  along with this wide divergence in mens ideas of the divine and civil ruler has been taking place a corresponding divergence in the codes of conduct respectively proceeding from them while the king was a deputygoda governor such as the jews looked for in the messiaha governor considered as the czar still is our god upon earthit of course followed that his commands were the supreme rules but as men ceased to believe in his supernatural origin and nature his commands ceased to be the highest and there arose a distinction between the regulations made by him and the regulations handed down from the old godkings who were rendered ever more sacred by time and the accumulation of myths hence came respectively law and morality the one growing ever more concrete the other more abstract the authority of the one ever on the decrease that of the other ever on the increase originally the same but now placed daily in more marked antagonism  simultaneously there has been going on a separation of the institutions administering these two codes of conduct while they were yet one of course church and state were one the king was archpriest not nominally but reallyalike the giver of new commands and the chief interpreter of the old commands and the deputypriests coming out of his family were thus simply expounders of the dictates of their ancestry at first as recollected and afterwards as ascertained by professed interviews with them this unionwhich still existed practically during the middle ages when the authority of kings was mixed up with the authority of the pope when there were bishoprulers having all the powers of feudal lords and when priests punished by penanceshas been step by step becoming less close though monarchs are still defenders of the faith and ecclesiastical chiefs they are but nominally such though bishops still have civil power it is not what they once had protestantism shook loose the bonds of union dissent has long been busy in organising a mechanism for the exercise of religious control wholly independent of law in america a separate organisation for that purpose already exists and if anything is to be hoped from the antistatechurch associationor as it has been newly named the society for the liberation of religion from state patronage and controlwe shall presently have a separate organisation here also  thus alike in authority in essence and in form political and spiritual rule have been ever more widely diverging from the same root that increasing division of labour which marks the progress of society in other things marks it also in this separation of government into civil and religious and if we observe how the morality which forms the substance of religions in general is beginning to be purified from the associated creeds we may anticipate that this division will be ultimately carried much further  passing now to the third species of controlthat of mannerswe shall find that this too while it had a common genesis with the others has gradually come to have a distinct sphere and a special embodiment among early aggregations of men before yet social observances existed the sole forms of courtesy known were the signs of submission to the strong man as the sole law was his will and the sole religion the awe of his supposed supernaturalness originally ceremonies were modes of behaviour to the godking our commonest titles have been derived from his names and all salutations were primarily worship paid to him let us trace out these truths in detail beginning with titles  the fact already noticed that the names of early kings among divers races are formed by the addition of certain syllables to the names of their godswhich certain syllables like our mac and fitz probably mean son of or descended fromat once gives meaning to the term father as a divine title and when we read in selden that the composition out of these names of deities was not only proper to kings their grandes and more honourable subjects no doubt members of the royal race had sometimes the like we see how the term father properly used by these also and by their multiplying descendants came to be a title used by the people in general and it is significant as bearing on this point that among the most barbarous nation in europe where belief in the divine nature of the ruler still lingers father in this higher sense is still a regal distinction when again we remember how the divinity at first ascribed to kings was not a complimentary fiction but a supposed fact and how further under the fetish philosophy the celestial bodies are believed to be personages who once lived among men we see that the appellations of oriental rulers brother to the sun etc were probably once expressive of a genuine belief and have simply like many other things continued in use after all meaning has gone out of them we way infer too that the titles god lord divinity were given to primitive rulers literallythat the nostra divinitas applied to the roman emperors and the various sacred designations that have been borne by monarchs down to the still extant phrase our lord the king are the dead and dying forms of what were once living facts from these names god father lord divinity originally belonging to the godking and afterwards to god and the king the derivation of our commonest titles of respect is clearly traceable  there is reason to think that these titles were originally proper names not only do we see among the egyptians where pharaoh was synonymous with king and among the romans where to be cæsar meant to be emperor that the proper names of the greatest men were transferred to their successors and so became class names but in the scandinavian mythology we may trace a human title of honour up to the proper name of a divine personage in anglosaxon bealdor or baldor means lord and balder is the name of the favourite of odins sonsthe gods who with him constitute the teutonic pantheon how these names of honour became general is easily understood the relatives of the primitive kingsthe grandees described by selden as having names formed on those of the gods and shown by this to be members of the divine racenecessarily shared in the epithets such as lord descriptive of superhuman relationships and nature their evermultiplying offspring inheriting these gradually rendered them comparatively common and then they came to be applied to every man of power partly from the fact that in these early days when men conceived divinity simply as a stronger kind of humanity great persons could be called by divine epithets with but little exaggeration partly from the fact that the unusually potent were apt to be considered as unrecognised or illegitimate descendants of the strong the destroyer the powerful one and partly also from compliment and the desire to propitiate  progressively as superstition diminished this last became the sole cause and if we remember that it is the nature of compliment as we daily hear it to attribute more than is duethat in the constantly widening application of esquire in the perpetual repetition of your honour by the fawning irishman and in the use of the name gentleman to any coalheaver or dustman by the lower classes of london we have current examples of the depreciation of titles consequent on complimentand that in barbarous times when the wish to propitiate was stronger than now this effect must have been greater we shall see that there naturally arose an extensive misuse of all early distinctions hence the facts that the jews called herod a god that father in its higher sense was a term used among them by servants to masters that lord was applicable to any person of worth and power hence too the fact that in the later periods of the roman empire every man saluted his neighbour as dominus and rex  but it is in the titles of the middle ages and in the growth of our modern ones out of them that the process is most clearly seen herr don signior seigneur sennor were all originally names of rulersof feudal lords by the complimentary use of these names to all who could on any pretence be supposed to merit them and by successive degradations of them from each step in the descent to a still lower one they have come to be common forms of address at first the phrase in which a serf accosted his despotic chief mein herr is now familiarly applied in germany to ordinary people the spanish title don once proper to noblemen and gentlemen only is now accorded to all classes so too is it with signior in italy seigneur and monseigneur by contraction in sieur and monsieur have produced the term of respect claimed by every frenchman and whether sire be or be not a like contraction of signior it is clear that as it was borne by sundry of the ancient feudal lords of france who as selden says affected rather to bee stiled by the name of sire than baron as le sire de montmorencie le sire de beauieu and the like and as it has been commonly used to monarchs our word sir which is derived from it originally meant lord or king thus too is it with feminine titles lady which according to horne tooke means exalted and was at first given only to the few is now given to all women of education dame once an honourable name to which in old books we find the epithets of highborn and stately affixed has now by repeated widenings of its application become relatively a term of contempt and if we trace the compound of this ma dame through its contractionsmadam maam mam mum we find that the yesm of sally to her mistress is originally equivalent to yes my exalted or yes your highness throughout therefore the genesis of words of honour has been the same just as with the jews and with the romans has it been with the modern europeans tracing these everyday names to their primitive significations of lord and king and remembering that in aboriginal societies these were applied only to the gods and their descendants we arrive at the conclusion that our familiar sir and monsieur are in their primary and expanded meanings terms of adoration  further to illustrate this gradual depreciation of titles and to confirm the inference drawn it may be well to notice in passing that the oldest of them have as might be expected been depreciated to the greatest extent thus mastera word proved by its derivation and by the similarity of the connate words in other languages fr maître for master russ master dan meester ger meister to have been one of the earliest in use for expressing lordshiphas now become applicable to children only and under the modification of mister to persons next above the labourer again knighthood the oldest kind of dignity is also the lowest and knight bachelor which is the lowest order of knighthood is more ancient than any other of the orders similarly too with the peerage baron is alike the earliest and least elevated of its divisions this continual degradation of all names of honour has from time to time made it requisite to introduce new ones having that distinguishing effect which the originals had lost by generality of use just as our habit of misapplying superlatives has by gradually destroying their force entailed the need for fresh ones and if within the last thousand years this process has produced effects thus marked we may readily conceive how during previous thousands the titles of gods and demigods came to be used to all persons exercising power as they have since come to be used to persons of respectability  if from names of honour we turn to phrases of honour we find similar facts the oriental styles of address applied to ordinary peoplei am your slave all i have is yours i am your sacrificeattribute to the individual spoken to the same greatness that monsieur and my lord do they ascribe to him the character of an allpowerful ruler so immeasurably superior to the speaker as to be his owner so likewise with the polish expressions of respecti throw myself under your feet i kiss your feet in our now meaningless subscription to a formal letteryour most obedient servantthe same thing is visible nay even in the familiar signature yours faithfully the yours if interpreted as originally meant is the expression of a slave to his master  all these dead forms were once living embodiments of factwere primarily the genuine indications of that submission to authority which they verbally assert were afterwards naturally used by the weak and cowardly to propitiate those above them gradually grew to be considered the due of such and by a continually wider misuse have lost their meanings as sir and master have done that like titles they were in the beginning used only to the godking is indicated by the fact that like titles they were subsequently used in common to god and the king religious worship has ever largely consisted of professions of obedience of being gods servants of belonging to him to do what he will with like titles therefore these common phrases of honour had a devotional origin  perhaps however it is in the use of the word you as a singular pronoun that the popularising of what were once supreme distinctions is most markedly illustrated this speaking of a single individual in the plural was originally an honour given only to the highestwas the reciprocal of the imperial we assumed by such yet now by being applied to successively lower and lower classes it has become all but universal only by one sect of christians and in a few secluded districts is the primitive thou still used and the you in becoming common to all ranks has simultaneously lost every vestige of the honour once attaching to it  but the genesis of manners out of forms of allegiance and worship is above all shown in mens modes of salutation note first the significance of the word among the romans the salutatio was a daily homage paid by clients and inferiors to superiors this was alike the case with civilians and in the army the very derivation of our word therefore is suggestive of submission passing to particular forms of obeisance mark the word again let us begin with the eastern one of baring the feet this was primarily a mark of reverence alike to a god and a king the act of moses before the burning bush and the practice of mahometans who are sworn on the koran with their shoes off exemplify the one employment of it the custom of the persians who remove their shoes on entering the presence of their monarch exemplifies the other as usual however this homage paid next to inferior rulers has descended from grade to grade in india it is a common mark of respect a polite man in turkey always leaves his shoes at the door while the lower orders of turks never enter the presence of their superiors but in their stockings and in japan this baring of the feet is an ordinary salutation of man to man  take another case selden describing the ceremonies of the romans saysfor whereas it was usual either to kiss the images of their gods or adoring them to stand somewhat off before them solemnly moving the right hand to the lips and then casting it as if they had cast kisses to turne the body on the same hand which was the right forme of adoration it grew also by custom first that the emperors being next to deities and by some accounted as deities had the like done to them in acknowledgment of their greatness if now we call to mind the awkward salute of a village schoolboy made by putting his open hand up to his face and describing a semicircle with his forearm and if we remember that the salute thus used as a form of reverence in country districts is most likely a remnant of the feudal times we shall see reason for thinking that our common wave of the hand to a friend across the street represents what was primarily a devotional act  similarly have originated all forms of respect depending upon inclinations of the body entire prostration is the aboriginal sign of submission the passage of scripture thou hast put all under his feet and that other one so suggestive in its anthropomorphism the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool imply what the assyrian sculptures fully bear out that it was the practice of the ancient godkings of the east to trample upon the conquered and when we bear in mind that there are existing savages who signify submission by placing the neck under the foot of the person submitted to it becomes obvious that all prostration especially when accompanied by kissing the foot expressed a willingness to be trodden uponwas an attempt to mitigate wrath by saying in signs tread on me if you will remembering further that kissing the foot as of the pope and of a saints statue still continues in europe to be a mark of extreme reverence that prostration to feudal lords was once general and that its disappearance must have taken place not abruptly but by gradual modification into something else we have ground for deriving from these deepest of humiliations all inclinations of respect especially as the transition is traceable the reverence of a russian serf who bends his head to the ground and the salaam of the hindoo are abridged prostrations a bow is a short salaam a nod is a short bow  should any hesitate to admit this conclusion then perhaps on being reminded that the lowest of these obeisances are common where the submission is most abject that among ourselves the profundity of the bow marks the amount of respect and lastly that the bow is even now used devotionally in our churchesby catholics to their altars and by protestants at the name of christthey will see sufficient evidence for thinking that this salutation also was originally worship  the same may be said too of the curtsy or courtesy as it is otherwise written its derivation from courtoisie courteousness that is behaviour like that at court at once shows that it was primarily the reverence paid to a monarch and if we call to mind that falling upon the knees or upon one knee has been a common obeisance of subjects to rulers that in ancient manuscripts and tapestries servants are depicted as assuming this attitude while offering the dishes to their masters at table and that this same attitude is assumed towards our own queen at every presentation we may infer what the character of the curtsy itself suggests that it is an abridged act of kneeling as the word has been contracted from courtoisie into curtsy so the motion has been contracted from a placing of the knee on the floor to a lowering of the knee towards the floor moreover when we compare the curtsy of a lady with the awkward one a peasant girl makes which if continued would bring her down on both knees we may see in this last a remnant of that greater reverence required of serfs and when from considering that simple kneeling of the west still represented by the curtsy we pass eastward and note the attitude of the mahometan worshipper who not only kneels but bows his head to the ground we may infer that the curtsy also is an evanescent form of the aboriginal prostration  in further evidence of this it may be remarked that there has but recently disappeared from the salutations of men an action having the same proximate derivation with the curtsy that backward sweep of the foot with which the conventional stagesailor accompanies his bowa movement which prevailed generally in past generations when a bow and a scrape went together and which within the memory of living persons was made by boys to their schoolmaster with the effect of wearing a hole in the flooris pretty clearly a preliminary to going on one knee a motion so ungainly could never have been intentionally introduced even if the artificial introduction of obeisances were possible hence we must regard it as the remnant of something antecedent and that this something antecedent was humiliating may be inferred from the phrase scraping an acquaintance which being used to denote the gaining of favour by obsequiousness implies that the scrape was considered a mark of servilitythat is of serfility  consider again the uncovering of the head almost everywhere this has been a sign of reverence alike in temples and before potentates and it yet preserves among us some of its original meaning whether it rains hails or shines you must keep your head bare while speaking to the monarch and on no plea may you remain covered in a place of worship as usual however this ceremony at first a submission to gods and kings has become in process of time a common civility once an acknowledgment of anothers unlimited supremacy the removal of the hat is now a salute accorded to very ordinary persons and that uncovering originally reserved for entrance into the house of god good manners now dictates on entrance into the house of a common labourer  standing too as a mark of respect has undergone like extensions in its application shown by the practice in our churches to be intermediate between the humiliation signified by kneeling and the selfrespect which sitting implies and used at courts as a form of homage when more active demonstrations of it have been made this posture is now employed in daily life to show consideration as seen alike in the attitude of a servant before a master and in that rising which politeness prescribes on the entrance of a visitor  many other threads of evidence might have been woven into our argument as for example the significant fact that if we trace back our still existing law of primogenitureif we consider it as displayed by scottish clans in which not only ownership but government devolved from the beginning on the eldest son of the eldestif we look further back and observe that the old titles of lordship signor seigneur sennor sire sieur all originally mean senior or elderif we go eastward and find that sheick has a like derivation and that the oriental names for priests as pir for instance are literally interpreted old manif we note in hebrew records how primeval is the ascribed superiority of the firstborn how great the authority of elders and how sacred the memory of patriarchsand if then we remember that among divine titles are ancient of days and father of gods and menwe see how completely these facts harmonise with the hypothesis that the aboriginal god is the first man sufficiently great to become a tradition the earliest whose power and deeds made him remembered that hence antiquity unavoidably became associated with superiority and age with nearness in blood to the powerful one that so there naturally arose that domination of the eldest which characterises all history and that theory of human degeneracy which even yet survives  we might further dwell on the facts that lord signifies highborn or as the same root gives a word meaning heaven possibly heavenborn that before it became common sir or sire as well as father was the distinction of a priest that worship originally worthshipa term of respect that has been used commonly as well as to magistratesis also our term for the act of attributing greatness or worth to the deity so that to ascribe worthship to a man is to worship him we might make much of the evidence that all early governments are more or less distinctly theocratic and that among ancient eastern nations even the commonest forms and customs appear to have been influenced by religion we might enforce our argument respecting the derivation of ceremonies by tracing out the aboriginal obeisance made by putting dust on the head which probably symbolises putting the head in the dust by affiliating the practice prevailing among certain tribes of doing another honour by presenting him with a portion of hair torn from the headan act which seems tantamount to saying i am your slave by investigating the oriental custom of giving to a visitor any object he speaks of admiringly which is pretty clearly a carrying out of the compliment all i have is yours  without enlarging however on these and many minor facts we venture to think that the evidence already assigned is sufficient to justify our position had the proofs been few or of one kind little faith could have been placed in the inference but numerous as they are alike in the case of titles in that of complimentary phrases and in that of salutessimilar and simultaneous too as the process of depreciation has been in all of these the evidences become strong by mutual confirmation and when we recollect also that not only have the results of this process been visible in various nations and in all times but that they are occurring among ourselves at the present moment and that the causes assigned for previous depreciations may be seen daily working out other oneswhen we recollect this it becomes scarcely possible to doubt that the process has been as alleged and that our ordinary words acts and phrases of civility were originally acknowledgments of submission to anothers omnipotence  thus the general doctrine that all kinds of government exercised over men were at first one governmentthat the political the religious and the ceremonial forms of control are divergent branches of a general and once indivisible controlbegins to look tenable when with the above facts fresh in mind we read primitive records and find that there were giants in those dayswhen we remember that in eastern traditions nimrod among others figures in all the characters of giant king and divinitywhen we turn to the sculptures exhumed by mr layard and contemplating in them the effigies of kings driving over enemies trampling on prisoners and adored by prostrate slaves then observe how their actions correspond to the primitive names for the divinity the strong the destroyer the powerful onewhen we find that the earliest temples were also the residences of the kingsand when lastly we discover that among races of men still living there are current superstitions analogous to those which old records and old buildings indicate we begin to realise the probability of the hypothesis that has been set forth  going back in imagination to the remote era when mens theories of things were yet unformed and conceiving to ourselves the conquering chief as dimly figured in ancient myths and poems and ruins we may see that all rules of conduct whatever spring from his will alike legislator and judge all quarrels among his subjects are decided by him and his words become the law awe of him is the incipient religion and his maxims furnish its first precepts submission is made to him in the forms he prescribes and these give birth to manners from the first time develops political allegiance and the administration of justice from the second the worship of a being whose personality becomes ever more vague and the inculcation of precepts ever more abstract from the third forms of honour and the rules of etiquette  in conformity with the law of evolution of all organised bodies that general functions are gradually separated into the special functions constituting them there have grown up in the social organism for the better performance of the governmental office an apparatus of lawcourts judges and barristers a national church with its bishops and priests and a system of caste titles and ceremonies administered by society at large by the first overt aggressions are cognised and punished by the second the disposition to commit such aggressions is in some degree checked by the third those minor breaches of good conduct which the others do not notice are denounced and chastised law and religion control behaviour in its essentials manners control it in its details for regulating those daily actions which are too numerous and too unimportant to be officially directed there comes into play this subtler set of restraints and when we consider what these restraints arewhen we analyse the words and phrases and salutes employed we see that in origin as in effect the system is a setting up of temporary governments between all men who come in contact for the purpose of better managing the intercourse between them                                       from the proposition that these several kinds of government are essentially one both in genesis and function may be deduced several important corollaries directly bearing on our special topic  let us first notice that there is not only a common origin and office for all forms of rule but a common necessity for them the aboriginal man coming fresh from the killing of bears and from lying in ambush for his enemy has by the necessities of his condition a nature requiring to be curbed in its every impulse alike in war and in the chase his daily discipline has been that of sacrificing other creatures to his own needs and passions his character bequeathed to him by ancestors who led similar lives is moulded by this disciplineis fitted to this existence the unlimited selfishness the love of inflicting pain the bloodthirstiness thus kept active he brings with him into the social state these dispositions put him in constant danger of conflict with his equally savage neighbour in small things as in great in words as in deeds he is aggressive and is hourly liable to the aggressions of others like natured only therefore by the most rigorous control exercised over all actions can the primitive unions of men be maintained there must be a ruler strong remorseless and of indomitable will there must be a creed terrible in its threats to the disobedient and there must be the most servile submission of all inferiors to superiors the law must be cruel the religion must be stern the ceremonies must be strict  the coordinate necessity for these several kinds of restraint might be largely illustrated from history were there space suffice it to point out that where the civil power has been weak the multiplication of thieves assassins and banditti has indicated the approach of social dissolution that when from the corruptness of its ministry religion has lost its influence as it did just before the flagellants appeared the state has been endangered and that the disregard of established social observances has ever been an accompaniment of political revolutions whoever doubts the necessity for a government of manners proportionate in strength to the coexisting political and religious governments will be convinced on calling to mind that until recently even elaborate codes of behaviour failed to keep gentlemen from quarrelling in the streets and fighting duels in taverns and on remembering further that even now people exhibit at the doors of a theatre where there is no ceremonial law to rule them a degree of aggressiveness which would produce confusion if carried into social intercourse  as might be expected we find that having a common origin and like general functions these several controlling agencies act during each era with similar degrees of vigour under the chinese despotism stringent and multitudinous in its edicts and harsh in the enforcement of them and associated with which there is an equally stern domestic despotism exercised by the eldest surviving male of the family there exists a system of observances alike complicated and rigid there is a tribunal of ceremonies previous to presentation at court ambassadors pass many days in practising the required forms social intercourse is cumbered by endless compliments and obeisances class distinctions are strongly marked by badges the chief regret on losing an only son is that there will be no one to perform the sepulchral rites and if there wants a definite measure of the respect paid to social ordinances we have it in the torture to which ladies submit in having their feet crushed in india and indeed throughout the east there exists a like connection between the pitiless tyranny of rulers the dread terrors of immemorial creeds and the rigid restraint of unchangeable customs the caste regulations continue still unalterable the fashions of clothes and furniture have remained the same for ages suttees are so ancient as to be mentioned by strabo and diodorus siculus justice is still administered at the palacegates as of old in short every usage is a precept of religion and a maxim of jurisprudence  a similar relationship of phenomena was exhibited in europe during the middle ages while all its governments were autocratic while feudalism held sway while the church was unshorn of its power while the criminal code was full of horrors and the hell of the popular creed full of terrors the rules of behaviour were both more numerous and more carefully conformed to than now differences of dress marked divisions of rank men were limited by law to a certain width of shoetoes and no one below a specified degree might wear a cloak less than so many inches long the symbols on banners and shields were carefully attended to heraldry was an important branch of knowledge precedence was strictly insisted on and those various salutes of which we now use the abridgments were gone through in full even during our own last century with its corrupt house of commons and littlecurbed monarchs we may mark a correspondence of social formalities gentlemen were still distinguished from lower classes by dress people sacrificed themselves to inconvenient requirementsas powder hooped petticoats and towering headdresses and children addressed their parents as sir and madam  a further corollary naturally following this last and almost indeed forming part of it is that these several kinds of government decrease in stringency at the same rate simultaneously with the decline in the influence of priesthoods and in the fear of eternal tormentssimultaneously with the mitigation of political tyranny the growth of popular power and the amelioration of criminal codes has taken place that diminution of formalities and that fading of distinctive marks now so observable looking at home we may note that there is less attention to precedence than there used to be no one in our day ends an interview with the phrase your humble servant the employment of the word sir once general in social intercourse is at present considered bad breeding and on the occasions calling for them it is held vulgar to use the words your majesty or your royal highness more than once in a conversation people no longer formally drink each others healths and even the taking wine with each other at dinner has ceased to be fashionable the takingoff of hats between gentlemen has been gradually falling into disuse even when the hat is removed it is no longer swept out at arms length but is simply lifted hence the remark made upon us by foreigners that we take off our hats less than any other nation in europea remark that should be coupled with the other that we are the freest nation in europe  as already implied this association of facts is not accidental these titles of address and modes of salutation bearing about them as they all do something of that servility which marks their origin become distasteful in proportion as men become more independent themselves and sympathise more with the independence of others the feeling which makes the modern gentleman tell the labourer standing bareheaded before him to put on his hatthe feeling which gives us a dislike to those who cringe and fawnthe feeling which makes us alike assert our own dignity and respect that of othersthe feeling which thus leads us more and more to discountenance all forms and names which confess inferiority and submission is the same feeling which resists despotic power and inaugurates popular government denies the authority of the church and establishes the right of private judgment  a fourth fact akin to the foregoing is that these several kinds of government not only decline together but corrupt together by the same process that a court of chancery becomes a place not for the administration of justice but for the withholding of itby the same process that a national church from being an agency for moral control comes to be merely a thing of formulas and tithes and bishopricsby this same process do titles and ceremonies that once had a meaning and a power become empty forms  coats of arms which served to distinguish men in battle now figure on the carriage panels of retired grocers once a badge of high military rank the shoulderknot has become on the modern footman a mark of servitude the name banneret which once marked a partiallycreated barona baron who had passed his military little gois now under the modification of baronet applicable to any one favoured by wealth or interest or party feeling knighthood has so far ceased to be an honour that men now honour themselves by declining it the military dignity escuyer has in the modern esquire become a wholly unmilitary affix not only do titles and phrases and salutes cease to fulfil their original functions but the whole apparatus of social forms tends to become useless for its original purposethe facilitation of social intercourse those most learned in ceremonies and most precise in the observance of them are not always the best behaved as those deepest read in creeds and scriptures are not therefore the most religious nor those who have the clearest notions of legality and illegality the most honest just as lawyers are of all men the least noted for probity as cathedral towns have a lower moral character than most others so if swift is to be believed courtiers are the most insignificant race of people that the island can afford and with the smallest tincture of good manners  but perhaps it is in that class of social observances comprehended under the term fashion which we must here discuss parenthetically that this process of corruption is seen with the greatest distinctness as contrasted with manners which dictate our minor acts in relation to other persons fashion dictates our minor acts in relation to ourselves while the one prescribes that part of our deportment which directly affects our neighbours the other prescribes that part of our deportment which is primarily personal and in which our neighbours are concerned only as spectators thus distinguished as they are however the two have a common source for while as we have shown manners originate by imitation of the behaviour pursued towards the great fashion originates by imitation of the behaviour of the great while the one has its derivation in the titles phrases and salutes used to those in power the other is derived from the habits and appearances exhibited by those in power  the carrib mother who squeezes her childs head into a shape like that of the chief the young savage who makes marks on himself similar to the scars carried by the warriors of his tribe which is probably the origin of tattooing the highlander who adopts the plaid worn by the head of his clan the courtiers who affect greyness or limp or cover their necks in imitation of their king and the people who ape the courtiers are alike acting under a kind of government connate with that of manners and like it too primarily beneficial for notwithstanding the numberless absurdities into which this copyism has led the people from noserings to earrings from painted faces to beautyspots from shaven heads to powdered wigs from filed teeth and stained nails to bellgirdles peaked shoes and breeches stuffed with branit must yet be concluded that as the strong men the successful men the men of will intelligence and originality who have got to the top are on the average more likely to show judgment in their habits and tastes than the mass the imitation of such is advantageous  by and by however fashion corrupting like these other forms of rule almost wholly ceases to be an imitation of the best and becomes an imitation of quite other than the best as those who take orders are not those having a special fitness for the priestly office but those who see their way to a living by it as legislators and public functionaries do not become such by virtue of their political insight and power to rule but by virtue of birth acreage and class influence so the selfelected clique who set the fashion gain this prerogative not by their force of nature their intellect their higher worth or better taste but gain it solely by their unchecked assumption among the initiated are to be found neither the noblest in rank the chief in power the best cultured the most refined nor those of greatest genius wit or beauty and their reunions so far from being superior to others are noted for their inanity yet by the example of these sham great and not by that of the truly great does society at large now regulate its goings and comings its hours its dress its small usages as a natural consequence these have generally little or none of that suitableness which the theory of fashion implies they should have but instead of a continual progress towards greater elegance and convenience which might be expected to occur did people copy the ways of the really best or follow their own ideas of propriety we have a reign of mere whim of unreason of change for the sake of change of wanton oscillations from either extreme to the othera reign of usages without meaning times without fitness dress without taste and thus life à la mode instead of being life conducted in the most rational manner is life regulated by spendthrifts and idlers milliners and tailors dandies and silly women  to these several corollariesthat the various orders of control exercised over men have a common origin and a common function are called out by coordinate necessities and coexist in like stringency decline together and corrupt togetherit now only remains to add that they become needless together consequent as all kinds of government are upon the unfitness of the aboriginal man for social life and diminishing in coerciveness as they all do in proportion as this unfitness diminishes they must one and all come to an end as humanity acquires complete adaptation to its new conditions that discipline of circumstances which has already wrought out such great changes in us must go on eventually to work out yet greater ones that daily curbing of the lower nature and culture of the higher which out of cannibals and devil worshippers has evolved philanthropists lovers of peace and haters of superstition cannot fail to evolve out of these men as much superior to them as they are to their progenitors the causes that have produced past modifications are still in action must continue in action as long as there exists any incongruity between mans desires and the requirements of the social state and must eventually make him organically fit for the social state as it is now needless to forbid maneating and fetishism so will it ultimately become needless to forbid murder theft and the minor offences of our criminal code when human nature has grown into conformity with the moral law there will need no judges and statutebooks when it spontaneously takes the right course in all things as in some things it does already prospects of future reward or punishment will not be wanted as incentives and when fit behaviour has become instinctive there will need no code of ceremonies to say how behaviour shall be regulated  thus then may be recognised the meaning the naturalness the necessity of those various eccentricities of reformers which we set out by describing they are not accidental they are not mere personal caprices as people are apt to suppose on the contrary they are inevitable results of the law of relationship above illustrated that community of genesis function and decay which all forms of restraint exhibit is simply the obverse of the fact at first pointed out that they have in two sentiments of human nature a common preserver and a common destroyer awe of power originates and cherishes them all love of freedom undermines and periodically weakens them all the one defends despotism and asserts the supremacy of laws adheres to old creeds and supports ecclesiastical authority pays respect to titles and conserves forms the other putting rectitude above legality achieves periodical instalments of political liberty inaugurates protestantism and works out its consequences ignores the senseless dictates of fashion and emancipates men from dead customs  to the true reformer no institution is sacred no belief above criticism everything shall conform itself to equity and reason nothing shall be saved by its prestige conceding to each man liberty to pursue his own ends and satisfy his own tastes he demands for himself like liberty and consents to no restrictions on this save those which other mens equal claims involve no matter whether it be an ordinance of one man or an ordinance of all men if it trenches on his legitimate sphere of action he denies its validity the tyranny that would impose on him a particular style of dress and a set mode of behaviour he resists equally with the tyranny that would limit his buyings and sellings or dictate his creed whether the regulation be formally made by a legislature or informally made by society at largewhether the penalty for disobedience be imprisonment or frowns and social ostracism he sees to be a question of no moment he will utter his belief notwithstanding the threatened punishment he will break conventions spite of the petty persecutions that will be visited on him show him that his actions are inimical to his fellowmen and he will pause prove that he is disregarding their legitimate claimsthat he is doing what in the nature of things must produce unhappiness and he will alter his course but until you do thisuntil you demonstrate that his proceedings are essentially inconvenient or inelegant essentially irrational unjust or ungenerous he will persevere  some indeed argue that his conduct is unjust and ungenerous they say that he has no right to annoy other people by his whims that the gentleman to whom his letter comes with no esq appended to the address and the lady whose evening party he enters with gloveless hands are vexed at what they consider his want of respect or want of breeding that thus his eccentricities cannot be indulged save at the expense of his neighbours feelings and that hence his nonconformity is in plain terms selfishness  he answers that this position if logically developed would deprive men of all liberty whatever each must conform all his acts to the public taste and not his own the public taste on every point having been once ascertained mens habits must thenceforth remain for ever fixed seeing that no man can adopt other habits without sinning against the public taste and giving people disagreeable feelings consequently be it an era of pigtails or highheeled shoes of starched ruffs or trunkhose all must continue to wear pigtails highheeled shoes starched ruffs or trunkhose to the crack of doom  if it be still urged that he is not justified in breaking through others forms that he may establish his own and so sacrificing the wishes of many to the wishes of one he replies that all religious and political changes might be negatived on like grounds he asks whether luthers sayings and doings were not extremely offensive to the mass of his contemporaries whether the resistance of hampden was not disgusting to the timeservers around him whether every reformer has not shocked mens prejudices and given immense displeasure by the opinions he uttered the affirmative answer he follows up by demanding what right the reformer has then to utter these opinions whether he is not sacrificing the feelings of many to the feelings of one and so proves that to be consistent his antagonists must condemn not only all nonconformity in actions but all nonconformity in thoughts  his antagonists rejoin that his position too may be pushed to an absurdity they argue that if a man may offend by the disregard of some forms he may as legitimately do so by the disregard of all and they inquirewhy should he not go out to dinner in a dirty shirt and with an unshorn chin why should he not spit on the drawingroom carpet and stretch his heels up to the mantleshelf  the conventionbreaker answers that to ask this implies a confounding of two widelydifferent classes of actionsthe actions that are essentially displeasurable to those around with the actions that are but incidentally displeasurable to them he whose skin is so unclean as to offend the nostrils of his neighbours or he who talks so loudly as to disturb a whole room may be justly complained of and rightly excluded by society from its assemblies but he who presents himself in a surtout in place of a dresscoat or in brown trousers instead of black gives offence not to mens senses or their innate tastes but merely to their prejudices their bigotry of convention it cannot be said that his costume is less elegant or less intrinsically appropriate than the one prescribed seeing that a few hours earlier in the day it is admired it is the implied rebellion therefore that annoys how little the cause of quarrel has to do with the dress itself is seen in the fact that a century ago black clothes would have been thought preposterous for hours of recreation and that a few years hence some now forbidden style may be nearer the requirements of fashion than the present one thus the reformer explains that it is not against the natural restraints but against the artificial ones that he protests and that manifestly the fire of sneers and angry glances which he has to bear is poured upon him because he will not bow down to the idol which society has set up  should he be asked how we are to distinguish between conduct that is absolutely disagreeable to others and conduct that is relatively so he answers that they will distinguish themselves if men will let them actions intrinsically repugnant will ever be frowned upon and must ever remain as exceptional as now actions not intrinsically repugnant will establish themselves as proper no relaxation of customs will introduce the practice of going to a party in muddy boots and with unwashed hands for the dislike of dirt would continue were fashion abolished tomorrow that love of approbation which now makes people so solicitous to be en règle would still existwould still make them careful of their personal appearancewould still induce them to seek admiration by making themselves ornamentalwould still cause them to respect the natural laws of good behaviour as they now do the artificial ones the change would simply be from a repulsive monotony to a picturesque variety and if there be any regulations respecting which it is uncertain whether they are based on reality or on convention experiment will soon decide if due scope be allowed  when at length the controversy comes round as controversies often do to the point whence it started and the party of order repeat their charge against the rebel that he is sacrificing the feelings of others to the gratification of his own wilfulness he replies once for all that they cheat themselves by misstatements he accuses them of being so despotic that not content with being masters over their own ways and habits they would be masters over his also and grumble because he will not let them he merely asks the same freedom which they exercise they however propose to regulate his course as well as their ownto cut and clip his mode of life into agreement with their approved pattern and then charge him with wilfulness and selfishness because he does not quietly submit he warns them that he shall resist nevertheless and that he shall do so not only for the assertion of his own independence but for their good he tells them that they are slaves and know it not that they are shackled and kiss their chains that they have lived all their days in prison and complain at the walls being broken down he says he must persevere however with a view to his own release and in spite of their present expostulations he prophesies that when they have recovered from the fright which the prospect of freedom produces they will thank him for aiding in their emancipation  unamiable as seems this findfault mood offensive as is this defiant attitude we must beware of overlooking the truths enunciated in dislike of the advocacy it is an unfortunate hindrance to all innovation that in virtue of their very function the innovators stand in a position of antagonism and the disagreeable manners and sayings and doings which this antagonism generates are commonly associated with the doctrines promulgated quite forgetting that whether the thing attacked be good or bad the combative spirit is necessarily repulsive and quite forgetting that the toleration of abuses seems amiable merely from its passivity the mass of men contract a bias against advanced views and in favour of stationary ones from intercourse with their respective adherents conservatism as emerson says is debonnair and social reform is individual and imperious and this remains true however vicious the system conserved however righteous the reform to be effected nay the indignation of the purists is usually extreme in proportion as the evils to be got rid of are great the more urgent the required change the more intemperate is the vehemence of its promoters let no one then confound with the principles of this social nonconformity the acerbity and the disagreeable selfassertion of those who first display it                                       the most plausible objection raised against resistance to conventions is grounded on its impolicy considered even from the progressists point of view it is urged by many of the more liberal and intelligentusually those who have themselves shown some independence of behaviour in earlier daysthat to rebel in these small matters is to destroy your own power of helping on reform in greater matters if you show yourself eccentric in manners or dress the world they say will not listen to you you will be considered as crotchety and impracticable the opinions you express on important subjects which might have been treated with respect had you conformed on minor points will now inevitably be put down among your singularities and thus by dissenting in trifles you disable yourself from spreading dissent in essentials  only noting as we pass that this is one of those anticipations which bring about their own fulfilmentthat it is because most who disapprove these conventions do not show their disapproval that the few who do show it look eccentricand that did all act out their convictions no such inference as the above would be drawn and no such evil would resultnoting this as we pass we go on to reply that these social restraints and forms and requirements are not small evils but among the greatest estimate their sum total and we doubt whether they would not exceed most others could we add up the trouble the cost the jealousies vexations misunderstandings the loss of time and the loss of pleasure which these conventions entailcould we clearly realise the extent to which we are all daily hampered by them daily enslaved by them we should perhaps come to the conclusion that the tyranny of mrs grundy is worse than any other tyranny we suffer under let us look at a few of its hurtful results beginning with those of minor importance  it produces extravagance the desire to be comme il faut which underlies all conformities whether of manners dress or styles of entertainment is the desire which makes many a spendthrift and many a bankrupt to keep up appearances to have a house in an approved quarter furnished in the latest taste to give expensive dinners and crowded soirées is an ambition forming the natural outcome of the conformist spirit it is needless to enlarge on these follies they have been satirised by hosts of writers and in every drawingroom all that here concerns us is to point out that the respect for social observances which men think so praiseworthy has the same root with this effort to be fashionable in mode of living and that other things equal the last cannot be diminished without the first being diminished also if now we consider all that this extravagance entailsif we count up the robbed tradesmen the stinted governesses the illeducated children the fleeced relatives who have to suffer from itif we mark the anxiety and the many moral delinquencies which its perpetrators involve themselves in we shall see that this regard for conventions is not quite so innocent as it looks  again it decreases the amount of social intercourse passing over the reckless and those who make a great display on speculation with the occasional result of getting on in the world to the exclusion of much better men we come to the far larger class who being prudent and honest enough not to exceed their means and yet having a strong wish to be respectable are obliged to limit their entertainments to the smallest possible number and that each of these may be turned to the greatest advantage in meeting the claims upon their hospitality are induced to issue their invitations with little or no regard to the comfort or mutual fitness of their guests a few inconvenientlylarge assemblies made up of people mostly strange to each other or but distantly acquainted and having scarcely any tastes in common are made to serve in place of many small parties of friends intimate enough to have some bond of thought and sympathy thus the quantity of intercourse is diminished and the quality deteriorated because it is the custom to make costly preparations and provide costly refreshments and because it entails both less expense and less trouble to do this for many persons on a few occasions than for few persons on many occasions the reunions of our less wealthy classes are rendered alike infrequent and tedious  let it be further observed that the existing formalities of social intercourse drive away many who most need its refining influence and drive them into injurious habits and associations not a few men and not the least sensible men either give up in disgust this going out to stately dinners and stiff eveningparties and instead seek society in clubs and cigardivans and taverns im sick of this standing about in drawingrooms talking nonsense and trying to look happy will answer one of them when taxed with his desertion why should i any longer waste time and money and temper once i was ready enough to rush home from the office to dress i sported embroidered shirts submitted to tight boots and cared nothing for tailors and haberdashers bills i know better now my patience lasted a good while for though i found each night pass stupidly i always hoped the next would make amends but im undeceived cabhire and kid gloves cost more than any evening party pays for or ratherit is worth the cost of them to avoid the party no no ill no more of it why should i pay five shillings a time for the privilege of being bored  if now we consider that this very common mood tends towards billiardrooms towards long sittings over cigars and brandyandwater towards evanss and the coal hole towards every place where amusement may be had it becomes a question whether these precise observances which hamper our set meetings have not to answer for much of the prevalent dissoluteness men must have excitements of some kind or other and if debarred from higher ones will fall back upon lower it is not that those who thus take to irregular habits are essentially those of low tastes often it is quite the reverse among half a dozen intimate friends abandoning formalities and sitting at ease round the fire none will enter with greater enjoyment into the highest kind of social intercoursethe genuine communion of thought and feeling and if the circle includes women of intelligence and refinement so much the greater is their pleasure it is because they will no longer be choked with the mere dry husks of conversation which society offers them that they fly its assemblies and seek those with whom they may have discourse that is at least real though unpolished the men who thus long for substantial mental sympathy and will go where they can get it are often indeed much better at the core than the men who are content with the inanities of gloved and scented partygoersmen who feel no need to come morally nearer to their fellow creatures than they can come while standing teacup in hand answering trifles with trifles and who by feeling no such need prove themselves shallowthoughted and coldhearted  it is true that some who shun drawingrooms do so from inability to bear the restraints prescribed by a genuine refinement and that they would be greatly improved by being kept under these restraints but it is not less true that by adding to the legitimate restraints which are based on convenience and a regard for others a host of factitious restraints based only on convention the refining discipline which would else have been borne with benefit is rendered unbearable and so misses its end excess of government invariably defeats itself by driving away those to be governed and if over all who desert its entertainments in disgust either at their emptiness or their formality society thus loses its salutary influenceif such not only fail to receive that moral culture which the company of ladies when rationally regulated would give them but in default of other relaxation are driven into habits and companionships which often end in gambling and drunkenness must we not say that here too is an evil not to be passed over as insignificant  then consider what a blighting effect these multitudinous preparations and ceremonies have upon the pleasures they profess to subserve who on calling to mind the occasions of his highest social enjoyments does not find them to have been wholly informal perhaps impromptu how delightful a picnic of friends who forget all observances save those dictated by good nature how pleasant the little unpretended gatherings of booksocieties and the like or those purely accidental meetings of a few people well known to each other then indeed we may see that a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend cheeks flush and eyes sparkle the witty grow brilliant and even the dull are excited into saying good things there is an overflow of topics and the right thought and the right words to put it in spring up unsought grave alternates with gay now serious converse and now jokes anecdotes and playful raillery every ones best nature is shown every ones best feelings are in pleasurable activity and for the time life seems well worth having  go now and dress for some halfpast eight dinner or some ten oclock at home and present yourself in spotless attire with every hair arranged to perfection how great the difference the enjoyment seems in the inverse ratio of the preparation these figures got up with such finish and precision appear but half alive they have frozen each other by their primness and your faculties feel the numbing effects of the atmosphere the moment you enter it all those thoughts so nimble and so apt awhile since have disappearedhave suddenly acquired a preternatural power of eluding you if you venture a remark to your neighbour there comes a trite rejoinder and there it ends no subject you can hit upon outlives half a dozen sentences nothing that is said excites any real interest in you and you feel that all you say is listened to with apathy by some strange magic things that usually give pleasure seem to have lost all charm  you have a taste for art weary of frivolous talk you turn to the table and find that the book of engravings and the portfolio of photographs are as flat as the conversation you are fond of music yet the singing good as it is you hear with utter indifference and say thank you with a sense of being a profound hypocrite wholly at ease though you could be for your own part you find that your sympathies will not let you you see young gentlemen feeling whether their ties are properly adjusted looking vacantly round and considering what they shall do next you see ladies sitting disconsolately waiting for some one to speak to them and wishing they had the wherewith to occupy their fingers you see the hostess standing about the doorway keeping a factitious smile on her face and racking her brain to find the requisite nothings with which to greet her guests as they enter you see numberless traits of weariness and embarrassment and if you have any fellowfeeling these cannot fail to produce a feeling of discomfort the disorder is catching and do what you will you cannot resist the general infection you struggle against it you make spasmodic efforts to be lively but none of your sallies or your good stories do more than raise a simper or a forced laugh intellect and feeling are alike asphyxiated and when at length yielding to your disgust you rush away how great is the relief when you get into the fresh air and see the stars how you thank god thats over and half resolve to avoid all such boredom for the future  what now is the secret of this perpetual miscarriage and disappointment does not the fault lie with all these needless adjunctsthese elaborate dressings these set forms these expensive preparations these many devices and arrangements that imply trouble and raise expectation who that has lived thirty years in the world has not discovered that pleasure is coy and must not be too directly pursued but must be caught unawares an air from a streetpiano heard while at work will often gratify more than the choicest music played at a concert by the most accomplished musicians a single good picture seen in a dealers window may give keener enjoyment than a whole exhibition gone through with catalogue and pencil by the time we have got ready our elaborate apparatus by which to secure happiness the happiness is gone it is too subtle to be contained in these receivers garnished with compliments and fenced round with etiquette the more we multiply and complicate appliances the more certain are we to drive it away  the reason is patent enough these higher emotions to which social intercourse ministers are of extremely complex nature they consequently depend for their production upon very numerous conditions the more numerous the conditions the greater the liability that one or other of them will be disturbed and the emotions consequently prevented it takes a considerable misfortune to destroy appetite but cordial sympathy with those around may be extinguished by a look or a word hence it follows that the more multiplied the unnecessary requirements with which social intercourse is surrounded the less likely are its pleasures to be achieved it is difficult enough to fulfil continuously all the essentials to a pleasurable communion with others how much more difficult then must it be continuously to fulfil a host of nonessentials also it is indeed impossible the attempt inevitably ends in the sacrifice of the first to the lastthe essentials to the nonessentials what chance is there of getting any genuine response from the lady who is thinking of your stupidity in taking her in to dinner on the wrong arm how are you likely to have agreeable converse with the gentleman who is fuming internally because he is not placed next to the hostess formalities familiar as they may become necessarily occupy attentionnecessarily multiply the occasions for mistake misunderstanding and jealousy on the part of one or othernecessarily distract all minds from the thoughts and feelings that should occupy themnecessarily therefore subvert those conditions under which only any sterling intercourse is to be had  and this indeed is the fatal mischief which these conventions entaila mischief to which every other is secondary they destroy those highest of our pleasures which they profess to subserve all institutions are alike in this that however useful and needful even they originally were they not only in the end cease to be so but become detrimental while humanity is growing they continue fixed daily get more mechanical and unvital and by and by tend to strangle what they before preserved it is not simply that they become corrupt and fail to act they become obstructions old forms of government finally grow so oppressive that they must be thrown off even at the risk of reigns of terror old creeds end in being dead formulas which no longer aid but distort and arrest the general mind while the statechurches administering them come to be instruments for subsidising conservatism and repressing progress old schemes of education incarnated in public schools and colleges continue filling the heads of new generations with what has become relatively useless knowledge and by consequence excluding knowledge which is useful not an organisation of any kindpolitical religious literary philanthropicbut what by its evermultiplying regulations its accumulating wealth its yearly addition of officers and the creeping into it of patronage and party feeling eventually loses its original spirit and sinks into a mere lifeless mechanism worked with a view to private endsa mechanism which not merely fails of its first purpose but is a positive hindrance to it  thus is it too with social usages we read of the chinese that they have ponderous ceremonies transmitted from time immemorial which make social intercourse a burden the court forms prescribed by monarchs for their own exaltation have in all times and places ended in consuming the comfort of their lives and so the artificial observances of the diningroom and saloon in proportion as they are many and strict extinguish that agreeable communion which they were originally intended to secure the dislike with which people commonly speak of society that is formal and stiff and ceremonious implies the general recognition of this fact and this recognition logically developed involves that all usages of behaviour which are not based on natural requirements are injurious that these conventions defeat their own ends is no new assertion swift criticising the manners of his day sayswise men are often more uneasy at the overcivility of these refiners than they could possibly be in the conversation of peasants and mechanics  but it is not only in these details that the selfdefeating action of our arrangements is traceable it is traceable in the very substance and nature of them our social intercourse as commonly managed is a mere semblance of the reality sought what is it that we want some sympathetic converse with our fellowcreatures some converse that shall not be mere dead words but the vehicle of living thoughts and feelingsconverse in which the eyes and the face shall speak and the tones of the voice be full of meaningconverse which shall make us feel no longer alone but shall draw us closer to another and double our own emotions by adding anothers to them who is there that has not from time to time felt how cold and flat is all this talk about politics and science and the new books and the new men and how a genuine utterance of fellowfeeling outweighs the whole of it mark the words of baconfor a crowd is not a company and faces are but a gallery of pictures and talk but a tinkling cymbal where there is no love  if this be true then it is only after acquaintance has grown into intimacy and intimacy has ripened into friendship that the real communion which men need becomes possible a rationallyformed circle must consist almost wholly of those on terms of familiarity and regard with but one or two strangers what folly then underlies the whole system of our grand dinners our at homes our evening partiesassemblages made up of many who never met before many others who just bow to each other many others who though familiar feel mutual indifference with just a few real friends lost in the general mass you need but look round at the artificial expressions of face to see at once how it is all have their disguises on and how can there be sympathy between masks no wonder that in private every one exclaims against the stupidity of these gatherings no wonder that hostesses get them up rather because they must than because they wish no wonder that the invited go less from the expectation of pleasure than from fear of giving offence the whole thing is a gigantic mistakean organised disappointment  and then note lastly that in this case as in all others when an organisation has become effete and inoperative for its legitimate purpose it is employed for quite other onesquite opposite ones what is the usual plea put in for giving and attending these tedious assemblies i admit that they are stupid and frivolous enough replies every man to your criticisms but then you know one must keep up ones connections and could you get from his wife a sincere answer it would belike you i am sick of these frivolities but then we must get our daughters married the one knows that there is a profession to push a practice to gain a business to extend or parliamentary influence or county patronage or votes or office to be got position berths favours profit the others thoughts run upon husbands and settlements wives and dowries worthless for their ostensible purpose of daily bringing human beings into pleasurable relations with each other these cumbrous appliances of our social intercourse are now perseveringly kept in action with a view to the pecuniary and matrimonial results which they indirectly produce  who then shall say that the reform of our system of observances is unimportant when we see how this system induces fashionable extravagance with its entailed bankruptcy and ruinwhen we mark how greatly it limits the amount of social intercourse among the less wealthy classeswhen we find that many who most need to be disciplined by mixing with the refined are driven away by it and led into dangerous and often fatal courseswhen we count up the many minor evils it inflicts the extra work which its costliness entails on all professional and mercantile men the damage to public taste in dress and decoration by the setting up of its absurdities as standards for imitation the injury to health indicated in the faces of its devotees at the close of the london season the mortality of milliners and the like which its sudden exigencies yearly involveand when to all these we add its fatal sin that it blights withers up and kills that high enjoyment it professedly ministers tothat enjoyment which is a chief end of our hard struggling in life to obtainshall we not conclude that to reform our system of etiquette and fashion is an aim yielding to few in urgency                                       there needs then a protestantism in social usages forms that have ceased to facilitate and have become obstructivewhether political religious or otherhave ever to be swept away and eventually are so swept away in all cases signs are not wanting that some change is at hand a host of satirists led on by thackeray have been for years engaged in bringing our shamfestivities and our fashionable follies into contempt and in their candid moods most men laugh at the frivolities with which they and the world in general are deluded ridicule has always been a revolutionary agent that which is habitually assailed with sneers and sarcasms cannot long survive institutions that have lost their roots in mens respect and faith are doomed and the day of their dissolution is not far off the time is approaching then when our system of social observances must pass through some crisis out of which it will come purified and comparatively simple  how this crisis will be brought about no one can with any certainty say whether by the continuance and increase of individual protests or whether by the union of many persons for the practice and propagation of some better system the future alone can decide the influence of dissentients acting without cooperation seems under the present state of things inadequate standing severally alone and having no welldefined views frowned on by conformists and expostulated with even by those who secretly sympathise with them subject to petty persecutions and unable to trace any benefit produced by their example they are apt one by one to give up their attempts as hopeless the young conventionbreaker eventually finds that he pays too heavily for his nonconformity hating for example everything that bears about it any remnant of servility he determines in the ardour of his independence that he will uncover to no one but what he means simply as a general protest he finds that ladies interpret into a personal disrespect though he sees that from the days of chivalry downwards these marks of supreme consideration paid to the other sex have been but a hypocritical counterpart to the actual subjection in which men have held thema pretended submission to compensate for a real domination and though he sees that when the true dignity of women is recognised the mock dignities given to them will be abolished yet he does not like to be thus misunderstood and so hesitates in his practice  in other cases again his courage fails him such of his unconventionalities as can be attributed only to eccentricity he has no qualms about for on the whole he feels rather complimented than otherwise in being considered a disregarder of public opinion but when they are liable to be put down to ignorance to illbreeding or to poverty he becomes a coward however clearly the recent innovation of eating some kinds of fish with knife and fork proves the forkandbread practice to have had little but caprice for its basis yet he dares not wholly ignore that practice while fashion partially maintains it though he thinks that a silk handkerchief is quite as appropriate for drawingroom use as a white cambric one he is not altogether at ease in acting out his opinion then too he begins to perceive that his resistance to prescription brings round disadvantageous results which he had not calculated upon he had expected that it would save him from a great deal of social intercourse of a frivolous kindthat it would offend the fools but not the sensible people and so would serve as a selfacting test by which those worth knowing would be separated from those not worth knowing but the fools prove to be so greatly in the majority that by offending them he closes against himself nearly all the avenues though which the sensible people are to be reached thus he finds that his nonconformity is frequently misinterpreted that there are but few directions in which he dares to carry it consistently out that the annoyances and disadvantages which it brings upon him are greater than he anticipated and that the chances of his doing any good are very remote hence he gradually loses resolution and lapses step by step into the ordinary routine of observances  abortive as individual protests thus generally turn out it may possibly be that nothing effectual will be done until there arises some organised resistance to this invisible despotism by which our modes and habits are dictated it may happen that the government of manners and fashion will be rendered less tyrannical as the political and religious governments have been by some antagonistic union alike in church and state mens first emancipations from excess of restriction were achieved by numbers bound together by a common creed or a common political faith what remained undone while there were but individual schismatics or rebels was effected when there came to be many acting in concert it is tolerably clear that these earliest instalments of freedom could not have been obtained in any other way for so long as the feeling of personal independence was weak and the rule strong there could never have been a sufficient number of separate dissentients to produce the desired results only in these later times during which the secular and spiritual controls have been growing less coercive and the tendency towards individual liberty greater has it become possible for smaller and smaller sects and parties to fight against established creeds and laws until now men may safely stand even alone in their antagonism  the failure of individual nonconformity to customs as above illustrated suggests that an analogous series of changes may have to be gone through in this case also it is true that the lex non scripta differs from the lex scripta in this that being unwritten it is more readily altered and that it has from time to time been quietly ameliorated nevertheless we shall find that the analogy holds substantially good for in this case as in the others the essential revolution is not the substituting of any one set of restraints for any other but the limiting or abolishing the authority which prescribes restraints just as the fundamental change inaugurated by the reformation was not a superseding of one creed by another but an ignoring of the arbiter who before dictated creedsjust as the fundamental change which democracy long ago commenced was not from this particular law to that but from the despotism of one to the freedom of all so the parallel change yet to be wrought out in this supplementary government of which we are treating is not the replacing of absurd usages by sensible ones but the dethronement of that secret irresponsible power which now imposes our usages and the assertion of the right of all individuals to choose their own usages in rules of living a westend clique is our pope and we are all papists with but a mere sprinkling of heretics on all who decisively rebel comes down the penalty of excommunication with its long catalogue of disagreeable and indeed serious consequences  the liberty of the subject asserted in our constitution and ever on the increase has yet to be wrested from this subtler tyranny the right of private judgment which our ancestors wrung from the church remains to be claimed from this dictator of our habits or as before said to free us from these idolatries and superstitious conformities there has still to come a protestanism in social usages parallel therefore as is the change to be wrought out it seems not improbable that it may be wrought out in an analogous way that influence which solitary dissentients fail to gain and that perseverance which they lack may come into existence when they unite that persecution which the world now visits upon them from mistaking their nonconformity for ignorance or disrespect may diminish when it is seen to result from principle the penalty which exclusion now entails may disappear when they become numerous enough to form visiting circles of their own and when a successful stand has been made and the brunt of the opposition has passed that large amount of secret dislike to our observances which now pervades society may manifest itself with sufficient power to effect the desired emancipation  whether such will be the process time alone can decide that community of origin growth supremacy and decadence which we have found among all kinds of government suggests a community in modes of change also on the other hand nature often performs substantially similar operations in ways apparently different hence these details can never be foretold                                       meanwhile let us glance at the conclusions that have been reached on the one side government originally one and afterwards subdivided for the better fulfilment of its function must be considered as having ever been in all its branchespolitical religious and ceremonialbeneficial and indeed absolutely necessary on the other side government under all its forms must be regarded as subserving a temporary office made needful by the unfitness of aboriginal humanity for social life and the successive diminutions of its coerciveness in state in church and in custom must be looked upon as steps towards its final disappearance to complete the conception there requires to be borne in mind the third fact that the genesis the maintenance and the decline of all governments however named are alike brought about by the humanity to be controlled from which may be drawn the inference that on the average restrictions of every kind cannot last much longer than they are wanted and cannot be destroyed much faster than they ought to be  society in all its developments undergoes the process of exuviation these old forms which it successively throws off have all been once vitally united with ithave severally served as the protective envelopes within which a higher humanity was being evolved they are cast aside only when they become hindrancesonly when some inner and better envelope has been formed and they bequeath to us all that there was in them good the periodical abolitions of tyrannical laws have left the administration of justice not only uninjured but purified dead and buried creeds have not carried with them the essential morality they contained which still exists uncontaminated by the sloughs of superstition and all that there is of justice and kindness and beauty embodied in our cumbrous forms of etiquette will live perennially when the forms themselves have been forgotten  1 westminster review april 1854  2 this was written before moustaches and beards had become common     on the genesis of science1   there has ever prevailed among men a vague notion that scientific knowledge differs in nature from ordinary knowledge by the greeks with whom mathematicsliterally things learntwas alone considered as knowledge proper the distinction must have been strongly felt and it has ever since maintained itself in the general mind though considering the contrast between the achievements of science and those of daily unmethodic thinking it is not surprising that such a distinction has been assumed yet it needs but to rise a little above the common point of view to see that no such distinction can really exist or that at best it is but a superficial distinction the same faculties are employed in both cases and in both cases their mode of operation is fundamentally the same  if we say that science is organised knowledge we are met by the truth that all knowledge is organised in a greater or less degreethat the commonest actions of the household and the field presuppose facts colligated inferences drawn results expected and that the general success of these actions proves the data by which they were guided to have been correctly put together if again we say that science is previsionis a seeing beforehandis a knowing in what times places combinations or sequences specified phenomena will be found we are yet obliged to confess that the definition includes much that is utterly foreign to science in its ordinary acceptation for example a childs knowledge of an apple this as far as it goes consists in previsions when a child sees a certain form and colours it knows that if it puts out its hand it will have certain impressions of resistance and roundness and smoothness and if it bites a certain taste and manifestly its general acquaintance with surrounding objects is of like natureis made up of facts concerning them so grouped as that any part of a group being perceived the existence of the other facts included in it is foreseen  if once more we say that science is exact prevision we still fail to establish the supposed difference not only do we find that much of what we call science is not exact and that some of it as physiology can never become exact but we find further that many of the previsions constituting the common stock alike of wise and ignorant are exact that an unsupported body will fall that a lighted candle will go out when immersed in water that ice will melt when thrown on the firethese and many like predictions relating to the familiar properties of things have as high a degree of accuracy as predictions are capable of it is true that the results predicated are of a very general character but it is none the less true that they are rigorously correct as far as they go and this is all that is requisite to fulfil the definition there is perfect accordance between the anticipated phenomena and the actual ones and no more than this can be said of the highest achievements of the sciences specially characterised as exact  seeing thus that the assumed distinction between scientific knowledge and common knowledge is not logically justifiable and yet feeling as we must that however impossible it may be to draw a line between them the two are not practically identical there arises the questionwhat is the relationship that exists between them a partial answer to this question may be drawn from the illustrations just given on reconsidering them it will be observed that those portions of ordinary knowledge which are identical in character with scientific knowledge comprehend only such combinations of phenomena as are directly cognisable by the senses and are of simple invariable nature that the smoke from a fire which she is lighting will ascend and that the fire will presently boil water are previsions which the servantgirl makes equally well with the most learned physicist they are equally certain equally exact with his but they are previsions concerning phenomena in constant and direct relationphenomena that follow visibly and immediately after their antecedentsphenomena of which the causation is neither remote nor obscurephenomena which may be predicted by the simplest possible act of reasoning  if now we pass to the previsions constituting what is commonly known as sciencethat an eclipse of the moon will happen at a specified time and when a barometer is taken to the top of a mountain of known height the mercurial column will descend a stated number of inches that the poles of a galvanic battery immersed in water will give off the one an inflammable and the other an inflaming gas in definite ratiowe perceive that the relations involved are not of a kind habitually presented to our senses that they depend some of them upon special combinations of causes and that in some of them the connection between antecedents and consequents is established only by an elaborate series of inferences the broad distinction therefore between the two orders of knowledge is not in their nature but in their remoteness from perception  if we regard the cases in their most general aspect we see that the labourer who on hearing certain notes in the adjacent hedge can describe the particular form and colours of the bird making them and the astronomer who having calculated a transit of venus can delineate the black spot entering on the suns disc as it will appear through the telescope at a specified hour do essentially the same thing each knows that on fulfilling the requisite conditions he shall have a preconceived impressionthat after a definite series of actions will come a group of sensations of a foreknown kind the difference then is not in the fundamental character of the mental acts or in the correctness of the previsions accomplished by them but in the complexity of the processes required to achieve the previsions much of our commonest knowledge is as far as it goes rigorously precise science does not increase this precision cannot transcend it what then does it do it reduces other knowledge to the same degree of precision that certainty which direct perception gives us respecting coexistences and sequences of the simplest and most accessible kind science gives us respecting coexistences and sequences complex in their dependencies or inaccessible to immediate observation in brief regarded from this point of view science may be called an extension of the perceptions by means of reasoning  on further considering the matter however it will perhaps be felt that this definition does not express the whole factthat inseparable as science may be from common knowledge and completely as we may fill up the gap between the simplest previsions of the child and the most recondite ones of the natural philosopher by interposing a series of previsions in which the complexity of reasoning involved is greater and greater there is yet a difference between the two beyond that which is here described and this is true but the difference is still not such as enables us to draw the assumed line of demarcation it is a difference not between common knowledge and scientific knowledge but between the successive phases of science itself or knowledge itselfwhichever we choose to call it in its earlier phases science attains only to certainty of foreknowledge in its later phases it further attains to completeness we begin by discovering a relation we end by discovering the relation our first achievement is to foretell the kind of phenomenon which will occur under specific conditions our last achievement is to foretell not only the kind but the amount or to reduce the proposition to its most definite formundeveloped science is qualitative prevision developed science is quantitative prevision  this will at once be perceived to express the remaining distinction between the lower and the higher stages of positive knowledge the prediction that a piece of lead will take more force to lift it than a piece of wood of equal size exhibits certainty but not completeness of foresight the kind of effect in which the one body will exceed the other is foreseen but not the amount by which it will exceed there is qualitative prevision only on the other hand the prediction that at a stated time two particular planets will be in conjunction that by means of a lever having arms in a given ratio a known force will raise just so many pounds that to decompose a specified quantity of sulphate of iron by carbonate of soda will require so many grainsthese predictions exhibit foreknowledge not only of the nature of the effects to be produced but of the magnitude either of the effects themselves of the agencies producing them or of the distance in time or space at which they will be produced there is not only qualitative but quantitative prevision  and this is the unexpressed difference which leads us to consider certain orders of knowledge as especially scientific when contrasted with knowledge in general are the phenomena measurable is the test which we unconsciously employ space is measurable hence geometry force and space are measureable hence statics time force and space are measureable hence dynamics the invention of the barometer enabled men to extend the principles of mechanics to the atmosphere and aerostatics existed when a thermometer was devised there arose a science of heat which was before impossible such of our sensations as we have not yet found modes of measuring do not originate sciences we have no science of smells nor have we one of tastes we have a science of the relations of sounds differing in pitch because we have discovered a way to measure them but we have no science of sounds in respect to their loudness or their timbre because we have got no measures of loudness and timbre  obviously it is this reduction of the sensible phenomena it represents to relations of magnitude which gives to any division of knowledge its especially scientific character originally mens knowledge of weights and forces was in the same condition as their knowledge of smells and tastes is nowa knowledge not extending beyond that given by the unaided sensations and it remained so until weighing instruments and dynamometers were invented before there were hourglasses and clepsydras most phenomena could be estimated as to their durations and intervals with no greater precision than degrees of hardness can be estimated by the fingers until a thermometric scale was contrived mens judgments respecting relative amounts of heat stood on the same footing with their present judgments respecting relative amounts of sound and as in these initial stages with no aids to observation only the roughest comparisons of cases could be made and only the most marked differences perceived it is obvious that only the most simple laws of dependence could be ascertainedonly those laws which being uncomplicated with others and not disturbed in their manifestations required no niceties of observation to disentangle them whence it appears not only that in proportion as knowledge becomes quantitative do its previsions become complete as well as certain but that until its assumption of a quantitative character it is necessarily confined to the most elementary relations  moreover it is to be remarked that while on the one hand we can discover the laws of the greater proportion of phenomena only by investigating them quantitatively on the other hand we can extend the range of our quantitative previsions only as fast as we detect the laws of the results we predict for clearly the ability to specify the magnitude of a result inaccessible to direct measurement implies knowledge of its mode of dependence on something which can be measuredimplies that we know the particular fact dealt with to be an instance of some more general fact thus the extent to which our quantitative previsions have been carried in any direction indicates the depth to which our knowledge reaches in that direction and here as another aspect of the same fact we may further observe that as we pass from qualitative to quantitative prevision we pass from inductive science to deductive science science while purely inductive is purely qualitative when inaccurately quantitative it usually consists of part induction part deduction and it becomes accurately quantitative only when wholly deductive we do not mean that the deductive and the quantitative are coextensive for there is manifestly much deduction that is qualitative only we mean that all quantitative prevision is reached deductively and that induction can achieve only qualitative prevision  still however it must not be supposed that these distinctions enable us to separate ordinary knowledge from science much as they seem to do so while they show in what consists the broad contrast between the extreme forms of the two they yet lead us to recognise their essential identity and once more prove the difference to be one of degree only for on the one hand the commonest positive knowledge is to some extent quantitative seeing that the amount of the foreseen result is known within certain wide limits and on the other hand the highest quantitative prevision does not reach the exact truth but only a very near approximation to it without clocks the savage knows that the day is longer in the summer than in the winter without scales he knows that stone is heavier than flesh that is he can foresee respecting certain results that their amounts will exceed these and be less than thosehe knows about what they will be and with his most delicate instruments and most elaborate calculations all that the man of science can do is to reduce the difference between the foreseen and the actual results to an unimportant quantity  moreover it must be borne in mind not only that all the sciences are qualitative in their first stagesnot only that some of them as chemistry have but recently reached the quantitative stagebut that the most advanced sciences have attained to their present power of determining quantities not present to the senses or not directly measurable by a slow process of improvement extending through thousands of years so that science and the knowledge of the uncultured are alike in the nature of their previsions widely as they differ in range they possess a common imperfection though this is immensely greater in the last than in the first and the transition from the one to the other has been through a series of steps by which the imperfection has been rendered continually less and the range continually wider  these facts that science and the positive knowledge of the uncultured cannot be separated in nature and that the one is but a perfected and extended form of the other must necessarily underlie the whole theory of science its progress and the relations of its parts to each other there must be serious incompleteness in any history of the sciences which leaving out of view the first steps of their genesis commences with them only when they assume definite forms there must be grave defects if not a general untruth in a philosophy of the sciences considered in their interdependence and development which neglects the inquiry how they came to be distinct sciences and how they were severally evolved out of the chaos of primitive ideas  not only a direct consideration of the matter but all analogy goes to show that in the earlier and simpler stages must be sought the key to all subsequent intricacies the time was when the anatomy and physiology of the human being were studied by themselveswhen the adult man was analysed and the relations of parts and of functions investigated without reference either to the relations exhibited in the embryo or to the homologous relations existing in other creatures now however it has become manifest that no true conceptions no true generalisations are possible under such conditions anatomists and physiologists now find that the real natures of organs and tissues can be ascertained only by tracing their early evolution and that the affinities between existing genera can be satisfactorily made out only by examining the fossil genera to which they are allied well is it not clear that the like must be true concerning all things that undergo development is not science a growth has not science too its embryology and must not the neglect of its embryology lead to a misunderstanding of the principles of its evolution and of its existing organisation  there are à priori reasons therefore for doubting the truth of all philosophies of the sciences which tacitly proceed upon the common notion that scientific knowledge and ordinary knowledge are separate instead of commencing as they should by affiliating the one upon the other and showing how it gradually came to be distinguishable from the other we may expect to find their generalisations essentially artificial and we shall not be deceived some illustrations of this may here be fitly introduced by way of preliminary to a brief sketch of the genesis of science from the point of view indicated and we cannot more readily find such illustrations than by glancing at a few of the various classifications of the sciences that have from time to time been proposed to consider all of them would take too much space we must content ourselves with some of the latest                                       commencing with those which may be soonest disposed of let us notice first the arrangement propounded by oken an abstract of it runs thus       part i   mathesispneumatogeny primary art primary                consciousness god primary rest time polarity motion                man space point line surface globe                rotationhylogeny gravity matter ether heavenly                bodies light heat fire          he explains that mathesis is the doctrine of the whole         pneumatogeny being the doctrine of immaterial totalities and         hylogeny that of material totalities       part ii  ontologycosmogeny rest centre motion line                planets form planetary system cometsstöchiogeny                condensation simple matter

        of matter the first of these are the heavenly bodies         comprehended by cosmogeny these divide into         elementsstöchiogeny the earth element divides into         mineralsmineralogy these unite into one collective         bodygeogeny the whole in singulars is the living or         organic which again divides into plants and animals         biology therefore divides into

zoology                psychology  a glance over this confused scheme shows that it is an attempt to classify knowledge not after the order in which it has been or may be built up in the human consciousness but after an assumed order of creation it is a pseudoscientific cosmogony akin to those which men have enunciated from the earliest times downwards and only a little more respectable as such it will not be thought worthy of much consideration by those who like ourselves hold that experience is the sole origin of knowledge otherwise it might have been needful to dwell on the incongruities of the arrangementsto ask how motion can be treated of before space how there can be rotation without matter to rotate how polarity can be dealt with without involving points and lines but it will serve our present purpose just to point out a few of the extreme absurdities resulting from the doctrine which oken seems to hold in common with hegel that to philosophise on nature is to rethink the great thought of creation here is a sample  mathematics is the universal science so also is physiophilosophy although it is only a part or rather but a condition of the universe both are one or mutually congruent  mathematics is however a science of mere forms without substance physiophilosophy is therefore mathematics endowed with substance  from the english point of view it is sufficiently amusing to find such a dogma not only gravely stated but stated as an unquestionable truth here we see the experiences of quantitative relations which men have gathered from surrounding bodies and generalised experiences which had been scarcely at all generalised at the beginning of the historic periodwe find these generalised experiences these intellectual abstractions elevated into concrete actualities projected back into nature and considered as the internal framework of thingsthe skeleton by which matter is sustained but this new form of the old realism is by no means the most startling of the physiophilosophic principles we presently read that  the highest mathematical idea or the fundamental principle of all mathematics is the zero  0  zero is in itself nothing mathematics is based upon nothing and consequently arises out of nothing  out of nothing therefore it is possible for something to arise for mathematics consisting of propositions is something in relation to 0  by such consequentlys and therefores it is that men philosophise when they rethink the great thought of creation by dogmas that pretend to be reasons nothing is made to generate mathematics and by clothing mathematics with matter we have the universe if now we deny as we do deny that the highest mathematical idea is the zeroif on the other hand we assert as we do assert that the fundamental idea underlying all mathematics is that of equality the whole of okens cosmogony disappears and here indeed we may see illustrated the distinctive peculiarity of the german method of procedure in these mattersthe bastard à priori method as it may be termed the legitimate à priori method sets out with propositions of which the negation is inconceivable the à priori method as illegitimately applied sets out either with propositions of which the negation is not inconceivable or with propositions like okens of which the affirmation is inconceivable  it is needless to proceed further with the analysis else might we detail the steps by which oken arrives at the conclusions that the planets are coagulated colours for they are coagulated light that the sphere is the expanded nothing that gravity is a weighty nothing a heavy essence striving towards a centre that the earth is the identical water the indifferent air the different or the first the centre the second the radius the last the periphery of the general globe or of fire to comment on them would be nearly as absurd as are the propositions themselves let us pass on to another of the german systems of knowledgethat of hegel  the simple fact that hegel puts jacob boehme on a par with bacon suffices alone to show that his standpoint is far remote from the one usually regarded as scientific so far remote indeed that it is not easy to find any common basis on which to found a criticism those who hold that the mind is moulded into conformity with surrounding things by the agency of surrounding things are necessarily at a loss how to deal with those who like schelling and hegel assert that surrounding things are solidified mindthat nature is petrified intelligence however let us briefly glance at hegels classification he divides philosophy into three parts  1 logic or the science of the idea in itself the pure idea  2 the philosophy of nature or the science of the idea considered under its other formof the idea as nature  3 the philosophy of the mind or the science of the idea in its return to itself  of these the second is divided into the natural sciences commonly so called so that in its more detailed form the series runs thuslogic mechanics physics organic physics psychology  now if we believe with hegel first that thought is the true essence of man second that thought is the essence of the world and that therefore there is nothing but thought his classification beginning with the science of pure thought may be acceptable but otherwise it is an obvious objection to his arrangement that thought implies things thought ofthat there can be no logical forms without the substance of experiencethat the science of ideas and the science of things must have a simultaneous origin hegel however anticipates this objection and in his obstinate idealism replies that the contrary is true that all contained in the forms to become something requires to be thought and that logical forms are the foundations of all things  it is not surprising that starting from such premises and reasoning after this fashion hegel finds his way to strange conclusions out of space and time he proceeds to build up motion matter repulsion attraction weight and inertia he then goes on to logically evolve the solar system in doing this he widely diverges from the newtonian theory reaches by syllogism the conviction that the planets are the most perfect celestial bodies and not being able to bring the stars within his theory says that they are mere formal existences and not living matter and that as compared with the solar system they are as little admirable as a cutaneous eruption or a swarm of flies2  results so outrageous might be left as selfdisproved were it not that speculators of this class are not alarmed by any amount of incongruity with established beliefs the only efficient mode of treating systems like this of hegel is to show that they are selfdestructivethat by their first steps they ignore that authority on which all their subsequent steps depend if hegel professes as he manifestly does to develop his scheme by reasoningif he presents successive inferences as necessarily following from certain premises he implies the postulate that a belief which necessarily follows after certain antecedents is a true belief and did an opponent reply to one of his inferences that though it was impossible to think the opposite yet the opposite was true he would consider the reply irrational the procedure however which he would thus condemn as destructive of all thinking whatever is just the procedure exhibited in the enunciation of his own first principles  mankind find themselves unable to conceive that there can be thought without things thought of hegel however asserts that there can be thought without things thought of that ultimate test of a true propositionthe inability of the human mind to conceive the negation of itwhich in all other cases he considers valid he considers invalid where it suits his convenience to do so and yet at the same time denies the right of an opponent to follow his example if it is competent for him to posit dogmas which are the direct negations of what human consciousness recognises then is it also competent for his antagonists to stop him at every step in his argument by saying that though the particular inference he is drawing seems to his mind and to all minds necessarily to follow from the premises yet it is not true but the contrary inference is true or to state the dilemma in another formif he sets out with inconceivable propositions then may he with equal propriety make all his succeeding propositions inconceivable onesmay at every step throughout his reasoning draw exactly the opposite conclusion to that which seems involved  hegels mode of procedure being thus essentially suicidal the hegelian classification which depends upon it falls to the ground let us consider next that of m comte  as all his readers must admit m comte presents us with a scheme of the sciences which unlike the foregoing ones demands respectful consideration widely as we differ from him we cheerfully bear witness to the largeness of his views the clearness of his reasoning and the value of his speculations as contributing to intellectual progress did we believe a serial arrangement of the sciences to be possible that of m comte would certainly be the one we should adopt his fundamental propositions are thoroughly intelligible and if not true have a great semblance of truth his successive steps are logically coordinated and he supports his conclusions by a considerable amount of evidenceevidence which so long as it is not critically examined or not met by counter evidence seems to substantiate his positions but it only needs to assume that antagonistic attitude which ought to be assumed towards new doctrines in the belief that if true they will prosper by conquering objectorsit needs but to test his leading doctrines either by other facts than those he cites or by his own facts differently applied to at once show that they will not stand we will proceed thus to deal with the general principle on which he bases his hierarchy of the sciences  in the second chapter of his cours de philosophic positive m comte saysour problem is then to find the one rational order amongst a host of possible systems  this order is determined by the degree of simplicity or what comes to the same thing of generality of their phenomena and the arrangement he deduces runs thus mathematics astronomy physics chemistry physiology social physics this he asserts to be the true filiation of the sciences he asserts further that the principle of progression from a greater to a less degree of generality which gives this order to the whole body of science arranges the parts of each science and finally he asserts that the gradations thus established à priori among the sciences and the parts of each science is in essential conformity with the order which has spontaneously taken place among the branches of natural philosophy or in other wordscorresponds with the order of historic development  let us compare these assertions with the facts that there may be perfect fairness let us make no choice but take as the field for our comparison the succeeding section treating of the first sciencemathematics and let us use none but m comtes own facts and his own admissions confining ourselves to this one science of course our comparisons must be between its several parts m comte says that the parts of each science must be arranged in the order of their decreasing generality and that this order of decreasing generality agrees with the order of historical development our inquiry must be then whether the history of mathematics confirms this statement  carrying out his principle m comte divides mathematics into abstract mathematics or the calculus taking the word in its most extended sense and concrete mathematics which is composed of general geometry and of rational mechanics the subjectmatter of the first of these is number the subjectmatter of the second includes space time motion force the one possesses the highest possible degree of generality for all things whatever admit of enumeration the others are less general seeing that there are endless phenomena that are not cognisable either by general geometry or rational mechanics in conformity with the alleged law therefore the evolution of the calculus must throughout have preceded the evolution of the concrete subsciences now somewhat awkwardly for him the first remark m comte makes bearing upon this point is that from an historical point of view mathematical analysis appears to have risen out of the contemplation of geometrical and mechanical facts true he goes on to say that it is not the less independent of these sciences logically speaking for that analytical ideas are above all others universal abstract and simple and geometrical conceptions are necessarily founded on them  we will not take advantage of this last passage to charge m comte with teaching after the fashion of hegel that there can be thought without things thought of we are content simply to compare the two assertions that analysis arose out of the contemplation of geometrical and mechanical facts and that geometrical conceptions are founded upon analytical ones literally interpreted they exactly cancel each other interpreted however in a liberal sense they imply what we believe to be demonstrable that the two had a simultaneous origin the passage is either nonsense or it is an admission that abstract and concrete mathematics are coeval thus at the very first step the alleged congruity between the order of generality and the order of evolution does not hold good  but may it not be that though abstract and concrete mathematics took their rise at the same time the one afterwards developed more rapidly than the other and has ever since remained in advance of it no and again we call m comte himself as witness fortunately for his argument he has said nothing respecting the early stages of the concrete and abstract divisions after their divergence from a common root otherwise the advent of algebra long after the greek geometry had reached a high development would have been an inconvenient fact for him to deal with but passing over this and limiting ourselves to his own statements we find at the opening of the next chapter the admission that the historical development of the abstract portion of mathematical science has since the time of descartes been for the most part determined by that of the concrete further on we read respecting algebraic functions that most functions were concrete in their origineven those which are at present the most purely abstract and the ancients discovered only through geometrical definitions elementary algebraic properties of functions to which a numerical value was not attached till long afterwards rendering abstract to us what was concrete to the old geometers how do these statements tally with his doctrine again having divided the calculus into algebraic and arithmetical m comte admits as perforce he must that the algebraic is more general than the arithmetical yet he will not say that algebra preceded arithmetic in point of time and again having divided the calculus of functions into the calculus of direct functions common algebra and the calculus of indirect functions transcendental analysis he is obliged to speak of this last as possessing a higher generality than the first yet it is far more modern indeed by implication m comte himself confesses this incongruity for he saysit might seem that the transcendental analysis ought to be studied before the ordinary as it provides the equations which the other has to resolve but though the transcendental is logically independent of the ordinary it is best to follow the usual method of study taking the ordinary first in all these cases then as well as at the close of the section where he predicts that mathematicians will in time create procedures of a wider generality m comte makes admissions that are diametrically opposed to the alleged law  in the succeeding chapters treating of the concrete department of mathematics we find similar contradictions m comte himself names the geometry of the ancients special geometry and that of moderns the general geometry he admits that while the ancients studied geometry with reference to the bodies under notice or specially the moderns study it with reference to the phenomena to be considered or generally he admits that while the ancients extracted all they could out of one line or surface before passing to another the moderns since descartes employ themselves on questions which relate to any figure whatever these facts are the reverse of what according to his theory they should be so too in mechanics before dividing it into statics and dynamics m comte treats of the three laws of motion and is obliged to do so for statics the more general of the two divisions though it does not involve motion is impossible as a science until the laws of motion are ascertained yet the laws of motion pertain to dynamics the more special of the divisions further on he points out that after archimedes who discovered the law of equilibrium of the lever statics made no progress until the establishment of dynamics enabled us to seek the conditions of equilibrium through the laws of the composition of forces and he addsat this day this is the method universally employed at the first glance it does not appear the most rationaldynamics being more complicated than statics and precedence being natural to the simpler it would in fact be more philosophical to refer dynamics to statics as has since been done sundry discoveries are afterwards detailed showing how completely the development of statics has been achieved by considering its problems dynamically and before the close of the section m comte remarks that before hydrostatics could be comprehended under statics it was necessary that the abstract theory of equilibrium should be made so general as to apply directly to fluids as well as solids this was accomplished when lagrange supplied as the basis of the whole of rational mechanics the single principle of virtual velocities in which statement we have two facts directly at variance with m comtes doctrine first that the simpler science statics reached its present development only by the aid of the principle of virtual velocities which belongs to the more complex science dynamics and that this single principle underlying all rational mechanicsthis most general form which includes alike the relations of statical hydrostatical and dynamical forceswas reached so late as the time of lagrange  thus it is not true that the historical succession of the divisions of mathematics has corresponded with the order of decreasing generality it is not true that abstract mathematics was evolved antecedently to and independently of concrete mathematics it is not true that of the subdivisions of abstract mathematics the more general came before the more special and it is not true that concrete mathematics in either of its two sections began with the most abstract and advanced to the less abstract truths  it may be well to mention parenthetically that in defending his alleged law of progression from the general to the special m comte somewhere comments upon the two meanings of the word general and the resulting liability to confusion without now discussing whether the asserted distinction can be maintained in other cases it is manifest that it does not exist here in sundry of the instances above quoted the endeavours made by m comte himself to disguise or to explain away the precedence of the special over the general clearly indicate that the generality spoken of is of the kind meant by his formula and it needs but a brief consideration of the matter to show that even did he attempt it he could not distinguish this generality which as above proved frequently comes last from the generality which he says always comes first for what is the nature of that mental process by which objects dimensions weights times and the rest are found capable of having their relations expressed numerically it is the formation of certain abstract conceptions of unity duality and multiplicity which are applicable to all things alike it is the invention of general symbols serving to express the numerical relations of entities whatever be their special characters and what is the nature of the mental process by which numbers are found capable of having their relations expressed algebraically it is just the same it is the formation of certain abstract conceptions of numerical functions which are the same whatever be the magnitudes of the numbers it is the invention of general symbols serving to express the relations between numbers as numbers express the relations between things and transcendental analysis stands to algebra in the same position that algebra stands in to arithmetic  to briefly illustrate their respective powersarithmetic can express in one formula the value of a particular tangent to a particular curve algebra can express in one formula the values of all tangents to a particular curve transcendental analysis can express in one formula the values of all tangents to all curves just as arithmetic deals with the common properties of lines areas bulks forces periods so does algebra deal with the common properties of the numbers which arithmetic presents so does transcendental analysis deal with the common properties of the equations exhibited by algebra thus the generality of the higher branches of the calculus when compared with the lower is the same kind of generality as that of the lower branches when compared with geometry or mechanics and on examination it will be found that the like relation exists in the various other cases above given  having shown that m comtes alleged law of progression does not hold among the several parts of the same science let us see how it agrees with the facts when applied to separate sciences astronomy says m comte at the opening of book iii was a positive science in its geometrical aspect from the earliest days of the school of alexandria but physics which we are now to consider had no positive character at all till galileo made his great discoveries on the fall of heavy bodies on this our comment is simply that it is a misrepresentation based upon an arbitrary misuse of wordsa mere verbal artifice by choosing to exclude from terrestrial physics those laws of magnitude motion and position which he includes in celestial physics m comte makes it appear that the one owes nothing to the other not only is this altogether unwarrantable but it is radically inconsistent with his own scheme of divisions at the outset he saysand as the point is important we quote from the originalpour la physique inorganique nous voyons dabord en nous conformant toujours a lordre de généralité et de dépendance des phénomènes quelle doit être partagée en deux sections distinctes suivant quelle considère les phénomènes généraux de lunivers ou en particulier ceux que présentent les corps terrestres doù la physique céleste ou lastronomie soit géométrique soit mechanique et la physique terrestre  here then we have inorganic physics clearly divided into celestial physics and terrestrial physicsthe phenomena presented by the universe and the phenomena presented by earthly bodies if now celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies exhibit sundry leading phenomena in common as they do how can the generalisation of these common phenomena be considered as pertaining to the one class rather than to the other if inorganic physics includes geometry which m comte has made it do by comprehending geometrical astronomy in its subsectioncelestial physics and if its subsectionterrestrial physics treats of things having geometrical properties how can the laws of geometrical relations be excluded from terrestrial physics clearly if celestial physics includes the geometry of objects in the heavens terrestrial physics includes the geometry of objects on the earth and if terrestrial physics includes terrestrial geometry while celestial physics includes celestial geometry then the geometrical part of terrestrial physics precedes the geometrical part of celestial physics seeing that geometry gained its first ideas from surrounding objects until men had learnt geometrical relations from bodies on the earth it was impossible for them to understand the geometrical relations of bodies in the heavens  so too with celestial mechanics which had terrestrial mechanics for its parent the very conception of force which underlies the whole of mechanical astronomy is borrowed from our earthly experiences and the leading laws of mechanical action as exhibited in scales levers projectiles etc had to be ascertained before the dynamics of the solar system could be entered upon what were the laws made use of by newton in working out his grand discovery the law of falling bodies disclosed by galileo that of the composition of forces also disclosed by galileo and that of centrifugal force found out by huyghensall of them generalisations of terrestrial physics yet with facts like these before him m comte places astronomy before physics in order of evolution he does not compare the geometrical parts of the two together and the mechanical parts of the two together for this would by no means suit his hypothesis but he compares the geometrical part of the one with the mechanical part of the other and so gives a semblance of truth to his position he is led away by a verbal delusion had he confined his attention to the things and disregarded the words he would have seen that before mankind scientifically coordinated any one class of phenomena displayed in the heavens they had previously coordinated a parallel class of phenomena displayed upon the surface of the earth  were it needful we could fill a score pages with the incongruities of m comtes scheme but the foregoing samples will suffice so far is his law of evolution of the sciences from being tenable that by following his example and arbitrarily ignoring one class of facts it would be possible to present with great plausibility just the opposite generalisation to that which he enunciates while he asserts that the rational order of the sciences like the order of their historic development is determined by the degree of simplicity or what comes to the same thing of generality of their phenomena it might contrariwise be asserted that commencing with the complex and the special mankind have progressed step by step to a knowledge of greater simplicity and wider generality so much evidence is there of this as to have drawn from whewell in his history of the inductive sciences the general remark that the reader has already seen repeatedly in the course of this history complex and derivative principles presenting themselves to mens minds before simple and elementary ones  even from m comtes own work numerous facts admissions and arguments might be picked out tending to show this we have already quoted his words in proof that both abstract and concrete mathematics have progressed towards a higher degree of generality and that he looks forward to a higher generality still just to strengthen this adverse hypothesis let us take a further instance from the particular case of the scales the law of equilibrium of which was familiar to the earliest nations known archimedes advanced to the more general case of the unequal lever with unequal weights the law of equilibrium of which includes that of the scales by the help of galileos discovery concerning the composition of forces dalembert established for the first time the equations of equilibrium of any system of forces applied to the different points of a solid bodyequations which include all cases of levers and an infinity of cases besides clearly this is progress towards a higher generalitytowards a knowledge more independent of special circumstancestowards a study of phenomena the most disengaged from the incidents of particular cases which is m comtes definition of the most simple phenomena does it not indeed follow from the familiarly admitted fact that mental advance is from the concrete to the abstract from the particular to the general that the universal and therefore most simple truths are the last to be discovered is not the government of the solar system by a force varying inversely as the square of the distance a simpler conception than any that preceded it should we ever succeed in reducing all orders of phenomena to some single lawsay of atomic action as m comte suggestsmust not that law answer to his test of being independent of all others and therefore most simple and would not such a law generalise the phenomena of gravity cohesion atomic affinity and electric repulsion just as the laws of number generalise the quantitative phenomena of space time and force  the possibility of saying so much in support of an hypothesis the very reverse of m comtes at once proves that his generalisation is only a halftruth the fact is that neither proposition is correct by itself and the actuality is expressed only by putting the two together the progress of science is duplex it is at once from the special to the general and from the general to the special it is analytical and synthetical at the same time  m comte himself observes that the evolution of science has been accomplished by the division of labour but he quite misstates the mode in which this division of labour has operated as he describes it it has simply been an arrangement of phenomena into classes and the study of each class by itself he does not recognise the constant effect of progress in each class upon all other classes but only on the class succeeding it in his hierarchical scale or if he occasionally admits collateral influences and intercommunications he does it so grudgingly and so quickly puts the admissions out of sight and forgets them as to leave the impression that with but trifling exceptions the sciences aid each other only in the order of their alleged succession the fact is however that the division of labour in science like the division of labour in society and like the physiological division of labour in individual organisms has been not only a specialisation of functions but a continuous helping of each division by all the others and of all by each every particular class of inquirers has as it were secreted its own particular order of truths from the general mass of material which observation accumulates and all other classes of inquirers have made use of these truths as fast as they were elaborated with the effect of enabling them the better to elaborate each its own order of truths  it was thus in sundry of the cases we have quoted as at variance with m comtes doctrine it was thus with the application of huyghenss optical discovery to astronomical observation by galileo it was thus with the application of the isochronism of the pendulum to the making of instruments for measuring intervals astronomical and other it was thus when the discovery that the refraction and dispersion of light did not follow the same law of variation affected both astronomy and physiology by giving us achromatic telescopes and microscopes it was thus when bradleys discovery of the aberration of light enabled him to make the first step towards ascertaining the motions of the stars it was thus when cavendishs torsionbalance experiment determined the specific gravity of the earth and so gave a datum for calculating the specific gravities of the sun and planets it was thus when tables of atmospheric refraction enabled observers to write down the real places of the heavenly bodies instead of their apparent places it was thus when the discovery of the different expansibilities of metals by heat gave us the means of correcting our chronometrical measurements of astronomical periods it was thus when the lines of the prismatic spectrum were used to distinguish the heavenly bodies that are of like nature with the sun from those which are not it was thus when as recently an electrotelegraphic instrument was invented for the more accurate registration of meridional transits it was thus when the difference in the rates of a clock at the equator and nearer the poles gave data for calculating the oblateness of the earth and accounting for the precession of the equinoxes it was thusbut it is needless to continue  here within our own limited knowledge of its history we have named ten additional cases in which the single science of astronomy has owed its advance to sciences coming after it in m comtes series not only its secondary steps but its greatest revolutions have been thus determined kepler could not have discovered his celebrated laws had it not been for tycho brahes accurate observations and it was only after some progress in physical and chemical science that the improved instruments with which those observations were made became possible the heliocentric theory of the solar system had to wait until the invention of the telescope before it could be finally established nay even the grand discovery of allthe law of gravitationdepended for its proof upon an operation of physical science the measurement of a degree on the earths surface so completely indeed did it thus depend that newton had actually abandoned his hypothesis because the length of a degree as then stated brought out wrong results and it was only after picarts more exact measurement was published that he returned to his calculations and proved his great generalisation now this constant intercommunion which for brevitys sake we have illustrated in the case of one science only has been taking place with all the sciences throughout the whole course of their evolution there has been a continuous consensus of the sciencesa consensus exhibiting a general correspondence with the consensus of faculties in each phase of mental development the one being an objective registry of the subjective state of the other  from our present point of view then it becomes obvious that the conception of a serial arrangement of the sciences is a vicious one it is not simply that the schemes we have examined are untenable but it is that the sciences cannot be rightly placed in any linear order whatever it is not simply that as m comte admits a classification will always involve something if not arbitrary at least artificial it is not as he would have us believe that neglecting minor imperfections a classification may be substantially true but it is that any grouping of the sciences in a succession gives a radically erroneous idea of their genesis and their dependencies there is no one rational order among a host of possible systems there is no true filiation of the sciences the whole hypothesis is fundamentally false indeed it needs but a glance at its origin to see at once how baseless it is why a series what reason have we to suppose that the sciences admit of a linear arrangement where is our warrant for assuming that there is some succession in which they can be placed there is no reason no warrant whence then has arisen the supposition to use m comtes own phraseology we should say it is a metaphysical conception it adds another to the cases constantly occurring of the human mind being made the measure of nature we are obliged to think in sequence it is the law of our minds that we must consider subjects separately one after another therefore nature must be serialtherefore the sciences must be classifiable in a succession see here the birth of the notion and the sole evidence of its truth men have been obliged when arranging in books their schemes of education and systems of knowledge to choose some order or other and from inquiring what is the best order have naturally fallen into the belief that there is an order which truly represents the factshave persevered in seeking such an order quite overlooking the previous question whether it is likely that nature has consulted the convenience of bookmaking  for german philosophers who hold that nature is petrified intelligence and that logical forms are the foundations of all things it is a consistent hypothesis that as thought is serial nature is serial but that m comte who is so bitter an opponent of all anthropomorphism even in its most evanescent shapes should have committed the mistake of imposing upon the external world an arrangement which so obviously springs from a limitation of the human consciousness is somewhat strange and it is the more strange when we call to mind how at the outset m comte remarks that in the beginning toutes les sciences sont cultivées simultanément par les mêmes esprits that this is inevitable et même indispensable and how he further remarks that the different sciences are comme les diverses branches dun tronc unique were it not accounted for by the distorting influence of a cherished hypothesis it would be scarcely possible to understand how after recognising truths like these m comte should have persisted in attempting to construct une échelle encyclopédique  the metaphor which m comte has here so inconsistently used to express the relations of the sciencesbranches of one trunkis an approximation to the truth though not the truth itself it suggests the facts that the sciences had a common origin that they have been developing simultaneously and that they have been from time to time dividing and subdividing but it does not suggest the yet more important fact that the divisions and subdivisions thus arising do not remain separate but now and again reunite in direct and indirect ways they inosculate they severally send off and receive connecting growths and the intercommunion has been ever becoming more frequent more intricate more widely ramified there has all along been higher specialisation that there might be a larger generalisation and a deeper analysis that there might be a better synthesis each larger generalisation has lifted sundry specialisations still higher and each better synthesis has prepared the way for still deeper analysis  and here we may fitly enter upon the task awhile since indicateda sketch of the genesis of science regarded as a gradual outgrowth from common knowledgean extension of the perceptions by the aid of the reason we propose to treat it as a psychological process historically displayed tracing at the same time the advance from qualitative to quantitative prevision the progress from concrete facts to abstract facts and the application of such abstract facts to the analysis of new orders of concrete facts the simultaneous advance in generalisation and specialisation the continually increasing subdivision and reunion of the sciences and their constantly improving consensus  to trace out scientific evolution from its deepest roots would of course involve a complete analysis of the mind for as science is a development of that common knowledge acquired by the unaided senses and uncultured reason so is that common knowledge itself gradually built up out of the simplest perceptions we must therefore begin somewhere abruptly and the most appropriate stage to take for our point of departure will be the adult mind of the savage  commencing thus without a proper preliminary analysis we are naturally somewhat at a loss how to present in a satisfactory manner those fundamental processes of thought out of which science ultimately originates perhaps our argument may be best initiated by the proposition that all intelligent action whatever depends upon the discerning of distinctions among surrounding things the condition under which only it is possible for any creature to obtain food and avoid danger is that it shall be differently affected by different objectsthat it shall be led to act in one way by one object and in another way by another in the lower orders of creatures this condition is fulfilled by means of an apparatus which acts automatically in the higher orders the actions are partly automatic partly conscious and in man they are almost wholly conscious  throughout however there must necessarily exist a certain classification of things according to their propertiesa classification which is either organically registered in the system as in the inferior creation or is formed by experience as in ourselves and it may be further remarked that the extent to which this classification is carried roughly indicates the height of intelligencethat while the lowest organisms are able to do little more than discriminate organic from inorganic matter while the generality of animals carry their classifications no further than to a limited number of plants or creatures serving for food a limited number of beasts of prey and a limited number of places and materials the most degraded of the human race possess a knowledge of the distinctive natures of a great variety of substances plants animals tools persons etc not only as classes but as individuals  what now is the mental process by which classification is effected manifestly it is a recognition of the likeness or unlikeness of things either in respect of their sizes colours forms weights textures tastes etc or in respect of their modes of action by some special mark sound or motion the savage identifies a certain fourlegged creature he sees as one that is good for food and to be caught in a particular way or as one that is dangerous and acts accordingly he has classed together all the creatures that are alike in this particular and manifestly in choosing the wood out of which to form his bow the plant with which to poison his arrows the bone from which to make his fishhooks he identifies them through their chief sensible properties as belonging to the general classes wood plant and bone but distinguishes them as belonging to subclasses by virtue of certain properties in which they are unlike the rest of the general classes they belong to and so forms genera and species  and here it becomes manifest that not only is classification carried on by grouping together in the mind things that are like but that classes and subclasses are formed and arranged according to the degrees of unlikeness things widely contrasted are alone distinguished in the lower stages of mental evolution as may be any day observed in an infant and gradually as the powers of discrimination increase the widely contrasted classes at first distinguished come to be each divided into subclasses differing from each other less than the classes differ and these subclasses are again divided after the same manner by the continuance of which process things are gradually arranged into groups the members of which are less and less unlike ending finally in groups whose members differ only as individuals and not specifically and thus there tends ultimately to arise the notion of complete likeness for manifestly it is impossible that groups should continue to be subdivided in virtue of smaller and smaller differences without there being a simultaneous approximation to the notion of no difference  let us next notice that the recognition of likeness and unlikeness which underlies classification and out of which continued classification evolves the idea of complete likenesslet us next notice that it also underlies the process of naming and by consequence language for all language consists at the beginning of symbols which are as like to the things symbolised as it is practicable to make them the language of signs is a means of conveying ideas by mimicking the actions or peculiarities of the things referred to verbal language is also at the beginning a mode of suggesting objects or acts by imitating the sounds which the objects make or with which the acts are accompanied originally these two languages were used simultaneously it needs but to watch the gesticulations with which the savage accompanies his speechto see a bushman or a kaffir dramatising before an audience his mode of catching gameor to note the extreme paucity of words in all primitive vocabularies to infer that at first attitudes gestures and sounds were all combined to produce as good a likeness as possible of the things animals persons or events described and that as the sounds came to be understood by themselves the gestures fell into disuse leaving traces however in the manners of the more excitable civilised races but be this as it may it suffices simply to observe how many of the words current among barbarous peoples are like the sounds appertaining to the things signified how many of our own oldest and simplest words have the same peculiarity how children tend to invent imitative words and how the signlanguage spontaneously formed by deaf mutes is invariably based upon imitative actionsto at once see that the nation of likeness is that from which the nomenclature of objects takes its rise  were there space we might go on to point out how this law of life is traceable not only in the origin but in the development of language how in primitive tongues the plural is made by a duplication of the singular which is a multiplication of the word to make it like the multiplicity of the things how the use of metaphorthat prolific source of new wordsis a suggesting of ideas that are like the ideas to be conveyed in some respect or other and how in the copious use of simile fable and allegory among uncivilised races we see that complex conceptions which there is yet no direct language for are rendered by presenting known conceptions more or less like them  this view is further confirmed and the predominance of this notion of likeness in primitive times further illustrated by the fact that our system of presenting ideas to the eye originated after the same fashion writing and printing have descended from picturelanguage the earliest mode of permanently registering a fact was by depicting it on a wall that isby exhibiting something as like to the thing to be remembered as it could be made gradually as the practice grew habitual and extensive the most frequently repeated forms became fixed and presently abbreviated and passing through the hieroglyphic and ideographic phases the symbols lost all apparent relations to the things signified just as the majority of our spoken words have done  observe again that the same thing is true respecting the genesis of reasoning the likeness that is perceived to exist between cases is the essence of all early reasoning and of much of our present reasoning the savage having by experience discovered a relation between a certain object and a certain act infers that the like relation will be found in future cases and the expressions we constantly use in our argumentsanalogy implies the cases are not parallel by parity of reasoning there is no similarityshow how constantly the idea of likeness underlies our ratiocinative processes  still more clearly will this be seen on recognising the fact that there is a certain parallelism between reasoning and classification that the two have a common root and that neither can go on without the other for on the one hand it is a familiar truth that the attributing to a body in consequence of some of its properties all those other properties in virtue of which it is referred to a particular class is an act of inference and on the other hand the forming of a generalisation is the putting together in one class all those cases which present like relations while the drawing a deduction is essentially the perception that a particular case belongs to a certain class of cases previously generalised so that as classification is a grouping together of like things reasoning is a grouping together of like relations among things add to which that while the perfection gradually achieved in classification consists in the formation of groups of objects which are completely alike the perfection gradually achieved in reasoning consists in the formation of groups of cases which are completely alike  once more we may contemplate this dominant idea of likeness as exhibited in art all art civilised as well as savage consists almost wholly in the making of objects like other objects either as found in nature or as produced by previous art if we trace back the varied artproducts now existing we find that at each stage the divergence from previous patterns is but small when compared with the agreement and in the earliest art the persistency of imitation is yet more conspicuous the old forms and ornaments and symbols were held sacred and perpetually copied indeed the strong imitative tendency notoriously displayed by the lowest human races ensures among them a constant reproducing of likeness of things forms signs sounds actions and whatever else is imitable and we may even suspect that this aboriginal peculiarity is in some way connected with the culture and development of this general conception which we have found so deep and widespread in its applications  and now let us go on to consider how by a further unfolding of this same fundamental notion there is a gradual formation of the first germs of science this idea of likeness which underlies classification nomenclature language spoken and written reasoning and art and which plays so important a part because all acts of intelligence are made possible only by distinguishing among surrounding things or grouping them into like and unlikethis idea we shall find to be the one of which science is the especial product already during the stage we have been describing there has existed qualitative prevision in respect to the commoner phenomena with which savage life is familiar and we have now to inquire how the elements of quantitative prevision are evolved we shall find that they originate by the perfecting of this same idea of likeness that they have their rise in that conception of complete likeness which as we have seen necessarily results from the continued process of classification  for when the process of classification has been carried as far as it is possible for the uncivilised to carry itwhen the animal kingdom has been grouped not merely into quadrupeds birds fishes and insects but each of these divided into kindswhen there come to be subclasses in each of which the members differ only as individuals and not specifically it is clear that there must occur a frequent observation of objects which differ so little as to be indistinguishable among several creatures which the savage has killed and carried home it must often happen that some one which he wished to identify is so exactly like another that he cannot tell which is which thus then there originates the notion of equality the things which among ourselves are called equalwhether lines angles weights temperatures sounds or coloursare things which produce in us sensations that cannot be distinguished from each other it is true we now apply the word equal chiefly to the separate phenomena which objects exhibit and not to groups of phenomena but this limitation of the idea has evidently arisen by subsequent analysis and that the notion of equality did thus originate will we think become obvious on remembering that as there were no artificial objects from which it could have been abstracted it must have been abstracted from natural objects and that the various families of the animal kingdom chiefly furnish those natural objects which display the requisite exactitude of likeness  the same order of experiences out of which this general idea of equality is evolved gives birth at the same time to a more complex idea of equality or rather the process just described generates an idea of equality which further experience separates into two ideasequality of things and equality of relations while organic and more especially animal forms occasionally exhibit this perfection of likeness out of which the notion of simple equality arises they more frequently exhibit only that kind of likeness which we call similarity and which is really compound equality for the similarity of two creatures of the same species but of different sizes is of the same nature as the similarity of two geometrical figures in either case any two parts of the one bear the same ratio to one another as the homologous parts of the other given in any species the proportions found to exist among the bones and we may and zoologists do predict from any one the dimensions of the rest just as when knowing the proportions subsisting among the parts of a geometrical figure we may from the length of one calculate the others and if in the case of similar geometrical figures the similarity can be established only by proving exactness of proportion among the homologous parts if we express this relation between two parts in the one and the corresponding parts in the other by the formula a is to b as a is to b if we otherwise write this a to b  a to b if consequently the fact we prove is that the relation of a to b equals the relation of a to b then it is manifest that the fundamental conception of similarity is equality of relations  with this explanation we shall be understood when we say that the notion of equality of relations is the basis of all exact reasoning already it has been shown that reasoning in general is a recognition of likeness of relations and here we further find that while the notion of likeness of things ultimately evolves the idea of simple equality the notion of likeness of relations evolves the idea of equality of relations of which the one is the concrete germ of exact science while the other is its abstract germ  those who cannot understand how the recognition of similarity in creatures of the same kind can have any alliance with reasoning will get over the difficulty on remembering that the phenomena among which equality of relations is thus perceived are phenomena of the same order and are present to the senses at the same time while those among which developed reason perceives relations are generally neither of the same order nor simultaneously present and if further they will call to mind how cuvier and owen from a single part of a creature as a tooth construct the rest by a process of reasoning based on this equality of relations they will see that the two things are intimately connected remote as they at first seem but we anticipate what it concerns us here to observe is that from familiarity with organic forms there simultaneously arose the ideas of simple equality and equality of relations  at the same time too and out of the same mental processes came the first distinct ideas of number in the earliest stages the presentation of several like objects produced merely an indefinite conception of multiplicity as it still does among australians and bushmen and damaras when the number presented exceeds three or four with such a fact before us we may safely infer that the first clear numerical conception was that of duality as contrasted with unity and this notion of duality must necessarily have grown up side by side with those of likeness and equality seeing that it is impossible to recognise the likeness of two things without also perceiving that there are two from the very beginning the conception of number must have been as it is still associated with the likeness or equality of the things numbered if we analyse it we find that simple enumeration is a registration of repeated impressions of any kind that these may be capable of enumeration it is needful that they be more or less alike and before any absolutely true numerical results can be reached it is requisite that the units be absolutely equal the only way in which we can establish a numerical relationship between things that do not yield us like impressions is to divide them into parts that do yield us like impressions two unlike magnitudes of extension force time weight or what not can have their relative amounts estimated only by means of some small unit that is contained many times in both and even if we finally write down the greater one as a unit and the other as a fraction of it we state in the denominator of the fraction the number of parts into which the unit must be divided to be comparable with the fraction  it is indeed true that by an evidently modern process of abstraction we occasionally apply numbers to unequal units as the furniture at a sale or the various animals on a farm simply as so many separate entities but no true result can be brought out by calculation with units of this order and indeed it is the distinctive peculiarity of the calculus in general that it proceeds on the hypothesis of that absolute equality of its abstract units which no real units possess and that the exactness of its results holds only in virtue of this hypothesis the first ideas of number must necessarily then have been derived from like or equal magnitudes as seen chiefly in organic objects and as the like magnitudes most frequently observed magnitudes of extension it follows that geometry and arithmetic had a simultaneous origin  not only are the first distinct ideas of number coordinate with ideas of likeness and equality but the first efforts at numeration displayed the same relationship on reading the accounts of various savage tribes we find that the method of counting by the fingers still followed by many children is the aboriginal method neglecting the several cases in which the ability to enumerate does not reach even to the number of fingers on one hand there are many cases in which it does not extend beyond tenthe limit of the simple finger notation the fact that in so many instances remote and seemingly unrelated nations have adopted ten as their basic number together with the fact that in the remaining instances the basic number is either five the fingers of one hand or twenty the fingers and toes almost of themselves show that the fingers were the original units of numeration the still surviving use of the word digit as the general name for a figure in arithmetic is significant and it is even said that our word ten sax tyn dutch tien german zehn means in its primitive expanded form two hands so that originally to say there were ten things was to say there were two hands of them  from all which evidence it is tolerably clear that the earliest mode of conveying the idea of any number of things was by holding up as many fingers as there were things that isusing a symbol which was equal in respect of multiplicity to the group symbolised for which inference there is indeed strong confirmation in the recent statement that our own soldiers are even now spontaneously adopting this device in their dealings with the turks and here it should be remarked that in this recombination of the notion of equality with that of multiplicity by which the first steps in numeration are effected we may see one of the earliest of those inosculations between the diverging branches of science which are afterwards of perpetual occurrence  indeed as this observation suggests it will be well before tracing the mode in which exact science finally emerges from the merely approximate judgments of the senses and showing the nonserial evolution of its divisions to note the nonserial character of those preliminary processes of which all after development is a continuation on reconsidering them it will be seen that not only are they divergent growths from a common root not only are they simultaneous in their progress but that they are mutual aids and that none can advance without the rest that completeness of classification for which the unfolding of the perceptions paves the way is impossible without a corresponding progress in language by which greater varieties of objects are thinkable and expressible on the one hand it is impossible to carry classification far without names by which to designate the classes and on the other hand it is impossible to make language faster than things are classified  again the multiplication of classes and the consequent narrowing of each class itself involves a greater likeness among the things classed together and the consequent approach towards the notion of complete likeness itself allows classification to be carried higher moreover classification necessarily advances pari passu with rationalitythe classification of things with the classification of relations for things that belong to the same class are by implication things of which the properties and modes of behaviourthe coexistences and sequencesare more or less the same and the recognition of this sameness of coexistences and sequences is reasoning whence it follows that the advance of classification is necessarily proportionate to the advance of generalisations yet further the notion of likeness both in things and relations simultaneously evolves by one process of culture the ideas of equality of things and equality of relations which are the respective bases of exact concrete reasoning and exact abstract reasoningmathematics and logic and once more this idea of equality in the very process of being formed necessarily gives origin to two series of relationsthose of magnitude and those of number from which arise geometry and the calculus thus the process throughout is one of perpetual subdivision and perpetual intercommunication of the divisions from the very first there has been that consensus of different kinds of knowledge answering to the consensus of the intellectual faculties which as already said must exist among the sciences  let us now go on to observe how out of the notions of equality and number as arrived at in the manner described there gradually arose the elements of quantitative prevision  equality once having come to be definitely conceived was readily applicable to other phenomena than those of magnitude being predicable of all things producing indistinguishable impressions there naturally grew up ideas of equality in weights sounds colours etc and indeed it can scarcely be doubted that the occasional experience of equal weights sounds and colours had a share in developing the abstract conception of equalitythat the ideas of equality in size relations forces resistances and sensible properties in general were evolved during the same period but however this may be it is clear that as fast as the notion of equality gained definiteness so fast did that lowest kind of quantitative prevision which is achieved without any instrumental aid become possible  the ability to estimate however roughly the amount of a foreseen result implies the conception that it will be equal to a certain imagined quantity and the correctness of the estimate will manifestly depend upon the accuracy at which the perceptions of sensible equality have arrived a savage with a piece of stone in his hand and another piece lying before him of greater bulk of the same kind a fact which he infers from the equality of the two in colour and texture knows about what effort he must put forth to raise this other piece and he judges accurately in proportion to the accuracy with which he perceives that the one is twice three times four times etc as large as the other that isin proportion to the precision of his ideas of equality and number and here let us not omit to notice that even in these vaguest of quantitative previsions the conception of equality of relations is also involved for it is only in virtue of an undefined perception that the relation between bulk and weight in the one stone is equal to the relation between bulk and weight in the other that even the roughest approximation can be made  but how came the transition from those uncertain perceptions of equality which the unaided senses give to the certain ones with which science deals it came by placing the things compared in juxtaposition equality being predicated of things which give us indistinguishable impressions and no accurate comparison of impressions being possible unless they occur in immediate succession it results that exactness of equality is ascertainable in proportion to the closeness of the compared things hence the fact that when we wish to judge of two shades of colour whether they are alike or not we place them side by side hence the fact that we cannot with any precision say which of two allied sounds is the louder or the higher in pitch unless we hear the one immediately after the other hence the fact that to estimate the ratio of weights we take one in each hand that we may compare their pressures by rapidly alternating in thought from the one to the other hence the fact that in a piece of music we can continue to make equal beats when the first beat has been given but cannot ensure commencing with the same length of beat on a future occasion and hence lastly the fact that of all magnitudes those of linear extension are those of which the equality is most accurately ascertainable and those to which by consequence all others have to be reduced for it is the peculiarity of linear extension that it alone allows its magnitudes to be placed in absolute juxtaposition or rather in coincident position it alone can test the equality of two magnitudes by observing whether they will coalesce as two equal mathematical lines do when placed between the same points it alone can test equality by trying whether it will become identity hence then the fact that all exact science is reducible by an ultimate analysis to results measured in equal units of linear extension  still it remains to be noticed in what manner this determination of equality by comparison of linear magnitudes originated once more may we perceive that surrounding natural objects supplied the needful lessons from the beginning there must have been a constant experience of like things placed side by sidemen standing and walking together animals from the same herd fish from the same shoal and the ceaseless repetition of these experiences could not fail to suggest the observation that the nearer together any objects were the more visible became any inequality between them hence the obvious device of putting in apposition things of which it was desired to ascertain the relative magnitudes hence the idea of measure and here we suddenly come upon a group of facts which afford a solid basis to the remainder of our argument while they also furnish strong evidence in support of the foregoing speculations those who look sceptically on this attempted rehabilitation of the earliest epochs of mental development and who more especially think that the derivation of so many primary notions from organic forms is somewhat strained will perhaps see more probability in the several hypotheses that have been ventured on discovering that all measures of extension and force originated from the lengths and weights of organic bodies and all measures of time from the periodic phenomena of either organic or inorganic bodies  thus among linear measures the cubit of the hebrews was the length of the forearm from the elbow to the end of the middle finger and the smaller scriptural dimensions are expressed in handbreadths and spans the egyptian cubit which was similarly derived was divided into digits which were fingerbreadths and each fingerbreadth was more definitely expressed as being equal to four grains of barley placed breadthwise other ancient measures were the orgyia or stretch of the arms the pace and the palm so persistent has been the use of these natural units of length in the east that even now some of the arabs mete out cloth by the forearm so too is it with european measures the foot prevails as a dimension throughout europe and has done since the time of the romans by whom also it was used its lengths in different places varying not much more than mens feet vary the heights of horses are still expressed in hands the inch is the length of the terminal joint of the thumb as is clearly shown in france where pouce means both thumb and inch then we have the inch divided into three barleycorns  so completely indeed have these organic dimensions served as the substrata of all mensuration that it is only by means of them that we can form any estimate of some of the ancient distances for example the length of a degree on the earths surface as determined by the arabian astronomers shortly after the death of harounalraschid was fiftysix of their miles we know nothing of their mile further than that it was 4000 cubits and whether these were sacred cubits or common cubits would remain doubtful but that the length of the cubit is given as twentyseven inches and each inch defined as the thickness of six barleygrains thus one of the earliest measurements of a degree comes down to us in barleygrains not only did organic lengths furnish those approximate measures which satisfied mens needs in ruder ages but they furnished also the standard measures required in later times one instance occurs in our own history to remedy the irregularities then prevailing henry i commanded that the ulna or ancient ell which answers to the modern yard should be made of the exact length of his own arm  measures of weight again had a like derivation seeds seem commonly to have supplied the unit the original of the carat used for weighing in india is a small bean our own systems both troy and avoirdupois are derived primarily from wheatcorns our smallest weight the grain is a grain of wheat this is not a speculation it is an historically registered fact henry iii enacted that an ounce should be the weight of 640 dry grains of wheat from the middle of the ear and as all the other weights are multiples or submultiples of this it follows that the grain of wheat is the basis of our scale so natural is it to use organic bodies as weights before artificial weights have been established or where they are not to be had that in some of the remoter parts of ireland the people are said to be in the habit even now of putting a man into the scales to serve as a measure for heavy commodities  similarly with time astronomical periodicity and the periodicity of animal and vegetable life are simultaneously used in the first stages of progress for estimating epochs the simplest unit of time the day nature supplies ready made the next simplest period the mooneth or month is also thrust upon mens notice by the conspicuous changes constituting a lunation for larger divisions than these the phenomena of the seasons and the chief events from time to time occurring have been used by early and uncivilised races among the egyptians the rising of the nile served as a mark the new zealanders were found to begin their year from the reappearance of the pleiades above the sea one of the uses ascribed to birds by the greeks was to indicate the seasons by their migrations barrow describes the aboriginal hottentot as denoting periods by the number of moons before or after the ripening of one of his chief articles of food he further states that the kaffir chronology is kept by the moon and is registered by notches on sticksthe death of a favourite chief or the gaining of a victory serving for a new era by which last fact we are at once reminded that in early history events are commonly recorded as occurring in certain reigns and in certain years of certain reigns a proceeding which practically made a kings reign a measure of duration  and as further illustrating the tendency to divide time by natural phenomena and natural events it may be noticed that even by our own peasantry the definite divisions of months and years are but little used and that they habitually refer to occurrences as before sheepshearing or after harvest or about the time when the squire died it is manifest therefore that the more or less equal periods perceived in nature gave the first units of measure for time as did natures more or less equal lengths and weights give the first units of measure for space and force  it remains only to observe as further illustrating the evolution of quantitative ideas after this manner that measures of value were similarly derived barter in one form or other is found among all but the very lowest human races it is obviously based upon the notion of equality of worth and as it gradually merges into trade by the introduction of some kind of currency we find that the measures of worth constituting this currency are organic bodies in some cases cowries in others cocoanuts in others cattle in others pigs among the american indians peltry or skins and in iceland dried fish  notions of exact equality and of measure having been reached there came to be definite ideas of relative magnitudes as being multiples one of another whence the practice of measurement by direct apposition of a measure the determination of linear extensions by this process can scarcely be called science though it is a step towards it but the determination of lengths of time by an analogous process may be considered as one of the earliest samples of quantitative prevision for when it is first ascertained that the moon completes the cycle of her changes in about thirty daysa fact known to most uncivilised tribes that can count beyond the number of their fingersit is manifest that it becomes possible to say in what number of days any specified phase of the moon will recur and it is also manifest that this prevision is effected by an opposition of two times after the same manner that linear space is measured by the opposition of two lines for to express the moons period in days is to say how many of these units of measure are contained in the period to be measuredis to ascertain the distance between two points in time by means of a scale of days just as we ascertain the distance between two points in space by a scale of feet or inches and in each case the scale coincides with the thing measuredmentally in the one visibly in the other so that in this simplest and perhaps earliest case of quantitative prevision the phenomena are not only thrust daily upon mens notice but nature is as it were perpetually repeating that process of measurement by observing which the prevision is effected and thus there may be significance in the remark which some have made that alike in hebrew greek and latin there is an affinity between the word meaning moon and that meaning measure  this fact that in very early stages of social progress it is known that the moon goes through her changes in about thirty days and that in about twelve moons the seasons returnthis fact that chronological astronomy assumes a certain scientific character even before geometry does while it is partly due to the circumstance that the astronomical divisions day month and year are ready made for us is partly due to the further circumstances that agricultural and other operations were at first regulated astronomically and that from the supposed divine nature of the heavenly bodies their motions determined the periodical religious festivals as instances of the one we have the observation of the egyptians that the rising of the nile corresponded with the heliacal rising of sirius the directions given by hesiod for reaping and ploughing according to the positions of the pleiades and his maxim that fifty days after the turning of the sun is a seasonable time for beginning a voyage as instances of the other we have the naming of the days after the sun moon and planets the early attempts among eastern nations to regulate the calendar so that the gods might not be offended by the displacement of their sacrifices and the fixing of the great annual festival of the peruvians by the position of the sun in all which facts we see that at first science was simply an appliance of religion and industry  after the discoveries that a lunation occupies nearly thirty days and that some twelve lunations occupy a yeardiscoveries of which there is no historical account but which may be inferred as the earliest from the fact that existing uncivilised races have made themwe come to the first known astronomical records which are those of eclipses the chaldeans were able to predict these this they did probably says dr whewell in his useful history from which most of the materials we are about to use will be drawn by means of their cycle of 223 months or about eighteen years for at the end of this time the eclipses of the moon begin to return at the same intervals and in the same order as at the beginning now this method of calculating eclipses by means of a recurring cyclethe saros as they called itis a more complex case of prevision by means of coincidence of measures for by what observations must the chaldeans have discovered this cycle obviously as delambre infers by inspecting their registers by comparing the successive intervals by finding that some of the intervals were alike by seeing that these equal intervals were eighteen years apart by discovering that all the intervals that were eighteen years apart were equal by ascertaining that the intervals formed a series which repeated itself so that if one of the cycles of intervals were superposed on another the divisions would fit this once perceived and it manifestly became possible to use the cycle as a scale of time by which to measure out future periods seeing thus that the process of so predicting eclipses is in essence the same as that of predicting the moons monthly changes by observing the number of days after which they repeatseeing that the two differ only in the extent and irregularity of the intervals it is not difficult to understand how such an amount of knowledge should so early have been reached and we shall be less surprised on remembering that the only things involved in these previsions were time and number and that the time was in a manner selfnumbered  still the ability to predict events recurring only after so long a period as eighteen years implies a considerable advance in civilisationa considerable development of general knowledge and we have now to inquire what progress in other sciences accompanied and was necessary to these astronomical previsions in the first place there must clearly have been a tolerably efficient system of calculation mere fingercounting mere headreckoning even with the aid of a regular decimal notation could not have sufficed for numbering the days in a year much less the years months and days between eclipses consequently there must have been a mode of registering numbers probably even a system of numerals the earliest numerical records if we may judge by the practices of the less civilised races now existing were probably kept by notches cut on sticks or strokes marked on walls much as publichouse scores are kept now and there seems reason to believe that the first numerals used were simply groups of straight strokes as some of the stillextant roman ones are leading us to suspect that these groups of strokes were used to represent groups of fingers as the groups of fingers had been used to represent groups of objectsa supposition quite in conformity with the aboriginal system of picture writing and its subsequent modifications be this so or not however it is manifest that before the chaldeans discovered their saros there must have been both a set of written symbols serving for an extensive numeration and a familiarity with the simpler rules of arithmetic  not only must abstract mathematics have made some progress but concrete mathematics also it is scarcely possible that the buildings belonging to this era should have been laid out and erected without any knowledge of geometry at any rate there must have existed that elementary geometry which deals with direct measurementwith the apposition of lines and it seems that only after the discovery of those simple proceedings by which right angles are drawn and relative positions fixed could so regular an architecture be executed in the case of the other division of concrete mathematicsmechanics we have definite evidence of progress we know that the lever and the inclined plane were employed during this period implying that there was a qualitative prevision of their effects though not a quantitative one but we know more we read of weights in the earliest records and we find weights in ruins of the highest antiquity weights imply scales of which we have also mention and scales involve the primary theorem of mechanics in its least complicated forminvolve not a qualitative but a quantitative prevision of mechanical effects and here we may notice how mechanics in common with the other exact sciences took its rise from the simplest application of the idea of equality for the mechanical proposition which the scales involve is that if a lever with equal arms have equal weights suspended from them the weights will remain at equal altitudes and we may further notice how in this first step of rational mechanics we see illustrated that truth awhile since referred to that as magnitudes of linear extension are the only ones of which the equality is exactly ascertainable the equalities of other magnitudes have at the outset to be determined by means of them for the equality of the weights which balance each other in scales wholly depends upon the equality of the arms we can know that the weights are equal only by proving that the arms are equal and when by this means we have obtained a system of weightsa set of equal units of force then does a science of mechanics become possible whence indeed it follows that rational mechanics could not possibly have any other startingpoint than the scales  let us further remember that during this same period there was a limited knowledge of chemistry the many arts which we know to have been carried on must have been impossible without a generalised experience of the modes in which certain bodies affect each other under special conditions in metallurgy which was extensively practised this is abundantly illustrated and we even have evidence that in some cases the knowledge possessed was in a sense quantitative for as we find by analysis that the hard alloy of which the egyptians made their cutting tools was composed of copper and tin in fixed proportions there must have been an established prevision that such an alloy was to be obtained only by mixing them in these proportions it is true this was but a simple empirical generalisation but so was the generalisation respecting the recurrence of eclipses so are the first generalisations of every science  respecting the simultaneous advance of the sciences during this early epoch it only remains to remark that even the most complex of them must have made some progressperhaps even a greater relative progress than any of the rest for under what conditions only were the foregoing developments possible there first required an established and organised social system a long continued registry of eclipses the building of palaces the use of scales the practice of metallurgyalike imply a fixed and populous nation the existence of such a nation not only presupposes laws and some administration of justice which we know existed but it presupposes successful lawslaws conforming in some degree to the conditions of social stabilitylaws enacted because it was seen that the actions forbidden by them were dangerous to the state we do not by any means say that all or even the greater part of the laws were of this nature but we do say that the fundamental ones were it cannot be denied that the laws affecting life and property were such it cannot be denied that however little these were enforced between class and class they were to a considerable extent enforced between members of the same class it can scarcely be questioned that the administration of them between members of the same class was seen by rulers to be necessary for keeping their subjects together and knowing as we do that other things equal nations prosper in proportion to the justness of their arrangements we may fairly infer that the very cause of the advance of these earliest nations out of aboriginal barbarism was the greater recognition among them of the claims to life and property  but supposition aside it is clear that the habitual recognition of these claims in their laws implied some prevision of social phenomena even thus early there was a certain amount of social science nay it may even be shown that there was a vague recognition of that fundamental principle on which all the true social science is basedthe equal rights of all to the free exercise of their faculties that same idea of equality which as we have seen underlies all other science underlies also morals and sociology the conception of justice which is the primary one in morals and the administration of justice which is the vital condition of social existence are impossible without the recognition of a certain likeness in mens claims in virtue of their common humanity equity literally means equalness and if it be admitted that there were even the vaguest ideas of equity in these primitive eras it must be admitted that there was some appreciation of the equalness of mens liberties to pursue the objects of lifesome appreciation therefore of the essential principle of national equilibrium  thus in this initial stage of the positive sciences before geometry had yet done more than evolve a few empirical rulesbefore mechanics had passed beyond its first theorembefore astronomy had advanced from its merely chronological phase into the geometrical the most involved of the sciences had reached a certain degree of developmenta development without which no progress in other sciences was possible  only noting as we pass how thus early we may see that the progress of exact science was not only towards an increasing number of previsions but towards previsions more accurately quantitativehow in astronomy the recurring period of the moons motions was by and by more correctly ascertained to be nineteen years or two hundred and thirtyfive lunations how callipus further corrected this metonic cycle by leaving out a day at the end of every seventysix years and how these successive advances implied a longer continued registry of observations and the coordination of a greater number of factslet us go on to inquire how geometrical astronomy took its rise  the first astronomical instrument was the gnomon this was not only early in use in the east but it was found also among the mexicans the sole astronomical observations of the peruvians were made by it and we read that 1100 bc the chinese found that at a certain place the length of the suns shadow at the summer solstice was to the height of the gnomon as one and a half to eight here again it is observable not only that the instrument is found ready made but that nature is perpetually performing the process of measurement any fixed erect objecta column a dead palm a pole the angle of a buildingserves for a gnomon and it needs but to notice the changing position of the shadow it daily throws to make the first step in geometrical astronomy how small this first step was may be seen in the fact that the only things ascertained at the outset were the periods of the summer and winter solstices which corresponded with the least and greatest lengths of the midshadow and to fix which it was needful merely to mark the point to which each days shadow reached  and now let it not be overlooked that in the observing at what time during the next year this extreme limit of the shadow was again reached and in the inference that the sun had then arrived at the same turning point in his annual course we have one of the simplest instances of that combined use of equal magnitudes and equal relations by which all exact science all quantitative prevision is reached for the relation observed was between the length of the suns shadow and his position in the heavens and the inference drawn was that when next year the extremity of his shadow came to the same point he occupied the same place that is the ideas involved were the equality of the shadows and the equality of the relations between shadow and sun in successive years as in the case of the scales the equality of relations here recognised is of the simplest order it is not as those habitually dealt with in the higher kinds of scientific reasoning which answer to the general typethe relation between two and three equals the relation between six and nine but it follows the typethe relation between two and three equals the relation between two and three it is a case of not simply equal relations but coinciding relations and here indeed we may see beautifully illustrated how the idea of equal relations takes its rise after the same manner that that of equal magnitude does as already shown the idea of equal magnitudes arose from the observed coincidence of two lengths placed together and in this case we have not only two coincident lengths of shadows but two coincident relations between sun and shadows  from the use of the gnomon there naturally grew up the conception of angular measurements and with the advance of geometrical conceptions there came the hemisphere of berosus the equinoctial armil the solstitial armil and the quadrant of ptolemyall of them employing shadows as indices of the suns position but in combination with angular divisions it is obviously out of the question for us here to trace these details of progress it must suffice to remark that in all of them we may see that notion of equality of relations of a more complex kind which is best illustrated in the astrolabe an instrument which consisted of circular rims movable one within the other or about poles and contained circles which were to be brought into the position of the ecliptic and of a plane passing through the sun and the poles of the ecliptican instrument therefore which represented as by a model the relative positions of certain imaginary lines and planes in the heavens which was adjusted by putting these representative lines and planes into parallelism and coincidence with the celestial ones and which depended for its use upon the perception that the relations between these representative lines and planes were equal to the relations between those represented  were there space we might go on to point out how the conception of the heavens as a revolving hollow sphere the discovery of the globular form of the earth the explanation of the moons phases and indeed all the successive steps taken involved this same mental process but we must content ourselves with referring to the theory of eccentrics and epicycles as a further marked illustration of it as first suggested and as proved by hipparchus to afford an explanation of the leading irregularities in the celestial motions this theory involved the perception that the progressions retrogressions and variations of velocity seen in the heavenly bodies might be reconciled with their assumed uniform movement in circles by supposing that the earth was not in the centre of their orbits or by supposing that they revolved in circles whose centres revolved round the earth or by both the discovery that this would account for the appearances was the discovery that in certain geometrical diagrams the relations were such that the uniform motion of a point would when looked at from a particular position present analogous irregularities and the calculations of hipparchus involved the belief that the relations subsisting among these geometrical curves were equal to the relations subsisting among the celestial orbits  leaving here these details of astronomical progress and the philosophy of it let us observe how the relatively concrete science of geometrical astronomy having been thus far helped forward by the development of geometry in general reacted upon geometry caused it also to advance and was again assisted by it hipparchus before making his solar and lunar tables had to discover rules for calculating the relations between the sides and angles of trianglestrigonometry a subdivision of pure mathematics further the reduction of the doctrine of the sphere to the quantitative form needed for astronomical purposes required the formation of a spherical trigonometry which was also achieved by hipparchus thus both plane and spherical trigonometry which are parts of the highly abstract and simple science of extension remained undeveloped until the less abstract and more complex science of the celestial motions had need of them the fact admitted by m comte that since descartes the progress of the abstract division of mathematics has been determined by that of the concrete division is paralleled by the still more significant fact that even thus early the progress of mathematics was determined by that of astronomy  and here indeed we may see exemplified the truth which the subsequent history of science frequently illustrates that before any more abstract division makes a further advance some more concrete division must suggest the necessity for that advancemust present the new order of questions to be solved before astronomy presented hipparchus with the problem of solar tables there was nothing to raise the question of the relations between lines and angles the subjectmatter of trigonometry had not been conceived and as there must be subjectmatter before there can be investigation it follows that the progress of the concrete divisions is as necessary to that of the abstract as the progress of the abstract to that of the concrete  just incidentally noticing the circumstance that the epoch we are describing witnessed the evolution of algebra a comparatively abstract division of mathematics by the union of its less abstract divisions geometry and arithmetica fact proved by the earliest extant samples of algebra which are half algebraic half geometricwe go on to observe that during the era in which mathematics and astronomy were thus advancing rational mechanics made its second step and something was done towards giving a quantitative form to hydrostatics optics and harmonics in each case we shall see as before how the idea of equality underlies all quantitative prevision and in what simple forms this idea is first applied  as already shown the first theorem established in mechanics was that equal weights suspended from a lever with equal arms would remain in equilibrium archimedes discovered that a lever with unequal arms was in equilibrium when one weight was to its arm as the other arm to its weight that iswhen the numerical relation between one weight and its arm was equal to the numerical relation between the other arm and its weight  the first advance made in hydrostatics which we also owe to archimedes was the discovery that fluids press equally in all directions and from this followed the solution of the problem of floating bodies namely that they are in equilibrium when the upward and downward pressures are equal  in optics again the greeks found that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection and their knowledge reached no further than to such simple deductions from this as their geometry sufficed for in harmonics they ascertained the fact that three strings of equal lengths would yield the octave fifth and fourth when strained by weights having certain definite ratios and they did not progress much beyond this in the one of which cases we see geometry used in elucidation of the laws of light and in the other geometry and arithmetic made to measure the phenomena of sound  did space permit it would be desirable here to describe the state of the less advanced sciencesto point out how while a few had thus reached the first stages of quantitative prevision the rest were progressing in qualitative previsionhow some small generalisations were made respecting evaporation and heat and electricity and magnetism which empirical as they were did not in that respect differ from the first generalisations of every sciencehow the greek physicians had made advances in physiology and pathology which considering the great imperfection of our present knowledge are by no means to be despisedhow zoology had been so far systematised by aristotle as to some extent enabled him from the presence of certain organs to predict the presence of othershow in aristotles politics there is some progress towards a scientific conception of social phenomena and sundry previsions respecting themand how in the state of the greek societies as well as in the writings of greek philosophers we may recognise not only an increasing clearness in that conception of equity on which the social science is based but also some appreciation of the fact that social stability depends upon the maintenance of equitable regulations we might dwell at length upon the causes which retarded the development of some of the sciences as for example chemistry showing that relative complexity had nothing to do with itthat the oxidation of a piece of iron is a simpler phenomenon than the recurrence of eclipses and the discovery of carbonic acid less difficult than that of the precession of the equinoxesbut that the relatively slow advance of chemical knowledge was due partly to the fact that its phenomena were not daily thrust on mens notice as those of astronomy were partly to the fact that nature does not habitually supply the means and suggest the modes of investigation as in the sciences dealing with time extension and force and partly to the fact that the great majority of the materials with which chemistry deals instead of being ready to hand are made known only by the arts in their slow growth and partly to the fact that even when known their chemical properties are not selfexhibited but have to be sought out by experiment  merely indicating all these considerations however let us go on to contemplate the progress and mutual influence of the sciences in modern days only parenthetically noticing how on the revival of the scientific spirit the successive stages achieved exhibit the dominance of the same law hitherto tracedhow the primary idea in dynamics a uniform force was defined by galileo to be a force which generates equal velocities in equal successive timeshow the uniform action of gravity was first experimentally determined by showing that the time elapsing before a body thrown up stopped was equal to the time it took to fallhow the first fact in compound motion which galileo ascertained was that a body projected horizontally will have a uniform motion onwards and a uniformly accelerated motion downwards that is will describe equal horizontal spaces in equal times compounded with equal vertical increments in equal timeshow his discovery respecting the pendulum was that its oscillations occupy equal intervals of time whatever their lengthhow the principle of virtual velocities which he established is that in any machine the weights that balance each other are reciprocally as their virtual velocities that is the relation of one set of weights to their velocities equals the relation of the other set of velocities to their weights and how thus his achievements consisted in showing the equalities of certain magnitudes and relations whose equalities had not been previously recognised  when mechanics had reached the point to which galileo brought itwhen the simple laws of force had been disentangled from the friction and atmospheric resistance by which all their earthly manifestations are disguisedwhen progressing knowledge of physics had given a due insight into these disturbing causeswhen by an effort of abstraction it was perceived that all motion would be uniform and rectilinear unless interfered with by external forcesand when the various consequences of this perception had been worked out then it became possible by the union of geometry and mechanics to initiate physical astronomy geometry and mechanics having diverged from a common root in mens sensible experiences having with occasional inosculations been separately developed the one partly in connection with astronomy the other solely by analysing terrestrial movements now join in the investigations of newton to create a true theory of the celestial motions and here also we have to notice the important fact that in the very process of being brought jointly to bear upon astronomical problems they are themselves raised to a higher phase of development for it was in dealing with the questions raised by celestial dynamics that the then incipient infinitesimal calculus was unfolded by newton and his continental successors and it was from inquiries into the mechanics of the solar system that the general theorems of mechanics contained in the principiamany of them of purely terrestrial applicationtook their rise thus as in the case of hipparchus the presentation of a new order of concrete facts to be analysed led to the discovery of new abstract facts and these abstract facts having been laid hold of gave means of access to endless groups of concrete facts before incapable of quantitative treatment  meanwhile physics had been carrying further that progress without which as just shown rational mechanics could not be disentangled in hydrostatics stevinus had extended and applied the discovery of archimedes torricelli had proved atmospheric pressure by showing that this pressure sustained different liquids at heights inversely proportional to their densities and pascal established the necessary diminution of this pressure at increasing heights in the atmosphere discoveries which in part reduced this branch of science to a quantitative form something had been done by daniel bernouilli towards the dynamics of fluids the thermometer had been invented and a number of small generalisations reached by it huyghens and newton had made considerable progress in optics newton had approximately calculated the rate of transmission of sound and the continental mathematicians had succeeded in determining some of the laws of sonorous vibrations magnetism and electricity had been considerably advanced by gilbert chemistry had got as far as the mutual neutralisation of acids and alkalies and leonardo da vinci had advanced in geology to the conception of the deposition of marine strata as the origin of fossils our present purpose does not require that we should give particulars all that it here concerns us to do is to illustrate the consensus subsisting in this stage of growth and afterwards let us look at a few cases  the theoretic law of the velocity of sound enunciated by newton on purely mechanical considerations was found wrong by onesixth the error remained unaccounted for until the time of laplace who suspecting that the heat disengaged by the compression of the undulating strata of the air gave additional elasticity and so produced the difference made the needful calculations and found he was right thus acoustics was arrested until thermology overtook and aided it when boyle and marriot had discovered the relation between the density of gases and the pressures they are subject to and when it thus became possible to calculate the rate of decreasing density in the upper parts of the atmosphere it also became possible to make approximate tables of the atmospheric refraction of light thus optics and with it astronomy advanced with barology after the discovery of atmospheric pressure had led to the invention of the airpump by otto guericke and after it had become known that evaporation increases in rapidity as atmospheric pressure decreases it became possible for leslie by evaporation in a vacuum to produce the greatest cold known and so to extend our knowledge of thermology by showing that there is no zero within reach of our researches when fourier had determined the laws of conduction of heat and when the earths temperature had been found to increase below the surface one degree in every forty yards there were data for inferring the past condition of our globe the vast period it has taken to cool down to its present state and the immense age of the solar systema purely astronomical consideration  chemistry having advanced sufficiently to supply the needful materials and a physiological experiment having furnished the requisite hint there came the discovery of galvanic electricity galvanism reacting on chemistry disclosed the metallic bases of the alkalies and inaugurated the electrochemical theory in the hands of oersted and ampère it led to the laws of magnetic action and by its aid faraday has detected significant facts relative to the constitution of light brewsters discoveries respecting double refraction and dipolarisation proved the essential truth of the classification of crystalline forms according to the number of axes by showing that the molecular constitution depends upon the axes in these and in numerous other cases the mutual influence of the sciences has been quite independent of any supposed hierarchical order often too their interactions are more complex than as thus instancedinvolve more sciences than two one illustration of this must suffice we quote it in full from the history of the inductive sciences in book xi chap ii on the progress of the electrical theory dr whewell writes       thus at that period mathematics was behind experiment and a      problem was proposed in which theoretical results were wanted for      comparison with observation but could not be accurately obtained      as was the case in astronomy also till the time of the approximate      solution of the problem of three bodies and the consequent      formation of the tables of the moon and planets on the theory of      universal gravitation after some time electrical theory was      relieved from this reproach mainly in consequence of the progress      which astronomy had occasioned in pure mathematics about 1801      there appeared in the bulletin des sciences an exact solution of      the problem of the distribution of electric fluid on a spheroid      obtained by biot by the application of the peculiar methods which      laplace had invented for the problem of the figure of the planets      and in 1811 m poisson applied laplaces artifices to the case of      two spheres acting upon one another in contact a case to which      many of coulombs experiments were referrible and the agreement of      the results of theory and observation thus extricated from      coulombs numbers obtained above forty years previously was very      striking and convincing  not only do the sciences affect each other after this direct manner but they affect each other indirectly where there is no dependence there is yet analogyequality of relations and the discovery of the relations subsisting among one set of phenomena constantly suggests a search for the same relations among another set thus the established fact that the force of gravitation varies inversely as the square of the distance being recognised as a necessary characteristic of all influences proceeding from a centre raised the suspicion that heat and light follow the same law which proved to be the casea suspicion and a confirmation which were repeated in respect to the electric and magnetic forces thus again the discovery of the polarisation of light led to experiments which ended in the discovery of the polarisation of heata discovery that could never have been made without the antecedent one thus too the known refrangibility of light and heat lately produced the inquiry whether sound also is not refrangible which on trial it turns out to be  in some cases indeed it is only by the aid of conceptions derived from one class of phenomena that hypotheses respecting other classes can be formed the theory at one time favoured that evaporation is a solution of water in air was an assumption that the relation between water and air is like the relation between salt and water and could never have been conceived if the relation between salt and water had not been previously known similarly the received theory of evaporationthat it is a diffusion of the particles of the evaporating fluid in virtue of their atomic repulsioncould not have been entertained without a foregoing experience of magnetic and electric repulsions so complete in recent days has become this consensus among the sciences caused either by the natural entanglement of their phenomena or by analogies in the relations of their phenomena that scarcely any considerable discovery concerning one order of facts now takes place without very shortly leading to discoveries concerning other orders  to produce a tolerably complete conception of this process of scientific evolution it would be needful to go back to the beginning and trace in detail the growth of classifications and nomenclatures and to show how as subsidiary to science they have acted upon it and it has reacted upon them we can only now remark that on the one hand classifications and nomenclatures have aided science by continually subdividing the subjectmatter of research and giving fixity and diffusion to the truths disclosed and that on the other hand they have caught from it that increasing quantitativeness and that progress from considerations touching single phenomena to considerations touching the relations among many phenomena which we have been describing  of this last influence a few illustrations must be given in chemistry it is seen in the facts that the dividing of matter into the four elements was ostensibly based upon the single property of weight that the first truly chemical division into acid and alkaline bodies grouped together bodies which had not simply one property in common but in which one property was constantly related to many others and that the classification now current places together in groups supporters of combustion metallic and nonmetallic bases acids salts etc bodies which are often quite unlike in sensible qualities but which are like in the majority of their relations to other bodies in mineralogy again the first classifications were based upon differences in aspect texture and other physical attributes berzelius made two attempts at a classification based solely on chemical constitution that now current recognises as far as possible the relations between physical and chemical characters in botany the earliest classes formed were trees shrubs and herbs magnitude being the basis of distinction dioscorides divided vegetables into aromatic alimentary medicinal and vinous a division of chemical character cæsalpinus classified them by the seeds and seedvessels which he preferred because of the relations found to subsist between the character of the fructification and the general character of the other parts  while the natural system since developed carrying out the doctrine of linnæus that natural orders must be formed by attention not to one or two but to all the parts of plants bases its divisions on like peculiarities which are found to be constantly related to the greatest number of other like peculiarities and similarly in zoology the successive classifications from having been originally determined by external and often subordinate characters not indicative of the essential nature have been gradually more and more determined by those internal and fundamental differences which have uniform relations to the greatest number of other differences nor shall we be surprised at this analogy between the modes of progress of positive science and classification when we bear in mind that both proceed by making generalisations that both enable us to make previsions differing only in their precision and that while the one deals with equal properties and relations the other deals with properties and relations that approximate towards equality in variable degrees  without further argument it will we think be sufficiently clear that the sciences are none of them separately evolvedare none of them independent either logically or historically but that all of them have in a greater or less degree required aid and reciprocated it indeed it needs but to throw aside these and contemplate the mixed character of surrounding phenomena to at once see that these notions of division and succession in the kinds of knowledge are none of them actually true but are simple scientific fictions good if regarded merely as aids to study bad if regarded as representing realities in nature consider them critically and no facts whatever are presented to our senses uncombined with other factsno facts whatever but are in some degree disguised by accompanying facts disguised in such a manner that all must be partially understood before any one can be understood if it be said as by m comte that gravitating force should be treated of before other forces seeing that all things are subject to it it may on like grounds be said that heat should be first dealt with seeing that thermal forces are everywhere in action that the ability of any portion of matter to manifest visible gravitative phenomena depends on its state of aggregation which is determined by heat that only by the aid of thermology can we explain those apparent exceptions to the gravitating tendency which are presented by steam and smoke and so establish its universality and that indeed the very existence of the solar system in a solid form is just as much a question of heat as it is one of gravitation  take other casesall phenomena recognised by the eyes through which only are the data of exact science ascertainable are complicated with optical phenomena and cannot be exhaustively known until optical principles are known the burning of a candle cannot be explained without involving chemistry mechanics thermology every wind that blows is determined by influences partly solar partly lunar partly hygrometric and implies considerations of fluid equilibrium and physical geography the direction dip and variations of the magnetic needle are facts half terrestrial half celestialare caused by earthly forces which have cycles of change corresponding with astronomical periods the flowing of the gulfstream and the annual migration of icebergs towards the equator depending as they do on the balancing of the centripetal and centrifugal forces acting on the ocean involve in their explanation the earths rotation and spheroidal form the laws of hydrostatics the relative densities of cold and warm water and the doctrines of evaporation it is no doubt true as m comte says that our position in the solar system and the motions form size equilibrium of the mass of our world among the planets must be known before we can understand the phenomena going on at its surface but fatally for his hypothesis it is also true that we must understand a great part of the phenomena going on at its surface before we can know its position etc in the solar system it is not simply that as we have already shown those geometrical and mechanical principles by which celestial appearances are explained were first generalised from terrestrial experiences but it is that the very obtainment of correct data on which to base astronomical generalisations implies advanced terrestrial physics  until after optics had made considerable advance the copernican system remained but a speculation a single modern observation on a star has to undergo a careful analysis by the combined aid of various scienceshas to be digested by the organism of the sciences which have severally to assimilate their respective parts of the observation before the essential fact it contains is available for the further development of astronomy it has to be corrected not only for nutation of the earths axis and for precession of the equinoxes but for aberration and for refraction and the formation of the tables by which refraction is calculated presupposes knowledge of the law of decreasing density in the upper atmospheric strata of the law of decreasing temperature and the influence of this on the density and of hygrometric laws as also affecting density so that to get materials for further advance astronomy requires not only the indirect aid of the sciences which have presided over the making of its improved instruments but the direct aid of an advanced optics of barology of thermology of hygrometry and if we remember that these delicate observations are in some cases registered electrically and that they are further corrected for the personal equationthe time elapsing between seeing and registering which varies with different observerswe may even add electricity and psychology if then so apparently simple a thing as ascertaining the position of a star is complicated with so many phenomena it is clear that this notion of the independence of the sciences or certain of them will not hold  whether objectively independent or not they cannot be subjectively sothey cannot have independence as presented to our consciousness and this is the only kind of independence with which we are concerned and here before leaving these illustrations and especially this last one let us not omit to notice how clearly they exhibit that increasingly active consensus of the sciences which characterises their advancing development besides finding that in these later times a discovery in one science commonly causes progress in others besides finding that a great part of the questions with which modern science deals are so mixed as to require the cooperation of many sciences for their solution we find in this last case that to make a single good observation in the purest of the natural sciences requires the combined assistance of half a dozen other sciences  perhaps the clearest comprehension of the interconnected growth of the sciences may be obtained by contemplating that of the arts to which it is strictly analogous and with which it is inseparably bound up most intelligent persons must have been at one time or other struck with the vast array of antecedents presupposed by one of our processes of manufacture let him trace the production of a printed cotton and consider all that is implied by it there are the many successive improvements through which the powerlooms reached their present perfection there is the steamengine that drives them having its long history from papin downwards there are the lathes in which its cylinder was bored and the string of ancestral lathes from which those lathes proceeded there is the steamhammer under which its crank shaft was welded there are the puddlingfurnaces the blastfurnaces the coalmines and the ironmines needful for producing the raw material there are the slowly improved appliances by which the factory was built and lighted and ventilated there are the printing engine and the die house and the colour laboratory with its stock of materials from all parts of the world implying cochinealculture logwoodcutting indigogrowing there are the implements used by the producers of cotton the gins by which it is cleaned the elaborate machines by which it is spun there are the vessels in which cotton is imported with the buildingslips the ropeyards the sailcloth factories the anchorforges needful for making them and besides all these directly necessary antecedents each of them involving many others there are the institutions which have developed the requisite intelligence the printing and publishing arrangements which have spread the necessary information the social organisation which has rendered possible such a complex cooperation of agencies  further analysis would show that the many arts thus concerned in the economical production of a childs frock have each of them been brought to its present efficiency by slow steps which the other arts have aided and that from the beginning this reciprocity has been ever on the increase it needs but on the one hand to consider how utterly impossible it is for the savage even with ore and coal ready to produce so simple a thing as an iron hatchet and then to consider on the other hand that it would have been impracticable among ourselves even a century ago to raise the tubes of the britannia bridge from lack of the hydraulic press to at once see how mutually dependent are the arts and how all must advance that each may advance well the sciences are involved with each other in just the same manner they are in fact inextricably woven into the same complex web of the arts and are only conventionally independent of it originally the two were one how to fix the religious festivals when to sow how to weigh commodities and in what manner to measure ground were the purely practical questions out of which arose astronomy mechanics geometry since then there has been a perpetual inosculation of the sciences and the arts science has been supplying art with truer generalisations and more completely quantitative previsions art has been supplying science with better materials and more perfect instruments and all along the interdependence has been growing closer not only between art and science but among the arts themselves and among the sciences themselves  how completely the analogy holds throughout becomes yet clearer when we recognise the fact that the sciences are arts to each other if as occurs in almost every case the fact to be analysed by any science has first to be preparedto be disentangled from disturbing facts by the afore discovered methods of other sciences the other sciences so used stand in the position of arts if in solving a dynamical problem a parallelogram is drawn of which the sides and diagonal represent forces and by putting magnitudes of extension for magnitudes of force a measurable relation is established between quantities not else to be dealt with it may be fairly said that geometry plays towards mechanics much the same part that the fire of the founder plays towards the metal he is going to cast if in analysing the phenomena of the coloured rings surrounding the point of contact between two lenses a newton ascertains by calculation the amount of certain interposed spaces far too minute for actual measurement he employs the science of number for essentially the same purpose as that for which the watchmaker employs tools if before writing down his observation on a star the astronomer has to separate from it all the errors resulting from atmospheric and optical laws it is manifest that the refractiontables and logarithmbooks and formulæ which he successively uses serve him much as retorts and filters and cupels serve the assayer who wishes to separate the pure gold from all accompanying ingredients  so close indeed is the relationship that it is impossible to say where science begins and art ends all the instruments of the natural philosopher are the products of art the adjusting one of them for use is an art there is art in making an observation with one of them it requires art properly to treat the facts ascertained nay even the employing established generalisations to open the way to new generalisations may be considered as art in each of these cases previously organised knowledge becomes the implement by which new knowledge is got at and whether that previously organised knowledge is embodied in a tangible apparatus or in a formula matters not in so far as its essential relation to the new knowledge is concerned if as no one will deny art is applied knowledge then such portion of a scientific investigation as consists of applied knowledge is art so that we may even say that as soon as any prevision in science passes out of its originally passive state and is employed for reaching other previsions it passes from theory into practicebecomes science in actionbecomes art and when we thus see how purely conventional is the ordinary distinction how impossible it is to make any real separationwhen we see not only that science and art were originally one that the arts have perpetually assisted each other that there has been a constant reciprocation of aid between the sciences and arts but that the sciences act as arts to each other and that the established part of each science becomes an art to the growing partwhen we recognise the closeness of these associations we shall the more clearly perceive that as the connection of the arts with each other has been ever becoming more intimate as the help given by sciences to arts and by arts to sciences has been age by age increasing so the interdependence of the sciences themselves has been ever growing greater their mutual relations more involved their consensus more active                                       in here ending our sketch of the genesis of science we are conscious of having done the subject but scant justice two difficulties have stood in our way one the having to touch on so many points in such small space the other the necessity of treating in serial arrangement a process which is not seriala difficulty which must ever attend all attempts to delineate processes of development whatever their special nature add to which that to present in anything like completeness and proportion even the outlines of so vast and complex a history demands years of study nevertheless we believe that the evidence which has been assigned suffices to substantiate the leading propositions with which we set out inquiry into the first stages of science confirms the conclusion which we drew from the analysis of science as now existing that it is not distinct from common knowledge but an outgrowth from itan extension of the perception by means of the reason  that which we further found by analysis to form the more specific characteristic of scientific previsions as contrasted with the previsions of uncultured intelligencetheir quantitativenesswe also see to have been the characteristic alike in the initial steps in science and of all the steps succeeding them the facts and admissions cited in disproof of the assertion that the sciences follow one another both logically and historically in the order of their decreasing generality have been enforced by the sundry instances we have met with in which the more general or abstract sciences have been advanced only at the instigation of the more special or concreteinstances serving to show that a more general science as much owes its progress to the presentation of new problems by a more special science as the more special science owes its progress to the solutions which the more general science is thus led to attemptinstances therefore illustrating the position that scientific advance is as much from the special to the general as from the general to the special  quite in harmony with this position we find to be the admissions that the sciences are as branches of one trunk and that they were at first cultivated simultaneously and this harmony becomes the more marked on finding as we have done not only that the sciences have a common root but that science in general has a common root with language classification reasoning art that throughout civilisation these have advanced together acting and reacting upon each other just as the separate sciences have done and that thus the development of intelligence in all its divisions and subdivisions has conformed to this same law which we have shown that the sciences conform to from all which we may perceive that the sciences can with no greater propriety be arranged in a succession than language classification reasoning art and science can be arranged in a succession that however needful a succession may be for the convenience of books and catalogues it must be recognised merely as a convention and that so far from its being the function of a philosophy of the sciences to establish a hierarchy it is its function to show that the linear arrangements required for literary purposes have none of them any basis either in nature or history  there is one further remark we must not omita remark touching the importance of the question that has been discussed unfortunately it commonly happens that topics of this abstract nature are slighted as of no practical moment and we doubt not that many will think it of very little consequence what theory respecting the genesis of science may be entertained but the value of truths is often great in proportion as their generality is wide remote as they seem from practical application the highest generalisations are not unfrequently the most potent in their effects in virtue of their influence on all those subordinate generalisations which regulate practice and it must be so here whenever established a correct theory of the historical development of the sciences must have an immense effect upon education and through education upon civilisation greatly as we differ from him in other respects we agree with m comte in the belief that rightly conducted the education of the individual must have a certain correspondence with the evolution of the race  no one can contemplate the facts we have cited in illustration of the early stages of science without recognising the necessity of the processes through which those stages were reacheda necessity which in respect to the leading truths may likewise be traced in all after stages this necessity originating in the very nature of the phenomena to be analysed and the faculties to be employed more or less fully applies to the mind of the child as to that of the savage we say more or less fully because the correspondence is not special but general only were the environment the same in both cases the correspondence would be complete but though the surrounding material out of which science is to be organised is in many cases the same to the juvenile mind and the aboriginal mind it is not so throughout as for instance in the case of chemistry the phenomena of which are accessible to the one but were inaccessible to the other hence in proportion as the environment differs the course of evolution must differ after admitting sundry exceptions however there remains a substantial parallelism and if so it becomes of great moment to ascertain what really has been the process of scientific evolution the establishment of an erroneous theory must be disastrous in its educational results while the establishments of a true one must eventually be fertile in schoolreforms and consequent social benefits  1 british quarterly review july 1854  2 it is somewhat curious that the author of the plurality of worlds with quite other aims should have persuaded himself into similar conclusions     on the physiology of laughter1   why do we smile when a child puts on a mans hat or what induces us to laugh on reading that the corpulent gibbon was unable to rise from his knees after making a tender declaration the usual reply to such questions is that laughter results from a perception of incongruity even were there not on this reply the obvious criticism that laughter often occurs from extreme pleasure or from mere vivacity there would still remain the real problemhow comes a sense of the incongruous to be followed by these peculiar bodily actions some have alleged that laughter is due to the pleasure of a relative selfelevation which we feel on seeing the humiliation of others but this theory whatever portion of truth it may contain is in the first place open to the fatal objection that there are various humiliations to others which produce in us anything but laughter and in the second place it does not apply to the many instances in which no ones dignity is implicated as when we laugh at a good pun moreover like the other it is merely a generalisation of certain conditions to laughter and not an explanation of the odd movements which occur under these conditions why when greatly delighted or impressed with certain unexpected contrasts of ideas should there be a contraction of particular facial muscles and particular muscles of the chest and abdomen such answer to this question as may be possible can be rendered only by physiology                                       every child has made the attempt to hold the foot still while it is tickled and has failed and probably there is scarcely any one who has not vainly tried to avoid winking when a hand has been suddenly passed before the eyes these examples of muscular movements which occur independently of the will or in spite of it illustrate what physiologists call reflexaction as likewise do sneezing and coughing to this class of cases in which involuntary motions are accompanied by sensations has to be added another class of cases in which involuntary motions are unaccompanied by sensationsinstance the pulsations of the heart the contractions of the stomach during digestion further the great mass of seeminglyvoluntary acts in such creatures as insects worms molluscs are considered by physiologists to be as purely automatic as is the dilatation or closure of the iris under variations in quantity of light and similarly exemplify the law that an impression on the end of an afferent nerve is conveyed to some ganglionic centre and is thence usually reflected along an efferent nerve to one or more muscles which it causes to contract  in a modified form this principle holds with voluntary acts nervous excitation always tends to beget muscular motion and when it rises to a certain intensity always does beget it not only in reflex actions whether with or without sensation do we see that special nerves when raised to a state of tension discharge themselves on special muscles with which they are indirectly connected but those external actions through which we read the feelings of others show us that under any considerable tension the nervous system in general discharges itself on the muscular system in general either with or without the guidance of the will the shivering produced by cold implies irregular muscular contractions which though at first only partly involuntary become when the cold is extreme almost wholly involuntary when you have severely burnt your finger it is very difficult to preserve a dignified composure contortion of face or movement of limb is pretty sure to follow if a man receives good news with neither change of feature nor bodily motion it is inferred that he is not much pleased or that he has extraordinary selfcontroleither inference implying that joy almost universally produces contraction of the muscles and so alters the expression or attitude or both and when we hear of the feats of strength which men have performed when their lives were at stakewhen we read how in the energy of despair even paralytic patients have regained for a time the use of their limbs we see still more clearly the relations between nervous and muscular excitements it becomes manifest both that emotions and sensations tend to generate bodily movements and that the movements are vehement in proportion as the emotions or sensations are intense2  this however is not the sole direction in which nervous excitement expends itself viscera as well as muscles may receive the discharge that the heart and bloodvessels which indeed being all contractile may in a restricted sense be classed with the muscular system are quickly affected by pleasures and pains we have daily proved to us every sensation of any acuteness accelerates the pulse and how sensitive the heart is to emotions is testified by the familiar expressions which use heart and feeling as convertible terms similarly with the digestive organs without detailing the various ways in which these may be influenced by our mental states it suffices to mention the marked benefits derived by dyspeptics as well as other invalids from cheerful society welcome news change of scene to show how pleasurable feeling stimulates the viscera in general into greater activity  there is still another direction in which any excited portion of the nervous system may discharge itself and a direction in which it usually does discharge itself when the excitement is not strong it may pass on the stimulus to some other portion of the nervous system this is what occurs in quiet thinking and feeling the successive states which constitute consciousness result from this sensations excite ideas and emotions these in their turns arouse other ideas and emotions and so continuously that is to say the tension existing in particular nerves or groups of nerves when they yield us certain sensations ideas or emotions generates an equivalent tension in some other nerves or groups of nerves with which there is a connection the flow of energy passing on the one idea or feeling dies in producing the next  thus then while we are totally unable to comprehend how the excitement of certain nerves should generate feelingwhile in the production of consciousness by physical agents acting on physical structure we come to an absolute mystery never to be solved it is yet quite possible for us to know by observation what are the successive forms which this absolute mystery may take we see that there are three channels along which nerves in a state of tension may discharge themselves or rather i should say three classes of channels they may pass on the excitement to other nerves that have no direct connections with the bodily members and may so cause other feelings and ideas or they may pass on the excitement to one or more motor nerves and so cause muscular contractions or they may pass on the excitement to nerves which supply the viscera and may so stimulate one or more of these  for simplicitys sake i have described these as alternative routes one or other of which any current of nerveforce must take thereby as it may be thought implying that such current will be exclusively confined to some one of them but this is by no means the case rarely if ever does it happen that a state of nervous tension present to consciousness as a feeling expends itself in one direction only very generally it may be observed to expend itself in two and it is probable that the discharge is never absolutely absent from any one of the three there is however variety in the proportions in which the discharge is divided among these different channels under different circumstances in a man whose fear impels him to run the mental tension generated is only in part transformed into a muscular stimulus there is a surplus which causes a rapid current of ideas an agreeable state of feeling produced say by praise is not wholly used up in arousing the succeeding phase of the feeling and the new ideas appropriate to it but a certain portion overflows into the visceral nervous system increasing the action of the heart and probably facilitating digestion and here we come upon a class of considerations and facts which open the way to a solution of our special problem  for starting with the unquestionable truth that at any moment the existing quantity of liberated nerveforce which in an inscrutable way produces in us the state we call feeling must expend itself in some directionmust generate an equivalent manifestation of force somewhereit clearly follows that if of the several channels it may take one is wholly or partially closed more must be taken by the others or that if two are closed the discharge along the remaining one must be more intense and that conversely should anything determine an unusual efflux in one direction there will be a diminished efflux in other directions  daily experience illustrates these conclusions it is commonly remarked that the suppression of external signs of feeling makes feeling more intense the deepest grief is silent grief why because the nervous excitement not discharged in muscular action discharges itself in other nervous excitementsarouses more numerous and more remote associations of melancholy ideas and so increases the mass of feelings people who conceal their anger are habitually found to be more revengeful than those who explode in loud speech and vehement action why because as before the emotion is reflected back accumulates and intensifies similarly men who as proved by their powers of representation have the keenest appreciation of the comic are usually able to do and say the most ludicrous things with perfect gravity  on the other hand all are familiar with the truth that bodily activity deadens emotion under great irritation we get relief by walking about rapidly extreme effort in the bootless attempt to achieve a desired end greatly diminishes the intensity of the desire those who are forced to exert themselves after misfortunes do not suffer nearly so much as those who remain quiescent if any one wishes to check intellectual excitement he cannot choose a more efficient method than running till he is exhausted moreover these cases in which the production of feeling and thought is hindered by determining the nervous energy towards bodily movements have their counterparts in the cases in which bodily movements are hindered by extra absorption of nervous energy in sudden thoughts and feelings if when walking along there flashes on you an idea that creates great surprise hope or alarm you stop or if sitting crosslegged swinging your pendent foot the movement is at once arrested from the viscera too intense mental action abstracts energy joy disappointment anxiety or any moral perturbation rising to a great height will destroy appetite or if food has been taken will arrest digestion and even a purely intellectual activity when extreme will do the like  facts then fully bear out these à priori inferences that the nervous excitement at any moment present to consciousness as feeling must expend itself in some way or other that of the three classes of channels open to it it must take one two or more according to circumstances that the closure or obstruction of one must increase the discharge through the others and conversely that if to answer some demand the efflux of nervous energy in one direction is unusually great there must be a corresponding decrease of the efflux in other directions setting out from these premises let us now see what interpretation is to be put on the phenomena of laughter                                       that laughter is a display of muscular excitement and so illustrates the general law that feeling passing a certain pitch habitually vents itself in bodily action scarcely needs pointing out it perhaps needs pointing out however that strong feeling of almost any kind produces this result it is not a sense of the ludicrous only which does it nor are the various forms of joyous emotion the sole additional causes we have besides the sardonic laughter and the hysterical laughter which result from mental distress to which must be added certain sensations as tickling and according to mr bain cold and some kinds of acute pain  strong feeling mental or physical being then the general cause of laughter we have to note that the muscular actions constituting it are distinguished from most others by this that they are purposeless in general bodily motions that are prompted by feelings are directed to special ends as when we try to escape a danger or struggle to secure a gratification but the movements of chest and limbs which we make when laughing have no object and now remark that these quasiconvulsive contractions of the muscles having no object but being results of an uncontrolled discharge of energy we may see whence arise their special charactershow it happens that certain classes of muscles are affected first and then certain other classes for an overflow of nerveforce undirected by any motive will manifestly take first the most habitual routes and if these do not suffice will next overflow into the less habitual ones well it is through the organs of speech that feeling passes into movement with the greatest frequency the jaws tongue and lips are used not only to express strong irritation or gratification but that very moderate flow of mental energy which accompanies ordinary conversation finds its chief vent through this channel hence it happens that certain muscles round the mouth small and easy to move are the first to contract under pleasurable emotion the class of muscles which next after those of articulation are most constantly set in action or extra action we should say by feelings of all kinds are those of respiration under pleasurable or painful sensations we breathe more rapidly possibly as a consequence of the increased demand for oxygenated blood the sensations that accompany exertion also bring on hardbreathing which here more evidently responds to the physiological needs and emotions too agreeable and disagreeable both at first excite respiration though the last subsequently depress it that is to say of the bodily muscles the respiratory are more constantly implicated than any others in those various acts which our feelings impel us to and hence when there occurs an undirected discharge of nervous energy into the muscular system it happens that if the quantity be considerable it convulses not only certain of the articulatory and vocal muscles but also those which expel air from the lungs  should the feeling to be expended be still greater in amounttoo great to find vent in these classes of musclesanother class comes into play the upper limbs are set in motion children frequently clap their hands in glee by some adults the hands are rubbed together and others under still greater intensity of delight slap their knees and sway their bodies backwards and forwards last of all when the other channels for the escape of the surplus nerveforce have been filled to overflowing a yet further and lessused group of muscles is spasmodically affected the head is thrown back and the spine bent inwardsthere is a slight degree of what medical men call opisthotonos thus then without contending that the phenomena of laughter in all their details are to be so accounted for we see that in their ensemble they conform to these general principlesthat feeling excites to muscular action that when the muscular action is unguided by a purpose the muscles first affected are those which feeling most habitually stimulates and that as the feeling to be expended increases in quantity it excites an increasing number of muscles in a succession determined by the relative frequency with which they respond to the regulated dictates of feeling  there still however remains the question with which we set out the explanation here given applies only to the laughter produced by acute pleasure or pain it does not apply to the laughter that follows certain perceptions of incongruity it is an insufficient explanation that in these cases laughter is a result of the pleasure we take in escaping from the restraint of grave feelings that this is a partcause is true doubtless very often as mr bain says it is the coerced form of seriousness and solemnity without the reality that gives us that stiff position from which a contact with triviality or vulgarity relieves us to our uproarious delight and in so far as mirth is caused by the gush of agreeable feeling that follows the cessation of mental strain it further illustrates the general principle above set forth but no explanation is thus afforded of the mirth which ensues when the short silence between the andante and allegro in one of beethovens symphonies is broken by a loud sneeze in this and hosts of like cases the mental tension is not coerced but spontaneousnot disagreeable but agreeable and the coming impressions to which the attention is directed promise a gratification that few if any desire to escape hence when the unlucky sneeze occurs it cannot be that the laughter of the audience is due simply to the release from an irksome attitude of mind some other cause must be sought  this cause we shall arrive at by carrying our analysis a step further we have but to consider the quantity of feeling that exists under such circumstances and then to ask what are the conditions that determine the direction of its discharge to at once reach a solution take a case you are sitting in a theatre absorbed in the progress of an interesting drama some climax has been reached which has aroused your sympathiessay a reconciliation between the hero and heroine after long and painful misunderstanding the feelings excited by this scene are not of a kind from which you seek relief but are on the contrary a grateful relief from the painful feelings with which you have witnessed the previous estrangement moreover the sentiments these fictitious personages have for the moment inspired you with are not such as would lead you to rejoice in any indignity offered to them but rather such as would make you resent the indignity and now while you are contemplating the reconciliation with a pleasurable sympathy there appears from behind the scenes a tame kid which having stared round at the audience walks up to the lovers and sniffs at them you cannot help joining in the roar which greets this contretemps inexplicable as is this irresistible burst on the hypothesis of a pleasure in escaping from mental restraint or on the hypothesis of a pleasure from relative increase of selfimportance when witnessing the humiliation of others it is readily explicable if we consider what in such a case must become of the feeling that existed at the moment the incongruity arose a large mass of emotion had been produced or to speak in physiological language a large portion of the nervous system was in a state of tension there was also great expectation with respect to the further evolution of the scenea quantity of vague nascent thought and emotion into which the existing quantity of thought and emotion was about to pass  had there been no interruption the body of new ideas and feelings next excited would have sufficed to absorb the whole of the liberated nervous energy but now this large amount of nervous energy instead of being allowed to expend itself in producing an equivalent amount of the new thoughts and emotions which were nascent is suddenly checked in its flow the channels along which the discharge was about to take place are closed the new channel openedthat afforded by the appearance and proceedings of the kidis a small one the ideas and feelings suggested are not numerous and massive enough to carry off the nervous energy to be expended the excess must therefore discharge itself in some other direction and in the way already explained there results an efflux through the motor nerves to various classes of the muscles producing the halfconvulsive actions we term laughter  this explanation is in harmony with the fact that when among several persons who witness the same ludicrous occurrence there are some who do not laugh it is because there has arisen in them an emotion not participated in by the rest and which is sufficiently massive to absorb all the nascent excitement among the spectators of an awkward tumble those who preserve their gravity are those in whom there is excited a degree of sympathy with the sufferer sufficiently great to serve as an outlet for the feeling which the occurrence had turned out of its previous course sometimes anger carries off the arrested current and so prevents laughter an instance of this was lately furnished me by a friend who had been witnessing the feats at franconis a tremendous leap had just been made by an acrobat over a number of horses the clown seemingly envious of this success made ostentatious preparations for doing the like and then taking the preliminary run with immense energy stopped short on reaching the first horse and pretended to wipe some dust from its haunches in the majority of the spectators merriment was excited but in my friend wound up by the expectation of the coming leap to a state of great nervous tension the effect of the baulk was to produce indignation experience thus proves what the theory implies namely that the discharge of arrested feelings into the muscular system takes place only in the absence of other adequate channelsdoes not take place if there arise other feelings equal in amount to those arrested  evidence still more conclusive is at hand if we contrast the incongruities which produce laughter with those which do not we at once see that in the nonludicrous ones the unexpected state of feeling aroused though wholly different in kind is not less in quantity or intensity among incongruities that may excite anything but a laugh mr bain instancesa decrepit man under a heavy burden five loaves and two fishes among a multitude and all unfitness and gross disproportion an instrument out of tune a fly in ointment snow in may archimedes studying geometry in a siege and all discordant things a wolf in sheeps clothing a breach of bargain and falsehood in general the multitude taking the law in their own hands and everything of the nature of disorder a corpse at a feast parental cruelty filial ingratitude and whatever is unnatural the entire catalogue of the vanities given by solomon are all incongruous but they cause feelings of pain anger sadness loathing rather than mirth now in these cases where the totally unlike state of consciousness suddenly produced is not inferior in mass to the preceding one the conditions to laughter are not fulfilled as above shown laughter naturally results only when consciousness is unawares transferred from great things to smallonly when there is what we call a descending incongruity  and now observe finally the fact alike inferable à priori and illustrated in experience that an ascending incongruity not only fails to cause laughter but works on the muscular system an effect of exactly the reverse kind when after something very insignificant there arises without anticipation something very great the emotion we call wonder results and this emotion is accompanied not by an excitement of the muscles but by a relaxation of them in children and country people that falling of the jaw which occurs on witnessing something that is imposing and unexpected exemplifies this effect persons who have been wonderstruck at the production of very striking results by a seemingly inadequate cause are frequently described as unconsciously dropping the things they held in their hands such are just the effects to be anticipated after an average state of consciousness absorbing but a small quantity of nervous energy is aroused without the slightest notice a strong emotion of awe terror or admiration joined with the astonishment due to an apparent want of adequate causation this new state of consciousness demands far more nervous energy than that which it has suddenly replaced and this increased absorption of nervous energy in mental changes involves a temporary diminution of the outflow in other directions whence the pendent jaw and the relaxing grasp  one further observation is worth making among the several sets of channels into which surplus feeling might be discharged was named the nervous system of the viscera the sudden overflow of an arrested mental excitement which as we have seen results from a descending incongruity must doubtless stimulate not only the muscular system as we see it does but also the internal organs the heart and stomach must come in for a share of the discharge and thus there seems to be a good physiological basis for the popular notion that mirthcreating excitement facilitates digestion                                       though in doing so i go beyond the boundaries of the immediate topic i may fitly point out that the method of inquiry here followed is one which enables us to understand various phenomena besides those of laughter to show the importance of pursuing it i will indicate the explanation it furnishes of another familiar class of facts  all know how generally a large amount of emotion disturbs the action of the intellect and interferes with the power of expression a speech delivered with great facility to tables and chairs is by no means so easily delivered to an audience every schoolboy can testify that his trepidation when standing before a master has often disabled him from repeating a lesson which he had duly learnt in explanation of this we commonly say that the attention is distractedthat the proper train of ideas is broken by the intrusion of ideas that are irrelevant but the question is in what manner does unusual emotion produce this effect and we are here supplied with a tolerably obvious answer the repetition of a lesson or set speech previously thought out implies the flow of a very moderate amount of nervous excitement through a comparatively narrow channel the thing to be done is simply to call up in succession certain previouslyarranged ideasa process in which no great amount of mental energy is expended hence when there is a large quantity of emotion which must be discharged in some direction or other and when as usually happens the restricted series of intellectual actions to be gone through does not suffice to carry it off there result discharges along other channels besides the one prescribed there are aroused various ideas foreign to the train of thought to be pursued and these tend to exclude from consciousness those which should occupy it  and now observe the meaning of those bodily actions spontaneously set up under these circumstances the schoolboy saying his lesson commonly has his fingers actively engagedperhaps in twisting about a broken pen or perhaps squeezing the angle of his jacket and if told to keep his hands still he soon again falls into the same or a similar trick many anecdotes are current of public speakers having incurable automatic actions of this class barristers who perpetually wound and unwound pieces of tape members of parliament ever putting on and taking off their spectacles so long as such movements are unconscious they facilitate the mental actions at least this seems a fair inference from the fact that confusion frequently results from putting a stop to them witness the case narrated by sir walter scott of his schoolfellow who became unable to say his lesson after the removal of the waistcoatbutton that he habitually fingered while in class but why do they facilitate the mental actions clearly because they draw off a portion of the surplus nervous excitement if as above explained the quantity of mental energy generated is greater than can find vent along the narrow channel of thought that is open to it and if in consequence it is apt to produce confusion by rushing into other channels of thought then by allowing it an exit through the motor nerves into the muscular system the pressure is diminished and irrelevant ideas are less likely to intrude on consciousness  this further illustration will i think justify the position that something may be achieved by pursuing in other cases this method of psychological inquiry a complete explanation of the phenomena requires us to trace out all the consequences of any given state of consciousness and we cannot do this without studying the effects bodily and mental as varying in quantity at each others expense we should probably learn much if we in every case askedwhere is all the nervous energy gone  1 macmillans magazine march 1860  2 for numerous illustrations see essay on the origin and function of music     on the origin and function of music1   when carlo standing chained to his kennel sees his master in the distance a slight motion of the tail indicates his but faint hope that he is about to be let out a much more decided wagging of the tail passing by and by into lateral undulations of the body follows his masters nearer approach when hands are laid on his collar and he knows that he is really to have an outing his jumping and wriggling are such that it is by no means easy to loose his fastenings and when he finds himself actually free his joy expends itself in bounds in pirouettes and in scourings hither and thither at the top of his speed puss too by erecting her tail and by every time raising her back to meet the caressing hand of her mistress similarly expresses her gratification by certain muscular actions as likewise do the parrot by awkward dancing on his perch and the canary by hopping and fluttering about his cage with unwonted rapidity under emotions of an opposite kind animals equally display muscular excitement the enraged lion lashes his sides with his tail knits his brows protrudes his claws the cat sets up her back the dog retracts his upper lip the horse throws back his ears and in the struggles of creatures in pain we see that the like relation holds between excitement of the muscles and excitement of the nerves of sensation  in ourselves distinguished from lower creatures as we are by feelings alike more powerful and more varied parallel facts are at once more conspicuous and more numerous we may conveniently look at them in groups we shall find that pleasurable sensations and painful sensations pleasurable emotions and painful emotions all tend to produce active demonstrations in proportion to their intensity  in children and even in adults who are not restrained by regard for appearances a highly agreeable taste is followed by a smacking of the lips an infant will laugh and bound in its nurses arms at the sight of a brilliant colour or the hearing of a new sound people are apt to beat time with head or feet to music which particularly pleases them in a sensitive person an agreeable perfume will produce a smile and smiles will be seen on the faces of a crowd gazing at some splendid burst of fireworks even the pleasant sensation of warmth felt on getting to the fireside out of a winters storm will similarly express itself in the face  painful sensations being mostly far more intense than pleasurable ones cause muscular actions of a much more decided kind a sudden twinge produces a convulsive start of the whole body a pain less violent but continuous is accompanied by a knitting of the brows a setting of the teeth or biting of the lip and a contraction of the features generally under a persistent pain of a severer kind other muscular actions are added the body is swayed to and fro the hands clench anything they can lay hold of and should the agony rise still higher the sufferer rolls about on the floor almost convulsed  though more varied the natural language of the pleasurable emotions comes within the same generalisation a smile which is the commonest expression of gratified feeling is a contraction of certain facial muscles and when the smile broadens into a laugh we see a more violent and more general muscular excitement produced by an intenser gratification rubbing together of the hands and that other motion which dickens somewhere describes as washing with impalpable soap in invisible water have like implications children may often be seen to jump for joy even in adults of excitable temperament an action approaching to it is sometimes witnessed and dancing has all the world through been regarded as natural to an elevated state of mind many of the special emotions show themselves in special muscular actions the gratification resulting from success raises the head and gives firmness to the gait a hearty grasp of the hand is currently taken as indicative of friendship under a gush of affection the mother clasps her child to her breast feeling as though she could squeeze it to death and so in sundry other cases even in that brightening of the eye with which good news is received we may trace the same truth for this appearance of greater brilliancy is due to an extra contraction of the muscle which raises the eyelid and so allows more light to fall upon and be reflected from the wet surface of the eyeball  the bodily indications of painful emotions are equally numerous and still more vehement discontent is shown by raised eyebrows and wrinkled forehead disgust by a curl of the lip offence by a pout the impatient man beats a tattoo with his fingers on the table swings his pendent leg with increasing rapidity gives needless pokings to the fire and presently paces with hasty strides about the room in great grief there is wringing of the hands and even tearing of the hair an angry child stamps or rolls on its back and kicks its heels in the air and in manhood anger first showing itself in frowns in distended nostrils in compressed lips goes on to produce grinding of the teeth clenching of the fingers blows of the fist on the table and perhaps ends in a violent attack on the offending person or in throwing about and breaking the furniture from that pursing of the mouth indicative of slight displeasure up to the frantic struggles of the maniac we shall find that mental irritation tends to vent itself in bodily activity  all feelings thensensations or emotions pleasurable or painfulhave this common characteristic that they are muscular stimuli not forgetting the few apparently exceptional cases in which emotions exceeding a certain intensity produce prostration we may set it down as a general law that alike in man and animals there is a direct connection between feeling and motion the last growing more vehement as the first grows more intense were it allowable here to treat the matter scientifically we might trace this general law down to the principle known among physiologists as that of reflex action2 without doing this however the above numerous instances justify the generalisation that mental excitement of all kinds ends in excitement of the muscles and that the two preserve a more or less constant ratio to each other                                       but what has all this to do with the origin and function of music asks the reader very much as we shall presently see all music is originally vocal all vocal sounds are produced by the agency of certain muscles these muscles in common with those of the body at large are excited to contraction by pleasurable and painful feelings and therefore it is that feelings demonstrate themselves in sounds as well as in movements therefore it is that carlo barks as well as leaps when he is let outthat puss purrs as well as erects her tailthat the canary chirps as well as flutters therefore it is that the angry lion roars while he lashes his sides and the dog growls while he retracts his lip therefore it is that the maimed animal not only struggles but howls and it is from this cause that in human beings bodily suffering expresses itself not only in contortions but in shrieks and groansthat in anger and fear and grief the gesticulations are accompanied by shouts and screamsthat delightful sensations are followed by exclamationsand that we hear screams of joy and shouts of exultation  we have here then a principle underlying all vocal phenomena including those of vocal music and by consequence those of music in general the muscles that move the chest larynx and vocal chords contracting like other muscles in proportion to the intensity of the feelings every different contraction of these muscles involving as it does a different adjustment of the vocal organs every different adjustment of the vocal organs causing a change in the sound emittedit follows that variations of voice are the physiological results of variations of feeling it follows that each inflection or modulation is the natural outcome of some passing emotion or sensation and it follows that the explanation of all kinds of vocal expression must be sought in this general relation between mental and muscular excitements let us then see whether we cannot thus account for the chief peculiarities in the utterance of the feelings grouping these peculiarities under the heads of loudness quality or timbre pitch intervals and rate of variation                                       between the lungs and the organs of voice there is much the same relation as between the bellows of an organ and its pipes and as the loudness of the sound given out by an organpipe increases with the strength of the blast from the bellows so other things equal the loudness of a vocal sound increases with the strength of the blast from the lungs but the expulsion of air from the lungs is effected by certain muscles of the chest and abdomen the force with which these muscles contract is proportionate to the intensity of the feeling experienced hence à priori loud sounds will be the habitual results of strong feelings that they are so we have daily proof the pain which if moderate can be borne silently causes outcries if it becomes extreme while a slight vexation makes a child whimper a fit of passion calls forth a howl that disturbs the neighbourhood when the voices in an adjacent room become unusually audible we infer anger or surprise or joy loudness of applause is significant of great approbation and with uproarious mirth we associate the idea of high enjoyment commencing with the silence of apathy we find that the utterances grow louder as the sensations or emotions whether pleasurable or painful grow stronger  that different qualities of voice accompany different mental states and that under states of excitement the tones are more sonorous than usual is another general fact admitting of a parallel explanation the sounds of common conversation have but little resonance those of strong feeling have much more under rising ill temper the voice acquires a metallic ring in accordance with her constant mood the ordinary speech of a virago has a piercing quality quite opposite to that softness indicative of placidity a ringing laugh marks an especially joyous temperament grief unburdening itself uses tones approaching in timbre to those of chanting and in his most pathetic passages an eloquent speaker similarly falls into tones more vibratory than those common to him now any one may readily convince himself that resonant vocal sounds can be produced only by a certain muscular effort additional to that ordinarily needed if after uttering a word in his speaking voice the reader without changing the pitch or the loudness will sing this word he will perceive that before he can sing it he has to alter the adjustment of the vocal organs to do which a certain force must be used and by putting his fingers on that external prominence marking the top of the larynx he will have further evidence that to produce a sonorous tone the organs must be drawn out of their usual position thus then the fact that the tones of excited feeling are more vibratory than those of common conversation is another instance of the connection between mental excitement and muscular excitement the speaking voice the recitative voice and the singing voice severally exemplify one general principle  that the pitch of the voice varies according to the action of the vocal muscles scarcely needs saying all know that the middle notes in which they converse are made without any appreciable effort and all know that to make either very high or very low notes requires a considerable effort in either ascending or descending from the pitch of ordinary speech we are conscious of an increasing muscular strain which at both extremes of the register becomes positively painful hence it follows from our general principle that while indifference or calmness will use the medium tones the tones used during excitement will be either above or below them and will rise higher and higher or fall lower and lower as the feelings grow stronger this physiological deduction we also find to be in harmony with familiar facts the habitual sufferer utters his complaints in a voice raised considerably above the natural key and agonising pain vents itself in either shrieks or groansin very high or very low notes beginning at his talking pitch the cry of the disappointed urchin grows more shrill as it grows louder the oh of astonishment or delight begins several notes below the middle voice and descends still lower anger expresses itself in high tones or else in curses not loud but deep deep tones too are always used in uttering strong reproaches such an exclamation as beware if made dramaticallythat is if made with a show of feelingmust be many notes lower than ordinary further we have groans of disapprobation groans of horror groans of remorse and extreme joy and fear are alike accompanied by shrill outcries  nearly allied to the subject of pitch is that of intervals and the explanation of them carries our argument a step further while calm speech is comparatively monotonous emotion makes use of fifths octaves and even wider intervals listen to any one narrating or repeating something in which he has no interest and his voice will not wander more than two or three notes above or below his medium note and that by small steps but when he comes to some exciting event he will be heard not only to use the higher and lower notes of his register but to go from one to the other by larger leaps being unable in print to imitate these traits of feeling we feel some difficulty in fully realising them to the reader but we may suggest a few remembrances which will perhaps call to mind a sufficiency of others if two men living in the same place and frequently seeing one another meet say at a public assembly any phrase with which one may be heard to accost the otheras hallo are you herewill have an ordinary intonation but if one of them after long absence has unexpectedly returned the expression of surprise with which his friend may greet himhallo how came you herewill be uttered in much more strongly contrasted tones the two syllables of the word hallo will be the one much higher and the other much lower than before and the rest of the sentence will similarly ascend and descend by longer steps  again if supposing her to be in an adjoining room the mistress of the house calls mary the two syllables of the name will be spoken in an ascending interval of a third if mary does not reply the call will be repeated probably in a descending fifth implying the slightest shade of annoyance at marys inattention should mary still make no answer the increasing annoyance will show itself by the use of a descending octave on the next repetition of the call and supposing the silence to continue the lady if not of a very even temper will show her irritation at marys seemingly intentional negligence by finally calling her in tones still more widely contrastedthe first syllable being higher and the last lower than before  now these and analogous facts which the reader will readily accumulate clearly conform to the law laid down for to make large intervals requires more muscular action than to make small ones but not only is the extent of vocal intervals thus explicable as due to the relation between nervous and muscular excitement but also in some degree their direction as ascending or descending the middle notes being those which demand no appreciable effort of muscular adjustment and the effort becoming greater as we either ascend or descend it follows that a departure from the middle notes in either direction will mark increasing emotion while a return towards the middle notes will mark decreasing emotion hence it happens that an enthusiastic person uttering such a sentence asit was the most splendid sight i ever saw will ascend to the first syllable of the word splendid and thence will descend the word splendid marking the climax of the feeling produced by the recollection hence again it happens that under some extreme vexation produced by anothers stupidity an irascible man exclaimingwhat a confounded fool the fellow is will begin somewhat below his middle voice and descending to the word fool which he will utter in one of his deepest notes will then ascend again and it may be remarked that the word fool will not only be deeper and louder than the rest but will also have more emphasis of articulationanother mode in which muscular excitement is shown  there is some danger however in giving instances like this seeing that as the mode of rendering will vary according to the intensity of the feeling which the reader feigns to himself the right cadence may not be hit upon with single words there is less difficulty thus the indeed with which a surprising fact is received mostly begins on the middle note of the voice and rises with the second syllable or if disapprobation as well as astonishment is felt the first syllable will be below the middle note and the second lower still conversely the word alas which marks not the rise of a paroxysm of grief but its decline is uttered in a cadence descending towards the middle note or if the first syllable is in the lower part of the register the second ascends towards the middle note in the heighho expressive of mental and muscular prostration we may see the same truth and if the cadence appropriate to it be inverted the absurdity of the effect clearly shows how the meaning of intervals is dependent on the principle we have been illustrating  the remaining characteristic of emotional speech which we have to notice is that of variability of pitch it is scarcely possible here to convey adequate ideas of this more complex manifestation we must be content with simply indicating some occasions on which it may be observed on a meeting of friends for instanceas when there arrives a party of muchwishedforvisitorsthe voices of all will be heard to undergo changes of pitch not only greater but much more numerous than usual if a speaker at a public meeting is interrupted by some squabble among those he is addressing his comparatively level tones will be in marked contrast with the rapidly changing one of the disputants and among children whose feelings are less under control than those of adults this peculiarity is still more decided during a scene of complaint and recrimination between two excitable little girls the voices may be heard to run up and down the gamut several times in each sentence in such cases we once more recognise the same law for muscular excitement is shown not only in strength of contraction but also in the rapidity with which different muscular adjustments succeed each other  thus we find all the leading vocal phenomena to have a physiological basis they are so many manifestations of the general law that feeling is a stimulus to muscular actiona law conformed to throughout the whole economy not of man only but of every sensitive creaturea law therefore which lies deep in the nature of animal organisation the expressiveness of these various modifications of voice is therefore innate each of us from babyhood upwards has been spontaneously making them when under the various sensations and emotions by which they are produced having been conscious of each feeling at the same time that we heard ourselves make the consequent sound we have acquired an established association of ideas between such sound and the feeling which caused it when the like sound is made by another we ascribe the like feeling to him and by a further consequence we not only ascribe to him that feeling but have a certain degree of it aroused in ourselves for to become conscious of the feeling which another is experiencing is to have that feeling awakened in our own consciousness which is the same thing as experiencing the feeling thus these various modifications of voice become not only a language through which we understand the emotions of others but also the means of exciting our sympathy with such emotions  have we not here then adequate data for a theory of music these vocal peculiarities which indicate excited feeling are those which especially distinguish song from ordinary speech every one of the alterations of voice which we have found to be a physiological result of pain or pleasure is carried to its greatest extreme in vocal music for instance we saw that in virtue of the general relation between mental and muscular excitement one characteristic of passionate utterance is loudness well its comparative loudness is one of the distinctive marks of song as contrasted with the speech of daily life and further the forte passages of an air are those intended to represent the climax of its emotion we next saw that the tones in which emotion expresses itself are in conformity with this same law of a more sonorous timbre than those of calm conversation here too song displays a still higher degree of the peculiarity for the singing tone is the most resonant we can make again it was shown that from a like cause mental excitement vents itself in the higher and lower notes of the register using the middle notes but seldom and it scarcely needs saying that vocal music is still more distinguished by its comparative neglect of the notes in which we talk and its habitual use of those above or below them and moreover that its most passionate effects are commonly produced at the two extremities of its scale but especially the upper one  a yet further trait of strong feeling similarly accounted for was the employment of larger intervals than are employed in common converse this trait also every ballad and aria carries to an extent beyond that heard in the spontaneous utterances of emotion add to which that the direction of these intervals which as diverging from or converging towards the medium tones we found to be physiologically expressive of increasing or decreasing emotion may be observed to have in music like meanings once more it was pointed out that not only extreme but also rapid variations of pitch are characteristic of mental excitement and once more we see in the quick changes of every melody that song carries the characteristic as far if not farther thus in respect alike of loudness timbre pitch intervals and rate of variation song employs and exaggerates the natural language of the emotionsit arises from a systematic combination of those vocal peculiarities which are the physiological effects of acute pleasure and pain  besides these chief characteristics of song as distinguished from common speech there are sundry minor ones similarly explicable as due to the relation between mental and muscular excitement and before proceeding further these should be briefly noticed thus certain passions and perhaps all passions when pushed to an extreme produce probably through their influence over the action of the heart an effect the reverse of that which has been described they cause a physical prostration one symptom of which is a general relaxation of the muscles and a consequent trembling we have the trembling of anger of fear of hope of joy and the vocal muscles being implicated with the rest the voice too becomes tremulous now in singing this tremulousness of voice is very effectively used by some vocalists in highly pathetic passages sometimes indeed because of its effectiveness too much used by themas by tamberlik for instance  again there is a mode of musical execution known as the staccato appropriate to energetic passagesto passages expressive of exhilaration of resolution of confidence the action of the vocal muscles which produces this staccato style is analogous to the muscular action which produces the sharp decisive energetic movements of body indicating these states of mind and therefore it is that the staccato style has the meaning we ascribe to it conversely slurred intervals are expressive of gentler and less active feelings and are so because they imply the smaller muscular vivacity due to a lower mental energy the difference of effect resulting from difference of time in music is also attributable to the same law already it has been pointed out that the more frequent changes of pitch which ordinarily result from passion are imitated and developed in song and here we have to add that the various rates of such changes appropriate to the different styles of music are further traits having the same derivation the slowest movements largo and adagio are used where such depressing emotions as grief or such unexciting emotions as reverence are to be portrayed while the more rapid movements andante allegro presto represent successively increasing degrees of mental vivacity and do this because they imply that muscular activity which flows from this mental vivacity even the rhythm which forms a remaining distinction between song and speech may not improbably have a kindred cause why the actions excited by strong feeling should tend to become rhythmical is not very obvious but that they do so there are divers evidences there is the swaying of the body to and fro under pain or grief of the leg under impatience or agitation dancing too is a rhythmical action natural to elevated emotion that under excitement speech acquires a certain rhythm we may occasionally perceive in the highest efforts of an orator in poetry which is a form of speech used for the better expression of emotional ideas we have this rhythmical tendency developed and when we bear in mind that dancing poetry and music are connateare originally constituent parts of the same thing it becomes clear that the measured movement common to them all implies a rhythmical action of the whole system the vocal apparatus included and that so the rhythm of music is a more subtle and complex result of this relation between mental and muscular excitement  but it is time to end this analysis which possibly we have already carried too far it is not to be supposed that the more special peculiarities of musical expression are to be definitely explained though probably they may all in some way conform to the principle that has been worked out it is obviously impracticable to trace that principle in its more ramified applications nor is it needful to our argument that it should be so traced the foregoing facts sufficiently prove that what we regard as the distinctive traits of song are simply the traits of emotional speech intensified and systematised in respect of its general characteristics we think it has been made clear that vocal music and by consequence all music is an idealisation of the natural language of passion                                       as far as it goes the scanty evidence furnished by history confirms this conclusion note first the fact not properly an historical one but fitly grouped with such that the dancechants of savage tribes are very monotonous and in virtue of their monotony are much more nearly allied to ordinary speech than are the songs of civilised races joining with this the fact that there are still extant among boatmen and others in the east ancient chants of a like monotonous character we may infer that vocal music originally diverged from emotional speech in a gradual unobtrusive manner and this is the inference to which our argument points further evidence to the same effect is supplied by greek history the early poems of the greekswhich be it remembered were sacred legends embodied in that rhythmical metaphorical language which strong feeling exciteswere not recited but chanted the tones and the cadences were made musical by the same influences which made the speech poetical  by those who have investigated the matter this chanting is believed to have been not what we call singing but nearly allied to our recitative far simpler indeed if we may judge from the fact that the early greek lyre which had but four strings was played in unison with the voice which was therefore confined to four notes and as such much less remote from common speech than our own singing is for recitative or musical recitation is in all respects intermediate between speech and song its average effects are not so loud as those of song its tones are less sonorous in timbre than those of song commonly it diverges to a smaller extent from the middle notesuses notes neither so high nor so low in pitch the intervals habitual to it are neither so wide nor so varied its rate of variation is not so rapid and at the same time that its primary rhythm is less decided it has none of that secondary rhythm produced by recurrence of the same or parallel musical phrases which is one of the marked characteristics of song thus then we may not only infer from the evidence furnished by existing barbarous tribes that the vocal music of prehistoric times was emotional speech very slightly exalted but we see that the earliest vocal music of which we have any account differed much less from emotional speech than does the vocal music of our days  that recitativebeyond which by the way the chinese and hindoos seem never to have advancedgrew naturally out of the modulations and cadences of strong feeling we have indeed still current evidence there are even now to be met with occasions on which strong feeling vents itself in this form whoever has been present when a meeting of quakers was addressed by one of their preachers whose practice it is to speak only under the influence of religious emotion must have been struck by the quite unusual tones like those of a subdued chant in which the address was made it is clear too that the intoning used in some churches is representative of this same mental state and has been adopted on account of the instinctively felt congruity between it and the contrition supplication or reverence verbally expressed  and if as we have good reason to believe recitative arose by degrees out of emotional speech it becomes manifest that by a continuance of the same process song has arisen out of recitative just as from the orations and legends of savages expressed in the metaphorical allegorical style natural to them there sprung epic poetry out of which lyric poetry was afterwards developed so from the exalted tones and cadences in which such orations and legends were delivered came the chant or recitative music from whence lyrical music has since grown up and there has not only thus been a simultaneous and parallel genesis but there is also a parallelism of results for lyrical poetry differs from epic poetry just as lyrical music differs from recitative each still further intensifies the natural language of the emotions lyrical poetry is more metaphorical more hyperbolic more elliptical and adds the rhythm of lines to the rhythm of feet just as lyrical music is louder more sonorous more extreme in its intervals and adds the rhythm of phrases to the rhythm of bars and the known fact that out of epic poetry the stronger passions developed lyrical poetry as their appropriate vehicle strengthens the inference that they similarly developed lyrical music out of recitative  nor indeed are we without evidences of the transition it needs but to listen to an opera to hear the leading gradations between the comparatively level recitative of ordinary dialogue the more varied recitative with wider intervals and higher tones used in exciting scenes the still more musical recitative which preludes an air and the air itself the successive steps are but small and the fact that among airs themselves gradations of like nature may be traced further confirms the conclusion that the highest form of vocal music was arrived at by degrees  moreover we have some clue to the influences which have induced this development and may roughly conceive the process of it as the tones intervals and cadences of strong emotion were the elements out of which song was elaborated so we may expect to find that still stronger emotion produced the elaboration and we have evidence implying this instances in abundance may be cited showing that musical composers are men of extremely acute sensibilities the life of mozart depicts him as one of intensely active affections and highly impressionable temperament various anecdotes represent beethoven as very susceptible and very passionate mendelssohn is described by those who knew him to have been full of fine feeling and the almost incredible sensitiveness of chopin has been illustrated in the memoirs of george sand an unusually emotional nature being thus the general characteristic of musical composers we have in it just the agency required for the development of recitative and song intenser feeling producing intenser manifestations any cause of excitement will call forth from such a nature tones and changes of voice more marked than those called forth from an ordinary naturewill generate just those exaggerations which we have found to distinguish the lower vocal music from emotional speech and the higher vocal music from the lower thus it becomes credible that the fourtoned recitative of the early greek poets like all poets nearly allied to composers in the comparative intensity of their feelings was really nothing more than the slightly exaggerated emotional speech natural to them which grew by frequent use into an organised form and it is readily conceivable that the accumulated agency of subsequent poetmusicians inheriting and adding to the products of those who went before them sufficed in the course of the ten centuries which we know it took to develop this fourtoned recitative into a vocal music having a range of two octaves  not only may we so understand how more sonorous tones greater extremes of pitch and wider intervals were gradually introduced but also how there arose a greater variety and complexity of musical expression for this same passionate enthusiastic temperament which naturally leads the musical composer to express the feelings possessed by others as well as himself in extremer intervals and more marked cadences than they would use also leads him to give musical utterance to feelings which they either do not experience or experience in but slight degrees in virtue of this general susceptibility which distinguishes him he regards with emotion events scenes conduct character which produce upon most men no appreciable effect the emotions so generated compounded as they are of the simpler emotions are not expressible by intervals and cadences natural to these but by combinations of such intervals and cadences whence arise more involved musical phrases conveying more complex subtle and unusual feelings and thus we may in some measure understand how it happens that music not only so strongly excites our more familiar feelings but also produces feelings we never had beforearouses dormant sentiments of which we had not conceived the possibility and do not know the meaning or as richter saystells us of things we have not seen and shall not see                                       indirect evidences of several kinds remain to be briefly pointed out one of them is the difficulty not to say impossibility of otherwise accounting for the expressiveness of music whence comes it that special combinations of notes should have special effects upon our emotionsthat one should give us a feeling of exhilaration another of melancholy another of affection another of reverence is it that these special combinations have intrinsic meanings apart from the human constitutionthat a certain number of aerial waves per second followed by a certain other number in the nature of things signify grief while in the reverse order they signify joy and similarly with all other intervals phrases and cadences few will be so irrational as to think this is it then that the meanings of these special combinations are conventional onlythat we learn their implications as we do those of words by observing how others understand them this is an hypothesis not only devoid of evidence but directly opposed to the experience of every one how then are musical effects to be explained if the theory above set forth be accepted the difficulty disappears if music taking for its raw material the various modifications of voice which are the physiological results of excited feelings intensifies combines and complicates themif it exaggerates the loudness the resonance the pitch the intervals and the variability which in virtue of an organic law are the characteristics of passionate speechif by carrying out these further more consistently more unitedly and more sustainedly it produces an idealised language of emotion then its power over us becomes comprehensible but in the absence of this theory the expressiveness of music appears to be inexplicable  again the preference we feel for certain qualities of sound presents a like difficulty admitting only of a like solution it is generally agreed that the tones of the human voice are more pleasing than any others grant that music takes its rise from the modulations of the human voice under emotion and it becomes a natural consequence that the tones of that voice should appeal to our feelings more than any others and so should be considered more beautiful than any others but deny that music has this origin and the only alternative is the untenable position that the vibrations proceeding from a vocalists throat are objectively considered of a higher order than those from a horn or a violin similarly with harsh and soft sounds if the conclusiveness of the foregoing reasonings be not admitted it must be supposed that the vibrations causing the last are intrinsically better than those causing the first and that in virtue of some preestablished harmony the higher feelings and natures produce the one and the lower the other but if the foregoing reasonings be valid it follows as a matter of course that we shall like the sounds that habitually accompany agreeable feelings and dislike those that habitually accompany disagreeable feelings  once more the questionhow is the expressiveness of music to be otherwise accounted for may be supplemented by the questionhow is the genesis of music to be otherwise accounted for that music is a product of civilisation is manifest for though savages have their dancechants these are of a kind scarcely to be dignified by the title musical at most they supply but the vaguest rudiment of music properly so called and if music has been by slow steps developed in the course of civilisation it must have been developed out of something if then its origin is not that above alleged what is its origin  thus we find that the negative evidence confirms the positive and that taken together they furnish strong proof we have seen that there is a physiological relation common to man and all animals between feeling and muscular action that as vocal sounds are produced by muscular action there is a consequent physiological relation between feeling and vocal sounds that all the modifications of voice expressive of feeling are the direct results of this physiological relation that music adopting all these modifications intensifies them more and more as it ascends to its higher and higher forms and becomes music simply in virtue of thus intensifying them that from the ancient epic poet chanting his verses down to the modern musical composer men of unusually strong feelings prone to express them in extreme forms have been naturally the agents of these successive intensifications and that so there has little by little arisen a wide divergence between this idealised language of emotion and its natural language to which direct evidence we have just added the indirectthat on no other tenable hypothesis can either the expressiveness or the genesis of music be explained                                       and now what is the function of music has music any effect beyond the immediate pleasure it produces analogy suggests that it has the enjoyments of a good dinner do not end with themselves but minister to bodily wellbeing though people do not marry with a view to maintain the race yet the passions which impel them to marry secure its maintenance parental affection is a feeling which while it conduces to parental happiness ensures the nurture of offspring men love to accumulate property often without thought of the benefits it produces but in pursuing the pleasure of acquisition they indirectly open the way to other pleasures the wish for public approval impels all of us to do many things which we should otherwise not doto undertake great labours face great dangers and habitually rule ourselves in a way that smooths social intercourse that is in gratifying our love of approbation we subserve divers ulterior purposes and generally our nature is such that in fulfilling each desire we in some way facilitate the fulfilment of the rest but the love of music seems to exist for its own sake the delights of melody and harmony do not obviously minister to the welfare either of the individual or of society may we not suspect however that this exception is apparent only is it not a rational inquirywhat are the indirect benefits which accrue from music in addition to the direct pleasure it gives  but that it would take us too far out of our track we should prelude this inquiry by illustrating at some length a certain general law of progressthe law that alike in occupations sciences arts the divisions that had a common root but by continual divergence have become distinct and are now being separately developed are not truly independent but severally act and react on each other to their mutual advancement merely hinting thus much however by way of showing that there are many analogies to justify us we go on to express the opinion that there exists a relationship of this kind between music and speech  all speech is compounded of two elements the words and the tones in which they are utteredthe signs of ideas and the signs of feelings while certain articulations express the thought certain vocal sounds express the more or less of pain or pleasure which the thought gives using the word cadence in an unusually extended sense as comprehending all modifications of voice we may say that cadence is the commentary of the emotions upon the propositions of the intellect the duality of spoken language though not formally recognised is recognised in practice by every one and every one knows that very often more weight attaches to the tones than to the words daily experience supplies cases in which the same sentence of disapproval will be understood as meaning little or meaning much according to the inflections of voice which accompany it and daily experience supplies still more striking cases in which words and tones are in direct contradictionthe first expressing consent while the last express reluctance and the last being believed rather than the first  these two distinct but interwoven elements of speech have been undergoing a simultaneous development we know that in the course of civilisation words have been multiplied new parts of speech have been introduced sentences have grown more varied and complex and we may fairly infer that during the same time new modifications of voice have come into use fresh intervals have been adopted and cadences have become more elaborate for while on the one hand it is absurd to suppose that along with the undeveloped verbal forms of barbarism there existed a developed system of vocal inflections it is on the other hand necessary to suppose that along with the higher and more numerous verbal forms needed to convey the multiplied and complicated ideas of civilised life there have grown up those more involved changes of voice which express the feelings proper to such ideas if intellectual language is a growth so also without doubt is emotional language a growth  now the hypothesis which we have hinted above is that beyond the direct pleasure which it gives music has the indirect effect of developing this language of the emotions having its root as we have endeavoured to show in those tones intervals and cadences of speech which express feelingarising by the combination and intensifying of these and coming finally to have an embodiment of its ownmusic has all along been reacting upon speech and increasing its power of rendering emotion the use in recitative and song of inflections more expressive than ordinary ones must from the beginning have tended to develop the ordinary ones familiarity with the more varied combinations of tones that occur in vocal music can scarcely have failed to give greater variety of combination to the tones in which we utter our impressions and desires the complex musical phrases by which composers have conveyed complex emotions may rationally be supposed to have influenced us in making those involved cadences of conversation by which we convey our subtler thoughts and feelings  that the cultivation of music has no effect on the mind few will be absurd enough to contend and if it has an effect what more natural effect is there than this of developing our perception of the meanings of inflections qualities and modulations of voice and giving us a correspondingly increased power of using them just as mathematics taking its start from the phenomena of physics and astronomy and presently coming to be a separate science has since reacted on physics and astronomy to their immense advancementjust as chemistry first arising out of the processes of metallurgy and the industrial arts and gradually growing into an independent study has now become an aid to all kinds of productionjust as physiology originating out of medicine and once subordinate to it but latterly pursued for its own sake is in our day coming to be the science on which the progress of medicine dependsso music having its root in emotional language and gradually evolved from it has ever been reacting upon and further advancing it whoever will examine the facts will find this hypothesis to be in harmony with the method of civilisation everywhere displayed  it will scarcely be expected that much direct evidence in support of this conclusion can be given the facts are of a kind which it is difficult to measure and of which we have no records some suggestive traits however may be noted may we not say for instance that the italians among whom modern music was earliest cultivated and who have more especially practised and excelled in melody the division of music with which our argument is chiefly concernedmay we not say that these italians speak in more varied and expressive inflections and cadences than any other nation on the other hand may we not say that confined almost exclusively as they have hitherto been to their national airs which have a marked family likeness and therefore accustomed to but a limited range of musical expression the scotch are unusually monotonous in the intervals and modulations of their speech and again do we not find among different classes of the same nation differences that have like implications the gentleman and the clown stand in a very decided contrast with respect to variety of intonation listen to the conversation of a servantgirl and then to that of a refined accomplished lady and the more delicate and complex changes of voice used by the latter will be conspicuous now without going so far as to say that out of all the differences of culture to which the upper and lower classes are subjected difference of musical culture is that to which alone this difference of speech is ascribable yet we may fairly say that there seems a much more obvious connection of cause and effect between these than between any others thus while the inductive evidence to which we can appeal is but scanty and vague yet what there is favours our position                                       probably most will think that the function here assigned to music is one of very little moment but further reflection may lead them to a contrary conviction in its bearings upon human happiness we believe that this emotional language which musical culture develops and refines is only second in importance to the language of the intellect perhaps not even second to it for these modifications of voice produced by feelings are the means of exciting like feelings in others joined with gestures and expressions of face they give life to the otherwise dead words in which the intellect utters its ideas and so enable the hearer not only to understand the state of mind they accompany but to partake of that state in short they are the chief media of sympathy and if we consider how much both our general welfare and our immediate pleasures depend upon sympathy we shall recognise the importance of whatever makes this sympathy greater if we bear in mind that by their fellowfeeling men are led to behave justly kindly and considerately to each otherthat the difference between the cruelty of the barbarous and the humanity of the civilised results from the increase of fellowfeeling if we bear in mind that this faculty which makes us sharers in the joys and sorrows of others is the basis of all the higher affectionsthat in friendship love and all domestic pleasures it is an essential element if we bear in mind how much our direct gratifications are intensified by sympathyhow at the theatre the concert the picture gallery we lose half our enjoyment if we have no one to enjoy with us if in short we bear in mind that for all happiness beyond what the unfriended recluse can have we are indebted to this same sympathywe shall see that the agencies which communicate it can scarcely be overrated in value  the tendency of civilisation is more and more to repress the antagonistic elements of our characters and to develop the social onesto curb our purely selfish desires and exercise our unselfish onesto replace private gratifications by gratifications resulting from or involving the happiness of others and while by this adaptation to the social state the sympathetic side of our nature is being unfolded there is simultaneously growing up a language of sympathetic intercoursea language through which we communicate to others the happiness we feel and are made sharers in their happiness  this double process of which the effects are already sufficiently appreciable must go on to an extent of which we can as yet have no adequate conception the habitual concealment of our feelings diminishing as it must in proportion as our feelings become such as do not demand concealment we may conclude that the exhibition of them will become much more vivid than we now dare allow it to be and this implies a more expressive emotional language at the same time feelings of a higher and more complex kind as yet experienced only by the cultivated few will become general and there will be a corresponding development of the emotional language into more involved forms just as there has silently grown up a language of ideas which rude as it at first was now enables us to convey with precision the most subtle and complicated thoughts so there is still silently growing up a language of feelings which notwithstanding its present imperfection we may expect will ultimately enable men vividly and completely to impress on each other all the emotions which they experience from moment to moment  thus if as we have endeavoured to show it is the function of music to facilitate the development of this emotional language we may regard music as an aid to the achievement of that higher happiness which it indistinctly shadows forth those vague feelings of unexperienced felicity which music arousesthose indefinite impressions of an unknown ideal life which it calls up may be considered as a prophecy to the fulfilment of which music is itself partly instrumental the strange capacity which we have for being so affected by melody and harmony may be taken to imply both that it is within the possibilities of our nature to realise those intenser delights they dimly suggest and that they are in some way concerned in the realisation of them on this supposition the power and the meaning of music become comprehensible but otherwise they are a mystery  we will only add that if the probability of these corollaries be admitted then music must take rank as he highest of the fine artsas the one which more than any other ministers to human welfare and thus even leaving out of view the immediate gratifications it is hourly giving we cannot too much applaud that progress of musical culture which is becoming one of the characteristics of our age  1 frasers magazine october
