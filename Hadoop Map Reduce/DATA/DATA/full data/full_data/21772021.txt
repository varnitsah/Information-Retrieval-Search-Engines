21772021	freaks on the fells by rm ballantyne    story one chapter 1  mr sudberry in his countinghouse  mr john sudberry was a successful london merchant  he was also a fat little man  moreover he was a sturdy little man wore spectacles and had a smooth bald head over which at the time we introduce him to the reader fifty summers had passed with their corresponding autumns winters and springs  the passage of so many seasons over him appeared to have exercised a polishing influence on the merchant for mr sudberrys cranium shone like a billiardball  in temperament mr sudberry was sanguine and full of energy  he could scarcely have been a successful merchant without these qualities  he was also extremely violent  now it is necessary here to guard the reader from falling into a mistake in reference to mr sudberrys character  we have said that he was violent but it must not be supposed that he was passionate  by no means  he was the most amiable and sweettempered of men  his violence was owing to physical rather than mental causes  he was hasty in his volitions impulsive in his actions madly reckless in his personal movements  his moral and physical being was capable of only two conditionsdeep repose or wild activity  at his desk mr sudberry was wont to sit motionless like a statue with his face buried in his hands and his thoughts busy  when these thoughts culminated he would start as if he had received an electric shock seize a pen and with pursed lips and frowning brows send it careering over the paper with harrowing rapidity squeaking and chirping the pen not the man like a small bird with a bad cold  mr sudberry used quills  he was a tremendous writer  he could have reported the debates of the house in longhand  the merchants portrait is not yet finished  he was a peculiar man and men of this sort cannot be sketched off in a few lines  indeed had he not been a peculiar man it would not have been worth while to drag him thus prominently into notice  among other peculiarities in mr sudberrys character he was afflicted with a chronic tendency to dab his pen into the inkbottle and split it to the feather or double up its point so as to render it unserviceable  this infirmity coupled with an uncommon capacity for upsetting inkbottles had induced him to hire a small clerk whose principal duties were to mend pens wipe up ink and generally to attend to the removal of debris  when mr sudberry slept he did it profoundly  when he awoke he did it with a start and a stare as if amazed at having caught himself in the very act of indulging in such weakness  when he washed he puffed and gasped and rubbed and made such a noise that one might have supposed a walrus was engaged in its ablutions  how the skin of his head face and neck stood the towelling it received is incomprehensible  when he walked he went like an express train when he sauntered he relapsed into the slowest possible snailspace but he did not graduate the changes from one to the other  when he sat down he did so with a crash  the number of chairs which mr sudberry broke in the course of his life would have filled a goodlysized concertroom and the number of teacups which he had swept off tables with the tails of his coat might we believe have set up a moderately ambitious man in the china trade  there was always a beaming smile on the merchants countenance except when he was engaged in deep thought then his mouth was pursed and his brows knitted  the small clerk was a thinbodied weakminded timid boy of about twelve years of age and of humble origin  he sat at mr sudberrys double desk in the office opposite and in dangerous proximity to his master whom he regarded with great admiration alarm and awe  on a lovely afternoon towards the middle of may when city men begin to thirst for a draught of fresh air and to long for an undignified roll on the green fields among primroses buttercups and daisies mr sudberry sat at his desk reading the advertisements in the times  suddenly he flung the paper away hit the desk a sounding blow with his clinched fist and exclaimed firmly  ill do it  accustomed though he was to nervous shocks the small clerk leaped with more than ordinary tremor off his stool on this occasion picked up the paper laid it at his masters elbow and sat down again prepared to look outnautically speakingfor more squalls  mr sudberry seized a quill dabbed it into the inkbottle and split it  seizing another he dabbed again the quill stood the shock the small clerk ventured a sigh of relief and laid aside the inky napkin which he had pulled out of his desk expecting an upset and prepared for the worst  a note was dashed off in two minutessigned sealed addressed in half a minute and mr sudberry leaped off his stool  his hat was thrown on his head by a species of sleight of hand and he appeared in the outer office suddenly like a stout jackinthebox  im away mr jones to his head clerk and wont be back till eleven tomorrow morning  have you the letters ready  i am going round by the postoffice and will take charge of them  they are here sir said mr jones in a mild voice  mr jones was a meek man with a red nose and a humble aspect  he was a confidential clerk and much respected by the firm of sudberry and company  in fact it was generally understood that the business could not get on without him  his caution was a most salutary counteractive to mr sudberrys recklessness  as for co he was a sleeping partner and an absolute nonentity  mr sudberry seized the letters and let them fall picked them up in haste thrust them confusedly into his pocket and rushed from the room knocking over the umbrellastand in his exit  the sensation left in the office was that of a dead calm after a sharp squall  the small clerk breathed freely and felt that his life was safe for that day    story one chapter 2  mr sudberry at home  my dear cried mr sudberry to his wife abruptly entering the parlour of his villa near hampstead heath i have done the deed  dear john you are so violent my nervesreallywhat deed said mrs sudberry a weakeyed delicate woman of languid temperament and not far short of her husbands age  i have written off to secure a residence in the highlands of scotland for our summer quarters this season  mrs sudberry stared in mute surprise  john my dear are you in earnest  have you not been precipitate in this matter  you know love that i have always trusted in your prudence to make arrangements for the spending of our holiday but really when i think  well my dear when you thinkpray go on  dont be hasty dear john you know i have never objected to any place you have hitherto fixed on  herne bay last year was charming and the year before we enjoyed margate so much  even worthing though rather too long a journey for a family was delightful and as the family was smaller then we got over the journey on the whole better than could have been expected  but scotlandthe highlandsmr sudberrys look at this point induced his wife to come to a full stop  the look was not a stern lookmuch less a savage look as connubial looks sometimes are  it was an aggrieved look not that he was aggrieved at the dubious reception given by his spouse to the arrangement he had madeno the sore point in his mind was that he himself entertained strong doubts as to the propriety of what he had done and to find these doubts reflected in the mind of his faithful better half was perplexing  well mary said the worthy merchant go on  do you state the cons and ill enumerate the pros after which we will close the account and see on which side the balance lies  you know dear said mrs sudberry in a remonstrative tone that the journey is fearfully long  i almost tremble when i think of it  to be sure we have the railroad to edinburgh now but beyond that we shall have to travel by stage i suppose at least i hope so but perhaps they have no stagecoaches in scotland  oh yes they have a few i believe replied the merchant with a smile  ah that is fortunate for wagons are fearfully trying  no i really think that i could not stand a wagon journey after my experience of the picnic at worthing some years ago  think of our large familyseven of us altogetherin a wagon john  but you forget i said that there are stagecoaches in scotland  well but think of the slow and wearisome travelling among great mountains over precipices and through scotch mists  lady knownothing assures me she has been told that the rain never ceases in scotland except for a short time in autumn just to give the scanty crops time to ripen  you know dear that our darling jackys health could never stand the scotch mists he is so very delicate  why mary exclaimed mr sudberry abruptly the doctor told me only yesterday that for a boy of five years old he was a perfect marvel of robust healththat nothing ailed him except the result of overeating and the want of openair exercise and i am sure that i can testify to the strength of his legs and the soundness of his lungs for he kicks like a jackass and roars like a lion  it is very wrong very sinful of the doctor said mrs sudberry in a languidly indignant manner to give such a false report of the health of our darling boy  at this moment the door burst open and the darling boy rushed into the roomwith a wild cheer of defiance at his nurse from whom he had escaped and who was in full pursuithit his head on the corner of the table and fell flat on the floor with a yell that might have sent a pang of jealousy to the heart of a chippeway indian  mr sudberry started up and almost overturned the teatable in his haste but before he could reach his prostrate son nurse had him kicking in her arms and carried him off howling  darling child said mrs sudberry with her hand on her heart  how you do startle me john with your violence  that is the fifteenth teacup this week  the good lady pointed to a shattered member of the set that lay on the tray beside her  i have just ordered a new set my dear said her husband in a subdued voice  our poor dear boy would benefit i think by mountain air  but go on with the cons  have i not said enough replied mrs sudberry with an injured look besides they have no food in scotland  this was a somewhat staggering assertion  the merchant looked astonished  at least pursued his wife they have nothing i am told but oatmeal  do you imagine that jacky could live on oatmeal  do you suppose that your family would return to london in a condition fit to be looked at after a summer spent on food such as we give to our horses no doubt you will tell me they have plenty of milkbuttermilk i suppose which i abhor  but do you think that i could live with pleasure on sawdust just because i had milk to take to it  but milk implies cream my dear interposed the merchant and buttermilk implies butter and both imply cows which are strong presumptive evidence in favour of beef  besides  dont talk to me mr sudberry  i know better and lady knownothing who went to scotland last year in the most unprejudiced state of mind came back absolutely horrified by what she had seen  why she actually tells me that the natives still wear the kilt  the very day she passed through edinburgh she met five hundred men without trousers  to be sure they had guns on their shoulders and someone told her they were soldiers but the sight was so appalling that she could not get rid of the impression she shut her eyes and ordered the coachman to drive straight through the town and let her know when she was quite beyond its walls  she has no doubt whatever that most if not all of the other inhabitants of that place were clothedperhaps i should say unclothedin the same way  what surprised poor lady knownothing most was that she did not see nearly so many kilts in the highlands as she saw on that occasion in edinburgh from which she concluded that the natives of scotland are less barbarous in the north than they are in the south  but she did see a few  one man who played those hideous things called the pipeswhich she says are so very like little pigs being killedactually came into her presence one day sat down before her with bare knees and took a pinch of snuff with a saltspoon  that is a dreadful account no doubt said mr sudberry but you must remember that lady knownothing is given to exaggerating and is therefore not to be depended on  have you done with the cons  not nearly done john but my nervous system cannot stand the sustained contemplation of such things  i should like to recover breath and hear what you have to say in favour of this temporary expatriation i had almost said of your family  well then here goes for the pros cried mr sudberry while a gleam of excitement shot from his eyes and his clinched hand came heavily down on the table  the sixteenth cupas near as possible observed his wife languidly  never mind the cups my dear but listen to me  the air of the highlands is salubrious and bracing  and piercingly cold my dear john interrupted mrs sudberry  in summer pursued her husband regardless of the interruption it is sometimes as clear and warm as it is in italy  and often foggy my dear  the mountain scenery is grand and majestic beyond description  then why attempt to describe it dear john  the hotels in most parts of the highlands though rather expensive  ah think of that my dear  though rather expensive are excellent the food is of the best quality and the wines are passable  beds  have they beds my dear  beds are generally found to be well aired and quite clean though of course in the poorer and more remote districts they are  hush pray spare my feelings my dear john  remote districts they are not so immaculate as one would wish  then there are endless moors covered with game and splendid lakes and rivers full of fish  just think mary what a region for our dear boys to revel in  think of the shooting  and the dreadful accidents my dear  think of the fishing  and the wet feet and the colds  poor darling jacky what a prospect  think of the glorious sunrises seen from the mountaintops before breakfast  and the falling over precipices and broken necks and limbs dear john  think of the shaggy ponies for our darling lucy to ride on  ah and to fall off  and the dew of early morning on the hills and the mists rolling up from the lakes and the wild uncultivated beauty of all around us and the sketching and walking and driving  dreadful  and bathing and boating  and drowning  not to mention the  dear john have pity on me  the pros are too much for me  i cannot stand the thought  but my dear the place is taken  the thing is fixed said mr sudberry with emphasis  mrs sudberry was a wise woman  when she was told by her husband that a thing was fixed she invariably gave in with a good grace  her powers of dissuasion having failedas they always did failshe arose kissed mr sudberrys forehead assured him that she would try to make the most of it since it was fixed and left the room with the comfortable feeling of having acted the part of a dutiful wife and a resigned martyr  it was towards the close of a doubtful summers evening several weeks after the conversation just detailed that a heavy stagecoach of an oldfashioned description toiled slowly up the ascent of one of those wild passes by which access is gained into the highlands of perthshire  the course of the vehicle had for some time lain along the banks of a turbulent river whose waters when not brawling over a rocky bed in impetuous velocity or raging down a narrow gorge in misty spray were curling calmly in deep pools or caldrons the dark surfaces of which were speckled with foam and occasionally broken by the leap of a yellow trout or a silver salmon  to an angler the stream would have been captivating in the extreme but his ardour would have been somewhat damped by the sight of the dense copsewood which overhung the water and while it added to the wild beauty of the scenery suggested the idea of fishing under difficulties  when the coach reached the narrowest part of the pass the driver pulled up and intimated that she would be obleeged if the leddies and gentlemen would get down and walk up the brae  hereupon there descended from the top of the vehicle a short stout elderly gentleman in a glengarry bonnet green tartan shootingcoat and shepherdsplaid vest and pantaloons two active youths of the ages of seventeen and fifteen respectively in precisely similar costume a manservant in pepper and salt and a little thin timid boy in blue a sort of confidential page without the buttons  all of them wore drab gaiters and shoes of the thickest conceivable description  from the inside of the coach there issued a delicate elderly lady who leaned in a helpless manner on the arm of a young plain but extremely fresh and sweetlooking girl of about sixteen whom the elder lady called lucy and who was so much engrossed with her mother that some time elapsed before she could attend to the fervent remarks made by her father and brothers in regard to the scenery  there also came forth from the interior of the coach a large redfaced angry woman who dragged after her a little girl of about eight who might be described as a modest sunbeam and a little boy of about five who resembled nothing short of an imp incarnate  when they were all out the entire family and household of mr sudberry stood in the centre of that lovely highland pass and the coach which was a special one hired for the occasion drove slowly up the ascent  what the various members of the family said in the extravagance of their excited feelings on this occasion we do not intend to reveal  it has been said that the day was doubtful in the south the sky was red with the refulgent beams of the setting sun which gleamed on the mountain peaks and glowed on the purple heather  towards the north dark leaden clouds obscured the heavens and presaged stormy weather  a few large drops began to fall as they reached the crest of the road and opened up a view of the enclosed valley or amphitheatre which lay beyond with a winding river a dark overshadowed loch and a noble background of hills  in the far distance a white house was seen embedded in the blue mountains  yonders ta hoose said the driver as the party overtook the coach and resumed their placesthe males on the top and the females inside  oh my dear look look cried mr sudberry leaning over the side of the coach there is our housethe white houseour highland home  at this moment a growl of distant thunder was heard  it was followed by a scream from mrs sudberry and a cry of  youd better send jacky inside my dear  ah he may as well remain where he is replied mr sudberry whose imperfect hearing led him to suppose that his spouse had said jackys inside my dear whereas the real truth was that the boy was neither out nor inside  master jacky be it known had a remarkably strong will of his own during the journey he preferred an outside seat in all weathers  by dint of much coaxing his mother had induced him to get in beside her for one stage but he had made himself so insufferably disagreeable that the good lady was thereafter much more disposed to let him have his own way  when the coach stopped as we have described jacky got out and roundly asserted that he would never get in again  when the attention of the party was occupied with the gorgeous scenery at the extremity of the pass jacky under a sudden impulse of wickedness crept stealthily into the copse that lined the road intending to give his parents a fright  in less than five minutes these parents were galloping away at the rate of ten miles an hour each happy in the belief that the sweet boy was with the other  somewhat surprised at the prolonged and deathlike silence that reigned around him jacky returned to the road where he actually gasped with horror on finding himself the solitary tenant of an apparently uninhabited wilderness  sitting down on a stone he shut his eyes opened wide his mouth and roared vehemently  at the end of about five minutes he ventured to reopen his eyes  his face instantly assumed an expression of abject terror and the roar was intensified into a piercing shriek when he beheld a fierce little black cow staring at him within a yard of his face  a drove of shaggy highland cattle had come suddenly round a turn in the pass while jackys eyes had been shut  they now filed slowly and steadily past the transfixed boy as if they were a regiment and he a reviewing general  each animal as it came up stopped stared for a few seconds and passed slowly on with its head down as if saddened by the sight of such a melancholy spectacle  there were upwards of a hundred animals in the drove the prolonged and maddening agony which jacky endured may therefore be conceived but cannot be described  last of all came the drover a kilted plaided and bonneted highlander quite as shaggy as the roughest of his cattle and rather fiercer in aspect  he was not so in reality however for on coming to the place where the poor boy sat he stopped and stared as his predecessors had done  fat is she doin there said he  jacky paused and gazed for one moment in mute surprise then resumed his roar with shut eyes and with tenfold vigour  as it was evident that any farther attempt at conversation must prove fruitless the drover took jacky in his arms carried him to the extremity of the pass set him down and pointing to the white house in the blue distance said  yonders ta hoose let her see how she can rin  jacky fixed his eyes on the house with the stare of one who regarded it as his last and only refuge and ran as he had never done before roaring while he ran  shes a clever callant observed the drover with a grim smile as he turned to follow his cattle  meanwhile the sudberry family reached the white house in the midst of increasing rain and mists and muttering thunder  of course jackys absence was at once discovered  of course the females screamed and the males shouted while they turned the mailcoach entirely inside out in a vain search for the lost one  the din was increased by nine shepherd dogs which rushed down the mountainside barking furiously with delight probably and with excitement certainly at the unwonted sight of so many strangers in that remote glen  presently the coach was turned round and the distracted father galloped back towards the pass of course he almost ran over his youngest son in less than five minutes five minutes more placed the recovered child in its mothers arms then followed a scene of kissing crying laughing barking and excitement which is utterly indescribable accompanied by thunder lightning and rain in the midst of which tempestuous mental and elemental commotion the sudberry family took possession of their highland home    story one chapter 3  first impressions  next morning the sudberrys were awakened to a sense of the peculiar circumstances into which they had plunged by the lowing of cattle the crowing of cocks and the furious barking of collie dogs as the household of donald mcallister commenced the labours of a new day  of course every member of the sudberry family with the exception of mamma rushed to his or her respective window  oh how beautiful gushed from the heart and lips of lucy as she gazed in wonder through the casement and a shriek burst from jacky as he stared in wild delight upon the gorgeous scene that met his view  we have said that the white house was embedded among the blue hills  it was an old and extremely simple building having an oblong front two sides and a back two stories six windows and one door which last imbued apparently with a dislike to being shut was always open  the house appeared to have an insatiable thirst for mountain air and it was well supplied with this fresh and exhilarating beverage for it stood in an elevated position on the slope of a mountain and overlooked a wide tract of flood and fell on which latter there was little wood but a luxuriant carpet of grass and heather  the weather had evidently resolved to make amends for its surly reception of the strangers the previous evening by greeting them with one of its sweetest highland smiles in the morning  when mr sudberry in the exuberance of his delight ran without hat or coat to a neighbouring knoll accompanied by all his children the scene that met his eye was one of surpassing grandeur and beauty  the mists of early morning were rolling up from the loch in white fleecy clouds which floated over and partly concealed the sides of the mountains  the upper wreaths of these clouds and the crags and peaks that pierced through them were set on fire by the rising sun  great fissures and gorges in the hills which at other times lay concealed in the blue haze of distance were revealed by the mists and the slanting rays of the sun and the incumbent cliffs bluff promontories and capes were in some places sharply defined in others luminously softened so that the mountains displayed at once that appearance of solid reality mingled with melting mystery which is seen at no period of the day but early morning  the whole scenewater earth and skywas so involved that no lines of demarcation could be traced anywhere only bold startling points melting into blue and white masses that mingled with each other in golden and pearly greys of every conceivable variety  having said thus much we need scarcely add that the scene cannot be adequately described  a light fragrant air met the stout englishman as he crested the hill and filled his unaccustomed nostrils with sensations that could not have been excelled had he been greeted by one of africs spicy gales  the same air with telegraphic speed conveyed to the collie dogs of the place the information that the sudberrys were abroad whereupon the whole packnine in numberbounded openmouthed up the hill with noise and ferocity enough to have alarmed the bravest of the brave  no wonder then that poor jacky rushed into his fathers knees being too small to run into his arms  but these seemingly ferocious dogs were in reality the gentlest and meekest of animals  down topper down down lively lass come into heel swaney cried donald mcallister as he approached his tenants  goodmornin miss mornin gentlemen  the ben has on its nightcap but im thinkin itll soon take it off  donald mcallisters english was excellent but he spoke in a slow deliberate manner and with a slightly nasal drawl which sounded very peculiar in the ears of the sudberrysjust as peculiar in fact as their speech sounded in the ears of mcallister  ah you call the white cloud on the mountaintop a nightcapgood very good cried mr sudberry rubbing his hands  what a charming place this is a paradisaical place so to speak  the dogs wont bite will they said he patting the alarmed jacky on the head  no fear o the dogs sir returned mcallister theyre like lambs its just their way  yell be for a row on the loch the day no doot the highlander addressed this remark to george and fred  what exclaimed the former is there a boat that we can have the use of  deed is there a good safe boat too that can hold the whole of ye ill show you where the oars lie after breakfast  capital cried mr sudberry rubbing his hands  charming exclaimed lucy with sparkling eyes  master jacky expressed his glee with a characteristic cheer or yell that at once set fire to the easily inflamed spirits of the dogs causing them to resume their excited gambols and furious barking  this effectually stopped the conversation for five minutes  i delight in boating observed fred when mcallister had quelled the disturbance  so do i said his father but fishing is the thing for me  theres nothing like fishing  you have fine trout in the lake i believe  ay an salmon too answered mcallister  so ive heard so ive heard said mr sudberry with a glow of excitement and pleasure on his round visage  we must get our rods and tackle unpacked at once george  you are a great fisher no doubt mr mcallister  well not just that but i do manage to fill a basket now and then an whiles to land a gilse  a gilse cried george in surprise what is that  it is a small salmon  oh you mean a grilse interposed mr sudberry  yes i mean that an i said that returned mcallister slowly and with emphasis  scienteefic men are not agreed whether the gilse is a small salmon or not im of opeenion that it is  but whether or not its a famous fish on the table and lively enough on the line to delight the heart of every true disciple of isaac walton  what you have read that charming book exclaimed mr sudberry looking at the rugged highlander in some surprise  yes replied the other in the grave quiet manner that was peculiar to him i took to it one winter as a sort o recreation after readin through paleys evidences  what cried mr sudberry whose evidences did you say  paleys yeve heard o him dootless  why yes replied mr sudberry i have heard of him but ii must confess that i have not read him  at this point jackys eye fell on a shaggy little cow which had strayed near to the party and stood regarding him with a stern inquisitive glance  remembering the fright he had received so recently from a similar creature he uttered a tremendous roar and again sought refuge in his fathers knees  the discussion on paley was thus cut short for the dogswhose chief delight was to bark though not to bite as has been libellously asserted of all dogs by dr wattssprang to their feet divided their forces and while two of the oldest kept frisking round and leaping upon the party in a promiscuous manner as if to assure them of protection in the event of danger the remainder ran openmouthed and howling at the cow  that curlyheaded longhorned creature received them at first with a defiant look and an elevated tail but ultimately took to her heels to the immense delight of jacky whose soul was imbued with a deep and altogether unutterable horror of cattle especially black cows  the service which the dogs rendered to him on this occasion induced the boy to make advances of a friendly nature which were met more than halfway and the result was the establishment of a good understanding between the sudberrys and the collie dogs which ultimately ripened into a lasting friendship insomuch that when the family quitted the place lucy carried away with her a lock of livelys hair cut from the pendent tip of her right ear  presently mr sudberry pulled out his watch and exclaiming that it was breakfasttime trotted down the hill followed by his family and escorted by the dogs  we will pause here to describe mr sudberrys family briefly  george was the merchants eldest son  he was bold stout active middlesized and seventeen years of age full of energy and life a crack rower a firstrate cricketer and generally a clever fellow george was always jolly  fred was about the same height as his brother two years younger slender in form and gentle in disposition but active too when occasion required it  his forte was drawing and painting  fred was generally quiet and grave  both brothers were musical  lucy had reached the interesting age of sixteen  she was plain decidedly but sweettempered in the extreme  her mouth was good and her eyes were good and her colour was good but her nose was a snub an undeniable and incurable snub  her mother had tried to amend it from the earliest hours of lucys existence by pulling the point gently downwards and pinching up the bridgeor rather the hollow where the bridge ought to have beenbut all in vain the infant turned up its eyes when the operation was going on and still turned up its nose when it was over  yes although there were many of the elements of beauty about lucy she was plainbut sweet always bear that in mind  she was funny too  not that she made fun of her own free will but she appreciated fun in others so intensely that she looked funny herself and she giggled  this was her only fault she giggled  when the spirit of fun was roused nothing could stop her  but dont suppose that she was always giggling by no means  she was always good and amiable often grave and sometimes deeply serious  matilda commonly called tilly was a meek delicate pretty little girl of eight years old  she was charmingly innocent and ignorant  in the last respect she resembled her mother who was the only other stupid member of mr sudberrys family  being deeply impressed with the fact of her ignorance and stupidity mrs sudberry went on the tack of boldly admitting the same and holding or affecting to hold ability and general acquirements in contempt  mrs brown was a female dragon nurse to master jacky and miss tilly she tormented the former whom she disliked and spoiled the latter whom she loved  hobbs was the manservant of the family  he was characterised chiefly by a tendency to drop his hs in conversation out of words to which they naturally belonged and to pick them up and insert them in the most contradictory manner in words with which they had no connection whatever  he was also marked by the strong regard and esteem which he had for his master and family the stronger regard and esteem which he had for himself and the easy goodhumoured way in which he regarded the remainder of the world at large as an inferior order of beings  as for peter he has already been described as the timid clerk of humble origin whose chief duties while in london were to wipe up ink and clear away debris  he had been taken with the family to act the part of a page in buttons without the buttonsand to make himself generally useful  hitherto the pages bosom had since leaving london been a chamber of indescribable terrors  truly if as is said the anticipation of death be worse than the reality poor peter must have suffered a prolonged and continuous death during the last few days never having been on a railway before the first shriek of the whistle pierced him like a knife the shock of starting rent him figuratively like a thunderbolt  thereafter every passing train was an excruciating arrow in his quivering heart every tunnel was a plunge into the horrible anticipation that here it was coming at last  but peters trials were now for a time he fondly hoped at an end  poor boy he little knew what was in store for him    story one chapter 4  first comers served first etcetera  when mr sudberry reached the breakfast parlour and put his head in at the door to see whether his faithful wife were there he was struck absolutely dumb by the amazing tableau vivant that met his vision  there was nothing in the aspect of the room itself to surprise him  it was homely and neat  the table was spread with a clean white cloth on which the breakfast equipage was displayed with a degree of care and precision that betrayed the masterhand of hobbs but on the edge of the table sat a large black cat calmly breakfasting off a pat of delicious fresh butter  beside the table with its forelegs thereon and its hindlegs on the floor stood a large nannygoat which was either looking in vain for something suited to its own particular taste or admiring with disinterested complacency the energy with which two hens and a bantam cock pecked out the crumb of a wheaten loaf  if the latter were the goats occupation it must have been charmed beyond expression for the half of the loaf had been devoured by the audacious trio and just at the moment of mr sudberrys appearance the bantams body was buried over the shoulders and nothing of it was visible to the horrified master of the house save its tail appearing over the edge of the loaf  sheeeew roared mr sudberry rushing into the room and whirling his arms like the sails of a windmill  the cat vanished through the window like a black vision galvanised and made awfully real  the poultry thrown into convulsions of terror flew screaming round the room in blind haste searching for a door or window of escape while the goat true to its nature ran at the enemy on its hindlegs and with its head down attempted to punch him on the stomach  by an active leap to one side the enemy escaped this charge but the goat nothing daunted turned to renew the attack next moment george fred and hobbs rushing into the room diverted its attention  intimidated by overwhelming numbers the animal darted through the doorway along the passage and out at the front door where it met peter unexpectedly and wreaked its disappointed vengeance on him by planting on his chest the punch which had been intended for his master  by this means that timid and hapless youth was laid flat on the green grass  is jacky safe cried mrs sudberry running into the room with terror on her countenance and falling down on the sofa in a semiswoon on being informed that he was  she was followed by lucy and tilly with scentbottles and by nurse who exhibited a tendency to go off into hysterics but who in consequence of a look from her master postponed that luxury to a more convenient season  thus the expatriated family assembled to morning prayers and to partake of their first highland breakfast  of course that day being their first was spent in an excited and rambling endeavour to master the localities and ascertain the most interesting points about their new home  mrs sudberry and her daughters examined the interior accommodation of the white house minutely and with the assistance of mrs brown hobbs and the page disposed their goods and chattels to the best advantage while her husband and sons went out to introduce themselves to the farmer and his family  they lived in a small cottage or offshoot at the back of the principal dwelling in close proximity to which were the byre stable and barns  it would occupy too much space to relate in detail all the things and sights that called forth the delight and surprise of the excitable mr sudberry  how he found to his amazement that the byre was under the same roof with the farmers kitchen and only separated therefrom by a wooden partition with a door in it  how he was assailed by the nine collie dogs the moment he entered the kitchen with threats of being torn to pieces yet was suffered to pass unscathed  how he and his sons were introduced by mr mcallister to his mother a grave mild old woman who puzzled them beyond measure because although clad in homely and unfashionable garments and dwelling in a hut little better than the habitation of the cattle except in point of cleanliness she conversed and conducted herself towards them with a degree of unaffected ease and urbanity that might have graced any lady in the land  how this old lady astonished them with the amount of general knowledge that leaked out in the course of a few minutes talk  how she introduced the dogs by name one by one to jacky which delighted him immensely and how soon after that jacky attempted to explore outoftheway corners of the farmyard and stepped suddenly up to the knees in a mudhole out of which he emerged with a pair of tightfitting wellington boots which filled him with ecstasy and his father with disgust  all this and a great deal more might be dilated on largely but we are compelled to dismiss it summarily without further remark  in the course of that day mr sudberry and his boys learned a great deal about their new home from mcallister whom they found intelligent shrewd and wellinformed on any topic they chose to broach even although he was as mr sudberry said in surprise quite a common man who wore corduroy and wrought in his fields like a mere labourer after dinner they all walked out together and had a row on the lake under his guidance and in the evening they unexpectedly met mr hector macdonald who was proprietor of the estate on which the white house stood and who dwelt in another white house of much larger size at the head of the loch distant about two miles  mrs sudberry had expected to find this highland gentleman a very poor and proud sort of man with a rough aspect a superabundance of red hair and possibly a kilt judge then her surprise when she found him to be a young gentleman of refined mind prepossessing manners elegant though sturdy appearance and clad in grey tweed shootingcoat vest and trousers the cut of which could not have been excelled by her own georges tailor and george was particular in respect to cut  mr macdonald who carried a fishingrod introduced himself and accompanied his new friends part of the way home and then saying that he was about to take a cast in the river before sunset offered to show the gentlemen the best pools  the gentlemen leaped at the offer more eagerly than ever trout leaped at an artificial fly for they were profoundly ignorant of the gentle art except as it is practised on the thames seated on a chair in a punt and with bait and float  hector macdonald not only showed his friends where to fish but how to fish and the whole thing appeared so easy as practised and explained by him that father and sons turned their steps homeward about dusk convinced that they could do it easily and anticipating triumph on the morrow  on the way home after parting from hector they passed a solitary hut of the rudest description which might have escaped observation had not a bright stream of light issued from the low doorway and crossed their path  i would like to peep into this cottage father said fred who cherished strong sympathies with poor people  come then cried mr sudberry let us explore  jacky who was with them felt timid and objected but being told that he might hang about outside he gave in  they had to bend low on entering the hovel which was mean and uncomfortable in appearance  the walls were built of unhewn stones gathered from the bed of the river hard by and the interstices were filled up with mud and straw  nothing graced these walls in the shape of ornament but a few mugs and tin pots and several culinary implements hung from rusty nails and wooden pegs  the floor was of hard mud there was no ceiling and the rafters were stained black by the smoke of the peat fire which burned in the middle of the floor and the only chimney for which was a small hole in the roof  a stool a broken chair and a crooked table constituted the entire furniture of the miserable place unless we may include a heap of straw and rags in a corner which served for a bed  seated on the stool and bending over the firewas an old woman so wild and shrivelled in her appearance that a much less superstitious urchin than jacky might have believed her to be a witch  her clothing may be described as a bundle of rags with the exception of a shepherdsplaid on her shoulders the spotless purity of which contrasted strangely with the dirtiness of every thing else around  the old creature was moaning and moping over the fire and drawing the plaid close round her as if she were cold although the weather was extremely warm  at first she took no notice whatever of the entrance of her visitors but kept muttering to herself in the gaelic tongue  a fine evening my good woman said fred laying his hand gently on her shoulder  how do ye know im good she cried turning her gleaming eyes sharply on her questioner  dont be angry granny put in mr sudberry in a conciliatory tone  the effect of this remark on the old woman was the reverse of what had been expected  granny granny she shrieked fiercely holding up her skinny right arm and shaking her fist at mr sudberry who dares to ca me granny  my dear woman i meant no offence said the latter much distressed at having unwittingly roused the anger of this strange creature who continued to glare furiously at the trio  jacky kept well in the background and contented himself with peeping round the doorpost  no offence no offence an you dare to ca me granny  go go go  as she uttered these three words with increasing vehemence the last syllable was delivered in a piercing scream  rising suddenly from her stool she pointed to the door with an air of command that would have well become the queen of the witches  not wishing to agitate the poor woman whom he now regarded as a lunatic mr sudberry turned to go but a wonderful change in the expression of her face arrested him  her eye had fallen on the round visage of jacky and a beaming smile now lighted up and beautified the countenance which had so recently been distorted with passion  uttering some unintelligible phrase in gaelic she held out her skinny arms towards the child as if entreating him to come to her  strange to say jacky did not run away or scream with fright as she approached him and took him in her arms  whether it was that he was too much petrified with horror to offer any resistance or that he understood the smile of affection and reciprocated it we cannot tell but certain it is that jacky suffered her to place him on her knee stroke his hair and press him to her old breast as unresistingly and silently as if she had been his own mother instead of a mad old woman  fred availed himself of this improved state of things to attempt again to open an amicable conversation but the old woman appeared to have turned stone deaf for she would neither look at nor reply to him  her whole attention was devoted to jacky into whose wondering ears she poured a stream of gaelic without either waiting for or apparently expecting a reply  suddenly without a word of warning she pushed jacky away from her and began to wring her hands and moan as she bent over the fire  mr sudberry seized the opportunity to decamp  he led jacky quietly out of the hut and made for the white house at as rapid a pace as the darkness of the night would allow  as they walked home father and sons felt as if they had recently held familiar converse with a ghost or an evil spirit  but that feeling passed away when they were all seated at tea in the snug parlour relating and listening to the adventure and jacky swelled to double his size figuratively on finding himself invested with sudden and singular importance as the darling of an old witch  soon however matters of greater interest claimed the attention of mr sudberry and his sons for their bosoms were inflamed with a desire to emulate the dexterous hector macdonald  rods and tackle were overhauled and every preparation made for a serious expedition on the morrow  that night mr sudberry dreamed of fishing    story one chapter 5  some account of a great fishing expedition  there was an old barometer of the banjo type in the parlour of the white house which whatever might have been its character for veracity in former days had now become such an inveterate storyteller that it was pretty safe to accept as true exactly the reverse of what it indicated one evening mr sudberry kept tapping that antique and musicallooking instrument with a view to get it to speak out its mind freely  the worthy mans efforts were not in vain for the instrument whether out of spite or not we cannot say indicated plainly much rain  now it must be known that mr sudberry knew as much about trout and salmonfishing as that celebrated though solitary individual the man in the moon  believing that bright dry sunny weather was favourable to this sport his heart failed him when the barometer became so prophetically depressed and he moved about the parlour with quick uneasy steps to the distress of his good wife whose workbox he twice swept off the table with his coattails and to the dismay of george whose tackle being spread out for examination was to a large extent caught up and hopelessly affixed to the same unruly tails  supper and repose finally quieted mr sudberrys anxious temperament and when he awoke on the following morning the sun was shining in unclouded splendour through his window  awaking with a start he bounced out of bed and opening his window shouted with delight that it was a glorious fishingday  the shout was addressed to the world at large but it was responded to only by hobbs  yes sir it is a hexquisite day said that worthy what a day for the thames sir  it does my art good sir to think of that there river  hobbs who was standing below his masters window with his coat off and his hands in his waistcoatpockets meant this as a happy and delicate allusion to things and times of the past  ah  hobbs said mr sudberry you dont know what fishing in the highlands is yet but you shall see  are the rods ready  yes sir  and the baskets and books  yes sir  and ah  i forgotthe flasks and sandwichesare they ready and the worms  yes sir miss lucys a makin of the sanwiches in the kitchen at this moment and maclisters a diggin of the worms  mr sudberry shut his window and george hearing the noise leaped out of bed with the violence that is peculiar to vigorous youth  fred yawned  what a magnificent day said george rubbing his hands and slapping himself preparatory to ablutions i will shoot  will youaow yawned fred i shall sketch  i mean to begin with the old womans hut  what do you mean to have your nose plucked off and your eyes torn out at the beginning of our holiday  not if i can help it george but i mean to run the riski mean to cultivate that old woman  hallo hi shouted their father from below while he tapped at the window with the end of a fishingrod  look alive there boys else well have breakfast without you  ay ay father  fred was up in a moment  about two hours later father and sons sallied out for a days sport george with a fowlingpiece fred with a sketchbook and mr sudberry with a fishingrod the varnish and brasswork on which being perfectly new glistened in the sun  we part here father said george as they reached a rude bridge that spanned the river about half a mile distant from the white house  i mean to clamber up the sides of the ben and explore the gorges  they say that ptarmigan and mountain hares are to be found there  the youths eye sparkled with enthusiasm for having been born and bred in the heart of london the idea of roaming alone among wild rocky glens up among the hills far from the abodes of men made him fancy himself little short of a second crusoe  he was also elated at the thought of firing at real wild birds and animalshis experiences with the gun having hitherto been confined to the unromantic practice of a shootinggallery in regent street  success to you george cried mr sudberry waving his hand to his son as the latter was about to enter a ravine  the same to you father cried george as he waved his cap in return and disappeared  five minutes walk brought them to the hut of the poor old woman whose name they had learned was moggy  this then is my goal said fred smiling  i hope to scratch in the outline of the interior before you catch your first trout  take care the old woman doesnt scratch out your eyes fred said the father laughing  dinner at fivesharp remember  fred entered the hovel and mr sudberry walking briskly along the road for a quarter of a mile diverged into a footpath which conducted him to the banks of the river and to the margin of a magnificent pool where he hoped to catch his first trout  and now at last had arrived that hour to which mr sudberry had long looked forward with the most ardent anticipation  to stand alone on a lovely summers day rod in hand on the banks of a highland stream had been the ambition of the worthy merchant ever since he was a boy  fate had decreed that this ambition should not be gratified until his head was bald but he did not rejoice the less on this account  his limbs were stout and still active and his enthusiasm was as strong as it was in boyhood  no one knew the powerful spirit of angling which dwelt in mr sudberrys breast  his wife did not his sons did not  he was not fully aware of it himself until opportunity revealed it in the most surprising manner  he had indeed known a little of the anglers feelings in the days of his youth but he had a soul above punts and chairs and floats and such trifles although like all great men he did not despise little things  many a day had he sat on old father thames staring with eager expectation at a gaudy float as if all his earthly hopes were dependent on its motions and many a struggling fish had he whipped out of the muddy waters with a shout of joy  but he thought of those days now with the feelings of an old soldier who returning from the wars to his parents abode beholds the drum and popgun of his childhood  he recalled the pleasures of the punt with patronising kindliness and gazed majestically on crag and glen and bright glancing stream while he pressed his foot upon the purple heath and put up his fishingrod  mr sudberry was in his element now  the deep flush on his gladsome countenance indicated the turmoil of combined romance and delight which raged within his heaving chest and which he with difficulty prevented from breaking forth into an idiotic cheer  he was alone as we have said  he was purposely so  he felt that as yet no member of his family could possibly sympathise with his feelings  it was better that they should not witness emotions which they could not thoroughly understand  moreover he wished to surprise them with the result of his prowessin regard to which his belief was unlimited  he felt besides that it was better there should be no witness to the trifling failures which might be expected to occur in the first essay of one wholly unacquainted with the art of angling as practised in these remote glens  the pool beside which mr sudberry stood was one which hector macdonald had pointed out as being one of the best in the river  it lay at the tail of a rapid had an eddy in it and a rippling oily surface  the banks were in places free from underwood and only a few small trees grew near them  the shadow of the mountain which reared its rugged crest close to it usually darkened the surface but at the time we write of a glowing sun poured its rays into the deepest recesses of the poola fact which filled mr sudberry in his ignorance with delight but which had he known better would have overwhelmed him with dismay in the present instance it happened that ignorance was bliss for as every fish in the pool was watching the angler with grave upturned eyes while he put up his rod and would as soon have attempted to swallow mr sudberrys hat as leap at his artificial flies it was well that he was not aware of the fact otherwise his joy of heart would have been turned into sorrow sooner than there was any occasion for  musing on piscatorial scenes past present and to come mr sudberry passed the line through the rings of his rod with trembling and excited fingers  while thus engaged he observed a break on the surface of the pool and a fish caused a number of rings to form on the water those floated toward him as if to invite him on  mr sudberry was redhot now with hope and expectation  it was an enormous trout that had risen  most trouts that are seen but not caught are enormous  there is no pleasure without its alloy  it could not be expected that the course of true sport any more than that of true love should run smooth  mr sudberrys ruddy face suddenly turned pale when he discovered that he had forgotten his fishing book  each pocket in his coat was slapped and plunged into with vehement haste while drops of cold perspiration stood on his forehead  it was not to be found suddenly he recollected the basket at his back wrenching it open he found the book there and joy again suffused his visage  selecting his best line and hooksas pointed out to him by hectormr sudberry let out a few yards of line and prepared for action remembering the advice and example of his friend he made his first cast  ha not so bad  the line fell rather closer to the bank on which he stood than was consistent with the vigour of the cast but never mind the next would be better  the next was better  the line went out to its full extent and came down on the water with such a splash that no trout in its senses would have looked at the place for an hour afterwards  but mr sudberry was ignorant of this so he went on hopefully  as yet the line was short so he let out half a dozen yards boldly and allowed the stream to draw it straight  then making a violent effort he succeeded in causing it to descend in a series of circles close to his feet  this besides being unexpected was embarrassing  determined to succeed he made another cast and caught the top branch of a small tree the existence of which he had forgotten  there the hooks remained fixed  a deep sigh broke from the excited man as he gazed ruefully up at the tree  under a sudden and violent impulse he tried to pull the tackle forcibly away  this would not do  he tried again till the rod bent almost double and he was filled with amazement to find that the castingline though no thicker than a thread could stand such a pull still the hooks held on  laying down his rod he wiped his forehead and sighed again  but mr sudberry was not a man to be easily thwarted  recalling the days of his boyhood he cast off his coat and nimbly shinned up the trunk of the tree  in a few minutes he reached the top branch and seized it  at that moment the bough on which he stood gave way and he fell to the ground with a terrible crash bringing the top branch with him  gathering himself up he carefully manipulated his neck to ascertain whether or not it was broken  he found that it was not but the line was so he sat down quietly on the bank and replaced it with a new one  before mr sudberry left that spot on the bank beside the dark pool he had caught the tree four times and his hat twice but he had caught no trout  theyre not taking today thats it he muttered sadly to himself but come cheer up old fellow and try a new fly  thus encouraged by himself mr sudberry selected a large blue fly with a black head red wings and a long yellow tail  it was a gorgeous and he thought a tempting creature but the trout were evidently not of the same opinion  for several hours the unfortunate piscator flogged the water in vain  he became very hot during this prolonged exertion stumbled into several holes and wetted both legs up to the knees had his cap brushed off more than once by overhanging branches and entangled his line grievously while in the act of picking it up bruised his shins several times and in short got so much knocked about battered and worried that he began to feel in a state of mental and physical dishevelment  still his countenance did not betray much of his feelings  he found fishing more difficult in all respects than he had expected but what then  was he going to give way to disgust at the first disappointment certainly not  was he going to fail in perseverance now after having established a reputation for that quality during a long commercial life in the capital of england  decidedly not  was that energy that vigour that fervour of character for which he was noted to fail him herehere in an uncivilised country where it was so much required after having been the means of raising him from a humble station to one of affluence after having enabled him to crush through all difficulties small or great as well as having caused him to sweep hecatombs of crockery to destruction with his coat tails  indubitably not  glowing with such thoughts the dauntless man tightened his cap on his brow pressed his lips together with a firm smile frowned goodhumouredly at fate and the water and continued his unflagging though not unflogging way  so the hot sun beat down upon him until evening drew on apace and then the midges came out  the torments which mr sudberry endured after this were positively awful and the struggles that he made in the bravery of his cheerful heart to bear up against them were worthy of a hero of romance  his sufferings were all the more terrible and exasperating that at first they came in the shape of an effect without a cause  the skin of his face and hands began to inflame and to itch beyond enduranceto his great surprise for the midges were so exceedingly small and light that being deeply intent on his line he did not observe them  he had heard of midges no doubt but never having seen them and being altogether engrossed in his occupation he never thought of them for a moment  he only became aware of everincreasing uneasiness and exhibited a tendency to rub the backs of his hands violently on his trousers and to polish his countenance with his cuffs  it must be the effect of exposure to the sun he thoughtyes that was it of course that would go off soon and he would become casehardened a regular mountaineer  ha was that a trout  yes that must have been one at last to be sure there were several stones and eddies near the spot where it rose but he knew the difference between the curl of an eddy now and the splash of a trout he would throw over the exact spot which was just a foot or two above a mosscovered stone that peeped out of the water he did so and caught itthe stone not the troutand the hooks remained fixed in the slimy green moss  mr sudberry scratched his head and felt inclined to stamp  he even experienced a wild desire to cast his rod violently into the river and walk home with his hands in his pockets but he restrained himself pulling on the line somewhat recklessly the hook came away to his immense delight trailing a long thread of the green moss along with it  mr sudberry now took to holding a muttered conversation with himselfa practice which was by no means new to him and in the course of which he was wont to address himself in curiously disrespectful terms  come come john my boy dont be cast down  never say die  hope ay hope told a flatterhallo was that a rise  no it must have been another of thesewhat can be the matter with your skin today john  i dont believe its the sun after all  the sun never drove anyone frantic never mind cheer up old cock  that seems a very likely holea beautifulbeautisteady  that was a good castthe best youve made today my buck try it againha ssus caught again as im a dutchman  this is too bad  really you knowwell youve come off easier than might have been expected  now then softly  what can be the matter with your facesurelyit cannot be mr sudberrys heart palpitated as he thought the measles  oh impossible pooh pooh you had the measles when you were a baby of coursedye know john youre not quite sure of that  fevers too occasionally come on with extremedear me how hot it is and what a time you have been fishing you stupid fellow without a rise  it must be getting late  mr sudberry stopped with a startled look as he said this  he glanced at the sun pulled out his watch gazed at it with unutterable surprise put it to his ear and groaned  too late halfpast five dinner at fivepunctually  oh  mary mary wont i catch it tonight  a cloud passed over the sun as he spoke  being very susceptible to outward influences the gloom of the shadow descended on his spirits as well as his person and for the first time that day a look of deep dejection overspread his countenance  suddenly there was a violent twitch at the end of the rod the reel spun round with a sharp whirrr and every nerve in mr sudberrys system received an electric shock as he bent forward straddled his legs and made a desperate effort to fling the trout over his head  the slender rod would not however permit of such treatment  it bent double and the excited piscator was fain to wind upan operation which he performed so hastily that the line became entangled with the winch of the reel which brought it to a deadlock  with a gasp of anxiety he flung down the rod and seizing the line with his hands hauled out a beautiful yellow trout of about a quarter of a pound in weight and five or six inches long  to describe the joy of mr sudberry at this piece of good fortune were next to impossible  sitting down on his fishingbasket with the trout full in view he drew forth a small flask of sherry a slice of bread and a lump of cheese and proceeded then and there to regale himself he cared nothing now for the loss of his dinner no thought gave he to the anticipated scold from neglected mrs sudberry  he gave full scope to his joy at the catching of this his first trout  he looked up at the cloud that obscured the sun and forgave it little thinking innocent man that the said cloud had done him a good turn that day  he smiled benignantly on water earth and sky  he rubbed his face and when he did so he thought of the measles and laughedlaughed heartily for by that time he had discovered the true cause of his misery and although we cannot venture to say that he forgave the midges sure we are that he was greatly mollified towards them  does any ignorant or cynical reader deem such an extravagance of delight inconsistent with so trifling an occasion  let him ponder before he ventures to exclaim ridiculous  let him look round upon this busy whirling incomprehensible world and note how its laughing and weeping multitudes are ofttimes tickled to uproarious merriment or whelmed in gloomy woe by the veriest trifles and then let him try to look with sympathy on mr sudberry and his first trout  having carefully deposited the fish in his basket he once more resumed his rod and his expectations  but if the petty annoyances that beset our friend in the fore part of that day may be styled harassing those with which he was overwhelmed towards evening may be called exasperating  first of all he broke the top of his rod a misfortune which broke his heart entirely  but recollecting suddenly that he had three spare toppieces in the butt his heart was cemented and bound up so to speak in a rough and ready manner  next he stepped into a hole which turned out to be three feet deep so that he was instantly soaked up to the waist  being extremely hot besides having grown quite reckless mr sudberry did not mind this it was pleasantly cooling  he was cheered too at the moment by the reappearance of the sun which shone out as bright as ever warming his heart poor ignorant man and all unknown to him damaging his chance of catching any more fish at that time  soon after this he came to a part of the river where it flowed through extremely rugged rocks and plunged over one or two precipices sending up clouds of grey mist and a dull roar which overawed him and depressed his spirits  this latter effect was still further increased by the bruising of his shins and elbows which resulted from the rough nature of the ground  he became quite expert now in hanking on bushes and disentangling the line and experienced a growing belief in the truth of the old saying that practice makes perfect  he cast better he hanked oftener and he disentangled more easily than he had done at an earlier period of the day  the midges too increased as evening advanced  presently he came upon a picturesque portion of the stream where the waters warbled and curled in little easygoing rapids miniature falls and deep oily pools  being an angler by nature though not by practice as yet he felt that there must be something there  a row of natural steppingstones ran out towards a splendid pool in which he felt assured there must be a large troutperhaps a grilse  his modesty forbade him to hint a salmon even to himself  it is a very difficult thing as everyone knows to step from one stone to another in a river especially when the water flowing between runs swift and deep  mr sudberry found it so  in his effort to approach the pool in question which lay under the opposite bank he exhibited not a few of the postures of the ropedancer and the acrobat but he succeeded for mr sudberry was a man of indomitable pluck  standing on a small stone carefully balanced and with his feet close together he made a beautiful cast  it was gracefully done it was vigorously manfully doneconsidering the difficulty of the position and the voracity of the midgesand would have been undoubtedly successful but for the branch of a tree which grew on the opposite bank and overhung the stream  this branch mr sudberry in his eagerness did not observe  in casting he thrust the end of his rod violently into it the line twirled in dire confusion round the leaves and small boughs and the drag hook as if to taunt him hung down within a foot of his nose  mr sudberry in despair made a desperate grasp at this and caught it more than thatit caught him and sunk into his forefinger over the barb so that he could not get it out  the rock on which he stood was too narrow to admit of much movement much less to permit of his resting the butt of his rod on it even if that had been practicablewhich it was not owing to the line being fast to the bough and the reel in a state of deadlock from some indescribable manoeuvre to which it had previously been subjected  there he stood the very personification of despair but while standing there he revolved in his mind the best method of releasing his line without breaking it or further damaging his rod  alas fortune in this instance did not favour the brave  while he was looking up in rueful contemplation of the havoc above and then down at his pierced and captured finger his foot slipped and he fell with a heavy plunge into deep water  that settled the question  the whole of his tackle remained attached to the fatal bough excepting the hook in his finger with which and the remains of his fishingrod he floundered to the shore  mr sudberrys first act on gaining the land was to look into his basket where to his great relief the trout was still reposing  his next was to pick up his hat which was sailing in an eddy fifty yards down the stream  then he squeezed the water out of his garments took down his rod with a heavy sigh strangely mingled with a triumphant smile and turned his steps home just as the sun began to dip behind the peaks of the distant hills  to his surprise and relief mrs sudberry did not scold when about an hour later he entered the hall or porch of the white house with the deprecatory air of a dog that knows he has been misbehaving and with the general aspect of a drowned rat  his wife had been terribly anxious about his nonarrival and the joy she felt on seeing him safe and well induced her to forget the scold  oh  john dear quick get off your clothes was her first exclamation  as for jacky he uttered a cheer of delight and amazement at beholding his father in such a woeful plight and he spent the remainder of the evening in a state of impish triumph for had not his own father come home in the same wet and draggled condition as that in which he himself had presented himself to mrs brown earlier in the day and for which he had received a sound whipping  hooray and with that the amiable child went off to inform his worthy nurse that papa was as bad a boy as himselfbadder in fact for he jacky had only been in the water up to the waist while papa had gone into it head and heels    story one chapter 6  the picnic  a vision of beauty now breaks upon the scene  this vision is tall graceful and commanding in figure  it has long black ringlets piercing black eyes a fair delicate skin and a bewitching smile that displays a row ofof pearls  the vision is about sixteen years of age and answers to the romantic name of flora macdonald  it is sister to that stalwart hector who first showed mr sudberry how to fish and stately sedate and beautiful does it appear as leaning on its brothers arm it ascends the hill towards the white house where extensive preparations are being made for a picnic  goodmorning mr sudberry cries hector doffing his bonnet and bowing low to lucy  allow me to introduce my sister flora but glancing at the preparations i fear that my visit is inopportune  mr sudberry rushes forward and shakes hector and sister heartily by the hand  my dear sir my dear madam inopportune impossible  i am charmed  we are just going on a picnic that is all and you will go with us  lucy my dear allow me to introduce you to miss macdonald  flora my good sir pray do not let us stand upon ceremony interposes hector  lucy bows with a slight air of bashful reserve flora advances and boldly offers her hand  the blue eyes and the black meet the former twinkle the latter beam and the knot is tied they are fast friends for life  glorious day cries mr sudberry rubbing his hands  magnificent assents hector  you are fortunate in the weather for to say truth we have little enough of sunshine here  sometimes it rains for three or four weeks almost without cessation  does it indeed  mr sudberrys visage elongates a little for one moment  just then george and fred come out of the white house laden with hampers and fishingbaskets full of provisions  they start gaze in surprise at the vision and drop the provisions  these are my boys miss macdonaldhectors sister lads cries mr sudberry  youll join us i trust  to hector  hector assents with pleasure  he is a most amiable and accommodating man  meanwhile george and fred shake hands with flora and express their delight their pleasure etcetera at this unexpected meeting which etcetera etcetera  their eyes meet too as lucys and floras had met a minute before  whether the concussion of that meeting is too severe we cannot say but the result is that the three pair of eyes drop to the ground and their owners blush  george even goes the length of stammering something incoherent about highland scenery when a diversion is created in his favour by jacky who comes suddenly round the corner of the house with a northamericanindian howl and with the nine dogs tearing after him clamorously  jacky tumbles over a basket of course a state of disaster is his normal condition bruises his shins and yells fearfully to the dismay of his mother who runs shrieking to the window in her dressinggown meets the gaze of hector and flora macdonald and retires precipitately in discomfiture  no such sensibility affects the stern bosom of mrs brown who darts out at the front door catches the unhappy boy by one arm and drags him into the house by it as if it were a rope the child a homewardbound vessel and she a tugsteamer of nine hundred horsepower  the sounds that proceed from the nursery thereafter are strikingly suggestive they might be taken for loud clapping of hands but the shrieks which follow forbid the idea of plaudits  poor tilly who is confused by the uproar follows the nurse timidly bent upon intercession for she loves jacky dearly  the nine dogseasygoing jovial creaturesat once jump to the conclusion that the ham and cold chicken have been prepared and laid out there on the green hillside for their special entertainment  they make a prompt dash at the hampers  gentlemen and ladies alike rush to the rescue and the dogs are obliged to retire  they do so with a surprised and injured look in their innocent eyes  have you one or two raw onions and a few cold boiled potatoes inquires hector  ill run and see cries george who soon returns with the desired edibles in a tin can  that will do  now i shall let you taste a potato salad meanwhile i will assist in carrying the baskets down to the boat  hectors and lucys eyes meet as this is said  there must be some unaccountable influence in the atmosphere this morning for the meeting of eyes all round seems to produce unusual results  will mr mcallister accompany us says mr sudberry  mr mcallister permits a quiet smile to disturb the gravity of his countenance and agrees to do so at the same time making vague reference to the groves of arcadia and the delight of dining alfresco specially in wet weatherobservations which surprise mr sudberry and cause hector and the two brothers to laugh  mrs sudberry is ready at last  the gentlemen and hobbs load themselves and followed by jacky and the ladies proceed to the margin of the loch which sheet of water mr sudberry styles a lock while his better half deliberately and obstinately calls it a lake  the party is a large one for so small a boat but it holds them all easily besides the day is calm and the water lies like a sheet of pure glass it seems almost a pity to break such a faithful mirror with the plashing oars as they row away  thus pleasantly the picnic began  george and fred rowed hector steered and the ladies sangmr sudberry assisting with a bass  his voice being a strong baritone was overwhelmingly loud in the middle notes and sank into a muffled ineffective rumble in the deep tones  having a bad ear for tune he disconcerted the ladiesalso the rowers  but what did that matter  he was overflowing with delight and apologised for his awkwardness by laughing loudly and begging the ladies to begin again  this they always did with immense good humour  mrs sudberry had two engrossing subjects of contemplation  the one was the boat which she was firmly persuaded was on the point of upsetting when any one moved ever so little the other was jacky who owing to some strange impulse natural to his impish character strove to stretch as much of his person beyond the side of the boat as was possible without absolutely throwing himself overboard  the loch was upwards of three miles in length before the party had gone half the distance mr sudberry senior had sung himself quite hoarse and master sudberry junior had leaped threequarters of his length out of the boat six times and in various other ways had terrified his poor mother almost into fits and imperilled the lives of the party more than once  by the way said fred when his father concluded a fine old boatsong with a magnificent flourish worthy of an operatic artiste can any one tell me any thing about the strange old woman that lives down in the hut near the bridge  ha ha laughed george i can tell you that shes an old witch and a very fierce one too  a slight frown gathered on floras white forehead and a flash shot from her dark eyes as george said this but george saw it not  lucy did however and became observant while george continued  but methinks fred that the long visit you paid her lately must have been sadly misapplied if you have not pumped her history out of her  i went to paint not to pump  perhaps mr macdonald can tell me about her  not i said hector lighting a cigar  i only know that she lost her grandson about six years ago and that shes been mad ever since poor thing  for shame hector said flora you know that poor old moggy is no more mad than yourself  possibly not sweet sister but as you often tell me that i am mad and as i never deny the charge it seems to me that you have said nothing to vindicate the old womans character for sanity  poor thing said flora turning from her brother and speaking with warmth to fred if you knew how much that unhappy old creature has suffered you would not be surprised to find her somewhat cross at times  she is one of my people and im very glad to find that you take an interest in her  my people  flora then takes an interest in the poor thought the observant lucy  another link was added to the chain of friendship  do tell us about her please cried george  there is nothing that i love so much as a storyespecially a horrible one with two or three dreadful murders to chill ones blood and a deal of retributive justice to warm it up again  im dying to know about old moggy  are you said flora saucily  im glad to hear that because i mean to keep you in a dying state  i will tell the story as a dead secret to lucy when i take her to see my poor people and you shant hear it for weeks to come  george cast up his eyes in affected despair and said with a groan that he would endeavour to exist notwithstanding  oh  i know all about old moggy cried jacky with energy  everyone looked at the boy in surprise  in the midst of the foregoing dialogue he had suddenly ceased to tempt his fate and sat down quietly with a hand on each knee and his eyes fixed intently on flora macdonaldto the surprise and secret joy of his mother who being thus relieved from anxiety on his account had leisure to transfer the agony of her attention to the boat  what do you know about her child asked flora  shes jolly replied the boy with prompt vivacity  most genuine testimony in her favour laughed hector though the word is scarcely appropriate to one whose temper is sour  why do you think her jolly my boy said flora  cause i do  shes a old brick  jacky darling said mrs sudberry do try to give up those ugly slang wordstheyre so naughtythat is to sayat leastthey are very ugly if theyre not positively naughty  shes a jolly old brick retorted jacky with a look at his mother that was the concentrated essence of defiance  dear child  lucy snickered and coughed somewhat violently into her handkerchief while flora repressing a smile said  but why does jacky like old moggy so much  hallo dont run us ashore shouted mr sudberry starting up with a sudden impetuosity which shook the boat and sent a pang to the heart of his wife the sharpness of which no words can convey  a piercing shriek however betrayed the state of her feelings as the boat was swept violently round by george to avoid a point of rock  as they were now drawing near to the spot where it was proposed that they should picnic jacky suddenly became alive to the fact that in his interest about old moggy he had been betrayed into a forgetfulness of his opportunities  no time was to be lost  turning round with a cheer he made a desperate plunge at the water and went much farther over than he had intended insomuch that he would certainly have taken a header into its depths had not mcallister grasped him by the baggy region of his trousers and gravely lifted him into his mothers lap  next moment the boats keel grated sharply on the gravel to the horror of mrs sudberry who having buried her face in the bosom of her saved son saw not what had occurred and regarded the shock as her deathwarrant  thus agreeably the picnic continued    story one chapter 7  the picnic concluded  what a glorious day it was and what spirits it put everybody in  the sun shone with an intensity almost torrid the spot on which they had landed was green and bright like a slice out of the realms of fairyland  no zephyr dared to disturb the leaves or the glassy water great clouds hung in the bright blue skyrotund fat and heavy like mountains of wool or butter  everything in nature seemed to have gone to sleep at noon as if spanish principles had suddenly imbued the universe  and what a business they had to be sure with the spreading of the viands and the kindling of the fire  the latter was the first duty hector said he would undertake it but after attempting to light it with damp sticks he gave it up and assisted the ladies to lay the cloth on the grass  then george and fred got the fire to kindle and mr sudberry in attempting to mend it burnt his fingers and put it out whereupon mcallister came to his rescue and got it to blaze in right earnest  jacky thereafter tried to jump over it fell into it and was saved from premature destruction by being plucked out and quenched before having received any further damage than the singeing of his hair and eyelashes  he was thus rendered a little more hideous and impishlike than nature had intended him to be  jacky happened to be particularly bad that day  not only was he more bent on mischief than usual but fortune seemed to enhance the value so to speak of his evil doings by connecting them with disasters of an unexpected nature  he tried to leap over a small stream in scotland styled a burn and fell into it  this necessitated drying at the firea slow process and disagreeable in all circumstances but especially so when connected with impatience and headstrong obstinacy then he put his foot on a plate of sandwiches and was within an ace of sitting down on a jam tart much to his own consternation poor boy for had he destroyed that the chief source of his own prospective felicity would have been dried up  it is not to be supposed that everyone regarded jackys eccentricities with the forgiving and loving spirit of his mother  mr sudberry good man did not mind much he was out for a days enjoyment and having armed himself capapie with benevolence was invulnerable  not so the other members of the party all of whom had to exercise a good deal of forbearance towards the boy  mcallister took him on his knee and gravely began to entertain him with a story for which kindness jacky kicked his shins and struggled to get away so the worthy man smiled sadly and let him go remarking that ovid himself would be puzzled to metamorphose him into a good boythis in an undertone of course  hector macdonald was somewhat sanguine and irascible in temper  he felt a tingling in his fingers and an irresistible desire to apply them to the ears of the little boy  come here jacky said he  flora who understood his feelings smiled covertly while she busied herself with cups plates and pannikins  lucy who did not understand his feelings thought he must be a goodnatured fellow to speak so kindly to a child who had annoyed him very much  lucy did not admit that she herself had been much annoyed by her little brothers pertinacity in interrupting conversation between her and hector although she might have done so with perfect truth  jacky advanced with hesitation  hector bent down playfully and seized him by both arms turning his back upon the party and thus bringing his own bulky figure between them and young hopeful  jack i want you to be good  i wont promptly said and with much firmness  oh yes you will  a stern masculine countenance within an inch of his nose and a vigorous little shake somewhat disconcerted jacky who exhibited a tendency to roar but hector closed his strong hands on the little arms so suddenly and so powerfully that being unexpectedly agonised jacky was for a moment paralysed  the awful glare of a pair of bright blue eyes and the glistening of a double row of white teeth did not tend to reassure him  oh yes you will my little man repeated hector tumbling him over on his back with a smile of ineffable sweetness but with a little touch of violence that seemed inconsistent therewith  jacky rose gasped and ran away glancing over his shoulder with a look of alarm  this little piece of byplay was not observed by any one but flora who exchanged a bright glance and a smile with her brother  the imp was quelledhe had met his match  during the remainder of the picnic he disturbed no one but kept at the farthest possible distance from hector that was consistent with being one of the party  but it is not to be supposed that his nature was changed  nojackys wickedness only sought a new channel in which to flow  he consoled himself with thoughts of the dire mischief he would perpetrate when the dinner was over  meanwhile he sat down and gloated over the jam tart devouring it in imagination  is that water boiling yet cried mr sudberry  just about it  hand me the eggs fred  here they are cried flora going towards the fire with a basket  she looked very sweet at that moment for the active operations in which she had been engaged had flushed her cheeks and brightened her eyes  george and fred gazed at her in undisguised admiration  becoming suddenly aware of the impoliteness of the act the former ran to relieve her of the basket of eggs the latter blushed and all but upset the kettle in an effort to improve the condition of the fire  fred you goose leave alone will you roared george darting forward to prevent the catastrophe  this is really charming is it not mr macgregor said mrs sudberry with a languid smile  macdonald madam if i may be allowed to correct you said hector with a smile and a little bow  ah to be sure  with an attempt at a laugh i have such a stupid habit of misnaming people  if mrs sudberry had told the exact truth she would have said i have such difficulty in remembering peoples names that i have made up my mind to call people by any name that comes first into my head rather than confess my forgetfulness  but she did not say this she only went on to observe that she had no idea it would have been so charming  to what do you refer said hectorthe scenery the weather or the prospect of dinner  oh you shocking man how can you talk of food in the same breath with  the salt exclaimed lucy with a little shriek  was there ever a picnic at which the salt was not forgotten or supposed to have been forgotten  never  mr sudberrys cheerful countenance fell  he had never eaten an egg without salt in his life and did not believe in the possibility of doing so  everyone ransacked everything in anxious haste  here it is  hope revived  no its only the pepper  mitigated despair and ransacking continued  maybe itll be in this parcel suggested mcallister holding up one which had not yet been untied  oh bring it to me mr macannister cried mrs sudberry with unwonted energy for her happiness was dependent on salt that day coupled of course with weather and scenery  faugh no its your horrid onions mr macandrews  why you have forgotten the potato salad mr macdonald exclaimed lucy  no i have not it can be made in five minutes but not without salt where can the salt be  i am certain it could not have been forgotten  the only individual of the party who remained calmly indifferent was master jacky  that charming creature having made up his mind to feed on jam tart did not feel that there was any need for salt  an attentive observer might have noticed however that jackys look of supreme indifference suddenly gave place to one of inexpressible glee he became actually red in the face with hugging himself and endeavouring to suppress all visible signs of emotion  his eye had unexpectedly fallen on the paper of salt which lay on the centre of the tablecloth so completely exposed to view that nobody saw it  why here it is actually before our eyes shouted george seizing the paper and holding it up  a small cheer greeted its discovery  a groan instantly followed as george spilt the whole of it  as it fell on the cloth however it was soon gathered up and then mr sudberry ordered everyone to sit down on the grass in a circle round the cloth  what a good boy jacky has suddenly become remarked lucy in some surprise  darling ejaculated his mother  a very good little fellow said flora with a peculiar smile  jacky said nothing  hectors eye was upon him as was his upon hector deep unutterable thoughts filled his swelling heart but he spoke not he merely gazed at the jam tart a large portion of which was in a few minutes supplied to him  the immediate result was crimson hands arms and cheeks  while hector was engaged in concocting the potato salad the kettle upset extinguished the fire and sent up a loud triumphant hiss of steam mingled with ashes  fortunately the potatoes were cooked so the dinner was at last begun in comfortthat is to say everyone was very hot very much exhausted and excited and very thirsty  jacky gorged himself with tart in five minutes and then took an opportunity of quietly retiring into the bushes sheltered by which he made a detour unseen towards the place where the boat had been left  alas for the picnic party that day that they allowed hector to prevail on them to begin with his potato salad  it was partly composed of raw onions  after having eaten a few mouthfuls of it their sense of taste was utterly destroyed  the chickens tasted of onions so did the cheese and the bread  even the whiskey was flavoured with onions  the beefsteakpie might as well have been an onionpie indeed no member of the party could with shut eyes have positively said that it was not the potatoes harmonised with the prevailing flavour not so the gingerbread however nor the butter  everything was oniony they finished their repast with a sweet oniontart  to make things worse the sky soon became overcast a stiff breeze began to blow and mr mcallister opined that there was going to be a squall  a piercing shriek put an abrupt termination to the meal  intent on mischief the imp had succeeded in pushing off the boat and clambering into it  for some time he rowed about in a circle with one oar much delighted with his performances  but when the breeze began to increase and blow the boat away he became alarmed and when the oar missed the water and sent him sprawling on his back he gave utterance to the shriek above referred to  luckily the wind carried him past the place where they were picnicking  there was but one mode of getting at the boat  it was at once adopted  hector threw off his coat and vest and swam out to it  ten minutes later they were rowing at full speed for the foot of the loch  the sky was dark and a squall was tearing up the waters of the lake  then the rain came down in torrents  then it was discovered that the cloaks had been left at hazlewood creek as the place where they had dined was named  to turn back was impossible  the gentlemens coats were therefore put on the ladies shoulders  all were soaked to the skin in a quarter of an hour  jacky was quietbeing slightly overawed but not humbled  his mother was too frightened to speak or scream  mr sudberry rubbed his hands and said come i like to have a touch of all sorts of weather and wont we have a jolly tea and a rousing fire when we get home  mrs sudberry sighed at the word home  mcallister volunteered a song and struck up the callums lament a dismally cheerful gaelic ditty  in the midst of this they reached the landingplace from which they walked through drenched heather and blinding rain to the white house  thus drearily the picnic ended    story one chapter 8  concerning fowls and pools  one morning the sudberry family sat on the green hillside in front of the white house engaged in their usual morning amusementfeeding the cocks and hens  it is astonishing what an amount of interest may be got up in this way if one goes at it with a sort of philanthropicophilosophical spirit a full hour of genuine satisfaction may be thus obtainednot to speak of the joy imparted to the poultry and the profound glimpses obtained into fowl character  there were about twenty hens more or less and two cocks  with wonderful sagacity did these creatures come to perceive that when the sudberrys brought out chairs and stools after breakfast and sat down thereon they the fowls were in for a feed  and it was surprising the punctuality with which they assembled each fine morning for this purpose  most of the family simply enjoyed the thing but mr sudberry in addition to enjoying it studied it  he soon came to perceive that the cocks were cowardly wretches and this gave him occasion to point out to his wife the confiding character and general superiority of female nature even in hens  the two large cocks could not be prevailed on to feed out of the hand by any means  under the strong influence of temptation they would strut with bold aspect but timid hesitating step towards the proffered crumb but the slightest motion would scare them away and when they did venture to peck they did so with violent haste and instantly fled in abject terror  it was this tendency in these ignoble birds that exasperated poor jacky whose chief delight was to tempt the unfortunate hens to place unlimited confidence in him and then clutch them by the beaks or heads and hold them wriggling in his cruel grasp and it was this tendency that induced him in the heat of disappointment and without any reference whatever to sex to call the cocks big hens  the hens on the other hand exhibited gentle and trusting natures  of course there was vanity of character among them as there is among ladies but for the most part they were wont to rush towards their human friends in a body and peck the crumbsat first timidly then boldlyfrom their palms  there was one hena black and ragged one with only half a tail and a downtrodden aspectwhich actually went the length of jumping up on little tillys knee and feeding out of her lap it even allowed her to stroke its back but it evidently permitted rather than enjoyed the process  on the morning in question the black hen was bolder than usual perhaps it had not breakfasted that day for it was foremost in the rush when the family appeared with chairs and stools and leaped on tillys knee without invitation as soon as she was seated whereupon tilly called it a dear darling pretty ittle pet and patted its back  why the creature seems quite fond of you my child said mrs sudberry  so it is mamma  it loves me i know by the way it looks at me with its beautiful black eye  what a pity the other is not so nice  i think the poor darling must be blind of that eye  there was no doubt about that  blackies right eye was blinder than any bats it was an opaque white balla circumstance which caused it no little annoyance for the other eye had to do duty for both and this involved constant screwing of the head about and unwearied watchfulness  it was as if a solitary sentinel were placed to guard the front and back doors of a house at one and the same time  despite blackies utmost care jacky got on her blind side more than once and caught her by the remnant of her poor tail  this used to spoil tillys morning amusement and send her sorrowful into the house  but what did that matter to jacky  he sometimes broke out worse than usual and set the whole brood into an agitated flutter which rather damaged the happiness of the family  but what did that matter to jacky  oh he was a darling child according to his mother  for some time the feeding went on quietly enough  the fowls were confiding  mr sudberry was becoming immensely philosophical mrs sudberry was looking on in amiable gratification george had prevailed on a small white hen to allow him to scratch her head fred was taking a rapid portrait of the smallest cock lucy had drawn the largest concourse towards herself by scattering her crumbs on the ground jacky had only caught two chickens by their beaks and one hen by its tail and was partially strangling another and the nine mcallister dogs were ranged in a semicircle round the group looking on benignantly and evidently inclined to put in for a share but restrained by the memory of past rebuffswhen little blackie standing on tillys knee and having eaten a large share of what was going raised itself to its full height flapped its wings and gave utterance to a cackle of triumph  a burst of laughter followedand tilly gave a shriek of delighted surprise that at once dissolved the spell and induced the horrified fowl to seek refuge in precipitate flight  by the way said mrs sudberry that reminds me that this would be a most charming day for your excursion over the mountains to that lake whatyoumaycallit  what connection there was between the little incident just described and the excursion to lake whatyoumaycallit we cannot pretend to state but there must have been some sort of connection in mrs sudberrys brain and we record her observation because it was the origin of this days proceedings  mr sudberry had for some time past talked of a long walking excursion with the whole family to a certain small loch or tarn among the hills  mrs sudberry had made up her mindfirst that she would not go and second that she would get everyone else to go in order to let mrs brown and hobbs have a thorough cleaningup of the house  this day seemed to suit for the excursionhence her propounding of the plan  poor delicate tilly seldom went on long expeditionsshe was often doomed to remain at home  mr sudberry shouted capital huzza clapped his hands and rushed into the house to prepare scattering the fowls like chaff in a whirlwind  fired by his example the rest of the family followed  but we must have our bathe first papa cried lucy  certainly my love there will be time for that  so away flew lucy to the nursery whence she reissued with jacky tilly mrs brown and towels  the bathingpool was what george called a great institution  in using this slang expression george was literally correct for the bathingpool was not a natural feature of the scenery it was artificial and had been instituted a week after the arrival of the family  the loch was a little too far from the house to be a convenient place of resort for ablutionary purposes  close beside the house ran a small burn  its birthplace was one of those dark glens or corries situated high up among those mountains that formed a grand towering background in all freds sketches of the white house  its bed was rugged and brokena deep cutting which the water had made on the hillside  here was quite a forest of dwarftrees and shrubs but so small were they and so deep the torrents bed that you could barely see the treetops as you approached the spot over the bare hills  in dry weather this burn tinkled over a chaos of rocks forming myriads of miniature cascades and hosts of limpid little pools  during heavy rains it ran roaring riotously over its rough bed with a force that swept to destruction whatever chanced to come in its way  in this burn screened from observation by an umbrageous coppice was the bathingpool  no pool in the stream was deep enough in ordinary weather to take jacky above the knees but one pool had been found about two hundred yards from the house which was large enough if it had only been deeper  to deepen it therefore they wentevery member of the family  let us recall the picture  father in shirt sleeves rolled up to the shoulders and trousers rolled up to the knees in the middle of the pool trying to upheave from the bottom a rock larger than himselfif he only knew it  but he doesnt because it is deeply embedded therefore he toils on in hope  george building with turf and stone a strong embankment with a narrow outlet to allow the surplus water to escape  fred lucy tilly and peter cutting turf and carrying stones  mother superintending the whole and making remarks  jacky making himself universally disagreeable and distracting his mother in a miscellaneous sort of way  its as good as robinson crusoe any day cries father panting and wiping his bald forehead  what a stone  i cant budge it  he stoops again to conquer if possible but the great difficulty with father is that the water comes so near to his tuckedup trousers that he cannot put forth his full strength without wetting them and mother insists that this must not be done  come george and fred bring the pickaxe and the iron lever we must have this fellow out hes right in the middle of the pool  now then heave  the lads obey and father straddles so fiercely that one leg slips down  hah there youve done it now from mother  well my dear it cant be helped meekly from father who is secretly glad and prepares to root out the stone like a hercules jacky gets excited and hopes the other leg will slip down and get wet too  here hand me the lever george you dont put enough force to it george obeys and grins  now then once more with willho hi hup father strains at the lever which not having been properly fixed slips and he finds himself suddenly in a sitting posture with the water round his waist  as the cool element embraces his loins he hahah gasps as every bather knows how but the shock to his system is nothing compared with the aggravation to his feelings when he hears the joyful yell of triumph that issues from the brazen lungs of his youngest hope  never mind ill work all the better nowcome let us be jolly and clear out the rest of the pool  good man nothing can put him out gradually the bottom is cleared of stones excepting the big one and levelled and the embankment is built to a sufficient height  now for the finishing touch cries george bring the turf fredim ready  the water of the burn is rushing violently through the narrow outlet in the dike  a heavy stone is dropped into the gap and turf is piled on  more turf more stones quick look aliveitll burst everything there thats it  all hands toil and work at the opening to smother it up  the angry element leaks through bursts gushesis choked back with a ready turf and squirts up in their faces  mother is stunned to see the power of so small a stream when the attempt is made to check it thoroughly she is not mechanicallyminded by nature and has learned nothing in that way by education  it is stopped at last however  for a quarter of an hour the waters from above are cut off from those below as completely as were those of the jordan in days of old  they all stand panting and silent watching the rising of the water while george keeps a sharp eye on the dike to detect and repair any weakness at last it is full and the surplus runs over in a pretty cascade while the accommodating stream piles mud and stones against the dike and thus unwittingly strengthens the barrier  the pool is formed full three feet deep by twenty broad  jacky wants to bathe at once  but the pool is like peasoup my petwait until it clears  i wontlet me bathe  o jacky my darling  he does for in his struggles he slips on the bank goes in head foremost and is fished out in a disgusting condition  so the bathingpool was made  it was undoubtedly a great institution they did not know at the time that like many such institutions it was liable to destruction but they lived to see it  meanwhile to return from this long digression lucy tilly and jacky bathed while mrs brown watched and scolded  this duty performed they returned to the house where they found the remainder of the party ready for a journey on foot to lake whatyoumaycallit which lake lucy named the lake of the clouds its gaelic cognomen being quite unpronounceable    story one chapter 9  a grand excursion over the mountains  little did good mr sudberry think what an excursion lay before him that day when in the pride of untried strength and unconquerable spirits he strode up the mountainside with his dutiful family following like a tail behind him  there was a kind of narrow sheeppath up which they marched in single file  father first lucy next with her gown prettily tuckedup george and fred following with large fishingbaskets stuffed with edibles jacky next light and active but as yet quiescent timorous peter bringing up the rear  he also was laden but not heavily  mr sudberry carried rod and basket for he had been told that there were large trout in the lake of the clouds  ever and anon the party halted and turned round to wave hats and kerchiefs to mrs sudberry tilly and mrs brown who returned the salute with interest until the white house appeared a mere speck in the valley below and mrs brown became so small that jacky for the first time in his life regarded her as a contemptible little thing  at last a shoulder of the hill shut out the view of the valley and they began to feel that they were in a deep solitude surrounded by wild mountain peaks  it is a fact that there is something peculiarly invigorating in mountain air  what that something is we are not prepared to say oxygen and ozone have undoubtedly something to do with it but in what proportions we know not  scientific men could give us a learned disquisition on the subject no doubt we therefore refer our readers to scientific men and confine our observations to the simple statement of the fact that there is something extremely invigorating in mountain air  every mountaineer knows it mr sudberry and family proved it that day beyond dispute excepting by the way poor peter whose unfortunate body was not adapted for rude contact with the rough elements of this world  the whole party panted and became very warm as they toiled upwards but instead of growing fatigued they seemed to gather fresh strength and additional spirit at every stepalways excepting peter of course soon a wild spirit came over them  on gaining a level patch of springy turf father gave a cheer and rushed madly he knew not and cared not whither  sons and daughters echoed the cheer and followed his example the sun burst forth at the moment crisping the peaks gorges and cloudswhich were all mingled togetherwith golden fires  each had started off without definite intention and they were scattered far and wide in five minutes but each formed the natural resolve to run to the nearest summit in order to devour more easily the view  thus they all converged again and met on a neighbouring knoll that overtopped a terrific precipice which over hung a small lake  thelakeof theclouds exclaimed lucy as she came up breathless and beaming  impossible cried her father mcallister says it is on the other side of the ridge and were not near the top yet  where are peter and jacky  i cannot see them said george and fred in a breath  no more can i cried lucy  no more could anybody except a hunter or an eagle for they were seated quietly among grey rocks and brown ferns which blended with their costume so as to render them all but invisible  the party on the knoll were however the reverse of invisible to jacky and his exhausted companion  they stood out black as ink against the bright blue sky and were so sharply defined that jacky declared he could see the turnup of lucys nose  the reader must not suppose that master jacky was exhausted like his slender companion  a glance at his firm lip flushed cheek sturdy little limbs and bright eyes would have made that abundantly plain no jacky was in a peculiar frame of mindthat was all  he chose to sit beside peter and as he never condescended to give a reason for his choice we cannot state one  he appeared to be meditatively inclined that day  perhaps he was engaged in the concoction of some excruciating piece of wickednesswho knows  suddenly jacky turned with a look of earnest gravity towards his companion who was a woebegone spectacle of exhaustion  i say wed better go on dont you think  peter looked up languidly sighed heavily and laid his hand on the fishingbasket full of sandwiches which constituted his burden  it was small and light but to the poor boy it felt like a ton  jackys eyes became still more owlishly wide and his face graver than ever  he had never seen him in this condition beforeindeed jackys experience of life beyond the nursery being limited he had never seen any one in such a case before  i say peter are you desprit blowd  desprit sighed peter  jacky paused and gazed at his companion for nearly a minute  i say dye think you could walk if you tried  oh yes  with a groan and a smile come ill try to push ahead now  here give me the basket cried jacky starting up with sudden and tremendous energy and wrenching the basket out of peters hand  he did it with ease although the small clerk was twice the size of the imp  peter remonstrated but in vain  mrs brown a woman of powerful frame and strong mind could not turn jacky from his purposeit was not likely therefore that an amiable milkandwater boy in a state of exhaustion could do it  jacky swung the basket over his shoulder with an amount of exertion that made him stagger and commanding peter to follow marched up the hill with compressed lips and knitted brows  it was an epoch in the mental development of jackyit was a new sensation to the child  hitherto he had known nothing but the feeling of dependence  up to this point he had been compelled by the force of circumstances to look up to everyoneand alas he had done so with a very bad grace  he had never known what it was to help any one  his mother had thoroughly spoiled him  strange infatuation in the mother she had often blamed the boy for spoiling his toys but she had never blamed herself for spoiling the boy  darling jacky dont ask the child to do anything for youhes too young yet  so jacky was never asked to help any one in any way except by mrs brown who did not ask but commanded and although she never rewarded obedience with the laurel either literally or figuratively she invariably punished disobedience with the palm  little tilly always did everything she wanted done herself and could never do enough for jacky so that she afforded no opportunity for her brother to exercise amiable qualities thus was jacky trained to be a selfish little imp and to this training he superadded the natural wickedness of his own little heart  but now for the first time the tables were turned  jacky felt that peter was dependent on himthat he could not get on without him  poor peter ill help himhes a weak skinny chap and im strong as a lionas a elephantas a crokindileanything  come on peter are you getting better now  thus they went up the hill together  ha there they are at last close under this mound  why i do believe that jackys carrying the basket  mr sudberry was bereft of breath at this discovery so was everyone else  when the boy stumped up the hill and flung down the basket with an emphatic there his father turned to the small clerk  how now sir did you bid jacky carry that  please sirno sir whimpering but master jacky forced it out of my hand sir and insisted on carrying it  he saw that i was very tired sirand so i am but i would not have asked him to carry it if i had been ever so tiredindeed i would not sir  im not displeased my boy said mr sudberry kindly patting him on the head i only wanted to know if he offered  of course i did cried the imp stoutly with his arms akimboand why not  dont you see that the poor boy is dead beat and was i goin to stand by and see him faint by hisself all alone on the mountain  certainly not and mr sudberry seized jacky and whirled him round till he was quite giddy and fell on the heather with a cheer and declared that he would not budge from that spot until they had lunched need we say that mr sudberry himself was the subject of a new sensation that daya sensation of a peculiarly hopeful natureas he gazed at his youngest son while that refined little creature crammed himself with sandwiches and gingerbread and besmeared his hands and visage with a pot of jam that had been packed away by his mother for her own darlings special use  my poor lad you must not come any farther with us  i had no idea you were so much fatigued  remain here by the provisions and rest in the sunshine till we return  so mr sudberry gave peter a plaid that had been carried up to serve as a tablecloth and told him to wrap well up in it lest he should catch cold  they left him there on the knoll refreshed and happy and with a new feeling in his breast in regard to jacky whom up to that day he had regarded as an imp of the most hopelessly incorrigible description  over the mountain and over the moor the sudberrys wandered  the ridge was gained and a new world of mountains glens gorges and peaks was discovered on the other side of it with the lake of the clouds lying like a bright diamond far below them  they descended into this new world with a cheer  a laugh or a cheer was their chief method of conversation nowtheir spirits as well as their bodies being so high not a house to be seen not a sign of man the untrodden wilderness cried mr sudberry  robinson crusoe  mungo park  pooh shouted george  hooray yelled jacky  the whole party laughed again and down the slope they went at such a pace that it was a miracle they did not terminate their career in the lake with the poetic name  at this point everyone was suddenly seized  mr sudberry and george were seized with an irresistible desire to fish fred was seized with a burning desire to sketch lucy was seized with a passionate desire to gather wild flowers and jacky was seized with a furious desire to wet himself and wade with his shoes on  he did it too and in the course of an hour tumbled into so many peatbogs and besmeared himself with so much coffeecoloured mud that his own mother would have failed to recognise him  he was supremely happyso was his father  at the very first cast he the father hooked a trout of half a pound weight and lost it too but that was nothing  the next cast he caught one of nearly a pound  george was equally successful  fortune smiled  before evening began to close both baskets were half full of splendid trout lucys basket was quite full of botanical specimens freds sketch was a success and jacky was as brown as a hottentot from head to foot  they prepared to return home rejoicing  haste was needful now  a short cut round the shoulder of the ridge was recommended by george and taken  it conducted them into a totally different gap from the one which led to their own valley  if followed out this route would have led them to a spot ten miles distant from their highland home but they were in blissful ignorance of the fact all gaps and gorges looked much the same to them  suddenly mr sudberry paused  is this the way we came  grave looks but no reply  let us ascend this ridge and make sure that we are right  they did so and made perfectly certain that they were wrong attempting to correct their mistake they wandered more hopelessly out of their way but it was not until the shades of night began to fall that mr sudberry with a cold perspiration on his brow expressed his serious belief that they were lost    story one chapter 10  lost on the mountains  did ever the worthy london merchant in the course of his life approach to the verge of the region of despair it was on that eventful night when he found himself and his family lost among the mountains of scotland  its dreadful said he sitting down on a cold grey rock and beginning slowly to realise the utter hopelessness of their condition  my poor lucy dont be cast down drawing her to his breast after all it will only be a night of wandering  but we must keep moving we must not venture to lie down in our wet clothes  we must not even rest long at a time lest a chill should come upon you  but im quite warm papa and only a very little tired  i could walk for miles yet  she said this cheerily but she could not help looking anxious  the night was so dark however that no one could see her looks  do let me go off alone father urged george i am as fresh as possible and could run over the hills until i should fall in with  dont mention it george i feel that our only hope is to keep together  poor peter what will become of that boy  mr sudberry became almost desperate as he thought of the small clerk he started up  come we must keep moving  you are not cold dear are you sure you are not cold  quite sure papa why are you so anxious  because i have a flask of brandy which i mean to delay using until we break down and cannot get on without it  whenever you begin to get chilled i must give you brandy  not till then however spirits are hurtful when there is hard toil before you but when you break down there is no resource left  rest food sleep would be better but these we have no chance of getting tonight  poor jacky does he keep warm george  no fear of him cried george with forced gaiety  hes all right  jack had broken down completely soon after nightfall  vigorously manfully had he struggled to keep up but when his usual hour for going to bed arrived nature refused to sustain him  he sank to the ground and then george wrapped him up in his shootingcoat in which he now lay sound asleep like a dirty brown bundle on his brothers shoulders  ill tell you what said fred after they had walked or rather stumbled on for some time in silence  suppose you all wait here for ten minutes while i run like a greyhound to the nearest height and see if anything is to be seen  mamma must have alarmed the whole neighbourhood by this time and if they are looking for us they will be sure to have lanterns or torches  a good idea my boy  go and pause every few minutes to shout so that we may not lose you  keep shouting fred and we will wait here and reply  fred was off in a moment and before he had got fifty yards away was floundering kneedeep in a peatbog  so much for reckless haste thought he as he got out of the bog and ran forward with much more caution  soon those waiting below heard his clear voice far up the heights  a few minutes more and it rang forth again more faintly  mr sudberry remarked that it sounded as if it came from the clouds he put his hands to his mouth sailor fashion and replied  then they listened intently for the next shout  how still it was while they sat there what a grand gloomy solitude  they could hear no sound but the beating of their own hearts  solemn thoughts of the creator of these mighty hills crept into their minds as they gazed around and endeavoured to pierce the thick darkness  but this was impossible  it was one of those nights in which the darkness was so profound that no object could be seen even indistinctly at the distance of ten yards  each could see the others form like a black marble statue but no feature could be traced  the mountain peaks and ridges could indeed be seen against the dark sky like somewhat deeper shadows but the crags and corries the scattered rocks and heathery knolls the peatbogs and the tarns of the wild scene which these circling peaks enclosedall were steeped in impenetrable gloom  there seemed something terrible almost unnatural in this union of thick darkness with profound silence  mr sudberry was startled by the sound of his own voice when he again spoke  the boy must have gone too far  i cannot hear  hush  hi in the far distance like a faint echo  they all breathed more freely and mr sudberry uttered a powerful response  presently the shout came nearernearer still and soon fred rejoined them with the disheartening information that he had gained the summit of the ridge and could see nothing whatever  well my children said mr sudberry with an assumption of cheerfulness which he was far from feeling nothing now remains but to push straight forward as fast as we can  we must come to a road of some sort in the longrun which will conduct to somewhere or other no doubt  come cheer up forward  follow close behind me lucy  george do you take the leadyou are the most active and sharpsighted among us and mind the bogs  what if we walk right over a precipice thought fred  he had almost said it but checked himself for fear of alarming the rest unnecessarily  instead of cautioning george he quietly glided to the front and took the lead  slowly wearily and painfully they plodded on stumbling at times over a rugged and stonecovered surface sometimes descending a broken slope that grew more and more precipitous until it became dangerous and then fearing to go farthernot knowing what lay beforethey had to retrace their steps and search for a more gradual descent  now crossing a level patch that raised their hopes inclining them to believe that they had reached the bottom of the valley anon coming suddenly upon a steep ascent that dashed their hopes and induced them to suppose they had turned in the wrong direction and were reascending instead of descending the mountain  all the time jacky slept like a top and george being a sturdy fellow carried him without a murmur  several times fred tried to make him give up his burden but george was inexorably obstinate  so they plodded on till nearly midnight  is that a house said fred stopping short and pointing to a dark object just in front of them  no its a lake  nonsense its a mountain  a few more steps and fred recoiled with a cry of horror  it was a precipice full a hundred feet deepthe dark abyss of which had assumed such varied aspects in their eyes  a long detour followed and they reached the foot in safety  here the land became boggy  each step was an act fraught with danger anxiety and calculation whether they should step kneedeep into a hole full of water or trip over a rounded mass of solid turf was a matter of absolute uncertainty until the step was taken  oh that we had only a gleam of moonshine said lucy with a sigh moonshine  how often had george in the course of his life talked with levity almost amounting to contempt of things being all a matter of moonshine  what would he not have given to have had only a tithe of the things which surrounded him at that time converted into moonshine  a feeble cheer from fred caused an abrupt halt  what is it  hallo  what now  the lake at lastour own loch  i know the shape of it well hurrah  everyone was overjoyed  they all gazed at it long and earnestly and unitedly came to the conclusion that it was the lochprobably at the distance of a mile or so  pushing forward with revived spirits they came upon the object of their hopes much sooner than had been anticipated  in fact it was not more than two hundred yards distant a wild yell of laughter mingled with despair burst from fred as the lake galloped away in the shape of a white horse  the untravelled reader may possibly doubt this  yet it is a fact that a white horse was thus mistaken for a distant lake  the revulsion of feeling was tremendous  everyone sighed and mr sudberry groaned for at that moment the thought of poor peter recurred to his mind  yet there remained a strange feeling of kindliness in the breast of each towards that white horse  it was an undeniable proof of the existence of animal life in those wild regions a fact which the deep solitude of all around had tempted them madly to doubtunknown even to themselves  besides it suggested the idea of an owner to the horse and by a natural and easy process of reasoning they concluded that the owner must be a human being and that when at home he probably dwelt in a house  what more probable than that the house was even then within hail  acting on the idea mr sudberry shouted for two minutes with all his might the only result of which was to render himself extremely hoarse then george tried it and so did fred and jacky awoke and began to whimper and to ask to be let down  he also kicked a little but being very tired soon fell asleep again  you must let me carry him now said fred  i wont  fred tried force but george was too strong for him so they went on as before lucy leaning somewhat heavily on her fathers arm  presently they heard the sound of water  it filled them with mitigated joy and excitement on the simple principle that anything in the shape of variety was better than nothing  a clap of thunder would have raised in their depressed bosoms a gleam of hope  a flash of lightning would have been a positive blessing  mr sudberry at once suggested that it must be a stream and that they could follow its coursewade down its bed if necessarytill they should arrive at something foolish man he had been long enough in the highlands by that time to have known that to walk down the bed of a mountainburn was about as possible as to walk down the shaft of a coalmine  they came to the edge of its banks however and looking over tried to pierce its gloom  there was a pale gleam of white foama rumbling rustling sound beneath and a sensation of moisture in the atmosphere  it rains said mr sudberry  i rather think its the spray of a fall observed george  had mr sudberry known the depth of the tremendous gulf into which he was peering and the steep cliff on the edge of which he stood he would have sprung back in alarm  but he did not knowhe did not entertain the faintest idea of the truth so he boldly though cautiously began to clamber down assisting lucy to descend  man including woman knows not what he can accomplish until he tries millions of glittering gold would not have induced any member of that party to descend such a place in the dark had they known what it was yet they accomplished it in safety  down down they went  dear me when shall we reach the foot  we must be near it now  no they were not near it still down they went becoming more and more alarmed yet always tempted on by the feeling that each step would bring them to the bottom  what a noise the stream makes why it must be a river  no it was not a riverit was a mere burn quite a little burn but what then  little men are always fussier and noisier than big men little boys invariably howl more furiously than big boys  nature is full of analogies and little streams especially mountain streams always make more ado in finding their level than big rivers  they got down at last and then they found the stream rushing bursting crashing among rent and riven rocks and boulders as if it had gone furiously mad and was resolved never more to flow and murmur but always to leap and roar  it was impassable to walk down its banks or bed was impossible so the wanderers had to reascend the bank and roam away over black space in search of another crossing  they soon lost the sound in the intricacies of cliffs and dells and never again found that stream  but they found a narrow path and fred announced the discovery with a cheer  it was an extremely rugged path and appeared to have been macadamised with stones the size of a mans head  this led them to suspect that it must be a ditch not a path but it turned out to be the dry bed of a mountaintorrentdry at least as regards running water though not dry in respect of numerous stagnant pools into which at various times each member of the party stepped unintentionally  it mattered notnothing could make them wetter or more miserable than they wereso they thought  they had yet to learn that the thoughts of men are forever misleading them and that there is nothing more certain than the uncertainty of all human calculations    story one chapter 11  still lost  meanwhile mrs sudberry was thrown into a species of frenzied horror which no words can describe and which was not in any degree allayed by the grave shaking of the head with which mr mcallister accompanied his vain efforts to comfort and reassure her  this excellent man quoted several passages from the works of dugald stewart and locke tending to show in common parlance that necessity has no law and that the rightly constituted human mind ought to rise superior to all circumstancesquotations which had the effect of making mrs sudberry more hysterical than ever and which induced mrs brown to call him who offered such consolation a brute  but mcallister did not confine his efforts solely to the region of mind while he was earnestly administering doses of the wisdom of stewart and locke to the agitated lady in the parlour dan and hugh with several others were by his orders arming themselves in the kitchen for a regular search  shes ready said dan entering the parlour unceremoniously with a huge stable lantern  thats right dankeep away up by the slate corrie and come down by the red tarn  if theyve taken the wrong turn to the right youre sure to fall in wi them thereaway  send hugh round by the burn ill go straight up the hill and come down upon loch cognahoighliey  give a shout now and then as ye goo  dan was a man of action and few words he vouchsafed no reply but turned immediately and left the room leaving a powerful odour of the byre behind him  poor mrs sudberry and tilly were unspeakably comforted by the grave businesslike way in which the search was gone about  they recalled to mind that a search of a somewhat similar nature in point of manner and time was undertaken a week before for a stray sheep and that it had been successful so they felt relieved though they remained of course dreadfully anxious  mcallister refrained from administering any more moral philosophy  as he was not at all anxious about the lost party and was rather fond of a sly joke it remains to this day a matter of doubt whether he really expected that his nostrums would be of much use in a few minutes he was breasting the hill like a true mountaineer with a lantern in his hand and with hobbs by his side  only think maam said mrs brown who was not usually judicious in her remarks only think if theyve been an fell hover a precipice  shocking exclaimed poor mrs sudberry with a little shriek as she clapped her hands on her eyes  poor jacky maam praps es lyin hall in a mangled eap at the foot of a  leave me cried mrs sudberry with an amount of sudden energy that quite amazed mrs brown who left the room feeling that she was an injured woman  darling mamma they will come back said tilly throwing her arms round her mothers neck and bursting into tears on her bosom  you know that the sheepthe lost sheepwas found last week and brought home quite safe  dan is so kind though he does not speak much and hugh too  they will be sure to find them darling mamma  the sweet voice and the hopeful heart of the child did what philosophy had failed to accomplishmrs sudberry was comforted  thus we see not that philosophy is a vain thing but that philosophy and feeling are distinct and that each is utterly powerless in the domain of the other  when peter was left alone by his master as recorded in a former chapter he sat himself down in a cheerful frame of mind on the sunny side of a large rock and gave himself up to the enjoyment of thorough repose as well mental as physical  the poor lad was in that state of extreme lassitude which renders absolute and motionless rest delightful extended at full length on a springy couch of heath with his eyes peeping dreamily through the halfclosed lids at the magnificent prospect of mountains and glens that lay before him and below him too so that he felt like a bird in midair looking down upon the world with his right arm under his meek head and both pillowed on the plaid with his countenance exposed to the full blaze of the sun and with his recent lunch commencing to operate on the system so as to render exhaustion no longer a pain but a pleasure peter lay on that knoll high up the mountainside in close proximity to the clouds dreaming and thinking about nothing that is to say about everything or anything in an imbecile sort of way in other words wandering in his mind disjointedly over the varied regions of memory and imagination too tired to originate an idea too indifferent to resist one when it arose too weak to follow it out and utterly indifferent as to whether his mind did follow it out or cut it short off in the middle  we speak of peters mind as a totally distinct and separate thing from himself  it had taken the bit in its teeth and run away  he cared no more for it than he did for the nose on his face which was at that time as red as a carrot by reason of the sun shining full on its tip but why attempt to describe peters thoughts  here they aresuch as they werefor the reader to make what he can out of them  heigh ho comfortable nowjollywhat a place  how i hate mountains climbing themdreadfullike em to lie on thoughsun i like your jolly

officeno scribblesno stools no desks novemberdear me thats funny  novemberwhats a vember  cut him in two cant join him againnonosnore  at this point peters thoughts went out altogether in sleep leaving the happy youth in peaceful oblivion  he started suddenly after an hours nap under the impression that he was tumbling over a precipice  to give a little scream and clutch wildly at the heather was natural he looked round  the sun was still hot and high  scratching his head as if to recall his faculties peter stared vacantly at the sandwiches which lay beside him on a piece of old newspaper  gradually his hand wandered towards them and a gleam of intelligence accompanied by a smile overspread his countenance as he conveyed one to his lips eating seemed fatiguing however  he soon laid the remnant down drew the plaid over him nestled among the heather and dropped into a heavy sleep with a sigh of ineffable comfort  when peter again woke up the sun was down and just enough of light remained to show that it was going to be an intensely dark night  can anyone describe can anyone imagine the state of peters feelings certainly not  peter besides being youthful was as we have said an extremely timid boy  he was constitutionally afraid of the dark even when surrounded by friends  what then were his sensations when he found himself on the mountain alonelost  the thought was horror peter gasped he leaped up with a wild shout gazed madly round and sank down with a deep groan  up he sprang again and ran forward a few paces  precipices occurred to himhe turned and ran as many paces backward  bogs occurred to himhe came to a full stop fell on his knees and howled  up he leaped again clapped both hands to his mouth and shouted until his eyes threatened to come out and his face became purple master  master  george hi halloo  jacky hooo  the o was prolonged into a wild roar and down he went again quite flat up he jumped once more the darkness was deepening  he rushed to the rightleftall roundtore his hair and gazed into the black depths belowyelled and glared into the dark vault above  poor peter  thus violently did his gentle spirit seek relief during the first few minutes of its overwhelming consternation  but he calmed down in the course of time into a species of mild despair a bursting sob broke from him occasionally as with his face buried in his hands his head deep in the heather and his eyes tight shut he strove in vain to blind himself to the true nature of his dreadful position  at last he became recklessly desperate and rising hastily he fled  he sought poor lad to fly from himself  of course the effort was fruitless  instead of distancing himselfan impossibility at all timesdoubly so in a rugged countryhe tumbled himself over a cliff fortunately not a high one and found himself in a peatbog fortunately not a deep one  this cooled and somewhat improved his understanding so that he returned to the knoll a wiser a wetter and a sadder boy  who shall describe the agonies the hopes the fears the wanderings the faggings and the final despair of the succeeding hours it is impossible to say who will describe all this for we have not the slightest intention of attempting it  towards midnight dan reached a very dark and lonely part of the mountains and was suddenly arrested by a low wail  the sturdy celt raised his lantern on high  just at that moment peters despair happened to culminate and he lifted his head out of the heather to give free vent to the hideous groan with which he meant if possible to terminate his existence  the groan became a shriek first of terror then of hope after that of anxiety as dan came dancing towards him like a jackolantern  fat is she shriekin at said dan  oh  im so gladim sooowhoo  poor peter seized dan round the legs for being on his knees he could not reach higher and embraced him  fats got the maister  peter could not tell  can she waalk  peter couldnt walkhis limbs refused their office  here speel up on her back  peter could do that  he did it and hugged dan round the neck with the tenacity of a shipwrecked mariner clinging to his last plank  the sturdy celt went down the mountain as lightly as if peter were a fly and as if the vicelike grip of his arms round his throat were the embrace of a worsted comforter  here they are maam screamed mrs brown  she was wrong  mrs brown was usually wrong  peter alone was deposited before the eager gaze of mrs sudberry who fainted away with disappointment  mrs brown said be off to peter and applied scentbottles to her mistress  the poor boys grateful heart wanted to embrace somebody so he went slowly and sadly upstairs where he found the cat and embraced it  hours passed away and the sudberry family still wandered lost and almost hopeless among the mountains    story one chapter 12  found  we left mr sudberry and his children in the nearly dry bed of a mountaintorrent indulging the belief that matters were as bad as could be and that therefore there was no possibility of their getting worse  a smart shower of rain speedily induced them to change their minds in this respect  seeking shelter under the projecting ledge of a great cliff the party stood for some time there in silence  you are cold my pet said mr sudberry  just a little papa i could not help shuddering said lucy faintly  now for the brandy said her father drawing forth the flask  suppose i try to kindle a fire said george swinging the bundle containing jacky off his shoulder and placing it in a hollow of the rocks  well suppose you try  george proceeded to do so but on collecting a few broken twigs he found that they were soaking wet and on searching for the matchbox he discovered that it had been left in the provisionbasket so they had to content themselves with a sip of brandy all roundexcepting jacky that amiable child was still sound asleep but in a few minutes he was heard to utter an uneasy squall and then george discovered that he had deposited part of his rotund person in a puddle of water  come let us move on said mr sudberry the rain gets heavier  it is of no use putting off time we cannot be much damper than we are  again the worthy man was mistaken for in the course of another hour they were all so thoroughly drenched that their previous condition might have been considered by contrast one of absolute dryness  suddenly a stone wall topped by a paling barred their further progress  fred who was in advance did not see this wallhe only felt it when it brought him up  heres a gate i believe cried george groping about  it was a gate and it opened upon the road  for the first time for many hours a gleam of hope burst in upon the benighted wanderers  presently a ray of light dazzled them  what do my eyes deceive mea cottage cried mr sudberry  ay and a witch inside said george  why its oldno impossible  yes it is thoughits old moggys cottage  hurrah cried fred  old moggys dog came out with a burst of indignation that threatened annihilation to the whole party but on discovering who they were it crept humbly back into the cottage  does she never go to bed whispered george as they approached and found the old woman moping over her fire and swaying her body to and fro with the thin dirty gown clinging close to her figure and the spotlessly clean plaid drawn tightly round her shoulders  goodevening old woman said mr sudberry advancing with a conciliatory air  its mornin retorted the old woman with a scowl  alas you are right here have we been lost on the hills and wandering all night and glad am i to find your fire burning for my poor daughter is very cold and much exhausted  may we sit down beside you  no reply save a furtive scowl  whats that asked moggy sharply as george deposited his dirty wet bundle on the floor beside the fire opposite to her  the bundle answered for itself by slowly unrolling sitting up and yawning violently at the same time raising both arms above its head and stretching itself  having done this it stared round the room with a vacant look and finally fixed its goggle eyes in mute surprise on moggy  the sight of this wet dirty little creature acted as formerly like a charm on the old woman  her face relaxed into a smile of deep tenderness  she immediately rose and taking the child in her arms carried him to her stool and sat down with him in her lap  jacky made no resistance on the contrary he seemed to have made up his mind to submit at once and with a good grace to the will of this strange old creatureto the amazement as well as amusement of his relations  the old woman took no further notice of her other visitors  she incontinently became stone deaf and apparently blind for she did not deign to bestow so much as a glance on them while they circled close round her fire and heaped on fresh sticks without asking leave  but she made up for this want of courtesy by bestowing the most devoted attentions on jacky  finding that that young gentleman was in a filthy as well as a moist condition she quietly undressed him and going to a rough chest in a corner of the hut drew out a full suit of clothing with which she speedily invested him  the garb was peculiara tartan jacket kilt and hose and these seemed to have been made expressly for him they fitted so well  although quite clean thin threadbare and darned the appearance of the garments showed that they had been muchworn  having thus clothed jacky the old woman embraced him tenderly then held him at armslength and gazed at him for a few minutes  finally she pushed him gently away and burst into tears rocking herself to and fro and moaning dismally  meanwhile jacky still perfectly mute and observant sat down on a log beside the poor old dame and stared at her until the violence of her grief began to subside  the other members of the party stared tooat her and at each otheras if to say what can all this mean  at last jacky began to manifest signs of impatience and pulling her sleeve he said  now ganny lollipops  old moggy smiled rose went to the chest again and returned with a handful of sweetmeats with which jacky at once proceeded to regale himself to the infinite joy of the old woman  mr sudberry now came to the conclusion that there must be a secret understanding between this remarkable couple and he was right  many a time during the last two weeks had master jacky all unknown to his parents made his way to old moggys hutattracted thereto by the splendid lollipops with which the subtle old creature beguiled him and also by the extraordinary amount of affection she lavished upon him besides this the child had a strong dash of romance in his nature and it was a matter of deep interest to him to be a courted guest in such a strange old hovel and to be fondled and clothed as he often was in highland costume by one who scowled upon everyone elseexcepting her little dog with which animal he became an intimate friend  jacky did not trouble himself to inquire into the reason of the old womans partialitysufficient for him that he enjoyed her hospitality and her favour and that he was engaged in what he had a vague idea must needs be a piece of clandestine and very terrible wickedness  his long absences during these visits had indeed been noticed by his mother but as jacky was in the habit of following his own inclinations in every thing and at all times without deigning to give an account of himself it was generally understood that he had just strayed a little farther than usual while playing about  while this was going on in moggys hut george had been despatched to inform mrs sudberry of their safety  the distance being short he soon ran over the ground and burst in upon his mother with a cheer  mrs sudberry sprang into his arms and burst into tears mrs brown lay down on the sofa and went into quiet hysterics and little tilly who had gone to bed hours before in a condition of irresistible drowsiness jumped up with a scream and came skipping downstairs in her nightgown  safe mother safe  and jacky  safe too all of us  oh  im so thankful  no not all of us said george suddenly recollecting peter  mrs sudberry gasped and turned pale  oh  george quick tell me  poor peter began george  please sir ive bin found said a meek voice behind him at which george turned round with a startstill supporting his mother  mrs brown perceiving the ludicrous nature of the remark began to grow violent on the sofa and to kick a little  then mrs sudberry asked for each of the missing ones individuallysobbing between each question and at each sob tillys sympathetic bosom heaved and mrs brown gave a kick and a subdued scream  then george began to tell the leading features of their misfortunes rapidly and mrs brown listened intently until mrs sudberry again sobbed when mrs brown immediately recollected that she was in hysterics and recommenced kicking  but where are they cried mrs sudberry suddenly  i was just coming to thattheyre at old moggys hut drying themselves and resting  oh  ill go down at once  take me there  accordingly the poor lady threw on her bonnet and shawl and set off with george for the cottage leaving mrs brown now relieved from all anxiety kicking and screaming violently on the sofa to the great alarm of hobbs who just then returned from his fruitless search  my son my darling cried mrs sudberry as she rushed into the cottage and clasped jacky in her arms  she could say no more and if she had said more it could not have been heard for her appearance created dire confusion and turmoil in the hovel  the lost and found wanderers started up to welcome her the little dog sprang up to bark furiously and repel her and the old woman ran at her screaming with intent to rescue jacky from her grasp  there was a regular scuffle for the old woman was strong in her rage but george and fred held her firmly though tenderly back while mr sudberry hurried his alarmed spouse and their child out of the hut and made for home as fast as possible  lucy followed with george almost immediately after leaving fred to do his best to calm and comfort the old woman  for his humane efforts fred received a severe scratching on the face and was compelled to seek refuge in flight    story one chapter 13  visiting the poor  for some time after this the sudberry family were particularly careful not to wander too far from their mountain home  mr sudberry forbade everyone on pain of his utmost displeasure to venture up among the hills without mcallister or one of his lads as a guide  as a further precaution he wrote for six pocket compasses to be forwarded as soon as possible  my dear said his wife since you are writing home you may as well  my dear i am not writing  youre writing to london for compasses are you not  no said mr sudberry with a smile  i believe they understand how to manufacture the mariners compass in scotlandi am writing to my edinburgh agent for them  oh ah well it did not occur to me  now you mention it i think i have heard that the scotch have sort of scientific tendencies  yes they are feelosophically inclined as our friend mcallister would say  but what did you want my love  i want a hobbyhorse to be sent to us for jacky but it will be of no use writing to edinburgh for one  i suppose they do not use such things in a country where there are so few real horses and so few roads fit for a horse to walk on  mr sudberry made no reply not wishing to incur the expense of such a useless piece of furniture and his wife continued her needlework with a sigh  from the bottom of her large heart she pitied the scottish nation and wondered whether there was the remotest hope of the place ever being properly colonised by the english and the condition of the aborigines ameliorated  mamma im going with flora macdonald to visit her poor people said lucy entering at the moment with a flushed facefor lucy was addicted to running when in a hurryand with a coquettish little round straw hat  very well my love but do take that goodnatured man to guide youmr whatshisname ive such a memory  ah  mccannister do take him with you dear  there is no need mamma  nearly all the cottages lie along the roadside and flora is quite at home here you know  true true i forgot that  mrs sudberry sighed and lucy laughed gaily as she ran down the hill to meet her friend  the first cottage they visited was a little rough thatched one with a low roof one door and two little windows in which latter there were four small panes of glass with a knot in each  the interior was similar to that of old moggys hut but there was more furniture in it and the whole was pervaded by an air of neatness and cleanliness that spoke volumes for its owner  this is mrs camerons cottage whispered flora as they entered  she was knocked over by a horse while returning from church last sunday and i fear has been badly shakenwell mrs cameron how are you today  a mild little voice issued from a boxbed in a corner of the room thankee mem im no that ill mem  the lord is verra kind to me there was a mild sadness in the tone a sort of the worlds in an awfu statebut no doot its a for the best an im resigned to my lot though i wadna objec to its being a wee thing better ooayfeeling in it which told of much sorrow in years gone by and of deep humility for there was not a shade of complaint in the tone  has the doctor been to see you my dear granny inquired flora sitting down at the side of the boxbed while lucy seated herself on a stool and tried to pierce the gloom within  oo ay he cam an pood aff ma mutch an feeld ma heed a over but he said nothinonly to lie quiet an tak a pickle watergruel ooay  as the voice said this its owner raised herself on one elbow and peering out with a pair of bright eyes displayed to her visitor the small withered yet healthy countenance of one who must have been a beautiful girl in her youth  she was now upwards of seventy and was as lucy afterwards said a sweet charming dear old woman  her features were extremely small and delicate and her eyes had an anxious look as if she were in the habit of receiving periodical shocks of grief and were wondering what shape the next one would take  i have brought you a bottle of wine said flora now dont shake your headyou must take it you cannot get well on gruel  your daughter is at our house just now i shall meet her on my way home and will tell her to insist on your taking it  the old woman smiled and looked at lucy  this is a friend whom i have brought to see you said flora observing the glance  the old woman held out her hand and lucy pressed it tenderly  she has come all the way from london to see our mountains granny  ay said the old woman with a kind motherly smile its a lang way to lunnon a lang way ay  yell be thinkin were a wild kind o folk hereaway somewhat uncouth we are no doot  indeed i think you are very nice people said lucy earnestly  i had no idea how charming your country was until i came to it  ooay we can only get ideas by seein or readin  its a grawnd thing travellin but its wonderfu what readin ll do  my guidman thats deed this therteen yearaycome martimas he wrought in lunnon for a year before we was marrit an he sent me the newspapers reglar once a monthay the english is fine folk  my guidman aye said that  lucy expressed much interest in this visit of the departed guidman and having touched a chord which was extremely sensitive and not easily put to rest after having been made to vibrate old mrs cameron entertained her with a sweet and prolix account of the last illness death and burial of the said guidman with the tears swelling up in her bright old eyes and hopping over her wrinkled cheeks until flora forbade her to say another word reminding her of the doctors orders to keep quiet  ooay yell be gawin to read me a bit o the book  i thought you would ask that what shall it be  oo ye canna go wrang  flora opened the bible and selecting a passage read it in a slow clear tone while the old woman lay back and listened with her eyes upturned and her hands clasped  isnt it grawnd said she appealing to lucy with a burst of feeling when flora had concluded  lucy was somewhat taken aback by this enthusiastic display of love for the bible and felt somewhat embarrassed for an appropriate answer but flora came to her rescue  i have brought you a book granny it will amuse you when you are able to get up and read  there now no thanksyou positively must lie down and try to sleep  i see your cheek is flushed with all this talking  goodday granny  the next whom we will visit is a very different character said flora as they walked briskly along the road that followed the windings of the river he dwells half a mile off  then you will have time to tell me about old moggy said lucy  you have not yet fulfilled your promise to tell me the secret connected with her and i am burning with impatience to know it  of course you are every girl of your age is set on fire by a secret i have a mind to keep you turning a little longer  and pray grandmamma said lucy with an expressive twinkle in her eyes at what period of your prolonged life did you come to form such a just estimate of character in girls of my age  ill answer that question another time said flora meanwhile i will relent and tell you about old moggy  but after all there is not much to tell and there is no secret connected with her although there is a little mystery  no secret yet a mystery a distinction without a difference it seems to me  perhaps it is  you shall hear  when a middleaged woman moggy was housekeeper to mr hamilton a landed proprietor in this neighbourhood  mr hamiltons gardener fell in love with moggy they married and returning to this their native hamlet settled down in the small hut which the old woman still occupies  they had one daughter named mary after mr hamiltons sister  when mary was ten years old her father died of fever and soon afterwards moggy was taken again into mr hamiltons household in her old capacity for his sister was an invalid and quite unfit to manage his house  in the course of time little mary became a woman and married a farmer at a considerable distance from this neighbourhood  they had one child a beautiful fairhaired little fellow  on the very day that he was born his father was killed by a kick from a horse  the shock to the poor mother was so great that she sank under it and died  thus the little infant was left entirely to the care of his grandmother  he was named willie after his father  death seemed to cast his shadow over poor moggys path all her life through  shortly after this event mr hamilton died suddenly  this was a great blow to the housekeeper for she was much attached to her old master who had allowed her to keep her little grandson beside her under his roof  the sister survived her brother about five years  after her death the housekeeper returned to her old hut where she has ever since lived on the interest of a small legacy left her by her old master little willie or wee wullie as she used to call him was the light of old moggys eyes and the joy of her heart  she idolised and would have spoiled him had that been possible but the child was of a naturally sweet disposition and would not spoil  he was extremely amiable and gentle yet bold as a young lion and full of fun  i do not wonder that poor old moggy was both proud and fond of him in an extraordinary degree  the blow of his removal wellnigh withered her up body and soul  he died said lucy looking up at flora with tearful eyes  no he did not perhaps it would have been better if the poor child had died you shall hear  when willie was six years old a gang of gypsies passed through this hamlet and taking up their abode on the common remained for some time  they were a wild dangerous set and became such a nuisance that the inhabitants at last took the law into their own hands and drove them away  just before this occurred little willie disappeared  search was made for him everywhere but in vain the gypsies were suspected and their huts examined  suspicion fell chiefly on one man a stout illfavoured fellow with an ugly squint and a broken nose but nothing could be proved either against him or the others except that at the time of the childs disappearance this man was absent from the camp  from that day to this dear little willie has never been heard of  at first the poor old grandmother went about almost mad with despair and anxiety but as years passed by she settled down into the moping old creature you have seen her  it is five years since that event willie will be eleven years old now if alive but alas  i fear he must be dead  what a sad sad tale said lucy  i suppose it must be because our jacky is about the age that willie was when he was stolen that the poor woman has evinced such a fondness for him  possibly and now i think of it there is a good deal of resemblance between the two especially about the hair and eyes though willie was much more beautiful  you have noticed no doubt that moggy wears a clean plaid  oh yes interrupted lucy i have observed that  that was the plaid that willie used to wear in winter  his grandmother spends much of her time in washing it she takes great pains to keep it clean  the only mystery about the old woman is the old chest in one corner of her hut  she keeps it jealously locked and no one has ever found out what is in it although the inquisitive folk of the place are very anxious to know  but it does not require a wizard to tell that doubtless it contains the clothing and toys of her grandson  poor old moggy  i can enlighten you on that point said lucy eagerly opening the lid of a small basket which hung on her arm and displaying the small suit of highland clothing in which jacky had been conveyed home on the night when the sudberrys were lost on the hills  this suit came out of the large chest and as i knew you meant to visit moggy today i brought it with me  the two friends reached the door of a small cottage as lucy said this and tapped  come in gruffly said a mans voice  this was one of floras difficult cases  the man was bedridden and was nursed by a granddaughter  he was quite willing to accept comfort from flora especially when it took the shape of food and medicine but he would not listen to the bible  flora knew that he liked her visits however so with prayers in her heart and the bible in her hand she persevered hopefully yet with such delicacy that the gruff old man became gruffer daily as his conscience began to reprove him for his gruffness  thus from hut to hut she went with love to mankind in her heart and the name of jesus on her lip sometimes received with smiles and sent away with blessings occasionally greeted with a cold look and allowed to depart with a frigid goodday  lucy had often wished for some such work as this at home but had not yet found courage to begin  she was deeply sympathetic and observant old moggy was the last they visited that day  flora was the only female she would tolerate  ive been tryin to sayt a night an i canna dot she said stoutly as the ladies entered  you forget the words perhaps dear moggythe lord gave and the lord hath  na na i dinna forget them but i canna say them  so flora sat down on a stool and gently sought by means of the bible to teach the old woman one of the most difficult lessons that poor human nature has got to learn in this world of mingled happiness and woe    story one chapter 14  a surprise and a battle  here halloo hi  hobbs  i say shouted mr sudberry running out at the front door after having swept lucys workbox off the table and trodden on the cats tail  where has that fellow gone to  hes always out of the way  halloo  looking up at the nursery window mrs brown  mrs brown being deeply impressed with the importance of learning just because of mrs sudberrys contempt thereof was busily engaged at that moment in teaching miss tilly and master jacky a piece of very profound knowledge  now miss tilly what is the meaning of procrastination  ho hi hallooooo from mr sudberry but mrs brown supposing the shout is meant for any one but herself takes no notice of it  tillydoing today what you might have put off till tomorrow halloo ho dont you hear hi from below  mrs brownno you little goose  what is it jacky  jackydoing tomorrow what you might have put off till today hi halloo are you deaf up there  mrs brownworse and worse stupid little goose  jacky indignantlywell then if its neither one thing nor tother just lets hear what you make it out to be hi ho halloo  mrs braaown  bless me i think papa is calling on me  yes sir  was you calling sir  throwing up the window and looking out  calling no i wasnt calling  i was shrieking howling yelling is hobbs there  no sir obbs is not ere sir  well then be so good as to go and look for him and say i want him directly to go for the letters  ere i am sir said hobbs coming suddenly round the corner of the house with an appearance of extreme haste  hobbs had in fact been within hearing of his master having been during the last halfhour seated in mcallisters kitchen where the uproarious merriment had drowned all other sounds  hobbs had become a great favourite with the highland family owing to his hearty good humour and ready power of repartee  the sharp cockney with the easygoing effrontery peculiar to his race attempted to amuse the householdnamely mrs mcallister dan hugh and two goodlooking and sturdylimbed servantgirlsby measuring wits with the canny scot as he called the farmer  he soon found however that he had caught a tartar  the goodnatured highlander met his raillery with what we may call a smile of grave simplicity and led him slyly into committing himself in such a way that even the untutored servants could see how far the man was behind their master in general knowledge but hobbs took refuge in smart reply confident assertion extreme volubility and the use of hard words so that it sometimes seemed to the domestics as if he really had some considerable power in argument  worthy mrs mcallister never joined in the debate except by a single remark now and then  she knew her son thoroughly and before the sudberrys had been a week at the white house she understood hobbs through and through  she was wont to sit at her spinningwheel regarding this intellectual sparring with grave interest as a peculiar phase of the human mind  a very sharp encounter had created more laughter than usual at the time when mr sudberry halloed for his manservant  you must be getting deaf hobbs i fear said the master at once pacified by the mans arrival go down and fetch  pray do not send him away just now cried mrs sudberry i have something particular for him to do  can you go down yourself dear  the good man sighed  well i will go and accordingly away he went  stay my dear  well  i expect one or two small parcels by the coach this morning mind you ask for em and bring em up  ay ay and mr sudberry with his hands in his pockets and his wideawake thrust back and very much on one side of his head sauntered down the hill towards the road  one of the disadvantageous points about the white house was its distance from any town or market  the nearest shop was four miles off so that bread butter meat and groceries had to be ordered a couple of days beforehand and were conveyed to their destination by the mailcoach even after they were deposited at the gate of mr mcallisters farm there was still about half a mile of rugged cartroad to be got over before they could be finally deposited in the white house  this was a matter of constant anxiety to mr sudberry because it was necessary that someone should be at the gate regularly to receive letters and parcels and this involved constant attention to the time of the mail passing  when no one was there the coachman left the property of the family at the side of the road  hobbs however was usually up to time fair weather and foul and this was the first time his master had been called on to go for the letters  walking down the road mr sudberry whistled an extremely operatic air in the contentment of his heart and glanced from side to side with a feeling amounting almost to affection at the various objects which had now become quite familiar to him and with many of which he had interesting associations  there was the miniature hut on the roof of which he usually laid his rod on returning from a days fishing  there was the rude stone bridge over the burn on the low parapet of which he and the family were wont to sit on fine evenings and commune of fishing and boating and climbing and wonder whether it would be possible ever again to return to the humdrum life of london  there was the pool in the same burn over which one day he reckless man had essayed to leap and into which he had tumbled when in eager pursuit of jacky  a little below this was the pool into which the said jacky had rushed in wild desperation on finding that his father was too fleet for him  passing through a fivebarred gate into the next field he skirted the base of a high precipitous crag on which grew a thicket of dwarftrees and shrubs and at the foot of which the burn warbled  here on his left stood the briar bush out of which had whirred the first live grouse he ever set eyes on  it was at this bird that in the madness of his excitement he had flung first his stick then his hat and lastly his shout of disappointment and defiance  a little further on was that other bush out of which he had started so many grouse that he now never approached it without a stone in each hand his eyes and nostrils dilated and his breath restrained  he never by any chance on these occasions sent his artillery within six yards of the game but once when he approached the bush in a profound reverie and without the usual preparation he actually saw a bird crouching in the middle of it  to seize a large stone and hit the ground at least forty yards beyond the bush was the work of a moment  up got the bird with a tremendous whizz  he flung his stick wildly and hitting it by chance fair on the head brought it down  to rush at it fall on it crush it almost flat and rise up slowly holding it very tight was the result of this successful piece of poaching  another result was a charming addition to a dinner a few days afterwards  at all these objects mr sudberry gazed benignantly as he sauntered along in the sunshine indulging in sweet memories of the recent past and whistling operatically  the highroad gained he climbed upon the gate seated himself upon the top bar to await the passing of the mail and began to indulge in a magnificent air the florid character of which he rendered much more effective than the composer had intended by the introduction of innumerable flourishes of his own  it was while thus engaged and in the middle of a tremendous shake that mr sudberry suddenly became aware of the presence of a man not more than twenty yards distant  he was lying down on the embankment beside the road and his ragged dress of muddybrown corduroy so resembled the broken ground on which he lay that he was not a very distinct object even when looked at pointblank  certainly mr sudberry thought him an extremely disagreeable object as he ended in an ineffective quaver and with a deep blush for that man must be more than human who when caught in the act of attempting to perpetrate an amateur concert in all its parts does not feel keenly  being of a sociable disposition mr sudberry was about to address this illfavoured beggarfor such he evidently waswhen the coach came round a distant bend in the road at full gallop  it was the ordinary tall topheavy mail of the first part of the nineteenth century  being a poor district there were only two horses a white and a black but the driver wore a stylish red coat and cracked his whip smartly  the road being all down hill at that part the coach came on at a spanking pace and pulled up with a crash  the beggar turned his face to the ground and pretended to be asleep  mr sudberry noticed this but being interested in his own affairs soon forgot the circumstance  got any letters for me today my man  oh yes he has letters and newspapers too  mr sudberry mutters to himself as they are handed down capitalhabusiness hum private hocompasses good  any more  there are no more but there is a parcel or two  the coachman gets down and opens the door of the box behind  the insides peep out and the outsides look down with interest  a great many large and heavy things are pulled out and laid on the road  mr sudberry remarks that it would have been wiser to have stowed his parcels in front  the coachman observes that these are his parcels shuts the door mounts the box and drives away with the outsides grinning and the insides stretching their heads out leaving mr sudberry transfixed and staring  one or two small parcels murmured the good man recalling his wifes words and mind you bring em up  one salmon two legs of mutton one ham three dozen of beer a cask ofofsomething or other and a bag ofofditto groceries i suppose and mind you bring em up  how that is the question cried mr sudberry quoting hamlet in desperation  suddenly he recollected the beggarman  halloo friend come hither  the man rose slowly and rising did not improve his appearance  he was rather tall shaggy loosejointed longarmed broadshouldered and he squinted awfully  his nose was broken and his dark colour bespoke him a gypsy  can you help me up to yonder house with these things my man  no said the man gruffly im footsore with travellin but ill watch them here while you go up for help  oh ahem said mr sudberry with peculiar emphasis you seem a stout fellow and might find more difficult ways of earning half a crown however ill give you that sum if you go up and tell them to send down a barrow  ill wait here replied the man with a sarcastic grin limping back to his former seat on the bank  oh very well and i will wait here said mr sudberry seating himself on a large stone and pulling out his letters  seeing this the gypsy got up again and looked cautiously along the road first to the right and then to the left  no human being was in sight  mr sudberry observed the act and felt uncomfortable  youd better go for help sir said the man coming forward  thank you id rather wait for it  this seems a handy sort of thing to carry said the gypsy taking up the sack that looked like groceries and throwing it across his shoulder  ill save you the trouble of taking this one up anyhow  he went off at once at a sharp walk and with no symptom either of lameness or exhaustion  mr sudberry was after him in a moment  the man turned round and faced him  put that where you took it from thundered mr sudberry  oh youre going to resist  the gypsy uttered an oath and ran at mr sudberry intending to overwhelm him with one blow and rob him on the spot  the big blockhead little knew his man  he did not know that the little englishman was a man of iron frame he only regarded him as a fiery little gentleman still less did he know that mr sudberry had in his youth been an expert boxer and that he had even had the honour of being knocked flat on his back more than once by professional gentlemenin an amicable way of courseat four and sixpence a lesson  he knew nothing of all this so he rushed blindly on his fate and met itthat is to say he met mr sudberrys left fist with the bridge of his nose and his right with the pit of his stomach the surprising result of which was that the gypsy staggered back against the wall  but the man was not a coward whatever other bad qualities he might have been possessed of  recovering in a moment he rushed upon his little antagonist and sent in two sledgehammer blows with such violence that nothing but the englishmans activity could have saved him from instant defeat  he ducked to the first parried the second and returned with such prompt goodwill on the gypsys right eye that he was again sent staggering back against the wall from which point of observation he stared straight before him and beheld mr sudberry in the wildness of his excitement performing a species of cherokee wardance in the middle of the road  nothing daunted however the man was about to renew his assault when george and fred all ignorant of what was going on came round a turn of the road on their way to see what was detaining their father with the letters  why thats father cried fred  fighting yelled george  they were off at full speed in a moment  the gypsy gave but one glance vaulted the wall and dived into the underwood that lined the banks of the river  he followed the stream a few hundred yards doubled at right angles on his course and in ten minutes more was seen crossing over a shoulder of the hill like a mountain hare    story one chapter 15  a dream and a ball  that evening mr sudberry having spent the day in a somewhat excited statehaving swept everything around him wherever he moved with his coattails as with the besom of destructionhaving despatched a note to the nearest constabulary station and having examined the bolts and fastenings of the windows of the white housesat down after supper to read the newspaper and fell fast asleep with his head hanging over the back of his chair his nose turned up to the ceiling and his mouth wide open  his loving familyminus tilly and jacky who were abed encircled the table variously employed and george stood at his elbow fastening up a pair of bookshelves of primitive construction coupled together by means of green cord  while thus domestically employed they heard a loud steady thumping outside  the sudberrys were well acquainted by this time with that sound and its cause  at first it had filled mrs sudberry with great alarm raising in her feeble mind horrible reminiscences of tales of burglary and midnight murder  after suffering inconceivable torments of apprehension for two nights the good lady could stand it no longer and insisted on her husband going out to see what it could be  as the sound appeared to come from the cottage or offshoot from the white house in which the mcallisters lived he naturally went there and discovered that the noise was caused by the stoutest of the two servantgirls this sturdy lass whose costume displayed a pair of enormous ankles to advantage and exhibited a pair of arms that might have made a prizefighter envious was standing in the middle of the floor with a large iron pot before her and a thick wooden pin in her hands with the end of which she was according to her own statement champin tatties  mrs mcallister her son hugh and dan and the other servantgirl were seated round the walls of the room watching the process with deep interest for their supper was in that pot  the nine dogs were also seated round the room watching the process with melancholy interest for their supper was not in that pot and they knew it and wished it was  my dear said mr sudberry on returning to the parlour they are champing tatties  what  champing tatties in other words mashing potatoes which it would seem with milk constitute the supper of the family  thus was mrs sudberrys mind relieved and from that night forward no further notice was taken of the sound  but on the present occasion the champing of the tatties had an unwonted effect on mr sudberry  it caused him to dream and his dreams naturally took a pugilistic turn  his breathing became quick and short his face began to twitch and lucy suggested that it would be as well to awake papa when papa suddenly awaked himself and hit george a tremendous blow on the shoulder  hallo father cried george remonstratively rubbing the assaulted limb really you know if you come it in this way often you will alienate my affections i fear  my dear boywhatwhere  why i was dreaming  of course he was and the result of his dream was that everybody in the room started up in surprise and excitement  thereafter they sat down in a gay and very talkative humour  soon afterwards a curious squeaking was heard in the adjoining cottage and another thumping sound began which was to the full as unremitting as and much more violent than that caused by champin tatties  the mcallister household having supped were regaling themselves with a dance  what say to a dance with them said george  oh cried lucy leaping up  capital shouted mr sudberry clapping his hands  a message was sent in  the reply was heartily welcome and in two minutes mr sudberry and stout servantgirl number 1 george and stout girl number 2 hugh and lucy dan and hobbs the latter consenting to act as girl number 3 were dancing the reel o tullochgorum like maniacs to the inspiring strains of mcallisters violin while peter sat in a corner in constant dread of being accidentally sat down upon fred in another corner looked on laughed and was caressed furiously by the nine dogs  mrs sudberry talked philosophy in the window with grave earnest mrs mcallister whose placid equanimity was never disturbed but flowed on broad and deep like a mighty river and whose interest in all things small and great seemed never to flag for a moment  the room in which all this was going on was of the plainest possible description  it was the hall the parlour the diningroom the drawingroom and the library of the mcallister family  earth was the floor whitewashed and uneven were the walls nonexistent was the ceiling and black with peatsmoke were the rafters  there was a dresser clean and white and over it a rack of plates and dishes there was a fireplacea huge yawning gulf with a roaring fire for culinary purposes only being summerand beside it a massive iron gallows on which to hang the family pot  said pot was a caldron so big was it that there was a species of winch and a chain for raising and lowering it over the fire in fact a complicated sort of machinery mysterious and sootbegrimed towered into the dark depths of the ample chimney  there was a brown cupboard in one corner and an apoplectic eightday clock in another  a small bookshelf supported the family bible and several ancient and muchworn volumes  wooden benches were ranged round the walls and clumsy chairs and tables with various pails buckets luggies troughs and indescribable articles completed the furniture of the picturesque and cosy apartment  the candle that lighted the whole was supported by a tall wooden candlestick whose foot rested on the ground and whose body by a simple but clumsy contrivance could be lengthened or shortened at pleasure from about three to five feet  but besides all this there was a world of materiel disposed on the black rafters aboveold farm implements broken furniture an old musket an old claymore a broken spinningwheel etcetera all of which were piled up and so mingled with the darkness of the vault above that imagination might have deemed the spot a general rendezvous for the aged and the maimed of still life  fast and furious was the dancing that night  native animal spirits did it all  no artificial stimulants were there  tatties and mulk were at the bottom of the whole affair  the encounter of that forenoon seemed to have had the effect of recalling the spirit of his youth to mr sudberry and his effervescing joviality gave tone to all the rest  now fred you must take my place said he throwing himself in an exhausted condition on a settle  but perhaps your partner may want a rest suggested fred  lass number 1 scorned the idea so fred began  are your fingers not tired asked mr sudberry wiping his bald forehead which glistened as if it had been anointed with oil  not yet said mcallister quietly  not yet  if the worthy highlander had played straight on all night and half the next day he would have returned the same answer to the same question  you spend a jolly life of it here said mr sudberry to mrs mcallister  ay a pleasant life no doot but were not always fiddling and dancing  true but the variety of herding the cattle on these splendid hills is charming  so it is assented mrs mcallister weve reason to be contented with our lot  maybe ye would grow tired of it however if ye was always here  im told that the gentry whiles grow tired of their braw rooms and take to plowterin aboot the hills and burns for change  sometimes they even dance wi the servants in a highland cottage  ha you have me there cried mr sudberry laughing  let me sit down pa pray do cried lucy  her father rose quickly and lucy dropped into his place quite exhausted  come father relieve me cried fred  im done up and my partner wont give in  to say truth it seemed as if the said partner stout lass number 1 never would give in at all  from the time that the sudberrys entered she had not ceased to dance reel after reel without a minute of breathingtime  her countenance was like the sun in a fog her limbs moved as deftly and untiringly after having tired out father and son as they did when she began the evening and she now went on with a quiet smile on her face evidently resolved to show their english guests the nature of female highland metal  in the midst of all this the dogs suddenly became restive and began to growl  soon after a knock came to the door and the dogs rushed at it barking violently  mr mcallister went out and found that a company of wandering beggars had arrived and prayed to be allowed to sleep in the barn  unfortunate it was for them that they came so soon after mr sudberrys unpleasant rencounter with one of their fraternity  the good man of the house although naturally humane and hospitable to such poor wanderers was on the present occasion embittered against them so he ordered them off  this incident brought the evening to an abrupt termination as it was incumbent on the farmer to see the intruders safely off his premises so the sudberrys returned in a state of great delight excitement and physical warmth to their own parlour  the only other fact worth recording in regard to this event is that the sudberrys were two hours late for breakfast next morning    story one chapter 16  the effects of compasses  the first few weeks of the sudberrys residence in their highland home were of an april castalternate sunshine and shower  sometimes they had a day of beaming light from morning till night at other times they had a day of unmitigated rain or as mr sudberry called it a day of cats and dogs and occasionally they had a day which embraced within its own circuit both conditions of weatherglorious bursts of sunshine alternating with sudden plumps of rain  thus far the weather justified and strengthened the diverse opinions of both husband and wife  did i not tell you my love that the climate was charming was mr sudberrys triumphant remark when a dazzling blaze of light would roll over flood and fell and chase the clouds away  there didnt i say so was the withering rejoinder of mrs sudberry when a black cloud rolled over the sky and darkened the landscape as with a wipe of ink  hitherto victory leaned decidedly to neither side the smile of triumph and the humbled aspect of defeat rested alternate on either countenance so that both faces taken together formed a sort of contradictory human barometer which was not a bad oneat all events it was infinitely superior to that instrument of the banjo type which mr sudberry was perpetually tapping in order to ascertain whether or not its tendencies were dropsical  when father was up at set fair mother was certain to be depressed inclining to much rain yet strangely enough it was on such occasions very dry  when mother was fair barometrically speaking of course father was naturally down at changeable  yet there was wonderful contradiction in the readings of this barometer for when mothers countenance indicated much rain father sometimes went down to stormy and the tails of his coat became altogether unmanageable  but towards the middle of the holidays father gained a decided victory  for three weeks together they had not a drop of rainscarcely a cloud in the sky and mother although fairly beaten and obliged to confess that it was indeed splendid weather met her discomfiture with a good grace and enjoyed herself extremely in a quiet way  during this bright period the sudberry family one and all went ahead as george said at a tremendous pace  the compasses having arrived mr sudberry no longer laid restrictions on the wandering propensities of his flock but having given a compass to each and taught them all the use of it sent them abroad upon the unexplored ocean of hills without fear  even jacky received a compass with strict injunctions to take good care of it  being naturally of an inquiring disposition he at once took it to pieces and this so effectually that he succeeded in analysing it into a good many more pieces than its fabricator had ever dreamed of  to put it together again would have taxed the ingenuity of the same fabricatorno wonder that it was beyond the power of jacky altogether  but this mattered nothing to the little darling as he did not understand his fathers learned explanation of the uses of the instrument  to do mr sudberry justice he had not expected that his boy could understand him but he was aware that if he jacky did not get a compass as well as the rest of them there would be no peace in the white house during that season  moreover jacky did not care whether he should get lost or not  in fact he rather relished it for he knew that it would create a pleasant excitement for a time in the household and he entertained the firm belief that mcallister and his men could find any creature on the hills man or beast no matter how hopelessly it should be lost  there being then no limit to the wanderings of the sudberrys they one and all gave themselves over deliberately to a spirit of riotous rambling  of course they all on various occasions lost themselves despite the compasses but having become experienced mountaineers they always took good care to find themselves again before sunset  george and fred candidly declared that they preferred to steer by dead reckoning and left their compasses at home  lucy always carried hers and frequently consulted it especially when in her fathers presence for she was afflicted poor girl with that unfashionable weakness an earnest desire to please her father even in trifles  nevertheless she privately confided to fred one day that she was often extremely puzzled by her compass and that she had grave doubts as to whether on a certain occasion when she had gone for a long ramble with hector and flora macdonald and been lost the blame of that disaster was not due to her compass  fred said he thought it was and believed that it would be the means of compassing her final disappearance from the face of the earth if she trusted to it so much  as for mr sudberry himself his faith in the compass was equal to that of any mariner  the worthy man was or believed himself to be which is the same thing you know of profoundly scientific tendencies  he was aware of course that he had never really studied any science whatever but he had dabbled in a number of them and he felt that he had immense capacity for deep thought and subtle investigation  his mind was powerfully analyticalthats what it was  one consequence of this peculiarity of mind was that he took his bearings on short and known distances as well as on long venturesome rambles he tested himself and his compass as it were  one day he had walked out alone in the direction of the village four miles distant from the white house whence the family derived their supplies  he had set out with his rod he never walked near the river without his rod intending to take a cast in what he styled the lower pools  by degrees he fished so near to the village that he resolved to push forward and purchase a few books  depositing rod and basket among the bushes he walked smartly along the road having previously as a matter of course taken his bearings from the village by compass  a flock of sheep met him gazed at him in evident surprise and passed on at their heels came the collie dog with his tongue out  it bestowed a mild intelligent glance on the stranger and also passed on  close behind the dog came the shepherd with plaid bonnet and thick stick  a fine day friend said mr sudberry  oo ay it is a fine day  he also passed on  another turn in the road and mr sudberry met a drove of shaggy cattle each cow of which looked sturdy and fierce enough for any ordinary bull while the bull himself was something awful to look upon  there is nothing ladylike or at all feminine in the aspect of a highland cow  mr sudberry politely stepped to one side and made way for them  many of the animals paused for an instant and gazed at the englishman with profound gravity and then went on their way with an air that showed they evidently could make nothing of him  the drover thought otherwise for he stopped  coottay to you sir  goodday friend goodday  splendid weather for thefor the  mr sudberry did not know exactly for which department of agriculture the weather was most favourable so he saidfor the cattle  oo ay the wathers no that ill  can she tell the time o day  out came the compass  westnorwest and byoh  i beg your pardon pulling out his watch and replacing the compass a quarterpast two  the drover passed on and mr sudberry chuckling at his mistake took the bearings of a tall pine that grew on a distant knoll  on gaining the outskirts of the village mr sudberry felt a sensation of hunger and instantly resolved to purchase a bun which article he had now learned to call by its native name of cookie  at the same instant a bright idea struck himhe would steer for the bakers shop by compass  he knew the position of the shop exactlythe milestone gave him the distancehe would lay his course for it  he would walk conscientiously with his eyes on the ground except when it was necessary to refer to the compass and he would not raise them until he stood within the shop  it would be a triumphant exhibition of the practical purposes in a small way to which the instrument might be applied  full of this idea he took a careful observation of the compass the sun and surrounding nature laid his course for the bakers shop which was on the right side of the village and walked straight into the butchers which lay on its left extremity  he was so much put out on lifting his eyes to those of the butcher that he ordered a leg of mutton and six pounds of beefsteaks on the spot  the moment after he recollected that two legs of mutton and a round of beef had been forwarded to the white house by coach the day before and that there was a poached brace of moorfowl in the larder at that moment but having given the order in a prompt business tone of voice he felt that he lacked moral courage to rescind it  yell hae friens comin to veesit ye observed the butcher who was gifted with a peculiar and farsighted faculty of putting that and that together  no we have no immediate prospect of such a pleasure  ay  hum its wonderfu what an appeteet the hill air gives to strangers  a tremendous appetite  goodday friend  mr sudberry said this heartily and went off to the bakersby dead reckoningdiscomfited but chuckling  the butcher pondered and philosophised over the subject the remainder of the afternoon with much curiosity but with no success  had the wisdom of plato been mingled with his scotch philosophy the compound reduced to an essential oil of investigative profundity and brought to bear on the subject in question he would have signally failed to discover the reason of the sudberrys larder being crammed that week with an unreasonable quantity of butchermeat  yes during these three weeks of sunshine the sudberrys made hay of their time as diligently as the mcallisters made hay of their grass and the compasses played a prominent part in all their doings and led them into many scrapes  among other things they led them to glen ogle more of this in the next chapter    story one chapter 17  the trip to glen ogle  without entering into minute comparisons it may be truly said that glen ogle is one of the grandest and wildest of mountain passes in the highlands of perthshire  unlike the trossachs which sir walter scott has immortalised in his lady of the lake glen ogle is a wild rugged rocky pass almost entirely destitute of trees except at its lower extremity and of shrubs except along the banks of the little burn which meanders like a silver thread down the centre of the glen  high precipitous mountains rise on either handthose on the left being more rugged and steep than those on the right  the glen is very narrow throughouta circumstance which adds to its wildness and which in gloomy weather imparts to the spot a truly savage aspect  masses of debris and fallen rocks line the base of the precipices or speckle the sides of the mountains in places where the slopes being less precipitous than elsewhere have served to check the fallen matter and the whole surface of the narrow vale is dotted with rocks of various sizes which have bounded from the cliffs and overleaping every obstacle have found a final restingplace on a level with the little stream  the road follows the course of the stream at the foot of the glen but as it advances it ascends the mountains on the right and runs along their sides until the head of the pass is gained  here it crosses by means of a rude stone bridge a deep chasm at the bottom of which the waters of the burn leap and roar among chaotic rocksa foretaste of the innumerable rushes leaps tumbles and plunges which await them all down the glen  just beyond this bridge is a small level patch of mingled rocky and mossy ground  it is the summit of the mountain ridge yet the highest peaks rise above it and so hem it in that it resembles the arena of a rude amphitheatre  in the centre of this spot lies a clear still lake or tarn not more than a hundred yards in diameter this is the fountainhead of two streams  from the pools and springs within a stones cast of the tarn arise the infant waters of the burn already mentioned which descending glen ogle find their way to the firth of tay through strath earn  from the opposite side of the tarn issues another brook which leaping down the other side of the mountains mingles its waters with loch tay and finds its way by a much more circuitous route to the same firth  the whole region is desolate and lonely in the extreme and so wild that a rocky mountain hunter transported thither by fairy power might find himself quite at home except in the matter of bighorned goats and grisly bears  but for the matter of that he would find mountain sheep with very respectable horns in their way and as to bears the hillsides are bare enough to satisfy any hunter of moderate expectations  up to this elevated tarn among the hoary mountain peaks the sudberry family struggled one hot sunny lovely forenoon  bent on a long and bold flight they had travelled by the stagecoach to the foot of the glen near the head of loch earn  here they were deposited at the door of a picturesque whitewashed house which was styled the inn and from this point they toiled up the glen on foot intoxicating themselves on the way with deep draughts of mingled excitement fresh air and romance  the whole family were out upon this occasion including mrs brown hobbs and peter  the delicate tilly was also there and to her master jacky devoted himself with an assiduity worthy of even a good boy  he took occasion several times however to tell peter in a grave way that whenever he felt tired he would be glad to carry his basket for him and himself too for the matter of that if he should get quite knocked up  he indemnified himself for these concessions on the side of virtue by inflicting various little torments on the bodies and minds of mrs brown and his mother such as hiding himself at some distance ahead and suddenly darting out from behind a rock with a hideous yell or coming up behind with eyes staring and hair flying and screaming mad bull with all the force of his lungs  hector and flora macdonald were also of the party  george and fred were particularly attentive to flora and hector was ditto to lucy  he carried her botanical box and gave her a good deal of information in regard to plants and wild flowers in which lucy professed a deep interest insomuch that she stopped frequently to gather specimens and listen to hectors learned observations until they were more than once left a considerable way behind the rest of the party  indeed lucys interest in science was so great that she unwittingly pulled two or three extremely rare specimens to pieces while listening to these eloquent discourses and was only made conscious of her wickedness by a laughing remark from hector that she must surely have the bump of destructiveness largely developed  arrived at the tarn each individual deposited his and her basket or bundle on a selected spot of dry ground and the ladies began to spread out the viands while mr sudberry took the exact bearings of the spot by compass  while thus philosophically engaged he observed that fish were rising in the tarn  hallo  hector why i see fish in the pond  true replied the young man plenty of trout but they are small  ill fish said mr sudberry  so will i cried george  and fish they did for half an hour at the end of which period they were forcibly torn away from the waterside and made to sit down and eat sandwicheshaving caught between them two dozen of trout the largest of which was about five inches long  why how did ever the creatures get up into such a lake inquired mr sudberry eyeing the trout in surprise they could never jump up all the waterfalls that we have passed today  i suppose they were born in the lake suggested hector with a smile  born in it murmured mr sudberry pondering the idea but the first ones could not have been born in it  how did the first ones get there  the same way as what the first fishes came into the sea of course said jacky looking very pompous  unfortunately he unintentionally tried to perform that impossible feat which is called swallowing a crumb down the wrong throat thereby nearly choking himself and throwing his mother into a flutter of agitation  there was something so exhilarating in the atmosphere of that elevated region that none of the party felt inclined to waste much time over luncheon  mr sudberry in particular was very restless and migratory his fishing propensities had been aroused and could not be quieted he had in the course of a quarter of an hour gobbled what he deemed it his duty to eat and drink and during the remainder of the meal had insisted on helping everybody to everything moving about as he did so and thereby causing destruction to various articles of crockery  at last he declared that he was off to fish down the burn and that the rest of the party would pick him up on their way back to the coach which was to start from the inn at loch earn head at five in the afternoon  now dont be late said he be at the inn by halfpast four precisely  ay ay yes yes from everybody and away he went alone to enjoy his favourite sport  the rest of the party scattered  some went to good points for sketching some to botanise and others to ascend the highest of the neighbouring peaks  mrs brown and hobbs were left in charge of the debris of luncheon to the eating up of which they at once devoted themselves with the utmost avidity as soon as the others were gone  come this is wot i calls comfortable said hobbs he spoke huskily through an immense mouthful of sandwich aint it mrs brown  humph said mrs brown  it is to be remarked that mrs brown was out of tempernot that that was an unusual thing but she had found the expedition more trying than she had anticipated and the torments of mind and body to which jacky had subjected her were of an uncommonly irritating nature  wot continued hobbs attacking a cold tongue dyou think of the natives of this ere place  nothink at all was mrs browns prompt rejoinder  hobbs who was naturally of a jolly sociable disposition felt a little depressed at mrs browns repellent manner so he changed his mode of address  try some of this ere fowl mrs brown its remarkably tender it is just suited to the tender lips ofdear me mrs brown how improvin the mountain hair is to your complexion if i may wenture to speak of improvin that wich is perfect already  get along hobbs said mrs brown affecting to be displeased  my dear im gettin along like a game chicken perhaps i might say like dan whos got the most uncommon happetite as i ever did see  hes a fine fellow dan is aint he mrs brown  brute said mrs brown theyre all brutes  ah said hobbs shaking his head strong language mrs brown  but admitting that merely for the sake of argument of course you cannot deny that they are raither clever brutes  i do deny it retorted mrs brown taking a savage bite out of the leg of a chicken as if it represented the whole celtic race  dont they talk the most arrant stuffspecially that mcallister who is forever speakin about things that he dont understand and that nobody else does  speak for yourself maam said hobbs drawing himself up with as much dignity as was compatible with a sitting posture  i do speak for myself  moreover i speak for some whom i might name and who aint verra far away  if maam you mean that insinivation to apply  i make no insinivations  hand me that pot of jamno the unopened one  hobbs did as he was required with excruciating politeness and thereafter took refuge in dignified silence suffering however an expression of lofty scorn to rest on his countenance  mrs brown observed this and her irate spirit was still further chafed by it  she meditated giving utterance to some withering remarks while with agitated fingers she untied the string of the little pot of cranberryjam  worthy mrs brown was particularly fond of cranberryjam  she had put up this pot in her own basket expressly for her own private use  she now opened it with the determination to enjoy it to the full to smack her lips very much and frequently and offer none of it to hobbs  when the cover was removed she gazed into the pot with a look of intense horror uttered a piercing shriek and fell back in a dead faint  this extraordinary result is easily accounted for  almost every human being has one grand special loathing  there is everywhere some creature which to some individual is an object of dreada creature to be shrunk from and shuddered at  mrs browns horror was frogs  jacky knew this well  he also knew of mrs browns love for cranberryjam and her having put up a special pot  to abstract the pot replace it by a similar pot with a live frog imprisoned therein and then retire to chuckle in solitude and devour the jam was simple and natural  that the imp had done this that he had watched with delight the deceived woman pant up glen ogle with the potted frog on her arm and perspiration on her brow that he had asked for a little cranberryjam on the way with an expression of countenance that almost betrayed him and that he had almost shrieked with glee when he observed the anxiety with which mrs brownhaving tripped and fallenopened her basket and smiled to observe that the pot was not broken that the imp we say had been guilty of all this was known only to himself but much of it became apparent to the mind of hobbs when on mrs browns fainting he heard a yell of triumph and on looking up beheld master jacky far up the heights clearly defined against the bright sky and celebrating the success of his plot with a maniacal edition of the highland fling  at a quarterpast four all the party assembled at the inn except mr sudberry  five arrivedno mr sudberry  the coach could not wait  the gentlemen in despair rushed up the bed of the stream and found him fishing in a glow of excitement with his basket and all his pockets full of splendid trout  the result was that the party had to return home in a large wagon and it was night when at last they embarked in their boat and rowed down their own lake  it was a profound calm  the air was mild and balmy there was just enough of light to render the surrounding mountains charmingly mysterious and the fatigues of the day made the repose of the boat agreeable  even mrs sudberry enjoyed that romantic nighttrip on the water  it was so dark that there was a tendency to keep silence on landing to speak in low tones but a little burst of delight broke forth when they surmounted the dark shoulder of the hill and came at last in sight of the windows of the white house glowing a ruddy welcome home    story one chapter 18  the family go to church under difficulties  it would seem to be a wellunderstood and undeniable fact that woman invariably gains the victory over man in the longrun and even when she does not prove to be the winner she is certain to come off the conqueror  it is well that it should be so  the reins of the world could not be in better hands  but strangely enough woman triumphs not only in matters over which she and man have more or less united control but even in matters with which the human race cannot interfere  for instance in regard to weatherdespite the three weeks of unfailing sunshine mrs sudberry maintained her original opinion that notwithstanding appearances being against her the weather in the highlands of scotland was as a rule execrable  as if to justify this opinion the weather suddenly changed and the three weeks of sunshine were followed by six weeks of rain  whether there was something unusual in the season or not we cannot positively say but certain it is that for the period we have named it rained incessantly with the exception of four days  during a great part of the time it rained from morning till night  sometimes it was intermittent and came down in devastating floods  at other times it came in the form of scotch mist which is simply small rain so plentiful that it usually obliterates the whole landscape and so penetrating that it percolates through everything except waterproof it was a question which was the more wetting species of rainthe thorough downpour or the heavy mist  but whether it poured or permeated there was never any change in the leaden sky during these six weeks and the mountains were never clearly seen except during the four accidental days already referred to  at first mrs sudberry triumphed but long before that season was over she had reached such a condition of humility that she would have actually rejoiced in a fine day  as for the rest of the family they bore up against it bravely for a time  on the first day of this wet season they were rather pleased than otherwise to be obliged to stay in the house  jacky in particular was delighted as it afforded him a glorious opportunity of doing mischief and making himself so disagreeable that all except his mother felt as if they hated him  on the second day indoor games of various kinds were proposed and entered into with much spirit  on the third day the games were tried again with less spirit  on the fourth day they were played without any spirit at all and on the fifth they were given up in disgust  the sixth day was devoted to reading and sulking and thus they ended that week  the seventh day which chanced to be sunday was one of the four fine days before mentioned  the sky was blue the sun intensely bright and the inundated earth was steaming  the elastic spirits of the family recovered  come well walk to church cried mr sudberry as they rose from breakfast  what my dear exclaimed his wife and the roads kneedeep in mud and water  i care not if they were waistdeep cried the reckless man ive been glued to my seat for a week so ill walk to church if i should have to swim for it  so will i so will i from george and fred so will we all from lucy and me too timidly from tilly with hurrah furiously from the impthis decided the business  very well said the resigned mother of the flock then i will go too  so away they went to church through mud and mire and water with the nine collie dogs at their heels and mr mcallister bearing them company  fred and mcallister walked together in rear of the rest conversing earnestly for the latter was learned in theology and the former dearly loved a philosophical discussion  mr sudberry and lucy walked in advance  as he approached the wellknown bush the force of habit induced him almost unconsciously to pick up a stone and walk on tiptoe lucy who did not know the cause of this strange action looked at her father in surprise  whirr went a blackcock bang went the stone and a yell instantly followed accompanied by a hatit was his best beaver  why dear papa it is sunday  dear me so it is  the good man was evidently much discomfited  ah lucy dear that shows the effect and force of bad habit that is to say of habit for the simple act cannot be called bad on the wrong day  you cannot call throwing your best hat in the mud a good habit on any day said mrs sudberry with the air of a woman who regarded her husbands chance of mending as being quite hopeless  it was only forgetfulness my dear said the worthy man putting his hat quite meekly on the back of his head and pushing forward in order to avoid further remarks  coming to a hollow of the road they found that it was submerged a foot deep by the river which had been swollen into a small lake at that spot  there was much trouble here mcallister with native gallantry offered to carry the ladies over in his arms but the ladies would not listen to the proposal with the exception of tilly who at once accepted it gladly  the rest succeeded in scrambling along by the projecting stones at the base of the wall that ran alongside of the road and gained the other side after many slips much alarm and sundry screams  oh you darling cried tilly suddenly  she pointed to a hole in the wall out of which peeped the most wideawake weasel that ever lived  its brown little head and sharp nose moved quickly about with little jerks and its round lustrous black eyes seemed positively to glitter with surprise perhaps it was delight at the sudberry family of course jacky rushed at it with a yellthere was a good deal of the terrier in jackyand of course the weasel turned tail and vanished like a flash of light  when they came to the narrowest part of the pass which opened out of their own particular valleyrasselas vale as lucy had named ittilly was fortunate enough to set eyes on another darling which in the shape of a roe deer stood startled and trembling in the centre of the pass  they came on it so suddenly that it seemed to have been paralysed for a moment  a shout from the imp however quickly dissolved the spell with one graceful bound it cleared the wall and was far away among the brackens on the mountainside before the party had recovered from their delight and surprise at having met a real live wild deer face to face and not twenty yards distant in this unexpected manner  nothing further occurred to arrest their progress to church which was upwards of four miles from their home among the hills  the sermon that day was peculiar  the minister of the parish was a young man one of those quiet modest humble young men who are as their friends think born to be neglected in this world  he was a shrewd sensible young fellow however who if put to it could have astonished his friends not a little  he was brimful of scotch theology but strange to say he refrained from bringing that fact prominently before his flock insomuch that some of the wiser among them held the opinion that although he was an excellent worthy young man he was if any thing a little commonplacein fact he never seemed to have any diffeeculties in his discoorses an if he had he aye got ower them by sayin plump oot that they were mysteries he did na pretend to unravel  any one with half an eye might have seen that the young clergyman was immeasurably above his flock intellectually  a few of them among whom was our friend mcallister perceived this and appreciated their minister  the most of them good souls thought him worthy but weak  feeling that he had been appointed to preach the gospel this youth resolved to make himself all things to all men in order that he might gain some  he therefore aimed at preaching christ crucified and kept much of his own light in the background bringing it out only in occasional flashes which were calculated to illuminate but not dazzle the minds of his people  he remembered the remark of that old woman who when asked what she thought of a new minister said hoot  i think naethin o him ava i understand every word he says and he resolved rather to be thought nothing of at all than pander to the contemptible craving of those who fancy that they are drinking deep draughts of wisdom when they read or hear words that are incomprehensible but which sound profoundly philosophical  but we might have spared our readers all this for the young minister did not preach that day  he was unwell and a friend had agreed to preach for him  the friend was an old man with bent form and silvery hair who having spent a long life in preaching the gospel had been compelled by increasing age to retire from active service  yet like a true warrior he could when occasion required buckle on his christian armour and fight stoutly as of old for his beloved master and for the salvation of human souls  his eye was dim and his voice was weak and it brought tears to the eyes of the sympathetic among the people to see the old man lose his place and unconsciously repeat his sentences  but not a shadow of disrespect mingled with their feelings  there was no mistaking the glow of love and the kindly fire which flushed the pale face when salvation was the theme  when he mentioned the name of jesus and urged sinners to flee from the wrath to come the people felt the truth of that word gods strength is perfected in mans weakness  the sudberrys felt very happy that day on returning home  they overtook old moggy stumping along through mud and water with tears bedewing her cheeks  why moggy you are all wet said fred hastening towards her  ay i fell into a dub as i cam out o the kirk  but ech sirs ive heard blessed words this day  the sudberrys spent that evening in their usual way  they went to a particular spot which lucy had named the sunny knoll and there learned hymns off by heart which were repeated at night and commented on by mr sudberry  after supper they all got into what is called a talk it were presumptuous to attempt to explain what that means  everyone knows what it is  many people know also that a talk can be got up when people are in the right spirit on any subject and that the subject of all others most difficult to get up this talk upon is religion  mr sudberry knew this he felt much inclined at one time that night to talk about fishing but he laid strong constraint on himself and gave the conversation a turn in the right direction  the result was a talka hearty free enthusiastic communing on the saviour the soul and eternal things which kept them up late and sent them happy to bedhappier than they had yet been all that season    story one chapter 19  a strange homecoming  master jacky made two discoveries next day both of which he announced with staring eyes and in breathless haste having previously dashed into the parlour like a miniature thunderbolt  the first was that the bathingpool was clean swept away by the floods not a vestige of it being left  the whole family rushed out to see with their own eyes  they saw and were convinced  not a trace of it remained  even the banks of the little stream had been so torn and altered by gushing water and tumbling rocks that it was almost impossible to say where that celebrated pool had been  the rains having commenced again on monday just as if sunday had been allowed to clear up in order to let people get to church the family returned to the house some to read and sketch mr sudberry and george to prepare for a fishing excursion despite the rain  the second discovery was more startling in its nature  jacky announced it with round eyes and a blazing face thus  oh ma old moggys ddyin  the attractive power of sweeties and a certain fondness for the old woman in the boys heart had induced jacky to visit the hut so frequently that it at last came to be understood that when the imp was utterly lost he was sure to be at old moggys  he had sauntered down indifferent to rain to call on his friend just after discovering the destruction of the bathingpool and found her lying on the bundle of rags which constituted her bed  she was groaning woefully  jack went forward with much anxiety  the old woman was too ill to raise herself but she had sufficient strength to grasp the childs hand and drawing him towards her to stroke his head  hallo  moggy youre ill  a groan and a gasp was the reply and the poor creature made such wry faces and looked altogether so cadaverous that jacky was quite alarmed  he suggested a drink of water and brought her one  then as the old woman poured out a copious stream of gaelic with much emphasis he felt that the presence of some more able and intelligent nurse was necessary so like a sensible boy he ran home and delivered his report as has been already described  lucy and fred hastened at once to the hut of the old woman and found her in truth in a high fever the result no doubt of the severe wetting of the day before and having slept in damp clothes  her mind was wandering a little when lucy knelt at her side and took her hand but she retained sufficient selfcontrol to look up and exclaim earnestly i can sayd nooi can sayd noo  i can say thy will be done  she became aware as she said so that the visitor at her side was not the one she had expected  eh yere no miss flora  no dear granny but i am quite as anxious to help you and flora will come very soon  we have only just heard of your illness and have sent a message to flora  come tell me what is the matter let me put your poor head right  old moggy submitted with a groan and lucy assisted by fred endeavoured to make her bed a little more comfortable while the anxious and staring jacky was sent back to the house for some tea and a dry flannel gown  before his return however flora macdonald who chanced to be in the neighbourhood came in to see moggy and immediately took the case in hand in a way that greatly relieved fred and lucy because they felt that she was accustomed to such incidents and thoroughly understood what to do  hobbs who came in a few minutes later with the sudberry medicine chest was instantly despatched by flora for the doctor and george who entered a few minutes after that was sent about his business as were also a number of gossips whose presence would ere long have rendered the small hut unbearably warm but for floras decision  meanwhile all this unusual bustle had the effect of diverting the mind of the patient who ceased to groan and took to wandering instead  leaving them all thus engaged we must beg the reader to accompany us to a very different scene  it is a dense thicket within the entrance of the pass to which reference has been made more than once  here a band of wandering beggars or gypsies had pitched their camp on a spot which commanded an extensive view of the highroad yet was itself concealed from view by the dwarftrees which in that place covered the rugged hillside  there was a rude hut constructed of boughs and ferns underneath which several darkskinned and sturdy children were at play  a dissipatedlooking young woman sat beside them  in front of this hut a small fire was kindled and over it from a tripod hung an iron pot the contents of which were watched with much interest and stirred from time to time by a middleaged woman of forbidding aspect  beside her stood our amiable friend with the squint and the broken nose who has already been mentioned as having received a merited thrashing from mr sudberry  yes the little brute has come back said the gypsy grinding his teeth in a way that might have led one to suppose he would have been glad to have had the little brute between them  serves ye right for stealin him away said the woman  serves me right echoed the man bitterly  did i not vow that i would have my revenge on that old witch  did she not stand up in court and witness again me so that i got two year for a job that many a fellow gits off with six months for  well you know you deserved it was the womans comforting rejoinder you committed the robbery  so i did but if that shewolf had not made it out so bad id have got off with six months  ha but i knew how to touch her up  i knew her weakness swore afore i left the dock that id steal away the little cub she was so fond ofand i did it  there was a gleam of triumph in the gypsys face as he said this but it was quickly followed by a scowl when the woman said  well and much you have made of it  here is the brat come back at the end o five years to spoil our harvest  how could i know hed do that  i paid the captain a goodish lump o tin to take him on a long voyage and i thought he was so young that hed forget the old place  how dye know that he hasnt forgot it inquired the woman  cause i seed him not twenty miles from this and heerd him say hed stop at the blue boar all night and come on here in the morningthats tomorrowso i come straight out to ask you wot im to do  ha thats like you  too chickenhearted to do any thing till i set you on an mean enough to saddle it on me when yer nabbed  come thats an old story growled the man  you know wot i am and i knows wot you are  but if somethings not done well have to cut this here part o the country in the very thick o the season when these southern sightseers are ranging about the hills  thats true rejoined the woman seriously  many a penny the bairns get from them an theres no part so good as this  ye couldnt put him out o the way could ye  no said the man doggedly  the woman had accompanied her question with a sidelong glance of fiendish meaning but her eyes at once dropped and she evinced no anger at the sharp decision of her companions reply  mother cried the young woman issuing from the hut at the moment dont you dare to go an tempt him again like that  our hands are black enough already dont you try to make them red else ill blab  the elder woman assumed an injured look as she said who spoke of makin them red  evil dreaders are evil doers  is there no way o puttin a chick out o the way besides murderin him  hush exclaimed the man starting and glancing round with a guilty look as if he fancied the bare mention of the word murder would bring the strong arm of the law down on his head  i wont hush cried the woman  youre cowards both of you  are there no corries in the hills to hide him inno ropes to tie him with that you should find it so difficult to keep a brat quiet for a week or two  a gleam of intelligence shot across the illfavoured face of the gypsy  ha youre a wise woman  come out with your plan and see if im not game to do it  theres no plan worth speakin of rejoined the woman somewhat mollified by her companions complimentary remarks  all youve to do is to go down the road tomorrow catch him and bring him to me  ill see to it that he dont make his voice heard until weve done with this part of the country  then we can slip the knot and let the brat go free  ill do it said the man sitting down on a stone and beginning to fill his pipe  i thought he was dead said the woman  so did i but hes not dead yet an dont look as if hed die soon  maybe said the woman he wont remember ye  its full five year now sin he was took away  wont he retorted the man with an angry look which did not tend to improve his disagreeable visage  hah  i heerd him say hed know me if he saw me in a crowd o ten thousand  i would ha throttled the cub then and there but the place was too public  a short silence ensued during which the gypsies ate their food with the zest of halfstarved wolves  youd better go down and see old moggy suggested the woman when the man had finished his repast and resumed his pipe  if the brat escapes you tomorrow it may be as well to let the old jade know that youll murder both him and her if he dares to blab  the man shook his head  no use said he  but the woman repeated her advice in a tone that was equivalent to a command so the man rose up sulkily and went  he was not a little surprised on drawing near to the hut to find it in a state of bustle and apparently in possession of the sudberrys  not daring to show himself he slunk back to his encampment and informed his female companion of what he had seen  all the more reason to make sure work of him on the road tomorrow said she with a dark frown  so i mean to replied the man doggedly  with these amiable sentiments and intentions animating their breasts this pair crept into their booth and went to rest in the bosom of their family    story one chapter 20  mysterious mattersa happy return etcetera  the morning which followed the events narrated in the last chapter broke with unclouded splendour  it was the second of the four bright days which relieved the monotony of those six dreary weeks of rain  rejoicing in the glorious aspect of earth and sky and in the fresh scents which the rain had called forth from every shrub and flower on the mountains mr sudberry dashed about the white housein and out awaiting the assembling of the family to breakfast with great impatience  his coattails that morning proved the means of annihilating the sugarbasinthe last of the set which had graced the board on his arrival in the highlands and which had been left for some time past blooming alone all its former companions having been shattered and gone long ago  according to custom mr sudberry went forward to the barometrical banjo intending to tap itnot that he expected correct information now  no he had found out its falsehood and was prepared to smile at anything it should say  he opened his eyes however and exclaimed hallo with unwonted energy on observing that as if in sheer defiance of the weather of truth and of public opinion its index aimed pointblank at stormy  he speedily discovered that this tremendous falsehood was the result of a careful intestine examination to which the instrument had been privately subjected by master jacky the evening before in the course of which examination the curious boy standing below the barometer did after much trouble manage to cut the bulb which held the mercury  that volatile metal being set free at once leaped into its liberators bosom and gushed down between his body and his clothes to the floor  ill thrash him to within an inch  mr sudberry clinched his teeth and his fists and burst out of the room it was at this moment that the last of the set became faded and gone and rushed towards the nursery  no i wont he muttered suddenly wheeling round on his heel and returning slowly to the parlour ill say nothing whatever about it  and mr sudberry kept his word jacky never heard of it from that day to this  seizing the opportunity of the fine day mr sudberry and george went out to fish  they fished with worm now the streams being too much swollen for fly  meanwhile master jacky sauntered down alone in a most freeandeasy independent manner to visit old moggy who was thought to be in a dying stateat least the doctor said so and it was to be presumed that he was right  jacky had regularly constituted himself sick nurse to the old woman despite the entreaties of flora and his sister who feared that the disease might be infectious he could not be prevailed on to remain away  his nursing did not indeed consist in doing much that was useful  he confined himself chiefly to playing on the riverbanks near the hut and to making occasional inquiries as to how the patient was getting on  sometimes he also assisted flora in holding sundry cups and glasses and medicine bottles and when flora was away he amused himself by playing practical jokes on the young woman who had volunteered to act as regular nurse to the old invalid  towards the afternoon jacky put his hands behind his backhe would have put them under his coattails if he had had any for he was very oldmannish in his tendenciesand sauntered down the road towards the pass  at this same time it chanced that another little boy more than twice jackys age was walking smartly along the same road towards the same pass from the other side of it  there were as yet several miles between the two boys but the pace at which the elder walked bid fair to bring them face to face within an hour  the boy whom we now introduce was evidently a sailor  he wore blue trousers a blue vest with little brass buttons a blue jacket with bigger brass buttons and a blue cap with a brass button on either sideeach brass button on coat cap and vest having an anchor of apparently burnished gold in the centre of it  he had clear blue eyes brown curly hair and an easy offhand swagger which last was the result of a seafaring life and example but he had a kindly and happy rather than a boastful or selfsatisfied expression of face as he bowled along with his hands in his pockets kicking all the stones out of his way and whistling furiously sometimes he burst into a song and once or twice he laughed smote his thigh and cheered but never for a moment did he slacken his pace although he had walked many a mile that day  curiously enough at this same time a man was crouching behind some bushes in the centre of the pass towards which these two boys were approaching  this man had a pair of grey eyes which might have been beautiful had they not been small and ferociouslooking and a nose which might have been aquiline had the bridge not been broken and a head of shaggy hair which might have been elegant had it been combed oiled curled and dyed and a general appearance which might have been prepossessing had it not been that of a thorough blackguard  this lovely specimen of humanity sat down on a rock and waited and fidgeted and the expression of his sweet face betrayed from time to time that he was impatient and anything but easy in his mind  as jack walked very leisurely and stopped frequently to play his progress towards the pass was slow and as our waiting friend whom the reader no doubt recognises as the gypsy could not see far along the road in that direction he was not aware of his approach  on the other hand the sailorboy came on fast and the road was so open and straight in that direction that the gypsy saw him when he was far enough away to seem like a mere blue spot in the distance  presently he gained the entrance to the pass and began the ascent which was gradual with a riotous windlass song in which the sentiments yo heave and ho were most frequently expressed  as he drew near the gypsy might have been observed to grin a smile that would have been quite captivating but for some obstinate peculiarity about the muscles of the mouth which rendered it very repulsive  next moment the sailorboy was abreast of him  the moment after that the bushes parted and the gypsy confronted his victim cutting a tremendous heave short in the middle and converting the ho that should have followed into a prolonged whistle of astonishment  hah my lad you remember me it seems  remember you  yes i just do answered the boy in whose countenance every trace of boyishness was instantly swallowed up in an intense gaze of manly determination  this mute but meaning glance had such a strange effect upon the gypsy that he actually cowered for a moment and looked as if he were afraid he was going to catch it  however he forced a laugh and said  come billy you neednt look so cross  you know i was hard put to it wen i sent you aboord the fair nancy and you shouldnt ought to owe me a grudge for puttin ye in the way o makin yer fortin  the man kept edging towards the boy as he spoke but the boy observed this and kept edging away regarding the man with compressed lips and dilated eyes but not vouchsafing a word in reply  i say billy its unkind you know to forget old times like this  i want to shake hands and theres my old woman up on the hill as wants to see you again  suddenly the fierce look left the boys face and was replaced by a wild waggish expression  oh your old woman wants to see me does she  and you want to shake hands do you  now look here growler i see through you  you thought to catch a flat and youll find youve caught a tartar or rather that the tartar has caught you  but ive grown merciful since i went to sea the lad tuckedup his wristbands at this point as if he really meditated a handtohand encounter with his huge antagonist  i do remember old times and i know how richly you deserve to be hanged but i dont want to mix up my homecoming if i can help it with dirty work  now ill tell you whatill give you your choice o two courses  either take yourself off and be out o hail of this part of the country within twelve hours or walk with me to the nearest police station and give yourself up  thereill give you exactly two minutes to think over it  the youthful salt here pulled out an enormous doublecase silver watch with an air of perfect nonchalance and awaited the result  for a few seconds the gypsy was overwhelmed by the lads coolness then he burst into a gruff laugh and rushed at him  he might as well have run at a squirrel  the boy sprang to one side crossed the road at a bound and still holding the watch said  half a minute gone  again the man rushed at his small opponent with similar result and a cool remark that another half minute was gone  this so exasperated the gypsy that he ran wildly after the boy for half a minute but the latter was as active as a kitten and could not be caught  times up two minutes and a quarter so dont say that im not merciful  now follow me to the constable  so saying billy as the man had called him turned his back towards the pass and ran off at full speed towards the village  the gypsy followed him at once feeling that his only chance lay in capturing the boy but so artfully did billy hang back and allow his pursuer to come close up that he had almost succeeded in enticing him into the village when the man became suddenly aware of his folly and stopped  billy stopped too  what youre not game to come on  the man shook his fist and turning his face towards the pass ran back towards his booth in the hills intending to take the boys first piece of advice and quit that part of the country  but billy had no idea of letting him off thus  he now became the pursuer  however fast the gypsy ran the sailorlad kept up with him  if the man halted as he frequently did in a breathless condition and tried to gain over his adversary billy also stopped said he was in no hurry thrust his hands into his jacket pockets and began to whistle  thus he kept him in view until they once more stood in the pass  here the man sat down on a large stone thoroughly exhausted  the boy sat down on another stone opposite to him looking quite fresh and jolly  five years of hearty devotion to a noble calling had prepared the muscles of the little sailor for that days exercise  the same number of years spent in debauchery and crime had not prepared the vagabond giant for that days work  what has brought you back said growler savagely  to see the old granny whom you stole me from replied the boy  also to have the satisfaction of puttin you in limbo although i did not expect to have this pleasure  ha ha laughed growler sarcastically youll fail in both  its not so easy to put me in limbo as you thinkand your grandmother is dyin  thats false cried billy springing half way across the road and shaking his little fist at his enemyyou know it is  the landlord of the blue boar told me he saw her at church strong and well last sunday  shes dyin however may be dead said the man with a sneer so full of triumph that it struck a chill to the heart of the poor boy  just at that moment jacky sudberry turned slowly round a sharp angle of the road and stood there transfixed with his eyes like two saucers and his mouth as round as an o  the sight of this intruder distracted billys attention for a moment growler at once bounded over the low wall and dived into the underwood billy hesitated to follow him for the last piece of information weighed heavily on his mind  that moments hesitation was sufficient for the gypsy to make good his retreat  although billy leaped the wall the next moment and darted hither and thither through the copse he failed to catch sight of him again and finally returned to the road where he found jacky seated on a stone pondering in a state of bewilderment on what he had seen  well my boy how goes it cried the sailor heartily as he came forward wiping his heated brow with a blue spotted cotton handkerchief  all right was jackys prompt reply  i say was you fightin with that man  ay that was i and ive not done with him yet  jacky breathed hard and looked upon the young sailorlad with a deep reverential awe feeling that he was in the presence of a real jack the giantkiller  he runnd away said jacky in amazement  did you hit him hard  not with my fists they aint big enough for that yet  weve only had a sparringmatch with words and legs  jacky glanced at billys legs as if he regarded them in the light of dire engines of destruction  indeed his active mind jumped at once to the conclusion that the sailors must be a kicking mode of warfare but he was too much amazed to make any rejoinder  now my boy im going this way so ill bid you goodday said billy jacky informed him that he was going the same wayhaving only been taking a strolland would willingly go back whereupon billy put his arm round his shoulder as boys are wont to do and jacky grasped billy round the waist and thus they wandered home together  i say youre a funny chap observed the young sailor in a comic vein as they went along  so are you replied jacky with intense gravity being deeply serious  billy laughed but as the two friends at that moment emerged from the pass and came in sight of the white house the laugh was suddenly checked and was followed by a sound that was not unlike choking  jacky looked up in alarm and was surprised to see tears hopping over his companions brown cheeks  to find a lad who could put a giant to flight was wonderful enough but to find one who could cry without any reason at all was beyond belief  jacky looked perplexed and said i say whats the matter  oh nothing only this is my old home and my scrimmage with that villain has made me come plump on it without thinkin  i was born here i know every stone and bush  iitheres the old  he choked again at this point and jacky whose mind was only opening stood looking on in silent wonder  my old granny lives here old moggy  the expression of jackys face caused billy to stop  why whats wrong boy  isisoold moggy your granny cried jacky eagerly stumbling over his words as if he had come upon steppingstones in the dark  ay what then  eh  i know her  do you my boy  yeyes shshes dyin  the result of this remark was that the sailorboy turned deadly pale and stared at his little friend without being able to utter a word mere human nature taught jacky that he had made a mistake in being so precipitate but home education had not taught him to consider the feelings of others  he felt inclined to comfort his new friend but knew not how to do it  at last a happy thought occurred to him and he exclaimed eagerly  bbut shshes not dead yet  does she live in the same cottage asked the boy in a low husky voice not considering that his companion could not know what cottage she had occupied in former days  jacky also ignoring this fact nodded his head violently being past speech with excitement and pointed in the direction of the hut  without another word billy more correctly speaking willie at once took to his heels and was followed by jacky as fast as his short legs could carry him  flora macdonald was administering a glass of hot wine and water to her patient when the door was quickly yet gently opened and a sailorlad sprang into the room fell on his knees beside the lowly couch seized the old womans hand gazed for a few seconds into her withered face and then murmuring granny its me laid his head on her shoulder and burst into tears  flora gently drew the boy away  willie is it possible can it be you  is she dyin said willie looking up in floras face with an expression of agony  i trust not dear boy but the doctor says she is very ill and must be kept quiet  hoot awa wi the doctor  hes wrang cried old moggy suddenly raising herself with great energy on one elbow dont i see my ain willie there as ive seen him in my dreams mony and mony a night flora grasped willies arm to prevent his running towards her and pointed to jacky who had at that moment entered the room and was at once recognised by moggy ay little did i think when i said yestreen thy wull be done that he wad send my ain laddie back again  she folded jacky who had gone to the bedside in her arms and was with difficulty prevailed on to let him go  it was quite evident that her mind was wandering  the effect of this little episode on willie was powerful and twofold  a pang of jealousy at first shot through his heart like a flash of lightning but when he perceived that the loving embrace was meant for his old self he broke down and the tears once more tumbled over his brown cheeks  she cannot recognise you just now dear willie said flora deeply touched by the sorrow of the lad and even if she could i fear it would do her harm by exciting her too much  come my poor fellow leading him softly to the door i am just going up to visit a kind english family where they will be only too glad to put you up until it is safe to let her know that you have returned  but she may die and never know that i have returned said willie almost passionately as he hung back  she is in gods loving hands willie  can i not stay and help you to nurse her asked the boy in pitiful tones  flora shook her head and willie meekly suffered himself to be led out of the hut  this then was the homecoming that he had longed for so intensely that he had dreamed of so often when far away upon the sea  no sooner was he in the open air than he burst away from flora without a word and ran off at full speed in the direction of the pass  at first he simply sought to obtain relief to his feelings by means of violent muscular exercise  the burning brain and throbbing heart were unbearable  he would have given the world for the tears that flowed so easily a short time before but they would not now come  running leaping bounding madly over the rough hillsidethat gave him some relief so he held on through bush and brake over heathery knoll and peat swamp until the hut was far behind him  suddenly his encounter with the gypsy occurred to him  the thought that he was the original cause of all this misery roused a torrent of indignation within him and he resolved that the man should not escape his wild race was no longer without purpose now  he no longer sprang into the air and bounded from rock to rock like a wild goat but coursing down the bed of a mountaintorrent came out upon the road and did not halt until he was in front of the constabulary station  hallo laddie whats wrang inquired a bluecoated official whose language betokened him a lowland scot  ive seen him come with mequick  ill take you to his whereabouts gasped willie  seen whae inquired the man with slow deliberation  the gypsy growler who stole me and would have murdered me this morning if he could have caught me but quick please  hell get off if you dont look alive  the earnestness and fervour of the lad had the effect of exciting even the constables phlegmatic nature so after a short conversation he summoned a comrade and set off for the pass at a round trot led by willie  dye think its likely hell ken yeve come here to tell on him inquired the constable as they ran  i said i would have him nabbed replied the boy  hoot mon that was na wiselike  but after a yere ony a bairn here tam yed better gang up by the stank burn an keep a lookoot ower the hills an ill start him  thus advised the second constable diverged to the right and plunging into the copsewood was instantly out of sight  soon afterwards willie came to the place where he had met the gypsy here a consultation was held as to where the booth might probably be  he jumped over the wall here said willie and im sure he took the hill in this direction at first  ay laddie but chiels o his stamp never gang straight to their mark well follow him up this way  hoe long ist sin ye perted wi him said ee examining the place where the gypsy had entered the copse  willie returned no answer  the unusual amount of fatigue and the terrible mental excitement which he had undergone that day were too much for him  a feeling of deadly sickness came suddenly on him and when the constable looked round he was lying on the road in a swoon  this unexpected incident compelled the man to abandon further pursuit for the time  giving utterance to a puir laddie he raised the boy in his arms and carried him to the nearest hut which happened to be that of old moggy  no one was there but the young woman who acted as nurse to the invalid  it chanced that moggy had had a sleep and she awoke with her mental faculties much cleared when the constable entered and laid willie on a mat not far from her bed  the old woman gazed long and earnestly in the boys face and seemed much troubled and perplexed while the nurse applied water to his temples  at last willie opened his eyes  moggy at once recognised him she strove eagerly to reach her longlost child and willie jumping up sprang to her side but ere they met she raised both arms in the air and uttering a long piercing cry fell back insensible upon the bed    story one chapter 21  the end  rain rain rain continual pertinacious unmitigated rain  the white house was no longer white it was grey  things were no longer damp they were totally flooded  mr mcallisters principal hayfield was a pondevery ditch was a rivulet the burn was a destructive cataract the white torrents that raged down the mountains everywhere far and near looked like veins of quartz and the river had become a lake with a strong current in the middle of it  there was no sunshine now in the highlandsnot a gleam  nevertheless there was sunshine in the hearts of some who sojourned there  mr sudberry had found out that he could fish just as well in wet weather as in dry and that the fish were more eager to be caught that was sunshine enough for him  lucy found a new and engrossing amusement of a semiscientific kind in laying down and pressing her botanical specimens and writing latin names under the same being advised thereto and superintended by hector macdonald  that was sunshine enough for her and for him too apparently for he came every day to help her and she declared she could not get on without help and it was quite wonderful to observe how very slowly the layingdown progressed although both of the semiphilosophers were intensely interested in their work  flora was so sunny by nature that she lightened up the place around her wherever she went she was thus in some measure independent of the sun  george was heard to say more than once that her face was as good as a sunbeam any day  mrs sudberry poor woman was so rampantly triumphant in the total discomfiture of her husband touching the weather that she resigned herself to highland miseries in a species of happy contentment and thus lived in what may be likened to a species of mild moonshine of her own  tilly poor delicate unobtrusive tilly was at all times satisfied to bask in the moonlight of her mothers countenance  as for jackythat archimp discovered that wet weather usually brought his victims within doors and therefore kept them constantly within reach of his dreadful influence  he was supremely happydarling child  fred finished up his sketchesneed we say that that was sunshine to him  the servants too shared in the general felicity  indeed they may in a sense be said to have been happier than those they served for having been transported to that region to work they found the little bits of fun and amusement that fell to their lot all the more pleasant and enjoyable that they were unexpected and formed a piquant contrast to the monotonous routine of daily duty  but the brightest blaze of internal sunshinethe most effulgent and dazzling beams of light were shed forth in the lowly hut of jackys particular friend  old moggy did not die after all  to the total discomfiture of the parish doctor and to the reflected discredit of the medical profession generally that obstinate old creature got well in spite of the emphatic assurances of her medical adviser that recovery was impossible  the doctor happened to be a misanthrope  he was not aware that in the materia medica of natures laboratory there is a substance called joy which sometimes effects a cure when all else failsor if he did know of this medicine he probably regarded it as a quack nostrum  at all events this substance cured old moggy as willie said in less than no time  she took such deep draughts of it that she quite surprised her old friends  so did willie himself  in fact these two absolutely took to tippling together on this medicine  more than that jacky joined them and seemed to imbibe a good dealchiefly through his eyes which were always very wide open and watchful when he was in the old hut  he drank to them only with his eyes and ears and could not be induced to enter into conversation much farther than to the extent of yes and no  not that he was shyby no means  the truth was that jacky was being opened upmentally  the new medicine was exercising an unconscious but powerful influence on his sagacious spirit  in addition to that he was fascinated by williefor the matter of that so was old moggyfor did not that small sailorboy sing and laugh and talk to them for hours about sights and scenes of foreign travel of which neither of them had dreamed before  of course he did and caused both of them to stare with eyes and mouths quite motionless for halfhours at a time and then roused them up with a joke that made jacky laugh till he cried and made moggy who was always crying more or less laugh till she couldnt cry  yes there was very brilliant sunshine in the hut during that dismal season of rainthere was the sunshine of human love and sympathy and flora was the means of introducing and mingling with it sunshine of a still brighter and a holier nature which while it intensified the other rendered it also permanent  at last the end of the sudberrys rustication arrived the last day of their sojourn dawned  it happened to be bright and beautifulso bright and lovely that it made one feel as if there never had been a bad day since the world began and never would be another bad one to the end of time  it was the fourth fine day of the six dreary weeksthe third which occurred some days before was only halfandhalf and therefore unworthy of special notice  nevertheless the sudberrys felt sad  they were going away  the mental sunshine of the rainy season was beclouded and the physical sunshine was of no avail to dispel such clouds  my dear said mr sudberry at breakfast that morning in a very sad tone have you any further use for me  my dear no replied his partner sorrowfully  from the nature of these remarks and the tone in which they were uttered an ignorant spectator might have imagined that mr sudberry having suspected his wife of growing indifference and having had his worst fears confirmed from her own lips meant to go quietly away to the river and drown him in a deep pool with a strong eddy so that he might run no chance of being prematurely washed upon a shallow  but the good man merely referred to the packing in connection with which he had been his wifes right hand during the last three or four days  well then my love as the heavy baggage has gone on before and we are ready to start with the coach which does not pass until the afternoon i will go and take a last cast in the river  mrs sudberry made no objection so mr sudberry accompanied by george and fred went down to the dear old river as they styled it for the last time  now it must be known that some weeks previous to this time hobbs had been allowed by his master to go out for a days troutfishing and hobbs failing to raise a single fin put on a salmon fly in reckless desperation  he happened by the merest chance to cast over a deep pool in which salmon were and still are wont to lie  to his amazement a whale as he styled it instantly rose sent its silvery body half out of the water and fell over with a tremendous splash but missed the fly  hobbs was instantly affected with temporary insanity  he cast in violent haste over the same spot as if he hoped to hook the fish by the tail before it should get to the bottom  again again and over again but without result  then dancing on the bank with excitement he changed the fly tried every fly in the book the insanity increasing tried two flies at once back to back put on a bunch of troutflies in addition wound several worms round all failed in every attempt to cast with care and finished off by breaking the top of the rod entangling the line round his legs and fixing the hooks in his coattails after which he rushed wildly up to the white house to tell what he had seen and show what he had done  from that day forward mr sudberry always commenced his days sport at the salmon pool  as usual on this his last day he went down to the salmon pool but he had so often fished there in vain that hope was wellnigh extinguished in addition to this his spirits were depressed so he gave the rod to fred  fred was not naturally a fisher and he only agreed to take the rod because he saw that his father was indifferent about it  fred my boy cast a little farther over just below yon curl in the water near the willow bushah thats about the place  hobbs declares that he raised a salmon there but i cant say ive ever seen one myself though i have fished here every other morning for many weeks  mr sudberry had not quite finished speaking when freds rod was bent into the form of a large hoop  hallo here father take iti dont know what to do  what a blaze of excitement beamed on the fathers countenance  hurrah hold on fredno no no ease offhell break all away  the caution was just in time  fred was holding on like a true briton he suddenly let the rod down and allowed the line to run out which it did like lightning  what now father  oh do take iti shall certainly lose the fish  no no boy it is your fish try to play it out  no one but the good man himself knew what a tremendous effort of selfdenial mr sudberry made on this occasion  but fred felt certain that the fish would get off  he also knew that his father would give fifty pounds down on the spot to land a salmon so he said firmly father if you dont take the rod ill throw it down  this settled the question  father took the rod under protest and having had considerable experience in troutfishing began to play the salmon with really creditable skill considering the difficulty of the operation and the fact that it was his first big fish  what varied expression flitted across the countenance of the enthusiastic sportsman on this great occasion  he totally forgot himself and his sons he forgot even that this was his last day in the highlands  it is an open question whether he did not forget altogether that he was in the highlands so absorbed so intensely concentrated was his mind on that salmon  george and fred also became so excited that they lost all command of themselves and kept leaping about cheering giving useless advice in eager tones tripping over stones and uneven places on the banks and following their father closely as the fish led him up and down the river for full two hours  they too forgot themselves they did not know what extraordinary faces they went on making during the greater part of the time  mr sudberry began the battle by winding up the line the salmon having begun to push slowly up stream after its first wild burst  in a moment it made a dart towards the opposite bank so sudden and swift that the rod was pulled straight and the line ran out with a whiz of the most violent description  almost simultaneously with the whiz the salmon leaped its entire length out of the water gave a tremendous fling in the air and came down with a heavy splash  fred gasped george cheered and mr sudberry uttered a roar of astonishment mingled with alarm for the line was slack and he thought the fish had broken off  it was still on however as a wild dash down stream followed by a spurt up and across with another fling into the air proved beyond a doubt  the fish was very wildfortunately it was well hooked and the tackle was strong  what with excitement and the violent action that ensued at each rush mr sudberry was so dreadfully blown in the first minutes that he trembled from head to foot and could scarce wind up the line  for one moment the thought occurred that he was too old to become a salmonfisher and that he would not be able to fight the battle out  he was quite mistaken  every minute after this he seemed to gain fresh strength  the salmon happily took it into his head to cease its antics for half a minute just when the fisher was at his worst  that halfminute of breathingspace was all that was wanted  geogehahcutwata  george could not make out what his agitated parent wanted  water waterchokin reiterated his father  oh all right  george scooped up a quantity of water in a leathern cup and ran with it to his choking sire who holding the rod tight with both hands turned his head aside and stretched over his left arm still however keeping his eyes fixed on the line  here up witht lips  the lips were projected and george raised the cup to them but the salmon moved at the moment and the draught was postponed  the fish came to another pause soon after  now geoge try gain  once more the lips were projected once again the cup was raised but that salmon seemed to know what was going on for just as the cup and the lips met it went off in an unusually fierce run down the river the cup and its contents were knocked into georges face and george himself was knocked over by his father as he sprang down the bank and ran along a dry patch of gravel which extended to the tail of the pool  hitherto the battle had been fought within the limits of one large pool which the fish seemed to have an objection to quit  it now changed its tactics and began to descend the river tail foremost slowly but steadily  the round face of the fisher which had all this time been blazing red with eager hope was now beclouded with a shade of anxiety  dont let him go down the rapids father said george youll never get past the thick bushes that overhang the bank  mr sudberry stopped and held on till the rod bent like a giant hoop and the line became rigid but the fish was not to be checked  its retrograde movement was slow but steady and irresistible  youll smash everything cried fred  mr sudberry was constrained to follow step by step  the head of the rapid was gained and he had to increase the pace to a quick walk still farther down and the walk became a smart run  the ground here was more rugged and the fishers actions became quite acrobatic  george and fred kept higher up the bank and ran along gazing in unspeakable amazement at the bounds and leaps which their fat little sire made with the agility of a roe deer  hold on the bushes let it break off  mr sudberry scorned the advice  the part of the bank before him was impassable not so the river which rushed past him like a millrace he tried once more to stop the fish failed of course and deliberately walked into the water  it was waistdeep so he was carried down like a cork with his toes touching the ground so lightly that for the first time in his life he rejoiced in those sensations which he had hitherto believed belonged exclusively to harlequins and columbines namely swift motion without effort  fifty yards at the rate of ten miles an hour brought him to an eddy into which the salmon had dashed just before him  mr sudberry gave vent to another roar as he beheld the fish almost under his nose  the startled creature at once flashed out of his sight and swept up down and across the stream several times besides throwing one or two somersaults in the air before it recovered its equanimity  after this it bolted into a deep dark pool and remained there quite motionless  mr sudberry was much puzzled at this point  to let out line when the fish ran up or across stream to wind in when the fish stopped and to follow when the fish went down streamthese principles he had been taught by experience in troutfishing but how to act when a fish would not move and could not be made to move was a lesson which he had yet to learn  whats to be done said he with a look of exasperation and no wonder he had experienced an hour and a quarter of very rough treatment and was getting fagged  pull him out of that hole suggested george  i cant  try  mr sudberry tried and failed  having failed he sat down on a stone still holding the rod very tight and wiped his heated brow  then starting up he tried for the next ten minutes to pull the fish out of the hole by main force of course never venturing to pull so hard as to break the line  he went up the stream and pulled down the stream and pulled he even waded across the stream at a shallow part and pulled but all in vain  the fish was in that condition which fishers term the sulks  at last fred recollected to have heard hector macdonald say that in such cases a stone thrown into the pool sometimes had the effect of starting the sulky one  accordingly a stone was thrown in and the result was that the fish came out at full speed in a horrible fright and went down stream not tail but head foremost  now when a salmon does this he knows by instinct that if he does not go down faster than the stream the water will force itself into his gills and drown him therefore when he goes down head first which he seldom does except when on his way to the sea he goes at full speed and the fishers only chance of saving his fish is to run after him as fast as he can in the hope that he may pause of his own accord in some opportune eddy  a fine open space of bank enabled mr sudberry to run like a deer after his fish for nigh a quarter of a mile but at the end of this burst he drew near to the fallsa succession of small cataracts and rapids which it seemed impossible for any fisher to go down without breaking his neck and losing his fish  george and fred roared hold on  mr sudberry glanced at the falls frowned and compressed his lips  he felt that he was in for it he resolved not to be beat so on he went the fish went right down the first fall the fisher leaped over a ledge of rock three feet high scrambled across some rough ground and pulled up at an eddy where the fish seemed disposed to rest  he was gratified here by seeing the fish turn up the white of his sidethus showing symptoms of exhaustion  but he recovered and went over another fall  here he stopped again and george and fred feeling convinced that their father had gone mad threw off their coats and ran to the foot of the fall ready to plunge into the stream and rescue him from the fate which they thought they saw impending  no such fate awaited the daring man he succeeded in drawing the fish close to a gravelly shallow where it gave an exhausted wallop or two and lay over on its side  george came up and leaping into the water tried to kick it out  he missed his kick and fell  fred dashed in and also missed  mr sudberry rushed forward and gave the salmon such a kick that he sent it high and dry on the bank  but in doing so he fell over george and tripped up fred so that all three were instantly soaked to the skin and returned to the bank without their hats  mr sudberry flung himself on the conquered fish and held it fast while george and fred cheered and danced round him in triumphant joy  thus mr sudberry landed his first and last salmona tenpounderand thus brilliantly terminated his threemonths rustication in the highlands    but this was not the end of the whole affairby no means  mr sudberry and family returned to london and they took that salmon with them  a dinnerparty of choice friends was hastily got up to do honour to the superb fish and on that occasion fred and his father wellnigh quarrelled on the point of who caught the salmon  mr sudberry insisting that the man who hooked the fish was the real catcher of it and fred scouting the ridiculous notion and asserting that he who played and landed it was entitled to all the honour  the point was settled however in some incomprehensible way without the selfdenying disputants coming to blows and everyone agreed that it was out of sight the best salmon that had ever been eaten in london  certainly it was one of the merriest parties that ever ate a salmon for mr sudberrys choice friends were of an uncommonly genial stamp  jones the head clerk the man with the red nose and humble aspect was there and so brilliant was mr sudberry that jones was observed to smilethe first instance on record of his having given way to levity of demeanour  lady knownothing was there too and before the evening was over she knew a few things that surprised but did not in the least convince her  oh no she knew everything so thoroughly that there was no possibility on earth of increasing her stock of knowledge  truly it was a happy party and mr sudberry enjoyed himself so much that he volunteered the highland fling in the drawingroomgeorge whistling the musicon which occasion he mr sudberry swept nearly half the teaservice off the table with his coattails and mrs sudberry was so happy that she didnt care a buttonand said so  but this was not the end of it yet by any means  that winter hector and flora macdonald visited london and were received by the sudberrys with open arms  the result was that lucy became intensely botanical in her tastes and routed out the old plants  of course hector could not do less than assist her and the finale was that these two scientific individuals were married and dwelt for many years thereafter in the highlands  strange to say george and flora fell in love with eachbut why say more  we do not mean to write the history of these two families  it is enough to say that every summer for many years after that the sudberrys spent two or three months in the highlands with the macdonalds and every winter the macdonalds spent a similar period with the sudberrys  on the former of these occasions fred renewed his intercourse with mr mcallister and these two became so profoundly inconceivably deep and metaphysical besides theological in their converse that they were utterly incomprehensible to everyone except themselves  best of all jacky became a good boy  yes that day on the hills with peter was the beginning of itold moggy willie and flora were the continuation of itand jacky became good to the unspeakable joy of his mother  old moggy lived to a fabulous age and became at last as wrinkled as a red herring  for all we know to the contrary she may be alive yet willie lived with her and became a cultivator of the soil  but why go on  enough has been said to show that no ill befell any individual mentioned in our tale  even mrs brown lived to a good old age and was a female dragon to the last  enough has also been said to prove that as the old song has it we little know what great things from little things may rise    story two chapter 1  why i did not become a sailor  there is mystery connected with the incidents which i am about to relate  looked at from one point of view the whole affair is mysteriouseminently so yet regarded from another point of view it is not so mysterious as it seems  whatever my reader may think about it as he goes along i entreat him to suspend his judgment until he has reached the conclusion of my narrative  my only reason for bringing this mysterious matter before the public is that in addition to filling me with unutterable surprise it had the effect of quenching one of my strongest desires and effectually prevented my becoming a sailor  this i freely admit is not in itself a sufficient reason to justify my rushing into print  but when i regard the matter from what may be termed a negative point of view i do feel that it is not absolutely presumptuous in me to claim public attention  suppose that sir john franklin had never gone to sea what a life of adventure and discovery would have been lost to the world what deeds of heroism undone and therefore untold  i venture to think that if that great navigator had not gone to sea it would have been a matter of interest knowing what we now know to have been told that such was the case  in this view of the matter i repeat it as being of possible future interest that the incident i am about to relate prevented my becoming a sailor  i am said to be a soft boythat is to say i was said to be soft im a man now but of course i was a boy once  i merely mention this to prove that i make no pretension whatever to unusual wisdom quite the reverse  i hate sailing under false coloursnot that i ever did sail under any colours never having become a sailorand yet i shouldnt say that either for thats the very point round which all the mystery hangs  i did go to sea  im rather apt to wander i find from my point and to confuse my own mind i trust not the readers  perhaps the shortest way to let you understand how it was is to tell you all about it  my name is robert smithnot an unusual name i am given to understand it was of little use to me during the period of my boyhood for i never got any other name than bobsometimes soft was added  i had a father  he loved me  as a natural consequence i loved him  he was old partially bald silverhaired kind affectionate good five feet six and wore spectacles  i at the time i write of was young stout wellgrown active and had a long nosemuch too long a nose it was the only point in regard to which i was sensitive  it was owing to the length of this member i believe that i once went by the name of mozambique  you see i conceal nothing  the remarkablethe mysteriousthe every way astonishing incidents i am about to relate require that i should be more than usually careful and particular in stating things precisely as i saw them and understood them at the time  in this view of the matter i should remark that the softness with which i was charged did not refer to my musclesthey were hard and well developedbut to my intellect  i take this opportunity of stating that i think the charge unjust  but to conclude my description of myself i am romantic  one of my dearest companions used to say that my nose was the same minus the tic  what he meant by that i never could make out i doubt if he himself knew  my chief delight in my leisure hours was to retire to my bedroom and immerse myself in books of travel and adventure  this was my mania  no one can conceive the delight i experienced in following heroes of every name over the pathless deep and through the trackless forests of every clime  my heart swelled within me and the blood rushed through my veins like liquid fire as i read of chasing lions tigers elephants in africa white bears and walrus in the polar regions and deer and bisons on the american prairies  i struggled long to suppress the flame that consumed me but i could not  it grew hotter and hotter  at last it burst forthand this brings me to the point  i thoughtone dark dismal night in the middle of novemberi thought mind i dont say i determined no but i thought of running away from home and going to sea  i confess it with shame  the image of my dear father rose before me with a kind and sorrowful look  i repented started to my feet and seized the book i was reading with the intention of tossing it into the fire  in doing so i accidentally turned over a leaf  there was an illustration on the page  i looked at it  an african savage firing the whole contents of a sixbarrelled revolver down the throat of a bengal tiger without apparently doing it any harm  i thought not of the incongruous combination  my soul was fired anew  once again i thought of running away from home and going to seanot by any means with the intention of remaining at sea but for the purpose of reaching foreign if possibleunknown lands  having conceived the thought i rose calmly shut the book carefully but with decision thrust my hands firmly into my pockets knitted my brows and went out in search of my bosom friend john brownalso a commonplace name i believeat least so it is said  jack as i used to call him had a mother but no fatherhis father died when jack was an infant  ive often fancied that there was a delicate bond of union between us here  he had a mother but no father i had a father but no mother  strange coincidence  i think the fact helped to draw us together  i may be wrong but i think so  jack was on a visit to us at the time so i had only to cross the passage to reach his room  come in he cried as i knocked  jack come to my room  its more comfortable than yours  i want your advice  he rose in some surprise and followed me  if john browns name was commonplace his person was certainly not so he looked like a young lord  he was a noble fellow by nature if not by birth  a clear sunny face masculine chin and nose sweet firm mouth the eye of an eagle and the soft curly golden hair of a child  tall broadshouldered elegant bold as a lion gentle and kind as a lamb such was my best my dearest friend jack  jack said i im going to run away  my friend fell into a chair put both legs straight out and looked at me in speechless amazement for a second then he burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter  jack i repeated im going to run away  youll do nothing of the sort said he  and i continued regardless of his remark i mean that you shall run away with me  ill do nothing of the sort he replied  but come bob my boy youre joking  surely this is not the object for which you called me out of my room  indeed it is  listen to me jack  i looked at him impressively  he returned the look for jack was earnest as well as gay you know that my dear father positively refused to let me go abroad although i have entreated him to do so again and again  now i think thats hard you know  i love my dear father very much but  you love yourself better  is that it  well put it so if you choose  i dont care  im going to run away and if you wont go with me you can stay at homethats all  come come bob dont be cross said jack kindly you know you dont mean it  but i do and im sure i dont see what it is that prevents you from going too said i testily  hm well there is a small matter a sort of moral idea so to speak that prevents  and what is that  respect for my mother  bob my boy ive been too deeply imbued with that in my babyhood to shake it off now even if i wished to do so but i dont bob i dont  im proud of my mother and moreover i remember her teachings  theres one little verse i used to repeat to her every sunday night along with the rest of the ten commandments honour thy father and thy mother etcetera  it seems to me that running away is rather flying in the face of that  doesnt it strike you in that light bob  i was silent  i felt that i had no argument against such reasoning jack rose  its late bob we are to start on our fishing expedition tomorrow morning at six so it behoves us to get into bed  goodnight and think over it  i seized his hand and pressed it warmly  goodnight jack i will    story two chapter 2  my bedroom was a small one with little furniture in it  a small iron stove in the fireplace acted instead of a grate and as i was accustomed to read late my father allowed me to light it in cold weather  it was blazing cheerfully when jack left me and the bright gleams of ruddy light that darted through the chinks of the door and fell on the opposite wall threw the light of my solitary candle quite into the shade  i have already remarked that the night was dark and dismal  in addition to that it was stormy  the wind moaned drearily among the venerable elms that surrounded our quiet country residence and ever and anon came in sharp fitful gusts that caused the windowframes to rattle and even shook the house at times to its foundation  heavy drops of rain fell occasionally on the windowpanes and in a few minutes the storm broke forth in full violence  as the old house had stood many such in years gone by i did not give myself much concern about the gale but pulled down the blind placed my little table and books near the stove and drawing in my chair sat down to think  how long i remained in this condition i cannot tell but my reveries were broken by the large clock on the stairs striking twelve  i started up and clinching my hands exclaimed aloud no  ive made up my mind i wont run away  under the impulse of the feeling i threw open the door of the stove and heaped on fresh coals muttering to myself as i did so no i wont run away i wont run away no no no i wont run a  i was checked suddenly by my eye falling a second time on that terrific african savage sending from his revolver a charge down the throat of that magnificent bengal tiger that would have blown the inside entirely out of any living creature smaller than an elephant  i sat down  i gazed at the picture  i read the account  i followed up the adventurous savage  my head reeled with excitement  a strange terrible heat seemed to dart like lightning through my veins and the book began to flicker before my eyes  i became alarmed  surely some terrible fever is seizing on me  i exclaimed and in the terror of the thought i started up and paced my room rapidly  but the fire increased and my head swam  i meditated ringing the bell and alarming the household but the thought of this quieted me and gradually i became calmer  it was at this moment that my former resolution returned upon me with tenfold violence  ill submit to this no longer i growled between my teeth i will run away  the instant i said that i felt as if i were imbued with a determination that nothing could shake  jacks reasoning never once came into my mind  i took down the knapsack that hung on a nail ready packed for the intended fishing expedition of the morrow  i buckled it on put on my thickest shoes and seizing a stout cudgel issued softly from my apartment and tapped gently at jacks door  come in  i entered and was overwhelmed with surprise at finding my friend standing in the middle of the room accoutred for the road just like myself  he put his finger to his lips  hush  bob  i was on the point of going to your room to say that ive made up my mind to run away with you  i was staggered  i did not relish this unaccountable change  if i had persuaded him to go it would have been all right but to find him thus ready and eager was unnatural  i felt as if i were accountable for this change in his opinions and actions and immediately strange to say experienced a tendency to dissuade him  but jack you forget what you said to me some hours ago  no i dont he answered gloomily  perhaps wed better think over it again  no we wont  come bob dont show the white feather now  dont waste time  its about dawn  its too late to reason  you have tempted me and i have given in  saying this he seized me by the collar and pushed me before him  and now the mysterious events which i am about to relate began  the conduct of my friend jack on this occasion was in itself a mystery  he was by nature the gentlest and most inoffensive of human beings except when circumstances required him to act vigorously then he was a lion irresistible  since the commencement of our acquaintance which was of many years standing he had never by word or look given me the slightest cause for anger and yet here he was grasping me violently by the collar and pushing me forcibly before him  i did not get angry  my conscience smote me  i said to myself ah this is the result of evil conduct  i have tempted jack to act against his judgment he is no longer what he was  instead of melting under this feeling i became hardened  i stepped out and so dragged my friend after me down the back stairs which led to the lower part of the house where the servants slept  jack whispered all right and let go his hold  now we must be cautious i said in a low tone as we proceeded to traverse the passage on each side of which were the rooms occupied by the servants  we took off our shoes and advanced on tiptoe  at the far end of the passage we heard a sound like a trombone  that was the butler we knew of his snoring propensities and so were not alarmed his door was open so was his mouthi could see that plainly as i passed by the dim light of a candle which he always burned at night the butler was excessively fat  i merely mention this because it accounts for the fact of his not awaking when we unlocked the street door  fat people are not easily wakened  the lock of the door was an oldfashioned large one  it grated slightly as jack turned the key then at a certain point the key lost control over it and it shot back with a report like a pistolshot  my heart flew to my mouth and almost choked me  the butler gave a double snort and turned in his bed as jack and i darted round an angle of the wall and hid in a dark corner  the butler soon gave unquestionable evidence that he had not been thoroughly aroused and we were about to issue from our place of concealment when the door of our manservants room opened and he peeped out  edwardsthat was his namewas a stout young fellow and we felt certain that he would not rest satisfied until he had found out the cause of the noise  we were right  he stepped cautiously into the passage with a poker in his hand  my heart sank within me  just at that moment a cat darted across the passage with its back and tail up and its eyes glaring edwards flung the poker at it missed the cat and knocked over an old tin umbrellastand with which the poker made a hideous clatter on the stone floor of the passage  ha you brute  wot its you as is makin all that row is it  oh dear edwards whats happened cried a shrill voice from the other end of the passageit was cook  oh nothin only the cat replied the man as he sauntered into the butlers room  the butler seemed at that moment to have been smitten with a fit of apoplexywe could see him from our dark cornerhe grew purple in the face gasped once or twice choked awfully and then sat up in bed staring like a maniac  oh  jack i whispered in horror  dont be alarmed its only his usual way of waking up  ive seen him do it often  what noise is that  whats going on down there cried a deep bass voice in the distance  it was my father  no one replied  presently my fathers bedroom bell rang with extreme violence  edwards rushed out of the butlers room  the butler fell back opened his mouth and pretended to be asleepsnoring moderately  this of itself would have undeceived any one for when the old hypocrite was really asleep he never snored moderately  the cook and housemaid uttered two little shrieks and slammed their respective doors while the bell rang violently a second time  now for it whispered jack  he opened the back door softly and we darted out  a streak of pale light on the horizon indicated the approach of day  we tried to close the door behind us but we heard the butler choke gasp and shout at the top of his voice hi hallo  at the same instant the old dinnergong sent a peal of horrible sound through the house and we took to flight filled with unutterable terror  oh how we did run  we had scarcely cleared the offices and got fairly into the avenue when we heard edwards shout as he started in pursuit  we were both good runners but jack soon took the lead and kept it by about five yards  our feet scarcely touched the ground  i felt as if i had wings so great was my terror  we reached the end of the avenue the gate was full five feet high  to my inexpressible amazement jack went clear over it with one bound  i have never been able to analyse my feelings and impulses on that occasion  i am and always was rather a poor jumper yet without hesitation without even a doubt as to my ability to clear it i went at that gate like an irish hunter at a stone wall and leaped fairly over it  the leap did not even check my pace for an instant  i remember in the whirl and confusion of the moment that i attributed my almost superhuman powers to terror but the feeling that we were pursued again absorbed all my faculties  we dashed on at a killing pace and strange to say without feeling the slightest fatigue  having cleared the avenue we mounted the high ground in the neighbourhood passed the church entered the village and went through it like a railway train came out upon the road beyond and reached a wooded part of the country where several roads and bypaths diverged from the highway  all this time edwards kept close on our heels  he did not gain on us but we felt that we did not distance him down here cried jack doubling suddenly into a lane  we passed a small bridge that crossed a milllake  beyond there was a farmyard  the pathway was high and we could look down on the tops of the stacks  one of these a haystack stood about ten feet from the low wall that skirted the road  it had been half pulled down and the hay was loose  without a word or warning jack sprang completely across this space turned right over and plunged head first into the hay  i followed instantly and disappeared  we lay for a few seconds perfectly still and heard edwards pass at full speed  then we struggled out and watched him out of sight  sliding down we regained the lane returned to the highroad and continued our flight  we saw no more of edwards  about eight miles from my fathers house there was a small seaport town we made for this and reached it just as the sun rose in all his golden glory on the distant edge of the sleeping sea    story two chapter 3  on entering the village we found it in a state of unusual bustle  i had often been there before and had thought it rather a quiet place for a seaport  but now there was a sort of bustling activity and an air of mystery about it that i could not understand  i mentioned my feelings to jack but he did not answer me which was a piece of rudeness so unusual that i could only suppose that his mind was so deeply affected with the circumstances in which we had placed ourselves as to render him somewhat absent  on arriving at the chief indeed the only inn of the place we discovered the reason of all the bustle  a strange ship had arrived the night beforea large ship fitted out for an expedition to some distant part of the world  she had come to complete her supply of provisions and to engage a few extra hands  here then was a fortunate opportunity  we asked at once where we could find the captain  he was in the barroom of the inn  we entered it and found him there standing with his back to the fire and a coattail under each arm  he was a big fat man with a savage expression of countenance and ragged head and beard and a red nose  sir said jack we wish to ship with you  the captain stared took a pencilcase out of his pocket picked his teeth therewith and surveyed us from head to foot  oh you do do you  you wish to ship with me  yes  suppose i dont want you  then we shall have to try elsewhere  the captain smiled grimly shut up the pencilcase and said  what can ye do  we can read and write and count said i taking the words out of jacks mouth for i felt that his brusque manner of replying was not calculated to commend us to the captain  oh you can read and write and count can ye repeated the captain with deep sarcasm  if ye had said ye could feed and fight and shout it would have bin more to the purpose  perhaps we can do a little of that sort of thing too suggested jack with a broad grin  hah ejaculated the captain  wot else can ye do  oh anything said jack  i ginrally find observed the captain that wen a boy says he can do anything he very soon proves that he can do nothing  well i dont mean that exactly rejoined jack i mean we can try anything  ha thats more to the pint  where did ye come from  we looked at each other  that said i is a matter of no importance to any one but ourselves  we have run away from home and we want to go to sea as fast as possible  if you are willing to take us we are willing to go  what say you  run away ho horun away said the captain chuckling you are just the lads i want  nothing like runaway boys for me  i wouldnt give a pinch of snuff for your good boys that do wot theyre bid commend me to the highspirited fellers that runs away and that folk are so wicked as to call bad boys  thats the sort o stuff that suits our service  i did not by any means relish the manner and tone in which all this was said so i asked him what particular service he belonged to  youll know that time enough he replied laughing but after all why shouldnt i tell ye theres nothing to conceal  were a discoveryship were goin to look for sir john franklins expedition and after weve found it were going to try the north pole and then go right through the norwest passage down by behrings straits across the pacific touchin at the cannibal islands in passin and so on to china  havin revictualled there well bear away for japan haustralia cape o good hope and the west indies and come tearin across the atlantic with the gulfstream to england  will that suit ye  it may seem strange and the reader will hardly believe me when i say that transparently absurd though this statement was nevertheless i believed every word of itand so did jack  i saw that by his glowing eye and heightened colour  and when do you sail  i inquired joyfully  in half an hour so get aboard boys and dont give so much tongue ive other matters to mind just now  come be off  we retreated precipitately to the door  whats her name inquired jack looking back  the ringtailed smasher cried the captain fiercely  the what  the ringtailed smasher roared the captain seizing the poker  we vanished  in five minutes we were on board the ship  to this hour i have no remembrance of how we got on board  my brain swam with intense excitement  i felt as if i were flying not walking as i ran about the deck and clambered up the rigging  shortly after the captain came aboard  the rope that attached the vessel to the quay was cast off the sails flew out as if by magic and the shore began to fall rapidly astern  it was now for the first time that a full sense of what i had done came over me  i leaned over the stern of the ship and gazed at my native shore as it grew fainter in the distance until the familiar hills became a mere line of blue on the horizon and were finally blotted from my view by the blinding tears that sprang suddenly to my eyes  oh the agony of that moment i shall never forget  the words that jack had quoted to me the night beforehonour thy father and thy motherseemed to be stamped in letters of fire within my brain  i felt keenly that in a moment of passionate selfwill i had done that which would cause me the deepest sorrow all my life  in that dark hour i forgot all my romantic notions of travel in foreign lands i cared not a straw for hunting or fighting or wild adventures i would have cheerfully given worlds had i possessed them to be permitted to undo the pastto hasten to my dear fathers feet and implore forgiveness of the evil that i had done  but regret was now unavailing  the land soon sank below the horizon and ere many hours had passed our ship was scudding before a stiff breeze and leaping wildly over the waves of the atlantic ocean    story two chapter 4  ho tumble up there tumble up  all hands ahoy tumble up  look alive lads theres work to do my hearties  such were the words uttered in the most terrifically violent bass tones that awoke me on the first morning after i went to sea instantly all the men around me leaped out of their hammocks  they were all halfdressed and i noticed that the greater part of them completed their toilet in the short interval between quitting their hammocks and gaining the deck  jack and i had lain down in our clothes so we were on deck almost as soon as the others  here the most unexpected sights assailed us  it seemed to me as if a miraculous change had taken place on everybody and everything during the night  the ship when she had set sail was as untidy and lumbered about the decks as a merchantman usually is on quitting port  now everything was clean in its place snugly fastened and in order  the sails appeared to have undergone some modification  i fancied too that the masts raked aft a good deal more than they had done and round the foot of them were ranged muskets pistols cutlasses and boardingpikes where masses of cordage and handspikes had been before  the hencoops had vanished and in their place were rows of brass carronades while in the centre of the deck an enormous swivel gun occupied the place on which the longboat had formerly rested  even the captain seemed to have changed  his costume was somewhat eastern in its character and his whole aspect was much more ferocious than when i first saw him  vague and terrible suspicions crossed my mind as i viewed these wonderful transformations but i had no time to indulge them for the men had hastened with the promptitude of menofwars men to their stations leaving jack and me alone in the middle of the deck  hallo boys shouted the captain no idlers allowed aboard this ship here stand by this gun and lend a hand with the ropes when youre told to  obey ordersthats the only duty ive got to lay on you  we hastened to the gun pointed out and while i was standing there waiting for orders i looked over the side and for the first time became aware of the cause of these proceedings  about two miles to leeward of us just off our larboard bow i saw a large ship running under a press of canvas  she was a huge clumsylooking merchantman and i heard our first mate say she was an eastindiaman  then why chase her thought i and why these warlike preparations  it struck me at the time i remember that the captain must have guessed my thoughts for he glanced at me quickly and then turning to the mate with a sarcastic smile said  i thought you had better sight than you seem to have  in my judgment thats a russian merchantman and as we happen to be at war with russia just now ill take the liberty of overhauling her  instead of replying to this the mate burst into a loud laugh in which strangely enough he was joined by the captain and all the men who were within hearing  i felt uneasy at this and expressed my feelings in a whisper to jack who shook his head and looked at me mysteriously but said nothing  i felt that even though we were at war with russia we as a discoveryship had no right whatever to interfere in the capacity of a warship and i was about to remonstrate with the captain at all hazards when my thoughts were suddenly changed by the order being given to fire a shot across the strangers bows  the gun at which i was stationed was run out  stand by cried the captain  fire  in the excitement of the moment and without knowing what i had to do though deeply impressed with the feeling that something ought to be done when an order was given i pulled violently at the rope which i had in my hand the effect of which was to move the gun very slightly when it exploded  the result was that the ball instead of passing well ahead of the strange vessel passed close to its bow and carried away half of the bowsprit  the captain turned on me a face absolutely blazing with wrath  he seized a handspike and i thought he was about to dash out my brains on the spot  he hissed at me between his clinched teeth then suddenly bursting into a shout of fiendish laughter he cried  well well after all theres no harm done  itll make them understand that we dont mean to trifle with em  clear the boardingpikes there are the grapplingirons ready  ay ay sir  by this time the stranger had hoveto and we were bearing down on her so rapidly that a few minutes more would bring us alongside  our men stood ready for action  they were the worstlooking set of scoundrels i ever beheld  ship ahoy shouted our captain as we drew near what ships that  a smart young officer leaped on the bulwarks and cried come alongside and ill tell you  show your colours  at the word our colours went up as colours are usually hoisted rolled up like a ball  i watched with intense interest for i felt that now at last i should know our true character  the ball of what seemed to be darkblue bunting reached the masthead and hung for one instantthen its folds fell heavily and were swept out by the breeze  the flag was black and in the centre were a white skull and crossbones  i almost fainted at the sight  i looked at jack who stood beside me he was as white as a sheet but his lips were firmly compressed and his brows knitted  do we deserve what we have got he muttered in a deep sad voice  i did not reply but my conscience answered we doat least i do  we were now hoveto about a pistolshot to leeward of the ship and our captain leaping on the bulwark cried with a dreadful oath send your gig alongside instantly with your captain and papers  if you dont look sharp ill blow you out of the water  he had scarcely finished speaking when a loud shout rent the air and the bulwarks of the strange vessel swarmed with soldiers  at the same moment twenty concealed ports flew open and twenty heavy guns were run out  our captain gave the word fire as he leaped on the deck and rushed to the wheel  the word must have been given at the same moment on board the chase for both broadsides burst simultaneously from the vessels sides with a deafening crash that sounded ten times louder and more terrible than the loudest thunder i ever heard  we were so near that the combined volumes of smoke completely blinded and almost suffocated me  i fancied for a moment that our powdermagazine had blown up  the thunder of the broadsides was followed by the most appalling shrieks i ever heard and by the ceaseless rattle of musketry as the soldiers opened on us with deadly precision  through the smoke i saw men falling around me and the decks were immediately covered with blood while bullets and splinters of wood whistled round my head like hail  i was stunned  i felt like one in a horrid dream  gradually the smoke cleared away and then i saw that our captain had put down the helm and our vessel was sheering off to leeward under full sail  the rapidity with which everything was done quite took away my breath  before we were out of gunshot the decks had been cleared the dead thrown into the sea the wounded carried below and the decks washed with buckets of water  just then i thought of jack and looked round in haste  he was not there  i rushed below he was not in his hammock  in an agony of anxiety i went down into the horrible den of blood where our surgeon was attending to the wounded  here amid groaning and dying men i found my friend stretched in a cot with a blanket over him his handsome face was very pale and his eyes were closed when i approached  going down on my knees beside him while my heart fluttered with an inexpressible feeling of dread i whispered his name  he opened his large eyes slowly and a sweet sad smile lit up his face for one moment as he took me by the hand  o jack  jack my friendmy brotherare you wounded  i asked  yes he replied in a faint voice im badly hurt i fear  has the doctor dressed your wound  he finished thetheoperation just before you came down  operation  i whispered while a feeling of deadly sickness came over me  wherewhat i could not go further  poor jack knew what i wished to ask  he gently lifted part of the blanket and i felt as if i had been stunned by an electric shock on observing that his right leg had been amputated above the knee  for some moments i could not speak  i could not move  it was with difficulty that i could draw my labouring breath  suddenly i clasped my hands  o jack my beloved my i gasped  my throat was parched  for one moment i thought i was dying  suddenly i started up uttered a great agonising cry and fell down on the deck  then a flood of tears sprang into my burning eyes and i sobbed as if my heart would burst asunder i did not try to check this  it was too precious a relief to my insupportable agony  i crept close to my friends cot took his hand gently and laying my cheek upon it wept there as i never wept before jacks former advice now came back to me vividly and his words of caution honour thy father and thy mother burned deep into my throbbing brain while my accusing conscience whispered unceasingly you brought him to thisyou brought him to this  my sorrow was broken in upon rudely by the first mate  what are you doin here you young blackguard he cried seizing me by the collar and dragging me to the foot of the ladder that led out of this bloody den  skulking eh  ill teach you to skulk ill cure you o that my lad  ill tan your skin for you and at each emphatic word he gave a blow with a ropes end that raised a bar of livid flesh across my back  there he cried giving me a final cut and hurling me up the first few steps of the ladder on deck with you  i did not hesitate to comply  i gained the deck with unusual rapidity smarting with pain and burning with indignation  but what i saw going on there made me almost forget my pain  the great swivel gun amidships was being cleared for action and our captain was giving orders beside it as coolly and quietly as if nothing unusual had occurred that day  i was deeply impressed for a few minutes with this cool calm indifference which characterised the men as well as the captain but when i had considered a little i came to understand that they were used to battle and bloodshed and that therefore it was quite natural  after that i ceased to wonder at anything  indeed the power to be astonished seemed to leave my breast altogether and from that moment i regarded everything that happened on the pirate vessel as being quite what might be expectedmere matter of course  i now observed that we had not yet done with the supposed russian  we had merely run astern out of range of her guns but not beyond the range of our large swivel  in a few minutes it was ready  the captain sighted the gun and gave the word fire  the ship quivered with the shock and so large was the ball that i could distinctly trace its flight  it fell short a few yards  so so muttered the captain  the next will do its work  he was right  the next ball struck the rails that ran round the poop carried away the binnacle and raked the upper deck from stern to stem i could see it quite plainly with the glass  hurrah shouted some of the crew  silence you babies growled the captain time enough to crow when our works done  the men who had cheered fell back abashed  i noticed that they were chiefly the younger men of the crew whose countenances were not yet utterly unhumanised by crime  load  ready  fire  again the huge iron mass sprang from the cannons mouth and rushed along its deadly track  it struck the top of a wave and bounding up passed through the sails and cordage of the russian cutting one or two of the lighter spars and also the main topsail halyards which caused the yard to come rattling down and rendered the sail useless  seeing this the pirate captain ordered sail to be reduced in order to keep at a sufficient distance astern to render the guns of the chase useless every shot from our gun now told with terrible effect  we could see the splinters fly as every ball entered the ships stern or swept her deck or crashed through her rigging  presently she turned her broadside to us  she dont mean to waste her ammunition surely remarked the captain with a sneer  she did not mean to do so  she evidently meant to turn the tables by bearing suddenly down on us and if possible give us a broadside before we could get out of range  the captain saw the intention instantly and thwarted it  up your helm  square the yards  look alive there  we fell off and were soon running before the wind with the swivel gun thundering over our stern as it had formerly thundered over our bows the russian fired a broadside and layto  every ball fell short of us we also layto and now the fire was kept up steadily  the ships fate was sealed  those on board evidently thought so for the colours which had hitherto been flying from the mast were presently lowered  upon this we ceased firing and ranged up alongside  oh youve had enough have you cried our captain  perhaps youll condescend to let your captain and papers come aboard now  the russian did not reply but a boat was lowered  it was evident they meant to obey  here you boy cried our captain as he paced the deck awaiting their arrival  heres a letter for you  a letter sir  i exclaimed stepping forward and touching my cap  ay your father gave it to me just afore we set sail  he told me not to give it to you until youd seen a little rough work  youve seen some now i think he accompanied this remark with a horrible leer so theres the letter  go below and read it  ill want you in half an hour for some still rougher work  there seemed to me something very unaccountable and mysterious in this i knew that the captain did not know my father  i had not even told him that i had a father  it seemed to me impossible that in the course of the short halfhour that intervened between the time of my engaging to serve in the ringtailed smasher and the time of my setting sail my father could have found out where i had run to have met and conversed with the captain and have written a letter to me  yet it seemed that such was the case  i recognised the handwriting  whom did you get the letter from  did you see my father  come youngster dont you go for to question me  go below drectly an stop there till yer wanted  the captain seized the end of a rope as he spoke so i retreated at once to the bedside of my poor friend jack only too glad to escape from the presence of the men whom i now abhorred with all my heart  jack said i eagerly heres a letter from my father  he evinced no surprise but looking up solemnly said in a faint voice read it  breaking the seal i read as follows  my beloved soni forgive you  you have sinned deeply in thus leaving me but i know that you have repented  i know that your own conscience has rebuked you more sternly than any earthly parent could do  you cannot now recall the pastyou cannot undo what you have done you must now continue your voyage and in order to relieve your oppressed heart i give you my blessing  i commend you my dear boy to him who is the saviour of sinners  beware of the captain  obey him in all that is right but do not serve him  again i say beware of him  there are secrets concerning him that i cannot unfold  i have just been to see jacks mother  she sends her forgiveness and blessing to her son  god bless you boyyour loving father  john smith  my father understood human nature  no reproaches that he could have heaped upon me would have cut half so deeply into my heart as did this kind forgiving letter  my heart was full  yet i felt a deep undercurrent of joy at knowing that my father loved me still  i looked at jack  he seemed to be asleep but he was not  a single tear coursed over his pale cheek as he looked up and whispered  we dont deserve this bob  before i could reply the ship was shaken by a tremendous explosion and immediately after i heard the most appalling shrieks and yells on deck accompanied by the clashing of swords and the scuffling of men in deadly conflict  i looked at jack he lay motionless with his eyes closed for a moment i feared that he was dead  bob smith  hallo tumble up there you skulker shouted a voice down the hatchway  at the same moment two wounded men were carried into the place and the surgeon appeared with his horrible instruments glittering cold and sharp on a wooden tray  seizing my cutlass and thrusting a brace of pistols in my belt i rushed on deck    story two chapter 5  on reaching the deck i saw at once how matters stood  the russian had allowed us to come alongside and then throwing out grapplingirons had fired a broadside into us and attempted to board  they were soon overcome however by the pirates and driven back into their ship whither they were immediately followed  i resolved come what might that i would take no part in the fray but i was carried in spite of myself on board the strange vessel in the rush that our men made when they drove their opponents back  there was a short sharp skirmish on the deck of the russian and then the crew were driven below and the hatches put on  i remembered having seen a number of soldiers on board when we first came up with this vessel there were none now  their mysterious disappearance struck me at first but i soon forgot it in the thrilling scenes that followed  in the middle of the vessels maindeck there was a cage of wild beasts how they had got there of course i knew not but i at once concluded the ship must have been in southern climes and these animals were being brought home to be presented to some menagerie or zoological garden there were several fine specimens of lions and tigers and the sight of blood which flowed plentifully on the decks had so excited these creatures that they were now filling the air with deafening roars bounding against the sides of their cage which i expected every moment to see broken to pieces by their united strength and glaring at us with the most awful expressions of ferocity i ever beheld  our captain who looked almost as fierce as the wild brutes could not make his voice heard for their roaring  in savage fury he rushed at the cage and made a desperate cut with his sword at the lion nearest the bars  the blood flowed from the wound freely and the savage animal being unable to wreak its vengeance on its cowardly assailant attacked one of its comrades  this and the blood now flowing in the cage quite maddened them all  an indiscriminate fight ensued  the wooden partition that separated the tigers from the lions was smashed in and the strong cage shook as if it were made of cardboard  turn a gun inboard yelled the captain who seemed to have actually gone mad with passion  the order was instantly obeyed  load to the muzzlegrapecanisterchain shot  in with it  he assisted in the operation rammed home the extraordinary charge pointed the gun at the cage and applied the match  instantly the gun leaped backwards as if it had been a living thing broke down the bulwarks of the ship and plunged overboard  the effect of the shot was terrific  the cage was blown to atoms and the mangled remains of the wild beasts were strewn about the deck  one animal however a magnificent bengal tiger had apparently escaped unhurt  it sprang at the captain with a hideous roar  he pointed a pistol at its open throat  at that moment the woodcut in my book of travels flashed vividly before me  but i had not time to think  the pistol exploded sending its contents down the creatures throat  the tiger fell short in its leap blood poured from its mouth and nose  with another bound it cleared the bulwarks and fell into the sea  the calm that succeeded this thrilling incident was like a sudden lull in the midst of a furious storm  even the pirates seemed to be solemnised by what had passed  now to work cried the captain wiping his sword and laying it with a brace of loaded pistols on the capstan  what are you staring at you foolshave you lost your senses  open the afterhatch and bring them up one at a time  get the plank ready  the first who was led bound before the captain was the steward of the ship  he was deadly pale and trembled very much  now my man said the captain answer my questions  the truth mind else he touched the butt of a pistol significantly  where did you last sail from  to my amazement the man gave the name of the port from which we ourselves had sailed  i felt certain that this was a falsehood and that the poor mans life would be forfeited  judge then my surprise when the captain said  i know that as well as you  i saw you sneak out just the day before we did  but you didnt escape me ha ha  you are too good to live my man  stand aside here till i call someone whos not quite so frightened  here hold him one of you  bring another  i started  my heart almost ceased to beat when the next man was led forward  he was my fathers manservant edwards  in the confusion and horror of that hour i could not reason but a vague sense of some mysterious impossibility having actually taken place oppressed me in a way that i cannot explain  the ship had sailed the day before ours did i left edwards behind me in the race from home  how then did i see him before me  then the cage of wild beasts  how was it possible that a vessel leaving an english port could have such creatures on board then my fathers letter it seemed more than ever mysterious how that letter could reach me and through such a channel and without a word of reference to edwards  he did not observe me as he passed  i tried to utter his name but my tongue was tied  i could not speak  i could not move  where did you last sail from began the captain  youll get nothing out of me replied edwards stoutly  do your most  torture me if you like  i defy you to your teeth  do you my fine fellow said the captain with a bitter sneer  then ill just send you overboard at once  ive no time to torture you and as i shall find plenty of your comrades willing enough to tell me all they know ill not trouble you any further  ho run out the plank there  i knew what that meant and a cold shiver passed through my frame as the men obeyed and blindfolded edwards preparatory to making him walk the plank  i could restrain myself no longer  darting up to the captain i shouted in a voice of indignation  do you mean to murder an innocent man you dastardly villain  he looked at me for a moment in surprise then snatching a pistol felled me with it to the deck  i was not rendered quite insensible  i heard the shriek of agony uttered by poor edwards as he fell off the end of the plank into the sea then i fainted  how long i lay i know not probably not long for i was restored to a state of consciousness by being plunged into the sea  i had no doubt that the captain had ordered me to be thrown overboard just after i fell under his brutal blow  being a good swimmer i struck out at once and made for the side of the pirate vessel where i caught the end of a rope and soon clambered on board  i was much exhausted and sat down on the breech of a carronade to rest and recover my stunned and scattered faculties  the crew of the pirate were so busily engaged with the captured ship that i found myself quite alone on the deck  not a man remained in the ship  an idea suddenly occurred to me just then  i glanced up at the sails  they were all flapping in the wind except the foretopsail that sail had slewed round and was drawing so that the vessel strained the ropes and grapplingirons that held her to the captured ship  i sprang up burning with eager excitement  i heard the shrieks of the illfated victims as one by one they walked the plank which fortunately for the success of my design was thrust out on the other side of the ship  a crowbar enabled me to wrench off the grapplingirons  two cuts of a large axe severed the cable that had been fastened to the bow and the vessels head fell slowly off  as it did so all the sails filled with a sudden clap  this was observed i heard a shout and saw the pirates spring on the bulwarks of the prize i flew rather than ran to the stern where the cable that held the vessel was rigid as a bar of iron  one blow cut it and the rope recoiled violently in the faces of the men who laid hold of it  next moment the pirate ship was heading away before a stiff breeze which was quickly freshening to a gale  as i sprang to the helm a shower of musket and pistol bullets tore up the deck round me and i heard the captains voice give the order to load the guns  it was a few minutes before the vis inertiae of the ship was overcome so that i was within close range when a whole broadside was fired at me but not a shot struck  they tore up the water all round and ricochetted over me  before they could reload i was almost beyond range for the gale was freshening every moment and the canvas spread was enough almost to tear the masts out of the ship  the water hissed as she flew over the heaving waves and in a few minutes i felt that i was free  oh the feeling of wild delight that filled me when i realised this  i lashed the helm amidships and ran down below to tell jack what i had done  he was asleep  by a powerful effort i restrained myself and did not disturb him  then i rushed on deck  my brain seemed on fire  i shouted laughed and sang and wept until i began to feel a terrible sensation of dread lest i should go mad  but this instead of calming me caused me to dance and sing and shout the more  a burning thirst came upon me  i ran to the watercask and drank till i could drink no more  i was refreshed but soon the fever returned fiercer than ever i was mad  i knew it i felt it but i did not care  i saw that the storm increased this caused me to shout again with joy at the thought that i was so quickly borne away from the scene of butchery and from the fiends in human form with whom i had so lately associated  the gale burst in all its fury upon us  the sails were new and strong the ship plunged into the waves a green billow swept inboard and burst in fury on the deck carrying away boats and loose spars  i yelled with delight and plunged into the brine that lashed the deck from stem to stern  i heard a noise overhead but was so confused that i could not understand what it was  as i gazed there came a terrific blast  the mainsail split from top to bottom  the topsails burst and were blown to ribbons  at the same moment i received a violent blow on the head  after that all was darkness and oblivion    story two chapter 6  when consciousness returned to me i found myself lying on my back on the deck of a vessel surrounded and propped up by pillows and jack brown sitting beside me reading a book  i felt a curious sensation of weakness and emptiness in my headas if it were hollow and a strange disinclination almost inability to speak or think  suddenly this passed away and the events which i have related in the previous chapters rushed back upon my memory with vivid power  it must have been a dream i thought or i must have been ill and delirious and these things have passed through my fevered brain  at that moment the thought of jacks amputated leg came into my head that will prove it thought i and turned quickly to look at my friend  one glance was sufficienta wooden stump occupied the place of his right leg  i groaned aloud and burst into tears  come bob said jack in a soft kind tone laying down his book and bending over me  come my poor fellow keep quiet  its about time you had your dinner  lie still and ill fetch it to you  i laid my hand on his arm and detained him  then its all true said i in a tone of the deepest despondency  is what all true  thisthis horribleyour leg your leg  jack suddenly stooped and gazed earnestly into my face  do you know me bob  he trembled as he spoke  know you jack why should i not know you  when did i ever forget you  thank god he exclaimed fervently taking my hand and pressing it to his breast  youre all right again  oh how i have longed and prayed for this  all right jack  have i been wrong then  that you have just said jack smiling sadly  youve just been as mad as a march hare thats all  i fell flat down and gazed at him  in a minute more i raised myself on one elbow and looking at him earnestly said how long jack  just three weeks today  i fell flat down again in which position jack left me to go and fetch me some dinner  he returned quickly with a plate of soup  before commencing to eat it i pressed my hand on my forehead and said  jack i am surrounded by mysteries  how got you so soon well  where got you that wooden leg  how are we here alone  where are we going clear up my faculties jack while i eat this soupdo like a good fellow  i can easily do that bob  first i got well because you took care of me  what  i  yes you  at the commencement of your madness you tended me and cared for me as if you had been my mother  when you got to lose all method in your madness i was well enough to take care of myself and you too secondly i found this wooden leg in the carpenters berth and gladly availed myself of its services though it is three inches too short and causes me to hobble in a most undignified manner  thirdly we are here alone because there is no one else with us  you took good care of that by cutting the ropes before any of our crew could get aboardso you told me just before you went mad  oh  i remember now  i recollect it all  go on  fourthly as to where we are going i dont know  our compass was smashed to pieces in the fight and ive been running for the last three weeks right before the wind  so now you know all and as youve finished your soup ill go and get you a lump of boiled junk  dont said i rising and shaking myself  ive dined  i feel quite strong  i dont feel a bit as if i had been ill  hallo what land is that  jack started and gazed at it with surprise  he had evidently not known that we were in the neighbourhood of land  a dense fogbank had concealed it from us  now that it cleared away it revealed to our gaze a stretch of yellow sand backed by the lofty blue hills of the interior and from the palmtrees that i could make out distinctly i judged that we must have been making for the tropical regions during the last three weeks  yet here again mystery surrounded me  how was it possible that we should have reached the tropics in so short a time  while i was puzzling over this question the greatest mystery of all occurred to us if i were not conscientiously relating events exactly as they occurred i should expect my readers to doubt my veracity here  as we were sailing smoothly along our ship without any apparent cause began to sink  she went down gradually but quicklyinch by inch until the water was on a level with the decks  we struck no rock we did not cease to advance towards the shore  i fancied that we must certainly have sprung a leak but there had been no sound of a plank starting and there was no noise of water rushing into the hold  i could not imagine what had occurred but i had not much time for thought  we could do nothing to avert the catastrophe  it occurred so suddenly that we were both rendered mute and helpless  we stood gazing at the water as it crept over the deck without making the slightest effort to save ourselves  at length the water reached the hatchway and poured in a roaring cataract into the hold  the vessel filled gave a heavy lurch to port a species of tremor passed through her frame as if she was a living thing and knew that her hour had come then she went down in a whirlpool leaving jack and me struggling in the sea  we were both good swimmers so that we did not experience much alarm especially when we felt that the sea was comparatively warm we struck out for the shore and being the better swimmer of the two i took the lead  but now to our horror we found that we were followed by sharks  no sooner did we observe this than we struck out with all the energy of terror  we never swam as we did on that occasion  it seemed to me quite miraculous  the water burst from our breasts in foam and we left long white tracks behind us as we clove our way through the water like two boats  it was awful  i shall never forget my feelings on that occasion they were indescribableinconceivable  we were about a quarter of a mile from a point of rocks when our ship sank  in an incredibly short space of time we were close on the rocks being several yards ahead of jack i was the first to clamber up my heart fluttering with fear yet filled with deep gratitude for my deliverance  i turned to help jack  he was yet six yards from shore when a dreadful shark made a rush at him  oh quick quick  i screamed  he was panting and straining like a lion  another moment and his hand would have been in mine but at that moment i beheld the double rows of horrid teeth close upon him  he uttered a piercing shriek and there was an indescribably horrible scrunch as he went down  in a moment after he reappeared and making a last frightful effort to gain the rocks caught my hand  i dragged him out of danger instantly and then i found to my unutterable joy that the shark had only bitten off the half of his wooden leg  embracing each other fervently we sat down in the rocks to rest and collect our thoughts    story two chapter 7  i have often found from experience that the more one tries to collect ones thoughts the more ones thoughts pertinaciously scatter themselves abroad almost beyond the possibility of discovery  such was the case with me after escaping from the sea and the sharks as related circumstantially in the last chapter  perhaps the truth of this may best be illustrated by laying before my readers the dialogue that ensued between me and jack on the momentous occasion referred to as follows  jack  i say bob where in all the world have we got to  bob  upon my word i dont know  jack  its very mysterious  bob  whats very mysterious  jack  where weve got to  cant you guess  bob  certainly  suppose i say lapland  jack  shaking his head wont do  bob  why  jack  cause there are no palmtrees in lapland  bob  dear me thats true  how confused my head is  ill tell you what it is jack i cant think  thats itthats the cause of the mystery that seems to beset me i cant tell how and then ive been illthats it too  jack  how can there be two causes for one effect bob  youre talking stuff man  if i couldnt talk better sense than that id not talk at all  bob  then why dont you hold your tongue  i tell you what it is jack were bewitched  you said i was mad some time ago  you were rightso i am so are you  there are too many mysteries here for any two sane men  here jack murmured we werent men but boys theres the running away and not being caughtthe ship ready to sail the moment we arrive theres your joining me after all your good advice theres that horrible fight and the lions and edwards and the sinking of our ship and thethein short i feel that im mad still  im not recovered yet  here jack take care of me  instead of replying to this jack busied himself in fitting a piece of wood he had picked up to his wooden leg and lashing it firmly to the old stump  when he had accomplished his task he turned gravely to me and said  bob your faculties are wandering pretty wildly today but youve not yet hit upon the cause of all our misfortunes  the true cause is that you have disobeyed your father and i my mother  i hung my head  i had now no longer difficulty in collecting my thoughtsthey circled round that point until i thought that remorse would have killed me  then suddenly i turned with a look of gladness to my friend  but you forget the letter  we are forgiven  true cried jack with a cheerful expression we can face our fate with that assurance  come let us strike into the country and discover where we are  ill manage to hop along pretty well with my wooden leg well get home as soon as we can by land if not by water and then well remain at homewont we bob  remain at home  i cried ay that will we  ive had more than enough of foreign experiences already  oh  jack jack its little i care for the sufferings i have enduredbut your leg jack  willingly most willingly my dear friend would i part with my own if by so doing i could replace yours  jack took my hand and squeezed it  its gone now bob he said sadly  i must just make the most of the one thats left  tis a pity that the one thats left is only the left one  so saying he turned his back to the sea and still retaining my hand in his led me into the forest  but here unthoughtof trouble awaited us at the very outset of our wanderings  the ground which we first encountered was soft and swampy so that i sank above the ankles at every step  in these circumstances as might have been expected poor jacks wooden leg was totally useless the first step he took after entering the jungle his leg penetrated the soft ground to the depth of nine or ten inches and at the second step it disappeared altogetherinsomuch that he could by no means pull it out  i say bob said he with a rueful expression of countenance im in a real fix now and no mistake  come to anchor prematurely  i resolved to stick at nothing and here i have stuck at the first step  what is to be done  jacks right leg being deep down in the ground it followed as a physical consequence that his left leg was bent as if he were in a sitting posture  observing this fact just as he made the above remark he placed both his hands on his left knee rested his chin on his hands and gazed meditatively at the ground  the action tickled me so much that i gave a short laugh  jack looked up and laughed too whereupon we both burst incontinently into an uproarious fit of laughter which might have continued ever so long had not jack in the fulness of his mirth given his fixed leg a twist that caused it to crack  hallo  bob he cried becoming suddenly very grave i say this wont do you know if i break it short off youll have to carry me my boy so it behoves me to be careful  what is to be done  come ill help you to pull it out  oh thats not what troubles me  but after we get it out whats to be done  jack said i seriously one thing at a time  when we get you out then it will be time enough to inquire what to do next  thats sound philosophy bob where did you pick it up  i suspect you must have been studying shakespeare of late on the sly  but come get behind me and put your hands under my arms and heave ill shove with my sound limb  now let us act together  stay  bob weve been long enough aboard ship to know the value of a song in producing unity of action  take the tune from me  suiting the action to the word jack gave forth at the top of his voice one or two of those peculiarly nautical howls wherewith seamen are wont to constrain windlasses and capstans to creak and anchors to let go their hold  now then heave away my hearties yoheaveohoi  at the last word we both strained with all our might  i heard jacks braces burst with the effort  we both became purple in the face but the leg remained immovable  with a loud simultaneous sigh we relaxed and looking at each other groaned slightly  come come bob never say die one trial more it was the braces that spoiled it that time  now then cheerily ho my hearties heaveyoheeohoy  the united force applied this time was so great that we tore asunder all the fastenings of the leg at one wrench and jack and i suddenly shot straight up as if we had been discharged from a hole in the ground losing our balance we fell over each other on our backsthe wooden leg remaining hard and fast in the ground  ah  jack said i sorrowfully as i rubbed the mud off my garments if we had remained at home this would not have happened  if we had remained at home returned jack rather gruffly as he hopped towards his leg nothing would have happened  come bob lay hold of it  out it shall come if the inside of the world should come along with it  there nowheave  this time we gave vent to no shout but we hove with such a will that jack split his jacket from the waist to the neck and the leg came out with a crack that resembled the drawing of the largest possible cork out of the biggest conceivable bottle  having accomplished this feat we congratulated each other and then sat down to repair damages  this was not an easy matter  it cost us no little thought to invent some contrivance that would prevent the leg from sinking but at last we thought of a plan  we cut a square piece of bark off a tree the outer rind of which was peculiarly tough and thick  in the centre of this we scooped a hole and inserted therein the end of the leg fastening it thereto with pieces of twine that we chanced to have in our pockets  thus we made as it were an artificial foot which when jack tried it served its purpose admirablyindeed it acted too well for being a broad base it did not permit the wooden leg to sink at all while the natural leg did sink more or less and as the wooden limb had no knee it was stiff from hip to heel and could not bend so that i had to walk behind my poor comrade and when i observed him get somewhat into the position of the leaning tower of pisa i sprang forward and supported him  thus we proceeded slowly through the forest stumbling frequently tumbling occasionally and staggering oft but strange to say without either of us having any very definite idea of where we were going or what we expected to find or why we went in one direction more than another  in fact we proceeded on that eminently simple principle which is couched in the wellknown and timehonoured phrase follow your nose  true once i ventured to ask my companion where he thought we were going to which he replied much to my surprise that he didnt know and didnt care that it was quite certain if we did not go forward we could not expect to get on and that in the ordinary course of things if we proceeded we should undoubtedly come to something  to this i replied in a meditative tone that there was much truth in the observation and that at any rate if we did not come to something something would certainly come to us  but we did not pursue the subject  in fact we were too much taken up with the interesting and amusing sights that met our gaze in that singular forest insomuch that on several occasions i neglected my peculiar duty of watching jack and was only made aware of my carelessness by hearing him shout hallo  bob look aliveim over when i would suddenly drop my eyes from the contemplation of the plumage of a parrot or the antics of a monkey to behold my friend leaning over at an angle of fortyfive  to leap forward and catch him in my arms was the work of an instant  on each of these occasions after setting him upright i used to give him a tender hug to indicate my regret at having been so inattentive and my sympathy with him in his calamitous circumstances  poor jack was very gentle and uncomplaining  he even made light of his misfortune and laughed a good deal at himself but i could see nevertheless that his spirits were at times deeply affected in spite of his brave efforts to bear up and appear gay and cheerful    story two chapter 8  it was evening when we were cast ashore in this new country so that we had not advanced far into the forest before night closed in and compelled us to halt for had we continued our journey in the dark we should certainly have been drowned in one of the many deep morasses which abounded there and which we had found it difficult to steer clear of even in daylight  as the moon arose and the stars began to glimmer in the sky i observed to my dismay that all kinds of noxious creatures and creeping things began to move about and strange hissing sounds and low dismal hootings and wails were heard at times indistinctly as if the place were the abode of evil spirits who were about to wake up to indulge in their midnight orgies  oh  jack said i shuddering violently as i stopped and seized my companion by the arm  i cant tell what it is that fills me with an unaccountable sensation of dread  ii feel as if we should never more get out of this horrible swamp or see again the blessed light of day see see what horrid creature is that  pooh man interrupted jack with a degree of levity in his tone which surprised me much  its only a serpent  all these kind o things are regular cowards  only let them alone and theyre sure to let you alone i should like above all things to tickle up one o these brutes and let him have a bite at my wooden toe  it would be rare fun wouldnt it bob eh  come let us push on and see that you keep me straight old fellow  i made no reply for some time  i was horrified at my comrades levity in such circumstances  then as i heard him continue to chuckle and remark in an undertone on the surprise the serpent would get on discovering the exceeding toughness of his toe it for the first time flashed across my mind that his sufferings had deranged my dear companions intellect  the bare probability of such a dreadful calamity was sufficient to put to flight all my previous terrors  i now cared nothing whatever for the loathsome reptiles that wallowed in the swamps around me and the quiet glidings and swelterings of whose hideous forms were distinctly audible in the stillness of approaching night  my whole anxiety was centred on jack  i thought that if i could prevail on him to rest he might recover and proposed that we should encamp but he would not hear of this  he kept plunging on staggering through brake and swamp reedy pond and quaking morass until i felt myself utterly unable to follow him a step farther  just at this point jack stopped abruptly and said  bob my boy well camp here  it was a fearful spot  dark dismal and not a square foot of dry ground  here jack  ay here  but itsits all wet  excuse me my dear comrade ive not yet acquired the habit of sleeping in water  no more have i bob we shall sleep on a fallen tree my boy  did you never hear of men sleeping in a swamp on the top of a log  its often done i assure you and i mean to do it tonight  see here is a good large one three feet broad by twenty feet long with lots of stumps of broken branches to keep us from rolling off  come lets begin  we immediately began to make our arrangements for the night  with the aid of our claspknives we cut a quantity of leafy branches and spread them on the trunk of a huge prostrated tree the half of which was sunk in the swamp but the other half was sufficiently elevated to raise us well out of the water  the bed was more comfortable than one would suppose and being very tired we lay down on it as soon as it was made and tried to sleep having nothing to eat we thought it well to endeavour to obtain all the refreshment we could out of sleep  we had not lain long when i started up in a fright and cried  hallo  jack whats that  see through the reeds it creeps slowly oh horror it comes towards us  jack looked at it sleepily  its an alligator said he  if it approaches too close just wake me but pray dont keep howling at every thing that comes to peep at us  just at that moment the hideous reptile drew near and opening its jaws let them come together with a snap  even jack was not proof against this  he started up and looked about for a defensive weapon we had nothing but our claspknives  the alligator wallowed towards us  oh for an axe gasped jack  the brute was within a few yards of us now  i was transfixed with horror  suddenly an idea occurred to me  your leg jack your leg  he understood me  one sweep of his claspknife cut all the fastenings the next moment he grasped the toe in both hands and swaying the heavy butt of the limb in the air brought it down with all his force on the skull of the alligator  it rang like the sound of a blow on an empty cask  again the limb was swayed aloft and descended with extraordinary violence on the extreme point of the alligators snout  there was a loud crash as if of small bones being driven in  the animal paused put its head on one side and turning slowly round waddled away into the noisome recesses of its native swamp  scarcely had we recovered from the effects of this when we heard in the distance shouts and yells and the barking of dogs  crouching in our nest we listened intently  the sounds approached but while those who made them were yet at some distance we were startled by the sudden approach of a dark object running at full speed  it seemed like a man or rather a huge ape for it was black and as it came tearing towards us running on its hindlegs we could see its eyes glaring in the moonlight and could hear its labouring breath  it was evidently hard pressed by its pursuers for it did not see what lay before it and had wellnigh run over our couch ere it observed jack standing on one leg with the other limb raised in a threatening attitude above his head  it was too late to turn to avoid the blow  uttering a terrible cry the creature fell on its knees and trembling violently cried  oh massa oh massa spare me  me no runaway agin  mercy massa mercy  silence you noisy villain cried jack seizing the negro by the hair of the head  yis massa gasped the man while his teeth chattered and the whites of his eyes rolled fearfully  what are you  where dye come from  whos after ye  to these abrupt questions the poor negro replied as briefly that he was a runaway slave and that his master and bloodhounds were after him  we had guessed as much and the deep baying of the hounds convinced us of the truth of his statement  quick cried jack dragging the black to the edge of our log get under there lie flat keep still so saying he thrust the negro under the branches that formed our couch  we covered him well up and then sat down on him  before we had well finished our task the foremost of the bloodhounds came bounding towards us with its eyeballs glaring and its white fangs glittering in the dim light like glowworms in a bloodred cavern  it made straight for the spot where the negro was concealed and would have seized him in another instant had not jack with one blow of his leg beat in its skull  shove him out of sight bob  i seized the dead hound and obeyed while my comrade prepared to receive the second dog  but that animal seemed more timid  it swerved as the blow was delivered received on its haunches and fled away howling in another direction  jack at once laid down his leg and sat down on the negro motioning me to do the same  then pulling an old tobaccopipe out of his pocket he affected to be calmly employed in filling it when the pursuers came up there were two of them in straw hats and nankeen pantaloons armed with cudgels and a more ruffianly pair of villains i never saw before or since  hallo strangers cried one as they halted for a few moments on observing us  queer place to camp  fond o water and dirt i guess  you seem fond o dirt and not o water to judge from your faces replied jack calmly attempting to light his pipe which was rather a difficult operation seeing that it was empty and he had no fire  ah my lights out  could you lend us a match friend  no we cant  no time  haint got none  did you see a nigger pass this way  ha youre after him are you cried jack indignantly  do you suppose id tell you if i did  go and find him for yourselves  the two men frowned fiercely at this and appeared about to attack us but they changed their minds and said mayhap youll tell us if ye saw two hounds then  yes i did  which way did they pass  they havent passed yet replied jack with deep sarcasm at the same time quietly lifting his leg and swaying it gently to and fro whether theyll pass without a licking remains to be seen  look ee lads well pay you for this shouted the men as they turned away  weve not time to waste now but well come back  i remonstrated with my friend  youre too rash jack  why  we dont need to fear two men  ay but there may be more in the woods  my surmise was correct  half an hour after the hound was heard returning  it came straight at us followed by at least a dozen men jack killed the dog with one blow and felled the first man that came up but we were overwhelmed by numbers and in a much shorter time than it takes to tell it both of us were knocked into the mud and rendered insensible    story two chapter 9  on recovering from the stunning effects of the blow that had felled me i found myself lying on a hard earthen floor surrounded by deep impenetrable darkness  are you there jack  i sighed faintly  ay bob im hereat least all o me thats left  i confess to you that i do feel a queer sensation as if the one half of my head were absent and the other half awanting while the brain lies exposed to the atmosphere  but i suppose thats impossible  where are we jack  were in an outhouse in the hands of planters so i made out by what i heard them say when i got my senses back but ive no notion of what part o the world were in  moreover i dont care  a man with only one leg no head and an exposed brain isnt worth caring about  i dont care for himnot a button  oh jack dear dont speak like thati cant stand it  youre lying down aint you inquired jack  yes  then how dyou know whether you can stand it or not  i was so overcome and to say the truth surprised at my companions recklessness that i could not reply  i lay motionless on the hard ground meditating on our forlorn situation when my thoughts were interrupted by the grating sound of a key turning in a lock  the door of the hut opened and four men entered each bearing a torch which cast a brilliant glare over the hovel in which we were confined  there was almost nothing to be seen in the place  it was quite empty  the only peculiar thing that i observed about it was a thick post with iron hooks fixed in it which rose from the centre of the floor to the rafters against which it was nailed  there were also a few strangelooking implements hanging round the walls but i could not at first make out what these were intended for  i now perceived that jack and i were chained to the wall  going to the four corners of the apartment the four men placed their four torches in four stands that seemed made for the purpose and then approaching us ranged themselves in a row before us  two of them i recognised as being the men we had first seen in the swamp the other two were strangers  so my bucks began one of the formera hideouslooking man whose personal appearance was by no means improved by a closed eye a flattened nose and a swelled cheek the result of jacks first flourish of his wooden legso weve got you have we  the hounds have got you eh  so it appears replied jack in a tone of quiet contempt as he sat on the ground with his back leaning against the wall his hands clasped above his solitary knee and his thumbs revolving round each other slowly  i say continued jack an expression of concern crossed his handsome countenance im afraid youre damaged rather about your headpiece  your eye seems a little out of order and pardon me but your nose is a little too flatjust a little  my poor fellow im quite sorry for you i really am though you are a dog  the man opened his solitary eye and stared with amazement at jack who smiled and putting his head a little to the other side returned the stare with interest  youre a bold fellow said the man on recovering a little from his surprise  im sorry retorted jack that i cannot return you the compliment  i was horrified  i saw that my poor friend probably under the influence of madness had made up his mind to insult and defy our captors to their teeth regardless of consequences  i tried to speak but my lips refused their office  the man grinned horribly and gnashed his teeth while the others made as though they would rush upon us and tear us limb from limb  but their chief for such the spokesman seemed to be restrained them  hah he gasped looking fiercely at jack and at the same time pointing to the implements on the wall dye see these things  not being quite so blind as you are i do  dye know what theyre for  not being a demon which you seem to be i dont  hah theseare he spoke very slowly and hissed the words out between his teethtorterers  what inquired jack putting his head a little more to one side and revolving his thumbs in a contrary direction by way of variety  torterersmantorterers  what dye twirl your thumbs like that for eh  because it reminds me how easily if i were unchained and had on my wooden leg i could twirl you round your own neck and cram your heels into your own mouth and ram you down your own throat until there was nothing of you left but the extreme ends of your shirtcollar sticking out of your eyes  the mention of this peculiarly complicated operation seemed to be too much for the men setting up a loud yell they rushed upon jack and seized him  quickthe screws cried the man with the flattened nose  a small iron instrument was brought jacks thumbs inserted therein and the handle turned  i heard a harsh grating sound and observed my poor companions face grow deadly pale and his lips turn blue  but he uttered no cry and to my surprise he did not even struggle  stop  i shouted in a voice of thunder  the men looked round in surprise  at that moment a great idea seemed to fill my soul  i cannot explain what it was  to this day i do not know what it was  it was a mysteryan indescribable mystery  i felt as one might be supposed to feel whose spirit were capable of eating material food and had eaten too much  it was awful  under the impulse of this sensation i again shouted  stop  why  i cannot tell you why until you unscrew that machine  quick it is of the deepest the most vital importance to yourselves  the extreme earnestness of my voice and manner induced the men to comply almost i might say in spite of themselves  now lad what is it  mind your turn is coming so dont trifle with us  trifle with you  i said in a voice so deep and slow and solemnwith a look so preternaturally awfulthat the four men were visibly impressed  listen  i have a secret to tell youa secret that intimately concerns yourselves  it is a fearful one  you would give all you possessyour wealth your very livesrather than not know it  i can tell it to you but not now  all the tortures of the inquisition could not drag it out of me  nay you need not smile  if you did torture me before i told you this secret that would have the effect of rendering my information useless to you  nothing could then save you  i must be left alone with my friend for an hour  go  you may leave us chained you may lock and bar your door you may watch and guard the house but go leave us  muchtoo muchvaluable time has been already lost  come back in one hour here i pulled out my watchin one hour and three minutes and five seconds exactly not sooner  go quick as you value your lives your families your property  and hark in your ear here i glared at them like a maniac and sank my voice to a deep hoarse whisper as you value the very existence of your slaves go leave us instantly and return at the hour named  the men were evidently overawed by the vehemence of my manner and the mysterious nature of my remarks  without uttering a word they withdrew and locked the door behind them  happily they left the torches  as soon as they were gone i threw my arms round my comrades neck and resting my head on his shoulder bemoaned our sad lot  dear dear jack have they hurt you  oh nothing to speak of  but i say bob my boy what on earth can this monstrous secret be  it must be something very tremendous  my poor jack said i regardless of his question your thumbs are bruised and bleeding  oh that i should have lived to bring you to this  come come bob enough of that  they are a little soreish but nothing to what they would have been had you not stopped them  but i say what is this secret  im dying to know  my dear boy youve no idea how you looked when you were spouting like that  you made my flesh creep i assure you  come out with it whats the secret  i felt and no doubt looked somewhat confused  do you know jack said i solemnly i have no secret whatever  jack gasped and stared  no secret bob  not the most distant shadow of one  jack pulled out his watch and said in a low voice  bob my boy we have just got about threequarters of an hour to live when these villains come back and find that youve been humbugging them theyll brain us on the spot as sure as my name is john brown and yours is robert smithromantic names both of em especially when associated with the little romance in which we are now involved  ha ha ha  i shrank back from my friend with the terrible dread which had more than once crossed my mind that he was going mad  oh jack dont laugh pray  could we not invent some secret to tell them  not a bad idea returned my friend gravely  well let us think what could we say  ay thats the rub  suppose we tell them seriously that my wooden leg is a ghost and that it haunts those who illtreat its master giving them perpetual bangs on the nose and otherwise rendering their lives miserable  i shook my head  well then suppose we say weve been sent by the queen of england to treat with them about the liberation of the niggers at a thousand pounds a head one hundred paid down in gold the rest in american shinplasters  that would be a lie you know jack  come thats good  youre wonderfully particular about truth for a man that has just told such tremendous falsehoods about a secret that doesnt exist  true jack i replied seriously i confess that i have lied but i did not mean to  i assure you i had no notion of what i was saying  i think i was bewitched  all your nonsense rolled out as it were without my will  indeed i did not mean to tell lies  yet i confess to my shame that i did  there is some mystery here which i can by no means fathom  fathom or not fathom rejoined my friend looking at his watch again you got me into this scrape so i request you to get me out of it  we have exactly twentyfive minutes and a half before us now  jack and i now set to work in real earnest to devise some plan of escape or to invent some plausible secret  but we utterly failed minute after minute passed and as the end of our time drew near we felt less and less able to think of any scheme until our brains became confused with the terror of approaching and inevitable death aggravated by previous torture  i trembled violently and jack became again uproarious and sarcastic  suddenly he grew quiet and i observed that he began to collect a quantity of straw that was scattered about the place  making a large pile of it he placed it before us and then loosened one of the torches in its stand  there said he with a sigh of satisfaction when all was arranged we shall give our amiable friends a warm reception when they come  but they will escape by the door said i in much anxiety and we only shall perish  never mind that bob we can only die once  besides they shant escape trust me for that  as he spoke we heard approaching footsteps  presently the key turned in the lock and the door opened    story two chapter 10  punctually to a minute our jailors returned and once again drew up in a row before us  now lads wot have ye got to say  my friends began jack standing up and balancing himself on his one leg as well as he could at the same time speaking with the utmost gravity and candour of expression my companion here in temporary distressfor i feel that it will be but temporaryhas devolved upon me the interesting duty of making known to you the secret which has burthened his own mind for some time and which has had so impressive and appropriate an effect upon yours  but first i must request you to lock the door and hang the key on this nail at my elbow  you hesitate why  i am in chains so is my comrade  we are two you are four  it is merely a precaution to prevent the possibility of any one entering by stealth and overhearing what i say  the man with the battered face locked the door and hung up the key as directed merely remarking with a laugh that we were safe enough anyhow and that if we were humbugging him it would be worse for us in the longrun  come now out with yer secret he added impatiently  certainly answered jack with increased urbanity at the same time taking down the key which caused the four men to start and gazing at it in a pensive manner  the secret  ah yes  well its a wonderful one  dyou know my lads there would not be the most distant chance of your guessing it if you were to try ever so much  well but what is it cried one of the men whose curiosity was now excited beyond endurance  it is this rejoined jack with slow deliberation that you four men are  well they whispered leaning forward eagerly  the most outrageous and unmitigated asses we ever saw  ha  i thought it would surprise you  bob and i are quite agreed upon it  pray dont open your eyes too wide in case you should find it difficult to shut them again  now in proof of this great and to you important truth let me show you a thing  do you see this torch taking it down and that straw  lifting up a handful well you have no idea what an astonishing result will follow the application of the former to the lattersee  to my horror and evidently to the dismay of the men who did not seem to believe that he was in earnest jack brown thrust the blazing torch into the centre of the heap of straw  the men uttered a yell and rushing forward threw themselves on the smoking heap in the hope of smothering it at once  but jack applied the torch quickly to various parts  the flames leaped up  the men rolled off in agony  jack who somehow had managed to break his chain hopped after them showering the blazing straw on their heads and yelling as never mortal yelled before  in two seconds the whole place was in a blaze and i beheld jack actually throwing somersets with his one leg over the fire and through the smoke punching the heads of the four men most unmercifully catching up blazing handfuls of straw and thrusting them into their eyes and mouths in a way that quite overpowered me  i could restrain myself no longer  i began to roar in abject terror  in the midst of this dreadful scene the roof fell in with a hideous crash and jack bounding through the smoking debris cleared the walls and vanished  at the same moment i received a dreadful blow on the side and awoke to find myself lying on the floor of my bedroom and our manservant edwards furiously beating the bedcurtains which i had set on fire by upsetting the candle in my fall  why master robert gasped edwards sitting down and panting vehemently after having extinguished the flames wot have you been adoin of  i was standing speechless in the midst of my upset chair table and books glaring wildly when the man said this  edwards i replied with deep solemnity the mysterys cleared up at last  it has been all a dream  wots been all a dream  you haint bin a bed all night for the close is never touched an its broad daylight  wot has bin up  i might have replied that according to his own statement i had been up but i did not  i began gradually to believe that the dreadful scenes i had witnessed were not reality and an overpowering sense of joy kept filling my heart as i continued to glare at the man until i thought my chest would rend asunder  suddenly and without moving hand foot or eye i gave vent to a loud sharp hurrah  edwards startedeh  hurrah hurrah its a dream  hallo  i say you know come this wont  hurrah  bless my art master ro  again i interrupted him by seizing my cap swinging it round my head in an ecstasy of delight and uttering cheer upon cheer with such outrageous vehemence that edwards who thought me raving mad crept towards the door intending to bolt  he was prevented from carrying out his intention and violently overturned by the entrance of my father in dishabille  i sprang forward plucked the spectacles off his nose threw my arms round his neck and kissed him on both eyes  i wont run away now father no no no its all a dreama horrid dream ha ha ha  bob my dear boy  at this moment jack also in dishabille rushed in  hallo  bob whats all the row  i experienced a different but equally powerful gush of feeling on seeing my friend  leaving my father i rushed towards him and falling on his neck burst into tears  yes i confess it without shame reader if you had felt as i did you would have done the same  jack led me gently to my bed and seating me on the edge of it sat down beside me  i at once perceived from their looks that they all thought me mad and felt the necessity of calming me before taking more forcible measures  this tickled me so much that i laughed again heartily insomuch that jack could not help joining me  suddenly a thought flashed into my mind  my heart leaped to my throat and i glanced downwards  it was there  i seized jacks right leg tumbled him back into the bed and laying the limb across my knee grasped it violently  all right  i shouted straight firm muscular supple as ever  i squeezed harder  jack roared  i say bob gently  hold your tongue said i pinching the thigh  do you feel that  ho ah dont  and that  stop him  i say my dear boy have mercy  jack tried to raise himself but i tilted him back and grasping the limb in both arms hugged it  after breakfast jack and i retired to my room where the weather being unfavourable for our fishing excursion i went all over it again in detail  after that i sent jack off to amuse himself as he chose and seizing a quire of foolscap mended a pen squared my elbows and began to write this remarkable account of the reason why i did not become a sailor  i now present it to the juvenile public in the hope that it may prove a warning to all boys who venture to entertain the notion of running away from home and going to sea    story three chapter 1  papers from norway  norway 2nd july 1868  happening to be in norway just now and believing that young people feel an interest in the land of the old seakings i send you a short account of my experiences  up to this date i verily believe that there is nothing in the wide world comparable to this island coast of norway  at this moment we are steaming through a region which the fairies might rejoice to inhabit  indeed the fact that there are no fairies here goes far to prove that there are none anywhere  what a thought  no fairies  why all the romance of childhood would be swept away at one fell blow if i were to admit the idea that there are no fairies  perish the matteroffact thought  let me rather conclude that for some weighty though unknown reason the fairies have resolved to leave this island world uninhabited  fortune favours me  i have just come on deck after a two days voyage across the german ocean to find myself in the midst of innumerable islands a dead calmso dead that it seems impossible that it should ever come alive againand scenery so wild so gorgeous that one ceases to wonder where the vikings of old got their fire their romance their enterprise and their indomitable pluck  it is warm too and brilliantly sunny  on gazing at these tall grey rocks with the bright green patches here and there and an occasional redtiled hut one almost expects to see a fleet of daring rovers dash out of a sequestered bay with their long yellow hair and big blue eyes and broad shouldersnot to mention broadswords and ringmail and battleaxes  but one does not always see what one expects  the days of the seakings are gone by and at this moment rowing out of one of these same sequestered bays comes the boat of a customhouse officer  yes there is no doubt whatever about it there he comes a plainlooking unromantic man in a foragingcap with a blue surtout and brass buttons about as like to a seaking as a manofwar is to a muffin  of course the scenery is indescribableno scenery is describable in order that my reader may judge of the truth of this statement i append the following description  there are islands round us of every shape and sizeall of them more or less barren the greater part of their surfaces being exposed grey rock here and there may be seen as i have already hinted small patches of bright green and sparsely scattered everywhere are little redroofed wooden cottagespoor enough things the most of them others gaudylooking affairs with gableends white faces and windows bordered with green  all of these are while i write reflected in the water as in a mirror for there is not a breath of wind  over the islands on my left are seen more islands extending out to sea  on the right tower up the blue hills of the interior of old norway and although the weather is excessively hot many of these are covered with snow  everything is light and transparent and thin and blue and glassy and fairylike and magically beautiful and altogether delightful  there have you made much of all that good reader  if you have be thankful for as i set out by saying description of scenery at least to any good purpose is impossible  the description of a man however is quite another thing  here is our pilot  he is a rugged man with fair hair and a yellow face and a claycoloured chin and a red nose  he is small in stature and thin insignificant in appearance deeply miserable in aspect  his garments are black glazed oiledcloth from head to foot and immensely too large for him especially the waistcoat which is doublebreasted and seems to feel that his trousers are not a sufficient covering for such a pair of brittle looking legs for it extends at least half way down to his knees  the flap of his souwester also comes half way down his back  he is a wonderful object to look upon yet he has the audacity so it seems to me to take us in charge and our captain has the foolhardiness to allow him  if one goes out of the beaten track of routes in norway one is apt to get into difficulties of a minor kind  i happen to be travelling just now with a party of four friends of whom three are ladies the fourth a jolly young fellow fresh from college  a few days ago we had a few unusual experienceseven for norway  on leaving bergen we had made up our minds as the steamer did not sail to within about sixty miles of our destination to get ourselves and our luggage put down at a small hamlet at the mouth of the nordfjord and there engage two large boats to transport us the remaining sixty miles up the fjord  the ladies of our party valorously resolved to sit up all night to see the magnificent island scenery through which we were passing under the influence of the charming and subdued daylight of midnightfor there is no night here just now  as for myself being an old traveller i have become aware that sleep is essential to a comfortable and useful existence  i therefore bade my friends goodnight took a farewell look at the bright sky and the islands and the sleeping sea and went below to bed  next day we spent steaming along the island coast  at one oclock on the following morning we reached moldeoen where the steamer landed us on a rock on which were a few acres of grass and half a dozen wooden houses  we had a good deal of luggage with us also some casks cases and barrels of provisions and a pianoforte as our place of sojourn is somewhat out of the way and far removed from civilised markets  a few povertystricken natives stood on the rude stone pier as we landed and slowly assisted us to unload  at the time i conceived that the idiotical expression of their countenances was the result of being roused at untimely hours but our subsequent experience led me to change my mind in regard to this  in half an hour the steamer puffed away into the mysterious depths of one of the darkblue fjords and we were left on a desolate island like robinson crusoe with our worldly goods around us  most of the natives we found so stupid that they could not understand our excellent norse one fellow in particular might as well have been a piece of mahogany as a man  he stood looking at me with stolid imbecility while i was talking to him and made no reply when i had done  in fact the motion of his eyes as he looked at me alone betrayed the fact that he was flesh and blood  we soon found that two boats were not to be had that almost all the men of the place were away deepsea fishing and would not be back for many hours and that when they did come back they would be so tired as to require at least half a days rest ere they could undertake so long a journey with us  however they sent a man off in a boat to search for as many boatmen as could be found  he was away an hour  during this period the few inhabitants who had turned out to see the steamer disappeared and we were left alone on the beach  there was no inn here no one cared for us every place seemed dirty with the exception of one house which had a very lonely and deserted aspect so we did not venture to disturb it  in the course of time the messenger returned  no men were to be found except three  this was not a sufficient crew for even one large boat we required two  a feeling that we were homeless wanderers came over us now and each seating himself or herself on a box or a portmanteau began to meditate seeing this the three men coolly lay down to rest in the bow of their boat and drawing a sail over them were quickly sound asleep  the act suggested the idea that we could not do better so we placed two portmanteaus end to end and thus made a couch about six feet long  a box somewhat higher placed at one end served for a pillow and on this one of the ladies lay down flat on her back of course that being the only possible position under the circumstances  a shawl was thrown over her and she went to sleep like an effigy on a tombstone  another of the ladies tried a similar couch but as boxes of equal height could not be found her position was not enviable  the third lady preferred an uneasy posture among the ribs and cordage of the boat and i lay down on the pavingstones of the quay having found from experience that in the matter of beds flatness is the most indispensable of qualities while hardness is not so awful as one might suppose  where my comrade the collegian went to i know not  presently one of the ladies got up and said that this would never do that the next day was sunday and that we were in duty bound to do our best to reach the end of our journey on saturday night  thus admonished my comrade and i started up and resolved to become men that is to act as boatmen  no sooner said than done  we roused the three sleepers embarked the most important half of our luggage left the other half in charge of the native with the idiotic countenance with directions to take care of it and have it forwarded as soon as possible and at a little after two in the morning pulled vigorously away from the inhospitable shores of moldeoen  we started on our sixtymiles journey hopefully and went on our way for an hour or so with spirit  but when two hours had elapsed my companion and i began to feel the effects of rowing with unaccustomed muscles rather severely and gazed with envy at the three ladies who lay coiled up in an indescribable heap of shawls and crinolines in the stern of the boat sound asleep  they needed sleep poor things not having rested for two days and two nights  but my poor friend was more to be pitied than they  having scorned to follow my example and take rest when he could get the chance he now found himself unexpectedly called on to do the work of a man when he could not keep his eyes open  when our third hour began i saw that he was fast asleep at the oarlifting it indeed and dipping it in proper time but without pulling the weight of an ounce upon it  i therefore took it from him and told him to take half an hours nap when i would wake him up and expect him to take the oars and give me a rest  on being relieved he dropped his head on a sugarcask and was sound asleep in two minutes  i now felt drearily dismal  i began to realise the fact that we had actually pledged ourselves to work without intermission for the next eighteen or twenty hours of which two only had run and i felt sensations akin to what must have been those of the galleyslaves of old  in the midst of many deep thoughts and cogitations during that silent morning hour when all were asleep around me save the three mechanicallooking boatmen and when the only sounds that met my ears were the dip of the oars and the deep breathing to give it no other name of the slumberersin the midst of many deep thoughts i say i came to the conclusion that in my present circumstances the worst thing i could do was to think  i remembered the fable of the pendulum that became so horrified at the thought of the number of ticks it had to perform in a lengthened period of time that it stopped in despair and i determined to shut down my intellect  soon after my shoulders began to ache and in process of time i felt a sensation about the small of my back that induced the alarming belief that the spinal marrow was boiling  presently my wrists became cramped and i felt a strong inclination to pitch the oars overboard lie down in the bottom of the boat and howl  but feeling that this would be unmanly i restrained myself  just then my companion in sorrow began to snore so i awoke him andgiving him the oarswent to sleep  from this period everything in the history of that remarkable day became unconnected hazy and confusing  i became to some extent mechanical in my thoughts and actions  i rowed and rested and rowed again i ate and sang and even laughed  my comrade did the same like a true briton for he was game to the backbone  but the one great grand neverchanging idea in the day waspullpullpull  we had hoped during the course of that day to procure assistance but we were unsuccessful  we passed a number of fishermens huts but none of the men would consent to embark with us  at last late that night we reached a small farm about twothirds of the way up the fjord where we succeeded in procuring another large boat with a crew of five men here also we obtained a cup of coffee and while we were awaiting the arrival of the boat i lay down on the pier and had a short nap  none but those who have toiled for it can fully appreciate the blessing of repose  it was a clear calm night when we resumed our boat journey the soft daylight threw a species of magical effect over the great mountains and the glassy fjord as we rowed away with steady and vigorous strokes and i lay down in the bow of the boat to sleep  the end of the mast squeezed my shoulder the edge of a cask of beef wellnigh stove in my ribs the corner of a box bored a hole in the nape of my neckyet i went off like one of the famed seven sleepers and my friend although stretched out beside me in similarly unpropitious circumstances began to snore in less than five minutes after he laid down  the last sounds i heard before falling into a state of oblivion were the voices of our fair companions joining in that most beautiful of our sacred melodies the evening hymn ere they lay down to rest in the stern of the boat  next morning at nine we arrived at the top of the fjord and at the end for a time at least of our journeying    story three chapter 2  salmonfishing extraordinary  norway 14th july 1868  yesterday was a peculiar day in my experience of salmonfishing in norway  the day was dull when i set out for the river seven miles distant in a small boat with a norseman  a sevenmiles pull was not a good beginning to a days salmonfishing the weight of my rod being quite sufficient to try the arms without that but there was no help for it arrived there i got a native named anders to carry the bag and gaff  anders is a fair youth addicted to going about with his mouth open with a mild countenance and a turnedup nose  good weather for fishing anders said i in norse  ya said he megit god very good  this was the extent of our conversation at that time for we came suddenly on the first pool in the river and i soon perceived that although the weather was good enough the river was so flooded as to be scarcely fishable  and now began a series of petty misfortunes that gradually reduced me to a state of misery which was destined to continue throughout the greater part of that day  but hope told me flattering talesnot to say storiesfor a considerable time and it was not until i had fished the third pool without seeing a fin that my heart began fairly to sink the day too had changed from a cloudy to a rainy one and anders nose began to droop while his face elongated visibly  feeling much depressed i sat down on a wet stone in my wet garments and lunched off a moist biscuit a piece of tongue and a lump of cheese  this was consoling as far as it went but it did not go far the misty clouds obliterated the mountains the rain drizzled from the skies percolated through the brim of my hat trickled down my nose and dropped upon my luncheon  now we shall go up the river anders said i  anders assented as he would have done had i proposed going down the river or across the river or anywhere in the wide world for as i said it in english he did not understand me  evidently he did not care whether he understood me or not  up the river we went to the best pool in it  the place was a torrent unfishableso deep that i could not wade in far enough to cast over the spot where fish are wont to lie  in making a desperate effort to get far in i went over the boottop and my legs and feet which hitherto had been dry had immediate cause to sympathise with the rest of my person  anders face became longer than ever  all the best pools in the river were tried but without success and at last towards evening we turned to retrace our steps down the valley  on the way i took another cast into the best poolgoing deeper than the waist into the water in order to cast over the right spot  the effort was rewarded  i hooked a fish and made for the bank as fast as possible  my legs were like solid pillars or enormous sausages by reason of the long boots being full to bursting with water  to walk was difficult to run in the event of the fish requiring me to do so impossible  i therefore lay down on the bank and tossed both legs in the air to let the water run outholding on to the fish the while  the water did run outit did more it ran right along my backbone to the nape of my neck completing the saturation which the rain had hitherto failed to accomplish  but i had hooked a fish and heeded it not  he was a small one only ten pounds so we got him out quickly and without much trouble  yet this is not always the case  little fish are often the most obstreperous and the most troublesome  it was only last week that i hooked and landed a twentyeightpound salmon and he did not give me half the trouble that i experienced from one which i caught yesterday  well having bagged him we proceeded on our homeward way anders face shortening visibly and his nose rising while my own spirits began to improve  at another pool i tried again and almost at the first cast hooked an eighteenpounder which anders gaffed after about twentyminutes play  we felt quite jolly now although it rained harder than ever and we went on our way rejoicinganders countenance reduced to its naturally short proportions  presently we came to an old weir or erection for catching fish as they ascend the river where lies one of our favourite pools  the water was running down it like a millrace  pent up by the artificial dike the whole river in this place gushes down in a turbulent rapid  there was one comparatively smooth bit of water which looked unpromising enough but being in hopeful spirits now i resolved on a final cast  about the third cast a small trout rose at the fly  the greedy little monsters have a tendency to do this  many a small trout have i hooked with a salmon fly as large as its own head  before i could draw the line to cast again the usual heavy wauble of a salmon occurred near the fly it was followed by the whir of the reel as the line flew out like lightning sawing right through the skin of my fingers which by the way are now so seamed and scarred that writing is neither so easy nor so pleasant as it used to be  the burst that now ensued was sudden and tremendous  the salmon flashed across the pool then up the pool then down the pool  it was evidently bent on mischief  my heart misgave me for the place is a bad oneall full of stumps and stones with the furious rapid before mentioned just below and the rough unsteady stones of the old dike as an uncertain pathway to gallop over should the fish go down the river  i held on stoutly for a few seconds as he neared the head of the rapid but there is a limit to the endurance of rods and tackle  what made the matter worse was that the dike on which i stood terminated in a small island to get from which to the shore necessitated swimming and if he should go down the big rapid there was little chance of his stopping until he should reach the foot of itfar below this island  all at once he turned tail and went down head first  i let the line fly now keeping my fingers well clear of it  hes off anders  i shouted as i took to my heels at full speed  hurroohoooo yelled the norseman flying after me with the gaff  how i managed to keep my footing in the rush over the broken dike i know not  it is a marvel to me  the bushes on the island overhung the water the earth having been cut away by the force of the rapid  i tried to pull up because they were too thick to crash through but the fish willed it otherwise  the line was getting low on the reel the rod bent double presently i had to straighten it outin another moment i was in the water over the boots which filled of course in a moment but this did not impede me as long as i was in deep water  i was forsaken at this point by anders who sought and found a safe passage to the mainland where he stood gazing at me with his eyes blazing and his mouth wide open  i soon reached the end of the island to my horror for i had not previously taken particular note of the formation of the land there  a gulf of water of five or six yards broad of unknown depth lay between me and that shore by which in the natural course of things i should have followed my fish as far as he chose  the rapid itself looked less tremendous than this deep black hole  i hesitated but the salmon did not  still down he went  now then thought i hole or rapid  the question was settled for me for before i could decide i was hauled into the rapid  no doubt i was a more than halfwilling captive anyhow willing or not willing down i went  ah what a moment of ease and relief from exertion was that when i went a little deeper than the waist and found myself borne pleasantly along on tiptoe as light as one of those beautiful balls with which juvenilesin these highly favoured daysare wont to sport in the fields  and ohhoo how my spirit seemed to gush out through my mouth and nose or out at the top of my head when the cold water encircled my neck as i lost my footing altogether and struck out with my right hand endeavouring the while to support my rod in the left  i heard anders gasp at this point but i saw him not  in another second my knees came into violent contact with a rock alas every motion of my body as i now write reminds me painfully of that crash immediately after this i was sprawling up the bank having handed the rod to anders to hold while i tossed my legs again in the air to get rid of the water which weighed me down like lead  how earnestly i wished that i could tear these boots off and fling them away  but there was no time for that  on regaining my legs i seized the rod and found that the salmon had brought up in an eddy created by the tail of a gravelbank in the centre of the river between two rapids  good i gasped blandly  anders smiled  presently i found that it was the reverse of good for when i tried to wind in the line and move the fish i perceived that the resistance offered was not like that of a salmon but a stump  i do believe hes gone  i exclaimed  anders became grave  no fish there said i gloomily  anders face elongated  he has wound the line round a stump and broken off said i in despair  woe of the deepest profundity was depicted on anders visage  for full five minutes i tried every imaginable device short of breaking the rod to clear the linein vain  then i gave the rod to anders to hold and taking the gaff with me i went sulkily up the river and again taking to the water made my way to the head of the gravelbank over which i walked slowly oppressed in spirit and weighed down by those abominable boots which had once more filled to overflowing waterproof boots are worse than useless for this sort of work  but happily this is not the usual style of thing that one experiences in norwegian fishing  it is only occasionally that one enjoys a treat of the kind  in the middle of the gravelbank the water was only three inches deep so i lay down on my back and once again elevating my ponderous legs in the air allowed a cataract of water to flow over me  somewhat lightened i advanced into the hole  it was deeper than i thought  i was up to the middle in a moment and sighed as i thought of the boots full again  before i reached the line the water was up to my shoulders but it was the still water of the eddy  i soon caught the line and found that it was round a stump as i had feared  with a heavy heart i eased it offwhen lo a tug sent an electric shock through my benumbed body and i saw the salmon not three yards off at the bottom of the pool  he also saw me and darting in terror from side to side wound the line round me  i passed it over my head however and was about to let it go to allow anders to play it out and finish the work when the thought occurred that i might play it myself by running the line through my fingers when he should pull and hauling in when he should stop  i tried this successfully  in half a minute more i drew him to within a yard of my side gaffed him near the tail and carried him up the gravelbank under my arm  he was not a large fish after allonly thirteen pounds  nevertheless had he been fresh it would have been scarcely possible for me to hold his strong slippery body  even when exhausted he gave me some trouble gaining the shallowest part of the bank i fell on my knees crammed the fingers of my left hand into his mouth and gills and held him down while i terminated his career with a stone  thereafter i fixed the hook more securely in his jaw and launching him into the rapid left anders to haul him out while i made the best of my way to the shore  this is about the roughest experience i have yet had of salmonfishing in norway  the season this year bids fair to be a pretty good one  i have had about twelve days fishing and have caught sixteen fish weighing together two hundred and seventysix pounds two of them being twentyeightpounders  the end
