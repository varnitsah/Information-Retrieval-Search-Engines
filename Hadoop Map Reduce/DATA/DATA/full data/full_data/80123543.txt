80123543	the walrus hunters by rm ballantyne 18251894 1893    this book is full of action  it deals with both a tribe of red indians of the dogrib nation and a tribe of eskimos  normally a certain animosity existed between these two but this tale relates how under certain circumstances members of these tribes could not only become close friends and work together towards a common goal but also intermarry  there is no doubt but that the reader will have a greater knowledge of the ways and thoughts of the indian and the eskimo and kindly feelings towards both after reading this bookan easy task for it is a good and absorbing read  in this little preface we have deliberately used the oldfashioned terms for the two races fully aware that they are both inexact and that today we would for instance use the term inuit instead of eskimo however this book was written in 1893 and things were different then  it has been written of ballantyne that in the last years before his death in 1894 the quality of his work was failing and indeed repetitive  anyone reading this book can see that this is untrue for it is one of his very best  indeed it is a strange thing that his earlier books which were wellpromoted upon their publication should still be so much more read than his later ones  while working upon this edition of the walrus hunters we found ourselves several times reflecting upon this strange state of affairs  robert michael ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894  he was educated at the edinburgh academy and in 1841 he became a clerk with the hudson bay company working at the red river settlement in northern canada until 1847 arriving back in edinburgh in 1848  the letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters  three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade the young fur traders ungava the hudson bay company and were based on his experiences with the hbc  in this period he also wrote the coral island and martin rattler both of these taking place in places never visited by ballantyne  having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about  with these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers  he researched the cornish mines the london fire brigade the postal service the railways the laying down of submarine telegraph cables the construction of lighthouses the lightship service the lifeboat service south africa norway the north sea fishing fleet ballooning deepsea diving algiers and many more experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time and he lived as they lived  he was a very truetolife author depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail  his young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen sometimes four in a year all very good reading  the rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life but the quality never failed  he published over ninety books under his own name and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym comus  for todays taste his books are perhaps a little too religious and what we would nowadays call pi  in part that was the way people wrote in those days but more important was the fact that in his days at the red river settlement in the wilds of canada he had been a little dissolute and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave as he felt he had been  some of his books were quite short little over 100 pages  these books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents having less pocketmoney  these books are particularly wellwritten and researched because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money  they were published as six series three books in each series    the walrus hunters a tale of life on the arctic shores of canada by rm ballantyne    chapter one  a romance of the iceworld  a surprise a combat and a feed  there is a river in america which flows to the northwestward of great bear lake and helps to drain that part of the great wilderness into the arctic sea  it is an insignificant stream compared with such wellknown waterways as the mackenzie and the coppermine nevertheless it is large enough to entice the whitewhale and the seal into its waters every spring and it becomes a restingplace for myriads of wildfowl while on their passage to and from the breedinggrounds of the far north  greygoose river was the name given to it by the dogrib indians who dwelt in its neighbourhood and who were wont every spring and autumn to descend its waters nearly to the sea in quest of game  the eskimos who coming from the mysterious north were in the habit of ascending it a short way during open water in pursuit of their peculiar prey named it whale river  the indians and eskimos did not often meet while on these trips  they did not like meeting because the result was apt to be disastrous besides the land was wide and the game plentiful enough for both so that they were not much tempted to risk a meeting  occasionally however meetings and encounters did take place and sometimes bitter feuds arose but the possession of firearms by the indianswho were supplied by the furtradersrendered the eskimos wary  their headstrong courage however induced the red men to keep as much as possible out of their way  in short there was a good deal of the spirit of letbe for letbe between the two at the time of which we write  one morning in the springtime of the year soon after the floods caused by the melting snows had swept the ice clean out of greygoose or whale river a sturdy young eskimo urged his sharp kayak or skincovered canoe up the stream in pursuit of a small whitewhale  but the creature gave him the slip so that after an energetic chase he turned his light vessel towards the left bank of the stream intending to land  cheenbuk for such was his name was one of those sedate beings whose energies run calm and deep like a mighty river  this feelings whatever they might be did not usually cause much agitation on the surface  disappointment did not visibly depress nor did success unduly elate him  the loss of the whale failed to disturb the placid look of grave contentment which sat on his goodlooking countenance  for it must be noted here that cheenbuk was a handsome savageif indeed we are entitled to style him a savage at all  his features were good and strongly marked  his young beard and moustache were black though not bushy  his dark eyes were large and full of tenderness which expression by an almost imperceptible raising of eyelid and contraction of brow was easily transmuted into a gaze of ferocity or indignation  his bulky frame was clothed in the sealskin garb peculiar to his people his hair was straight voluminous and unkempt and his motions gave indication of great strength combined with agility  and no wonder for a large part of our young eskimos life had been spent in battling with the forces of nature and the hardships of life as displayed in the arctic regionsto say nothing of frequent conflicts with the seal the walrus and the polar bear  running his kayak among the rushes of a small inlet cheenbuk stepped out of the hole in its centre into the stream  the water was ankledeep but the youth suffered no discomfort for he wore what may be styled homemade waterproof boots reaching to above the knees  these had been invented by his forefathers no doubt in the remote ages of antiquityat all events long before indiarubber had been discovered or macintosh was born  drawing his little craft out of the water the young man took some food from its interior and was about to begin his truly simple meal by eating it raw when a distant sound arrested his hand on the way to his mouth  he turned his head slightly on one side and remained for some moments like a singularly attentive statue  presently the voice of a wildgoose was faintly heard in the far distance  evidently the young eskimo desired a change of fare for he laid down the slice of raw seal on which he had been about to regale himself and disengaged a long slender spear from the bow of his kayak  it is wellknown that wildgeese will with proverbial stupidity answer to an imitation of their cry particularly in spring  indeed they will answer to a very bad imitation of it insomuch that the poorest counterfeit will turn them out of their course and attract them towards the crier  availing himself of this weakness our eskimo hid himself behind a bush and was opening his mouth to give vent to a stentorian goosecall when he was checked and apparently petrified by a loud report which echoed among the neighbouring cliffs  the youth knew the sound well  he had heard it only once before but once heard it could never be forgotten  it was the gun or as his people called it the firespouter of an indian  plunging quietly into the underwood he hastened towards the spot where a little wreath of smoke betrayed the position of what may be almost styled his hereditary foe  cautiously carefully and with a catlike motion that could hardly have been excelled by an indian brave cheenbuk advanced until he reached the edge of a partially clear space in which he beheld an indian leisurely engaged in pushing the head of a large grey goose under his belt  at his side leaning against a tree was the longbarrelled fowlingpiece which he had just reloaded  it was one of those common cheap flintlock affairs which were supplied by the furtraders in those days  the indian was a tall powerfully built middleaged man and from his look and manner was evidently unsuspicious of the presence of a foe he seemed to be quite alone  the eskimo poised his light spear but hesitated to launch it  he shrank from killing a defenceless foe  the hesitation betrayed him for at the moment the sharp ear of the red man heard and his eye discovered him  the gun flew to the indians shoulder and the eskimo launched his spear but by good fortune both weapons failed  the welldirected spear was cleverly dodged and the gun missed fire  to recock the weapon take a more deadly aim and pull the trigger was the work of three seconds but again the flint proved faithless cheenbuk however divined the meaning of the attempt and sprang upon his foe to prevent a repetition of the action though he was now practically unarmedfor the little stone knife which he carried in his bosom was but ill suited for deadly combat  the indian clubbed his gun to meet the onset but the eskimo evading the first blow caught hold of the weapon with both hands and now began a fierce and prolonged struggle for possession of the firespouter  both hands of each combatant being engaged neither could venture to draw his knife and as the men were pretty equally matched both as to size and strength they swayed to and fro with desperate energy for a considerable time each endeavouring to throw the other while the sweat poured down their faces and their breathing came in fitful gasps  at length there was a pause in the conflict  it seemed as if they had stopped by mutual consent to recover breath for a final effort  as they glared into each others faces each felt surprised to see little or nothing of the evidence of that deadly hatred which usually characterises implacable foes  suddenly cheenbuk relaxed his grip of the gun and stepped back a pace  in so doing he put himself to some extent at least at the mercy of his adversary  with quick perception the indian recognised the fact  he drew himself up and dropped the gun on the ground  why should we fight  the huntinggrounds are wide enough he said in the grave sententious tones peculiar to his race  that is just what came to my thought when i let go answered the more matteroffact eskimo  let us part then as friends returned the red man and let us do it in the manner of the palefaced traders  he extended his right hand as he spoke  cheenbuk who had heard a rumour of the white mans customsprobably from men of his race who had met with the crews of whalersadvanced grasped the extended hand and shook it in a way that might have done credit to any englishman  he smiled at the same time with a slightly humorous expression but the other maintained his solemnity  fun is not a prominent characteristic of the red man  but there is no need that we should part before feeding said the eskimo  waugh replied the indian by which it is to be presumed he signified assent  the reconciled foes being both adepts in the art of cookery andone of them at leastin woodcraft it was not long before a large fire was blazing under a convenient firtree and the grey goose soon hissed pleasantly in front of it  they were a quiet and selfcontained couple however and went about their work in profound silence  not that they lacked ideas or languagefor each being naturally a good linguist had somehow acquired a smattering of the others tonguebut they resembled each other in their disinclination to talk without having something particular to say and in their inclination to quietness and sobriety of demeanour  here however the resemblance ceased for while the eskimo was free and easy ready to learn and to sympathise and quick to see and appreciate a joke the indian was sternly conservative much impressed with his own rectitude of intention as well as his capacity for action and absolutely devoid of the slightest tinge of humour  thus the eskimos expression varied somewhat with the nature of the subjects which chased each other through his mind while that of the red man never changed from the calm of dignified immobilityexcept of course when as during the recent struggle his life was in danger  while the goose was roasting the erstwhile foes sat down to watch the process  they had not to watch long for the fire was strong and neither of them was particular  indeed the eskimo would gladly have eaten his portion raw but waited patiently out of deference to what he deemed his companions prejudices  you are alone said the eskimo interrogatively  yesalone returned the indian  to such men this was mental food for at least a quarter of an hour  by the end of that time one side of the bird was sufficiently done  the indian turned the stick on which it was impaled drew his scalpingknife and commenced on the side that was ready while the other side was being done  cheenbuk drew his stone knife cut a large slice of the breast and also fell to work  they ate vigorously yet the process was not soon over for the goose was large and their appetites were strong  of course they had no time or inclination for conversation during the meal  when it was finished the grey goose was reduced to a miserable skeleton  then both men sighed the sigh of contentment wiped their knives on the grass and looked gravely at each other  cheenbuk seemed as if about to speak but was arrested in his intention by the strange and unaccountable proceedings of his companion who now drew forth a gaily decorated bag which hung at his belt behind him from this he extracted a whitish implement with a little bowl at one end and having leisurely filled it with a brown substance also drawn from the bag he put the other or small end of the instrument between his teeth  then he took up a burning stick and applied it to the bowl  the eskimo had been gazing at him with everwidening eyes but at this his mouth also began to open and he gave vent to a gentle ho of unutterable surprise for immediately there burst from the indians lips a puff of smoke as if he had suddenly become a gun or firespouter and gone off unexpectedly  there was profound interest as well as astonishment in the gaze of our eskimo for he now became aware that he was about to witness a remarkable custom of the red men of which he had often heard but which he had never clearly understood  does it not burn he asked in breathless curiosity  no replied his friend  do you like it  hii  the exclamation was induced by the indian who at the moment sent a stream of smoke from each nostril shut his eyes as he did so opened his mouth and otherwise exhibited symptoms of extreme felicity  would you like to try it he asked after one or two more whiffs  cheenbuk accepted the offer and the pipe drew a voluminous whiff down into his lungs and exploded in a violent fit of coughing while the tears overflowed his eyes  try again said the indian gravely  for some minutes the eskimo found it difficult to speak then he returned the pipe saying no  my inside is not yet tough like yours i will lookand wonder  after being admiredwith wonderfor a considerable time the indian looked at his companion earnestly again offered him the pipe and said try again  the obliging eskimo tried again but with the caution of a child who having been burnt dreads the fire  he drew in a little smoke by means of the power of inhalation and choked again slightly but being now on his mettle he resolved not to be beaten  the indian regarded him meanwhile with grave approval  then it occurred to cheenbuk to apply the power of suction instead of inhalation  it was successful  he filled his mouth instead of his lungs and in his childlike delight at the triumph he opened his mouth to its full extent and sent forth a cloud with a gasp which was the combined expression of a puff and a ho  again he tried it and was again successful  overjoyed at this like a child with a new toy he went in for quite a broadside of puffs looking round at his friendly foe with a ho between each and surrounding his head with an atmosphere of smoke  suddenly he stopped laid down the pipe rose up and looking as if he had forgotten something retired into the bush  the indian took up the discarded pipe and for the first time displayed a few wrinkles about the corners of his eyes as he put it between his lips  presently cheenbuk returned somewhat paler than before and sat down in silence with a look as if of regret at the skeletongoose  without any reference to what had passed the indian turned to his companion and said why should the men of the ice fight with the men of the woods  why asked cheenbuk after a few moments profound meditation why should the men of the woods attack the men of the ice with their firespouters  this question seemed to puzzle the indian so much that he proceeded to fill another pipe before answering it  meanwhile the eskimo being more activeminded continued  is it fair for the men of the woods to come to fight us with firespouters when we have only spears  meet us with the same weapons and then we shall see which are the best men  the indian looked at his companion solemnly and shook his head  the strongest warriors and the best fighters he said are not always the best men  he who hunts well keeps his wives supplied with plenty of food and deerskin robes and is kind to his children is the best man  cheenbuk looked suddenly in the face of his sententious companion with earnest surprise in every feature for the sentiments which had just been expressed were in exact accordance with his own  moreover they were not what he expected to hear from the lips of a dogrib  i never liked fighting he said in a low voice though i have always been able to fight  it does nobody any good and it always does everybody much harm for it loses much blood and it leaves many women and children without foodproviderswhich is uncomfortable for the men who have enough of women and children of their own to hunt for  but continued the youth with emphasis i always thought that the men of the woods loved fighting  some of them do but i hate it said the indian with a sudden look of such ferocity that the eskimo might have been justified in doubting the truth of the statement  the flash however quickly disappeared and a double wreath of smoke issued from his nose as he remarked quietly fighting lost me my father my two brothers and my only son  why then do you still come against us with firespouters asked cheenbuk  because my people will have it so returned the red man  i do what i can to stop them but i am only one and there are many against me  i too have tried to stop my people when they would fight among themselves returned the eskimo in a tone of sympathy but it is easier to kill a walrus singlehanded than to turn an angry man from his purpose  the indian nodded assent as though a chord had been struck which vibrated in both bosoms  my son he said in a patronising tone do not cease to try  grey hairs are beginning to show upon my head i have seen and learned much and i have come to know that only he who tries and tries and tries again to do what he knows is right will succeed  to him the great manitou will give his blessing  my father replied the other falling in readily with the fictitious relationship i will try  having thus come to a satisfactory agreement this arctic peace society prepared to adjourn  each wiped his knife on the grass and sheathed it as he rose up  then they shook hands again after the fashion of the palefaces and departed on their respective ways  the red man returned to the wigwams of his people while the young eskimo descending the river in his kayak continued to hunt the whitewhale and pursue the feathered tribes which swarmed in the creeks rivulets and marshes that bordered the iceencumbered waters of the polar seas    chapter two  waruskeek  alas for the hopes and efforts of good men  at the very time that cheenbuk and the indian were expressing their detestation of war elsewhere a young eskimo was doing his best to bring about that unhappy and ruinous condition of things  he was an unusually strong young arctic swashbuckler with considerably more muscle than brains a restless spirit and what may be styled a homicidal tendency  he was also tyrannical like many men of that stamp and belonged to the same tribe as cheenbuk  walrus creek was the summer residence of the tribe of eskimos to which cheenbuk belonged  it was a narrow inlet which ran up into a small island lying some distance off the northern shores of america to discover and coast along which has been for so many years the aim and ambition of arctic explorers  how it came by its name is not difficult to guess  probably in ages past some adventurous voyagers whose names and deeds have not been recorded in history observing the numbers of walruses which scrambled out of the sea to sun themselves on the cliffs of the said creek had named it after that animal and the natives had adopted the name  like other aborigines they had garbled it however and handed it down to posterity as waruskeek while the walruses perhaps in order to justify the name had kept up the custom of their forefathers and continued to sun themselves there as in days of yore seals also abounded in the inlet and multitudes of aquatic birds swarmed around its cliffs  the eskimo village which had been built there unlike the snowhut villages of winter was composed chiefly of huts made of slabs of stone intermingled with moss and clay  it was exceeding dirty owing to remnants of blubber shreds of skins and bones innumerable which were left lying about  there might have been about forty of these huts at the doors of whichor the openings which served for doorsonly women and children were congregated at the time we introduce them to the reader  all the men with the exception of a few ancients were away hunting  in the centre of the village there stood a hut which was larger and a little cleaner than the others around it  an oldish man with a grey beard was seated on a stone bench beside the door  if tobacco had been known to the tribe he would probably have been smoking  in default of that he was thrown back upon meditation  apparently his meditations were not satisfactory for he frowned portentously once or twice and shook his head  you are not pleased today mangivik said a middleaged woman who issued from the hut at the moment and sat down beside the man  no woman i am not he answered shortly  mangivik meant no disrespect by addressing his wife thus  woman was the endearing term used by him on all occasions when in communication with her  what troubles you  are you hungry  no  i have just picked a walrus rib clean  it is not that  he pointed as he spoke to a huge bone of the animal referred to  no it is not that he repeated  what then  is it something you may not tell me asked the woman in a wheedling tone as she crossed her legs and toyed with the flap of her tail  lest the civilised reader should be puzzled we may here remark that the costume of the husband and wife whom we have introducedas indeed of most if not all eskimo men and womenis very similar in detail as well as material  mangivik wore a coat or shirt of sealskin with a hood to it and his legs were encased in boots of the same material which were long enough to cover nearly the whole of each leg and meet the skirt of the coat  the feet of the boots were of tough walrushide and there was a short peak to the coat behind  the only difference in the costume of the woman was that the hood of her coat was larger to admit of infants and other things being carried in it and the peak behind was prolonged into a tail with a broad flap at the end  this tail varied a little in length according to the taste of the wearerlike our ladies skirts but in all cases it was long enough to trail on the ground perhaps we should say the iceand from the varied manner in which different individuals caused it to sweep behind them it was evident that the tail not less than the civilised skirt served the purpose of enabling the wearers to display more or less of graceful motion  there is nothing that i have to hide from my woman said the amiable eskimo in reply to her question  only i am troubled about that jumpabout man gartok  has he been here again asked the wife with something of a frown on her fat face  he is just as you say a jumpabout like the little birds that come to us in the hot times which dont seem to know what they want  he is too big to look like them returned the husband  hes more like a mad walrus  i met him on one of the old floes when i was after a seal and he frightened it away  but it is not that that troubles me there are two things he is after he wants to stir up our young men to go and fight with the firespouters and he wants our nootka for a wife  the dirty walrus exclaimed mrs mangivik with as much vigour as if she had been civilised he shall never have nootka  as for fighting with the firespouters i only hope that if he does go to do so he will get killed and never come back  hm grunted mangivik if he does get killed hes not likely to come back  who is not likely to come back asked a young girl with an affectionate expression in her pretty brown eyes issuing from the hut at that moment and seating herself close to the old man  the girls face on the whole was unusually pretty for that of an eskimo and would have been still more so but for the grease with which it was besmearedfor the damsel had just been having a little refreshment of whitewhale blubber  her figure was comparatively slim and graceful and would have been obviously so but for the illfitting coat and clumsy boots with which it was covered  your mother and i were talking of a bad man nootka said mangivik  ay a very very bad man exclaimed mrs mangivik with a decided nod of her head  if he is so very bad returned nootka it would be good that he should never come back  who is it  gartok answered her mother with the air of one who has mentioned the most hateful thing in creation  nootka laughed  surely you are not fond of him exclaimed mangivik regarding his daughter with a look of anxiety  you know that im not answered the girl playfully hitting her sire on the back with the flap of her tail  of course notof course not you could not be fond of an ugly walrus like him said the father replying to her pleasantry by fondly patting her knee  just then a young man was seen advancing from the beach where he had left his kayak  it is oolalik said mrs mangivik shading her eyes with her hand from the sun which in all the strength of its meridian splendour was shining full on her fat face  he must have made a good hunt or he would not have come home before the others  as she spoke nootka arose hastily and reentered the hut from out of which there issued almost immediately the sounds and the savoury odours of roasting flesh  meanwhile oolalik came up and gave vent to a polite grunt or some such sound which was the eskimo method of expressing a friendly salutation  mangivik and his wife grumped in reply  you are soon back said the former  i have left a walrus and two seals on the rocks over there answered the youth sitting down beside the old man  good returned the latter  come in and feed  he rose and entered the hut  the young man who followed him was not so much a handsome as a strapping fellow with a quiet sedate expression and a manly look that rendered him attractive to most of his friends conversation however was not one of his strong points  he volunteered no remarks after seating himself opposite to nootka who handed him a walrus rib which she had just cooked over the oil lamp  had nootka been a civilised girl she might have been suspected of conveying a suggestion to the youth for she was very fond of him but being an eskimo of the far north she knew nothing about ribs or of mother eve  the young man however required no delicate suggestion for he was equally fond of nootka and he endeavoured to show his feelings by a prolonged stare after he had accepted the food  one is irresistibly impressed with the homogeneity of the human race when one observes the curious similarities of taste and habit which obtain alike in savage and civilised man  for a few moments this youths feelings were too much for him  he stared in admiration at the girl apparently oblivious of the rib and sighed profoundly  then he suddenly recovered himself appeared to forget the girl and applied himself tooth and nail to the rib  could anything be more naturaleven in a european prince  nootka did not speakyoung women seldom do among savages at least in the company of menbut she looked many and very unutterable things which it is impossible and would not be fair to translate  will the others be back soon asked mangivik  oolalik looked over the rib and nodded  in this last also there was indication of homogeneity  have they got much meat  again the young man nodded  good  there is nothing like meat and plenty of it  the old man proceeded to illustrate his belief in the sentiment by devoting himself to a steak of satisfying dimensions  his betterhalf meanwhile took up the conversation  is gartok with them she asked  yes he is with them said the youth who having finished the rib threw away the bone and looked across the lamp at nootka as if asking for another  the girl had one ready and handed it to him  again oolalik was overcome  he forgot the food and stared so that nootka dropped her eyes presumably in some confusion but once more the force of hunger brought the youth round and he resumed his meal  has gartok killed much continued the inquisitive mrs mangivik  i know nothing about gartok replied the young man a stern look taking the place of his usually kind expression i dont trouble my head about him when i am hunting  he fastened his teeth somewhat savagely in the second rib at this point  do you know said mangivik pausing in his occupation that gartok has been trying to get the young men to go to the whale river where you know there are plenty of birds and much wood  he wants to fight with the firespouters  yes i know it  gartok is always for fighting and quarrelling  he likes it  dont you think said the old man suggestively that you could give him a chance of getting what he likes without going so far from home  no i dont choose to fight for the sake of pleasing every fool who delights to brag and look fierce  mrs mangivik laughed at this and her daughter giggled but the old man shook his head as if he had hoped better things of the young one  he said no more however and before the conversation was resumed the voice of a boy was heard outside  anteek murmured nootka with a smile of pleasure  the other hunters must have arrived said oolalik polishing off his last bone for anteek was with them  he always comes first to see me when he has anything to tell remarked mrs mangivik with a laugh and from the noise he makes i think he has something to tell today  if noise was the true index of anteeks news he evidently was brimful for he advanced shouting at the top of his voice  with that unaccountable ingenuity which characterises some boys all the world over he produced every sort of sound except that which was natural to him and caused the surrounding cliffs to echo with the mooing of the walrus the roaring of the polar bear the shriek of the plover the bellow of the muskox and in short the varied cries of the whole arctic menagerie  but he stopped short at the door of the hut and looked at oolalik in evident surprise  you are back before me he said  that is not strange i am stronger  yes but i started off long before you  so you thought but you were mistaken  i saw you creeping away round the point  when you were out of sight i carried my kayak over the neck of land and so got here before you  have you told asked the boy anxiously  never said a word replied oolalik  here said nootka holding out a piece of halfcooked blubber to the boy sit down and tell us all about it  what is the news  ha exclaimed anteek accepting the food as if he appreciated it well ive killed my first walrusall alone too  clever boy how was it said mrs mangivik  this was the way  i was out by myselfall alone mindamong the cliffs looking for eggs but i had my spear with me the big one that cheenbuk made for me just before he went off to the whale river  well just as i was going to turn round one of the cliffs i caught sight of a walrusa big onemonstrous like that he said drawing an imaginary circle with both arms fat brown huge tusks and wide awake  i knew that because his back was to me and he was turning his head about looking at something in the other direction  i was astonished for though they climb up on the cliffs a good height to sun themselves on the warm rocks i had never seen one climb so high as that  well i drew back very quick and began to creep round so as to come at him when he didnt expect me  i soon got close enough and ran at him he tried to flop away at first but when i was close he turned and looked fierceterrible fierce  my heart jumped but it did not sink i aimed for his heart but just as i was close at him my foot struck a stone and i fell  he gave a frightful roar and i rolled out of his way and something twisted the spear out of my hand  when i jumped up what do you think  i found the spear had gone into one of his eyes and that made the other one water i suppose for he was twisting his head about but couldnt see me  so i caught hold of the spear pulled it out and plunged it into his side but i had not reached the heart for he turned and made for the sea  there was a steep place just there and he tumbled and rolled down  i lost my foothold and rolled down tooalmost into his flippers but i caught hold of a rock  he got hold at the same time with his tusks and held on  then i jumped up and gave him the spear again  this time i hit the life and soon had him killed  there  on concluding his narrative the excited lad applied himself to his yet untasted piece of blubber and nootka plied him with questions while oolalik rose and went off to assist his comrades whose voices could now be heard as they shouted to the women and children of the colony to come and help them to carry up the meat    chapter three  peace or warwhich  soon afterwards the mangivik family received another visitor  this was the bellicose gartok himself whose heart had been touched by the fair nootka  like his rival he sat down opposite the maiden and stared at her impressively across the cookinglamp  this would seem to be the usual mode of courtship among those children of the ice but the girls mode of receiving the attentions of the second lover varied considerably she did not drop her eyes shyly under his gaze but stared him full in the face by way of a slight rebuff  neither did she prepare for him a savoury rib so that he was obliged to help himselfwhich he did with much coolness for the laws of hospitality in eskimoland admit of such conduct  after some desultory conversation between gartok and his host the latter asked if it was true that there was a talk of the tribe paying a visit to whale river  yes it is true answered the young man  i came to see you about that very thing and to tell you that there is to be a meeting outside the big hut today  we shall want your advice  why do the young men wish to go there asked mangivik  to get food and wood for our spearhandles and sledges and berries and to have a good time  perhaps also to fight a little with the firespouters  the youth glanced furtively at mangivik as he concluded  to get food and wood and berries is good observed the old man but why fight with the firespouters  we cannot conquer them  you can ask that at the meeting  it is useless to ask it of me  good i will do so  for my part i am too old to go on long expeditions either to hunt or fightbut i can give advice  is cheenbuk to be at the meeting  did you not know  cheenbuk has already gone to the whale river  we only propose to follow him  he may not like our business but hell have to join us when we are there  having picked his rib clean and receiving no encouragement from nootka to remain gartok rose and departed  that afternoon there was a large meeting of the heads of families in front of what was known as the big hut  there was no formality about the meeting  unlike the war councils of the indians it was a sort of freeandeasy in which blubber and other choice kinds of food did duty for the red mans pipe  the women too were allowed to sit around and listenbut not to speakwhile the hunters discussed their plans  gartok being the biggest most forward and presumptuous among them all was allowed to speak firstthough this was contrary to the wishes and even the custom of the tribe  he did not make a set speech indeed no one thought of delivering an oration  it was merely a palaver on a large scale  we want spearhandles said gartok and wood for our kayakframes and deer for food as well as birds and rabbitskins for our underclothing  that is true remarked one of the elderly men we want all these things and a great many more things but we dont want fighting  there is no use in that  ho ho exclaimed several voices in approval  but we do want fighting retorted gartok firmly we want the pretty coloured things that the firespouters sew on their clothes and shoes also the iron things they have for cutting wood and we want the spouters which will make us more than a match for them in war and we cant get all these things without fighting  do without them then observed mangivik sharply why should we want things that we never had and dont need  listen to me young menfor i see by your looks that some of you would like a little fightingeven if we had the spouting things we could not make them spout  that is a lie exclaimed gartok with the simple straightforwardness peculiar to the uncivilised  once i met one of the firespouters when i was out hunting at the whale river  he was alone and friendly  i asked him to show me his spouter  he did so but told me to be very careful for sometimes it spouted of its own accord  he showed me the way to make it spoutby touching a little thing under it  there was a little bird on a bush close by  point at that he said  i pointed now said he look along the spouter with one eye  i put one end of it against my cheek and tried to look but by accident i touched the little thing and it spouted too soon  i never saw the little bird again but i saw many stars though it was broad daylight at the time  ho hoo exclaimed several of the younger men who listened to this narration with intense eagerness  yes continued gartok who had the gift of what is called the gab and was fond of exercising ityes it knocked me flat on my back  was it alive then asked anteek who mingled that day with the men as an equal in consequence of his having slain a walrus singlehanded  no it was not quite but it was very nearly alivewell when i fell the man laughed  you know his people are not used to laugh  they are very grave but this one laughed till i became angry and i would have fought with him but  ay interrupted anteek but you were afraid for he had the spouter  before gartok could reply mangivik broke in  boo he exclaimed contemptuously it is of no use your talking so much  i too have been to the whale river and have seen the firespouters and i know they are not nearly alive  they are dead quite dead  moreover they will not spout at all and are quite useless unless they are filled with a kind of black sand which is supplied by the white men who sell the spouters  go to the whale river if you will but dont fight with any onethat is my advice and my hair is grey  it is white old man if you only saw it murmured anteek with native disrespect  he was too goodnatured however to let his thoughts be heard  come oolalik said mangivik you are a stout and a wise young man let us hear what you have got to say  i say cried oolalik looking round with the air of a man who had much in his head and meant to let it out i say that the man who fights if he can avoid it is a fool  look back and think of the time gone away not many cold times have passed since our young men became puffed up indeed some of our old men were little betterand made a raid on the firespouters of the whale river  they met there was a bloody fight six of our best youths were killed and numbers were wounded by the little things that come out of the spouters  then they came home and what did they bring what had they gained  i was a boy at the time and did not understand it all but i understood some of it  i saw the fighters returning  some were looking very big and bold as if they had just come from fighting and conquering a whole tribe of bears and walruses  others came back limping  they went out young and strong men they came back too soon old helped along by their companions  two were carriedthey could not walk at all  look at them now  oolalik paused and directed attention to what may be called an objectlessontwo men seated on his right hand  both although in the prime of life looked feeble and prematurely old from wounds received in the fight referred to  one had been shot in the leg the bone was broken and that rendered him a cripple for life  the other had received a bullet in the lungs and a constitution which was naturally magnificent had become permanently shattered  what do you think continued oolalik  would not these men give much to get back their old strength and health  he paused again and the men referred to nodded emphatically as if they thought the question a very appropriate one while some of the peacefully disposed in the assembly exclaimed ho and hoo in tones of approval  then continued the speaker i passed by some of our huts and heard sounds of bitter weeping  i went in and found it was the wives and sisters of the men whose bodies lie on the banks of the whale river there would be reason in fighting if we had to defend our huts against the firespouters  selfdefence is right and every one has a good word for the brave men who defend their homes their women and their children  but the firespouters did not want to fight and the men who lost their lives at the fight i am speaking of threw them away for nothing  they will never more come home to provide their families with food and clothes or to comfort them or to play with the children and tell them of fights with the walrus and the bear when the nights are black and long  most of those poor women had sons or manrelations to care for them but there was one who had no relation to hunt for her after her husband was killedonly a little daughter to take care of her  i speak of old uleeta who is  that is a lie cried gartok springing up and looking fierce  old uleeta is as you all know my mother  she had me to hunt for her when father was killed and she has me still  you exclaimed oolalik with a look of scorn what are you  a hunter  no only a fool who wants to be thought very brave and would leave his mother and sister to the care of old men and boys while he goes away to fight with the firespouters  no he continued turning away from the angry young man with cool contempt old uleeta has no son  gartok was so taken aback with this behaviour of oolalik who was recognised as one of the gentlest and most peacefully disposed of the tribe that he stood gaping for a moment in surprise  then observing the halfamused halfcontemptuous looks of the men around him he suddenly caught up the unfinished handle of a spear that leaned against the wall of the hut beside him and made a desperate blow with it at the head of oolalik  but that youth had expected some such demonstration and was prepared for it  being very agile he made a step swiftly to one side and the handle came down on the skull of a walrus which hung on the wall with a violence that would have surprised its original owner had it been within  before the blow could be repeated oolalik sprang towards his assailant  eskimos know nothing of a blow straight from the shoulder but they know how to cuff  oolalik brought his open hand down on gartoks cheek with a pistolshot crack that tumbled that fireeater head over heels on the ground  the man was too strong however to be knocked insensible in that way he recovered himself sittingwise with his mouth agape and his eyes astonied while the whole assembly burst into a hearty fit of laughter high above the rest was heard the juvenile voice of the delighted anteek  what the fireeater thought we cannot tell but he had the wisdom to accept his punishment in silence and listened with apparent interest while oolalik concluded his remarks  the effect of this belligerent episode was to advance the cause of the peaceparty considerablyat least for a timeand when the meeting broke up most of the people returned to their various homes with a firm determination to leave the poor firespouters alone  but gartok who was still smarting under the disgrace to which he had been subjected at the hands of oolalik managed to rekindle and blow up the warspirit so that two days later a strong party of the more pugnacious among the young men of the tribe set off in their kayaks for the whale river taking with them a few of the women in one of their open boats or oomiakschiefly for the purpose of keeping their garments in repair    chapter four  war prevails  it would seem at times as if there were really some sort of spiritual communication between people whose physical frames are widely sundered  for at the very time that the eskimos in their remote home on the iceencumbered sea were informally debating the propriety of making an unprovoked attack on the dogrib indianswhom they facetiously styled firespoutersthe red men were also holding a very formal and solemn council of war as to the advisability of making an assault on those presumptuous eskimos or eatersofrawflesh who ventured to pay an uncalledfor visit to the greygoose rivertheir ancestral property every spring  one of their chiefs named nazinred had just returned from a visit to the river and reported having met and fought with one of the eskimos  immediately on hearing this the old or head chief summoned the council of war  the braves assembled in the counciltent in solemn dignity each classically enveloped in his blanket or leathern robe and inflated more or less with his own importance  they sat down silently round the council fire with as much gravity as if the fate of nations depended on their deliberationsand so on a small scale it did  after passing round the pipeby way of brightening up their intellectsthe old chief held forth his hand and began in a low voice and deliberate manner  my braves said he those filthy eatersofrawflesh have as you know been in the habit of coming to greygoose river every spring and trespassing on the borders of our huntinggrounds  he paused and looked round  waugh exclaimed his audience in order to satisfy him  with a dark frown the old chief went on  this is wrong  it is not right  it is altogether unbearable and more than the dogribs can stand  they wont stand it  waugh again said the audience for the old man had delivered the last sentence with considerable vehemence and meant that it should tell  being apparently destitute of a flow of ideas at that time the speaker had recourse to a not uncommon device among civilised orators he cleared his throat looked preternaturally wise and changed the subject  when the sun of spring rises over the icehills of the great salt lake he continued pointing towards the pole when it melts the snow opens the lakes and rivers and brings the summer birds to our land the braves of the great dogrib nation take their guns and bows and canoes and women and travel nearly as far as the icy sea that they may hunt and feedandsleep andandenjoy the land  nobody dares to stop us  nobody dares to hinder us  nobody dares even to look at us  he paused again and this flight of oratory was received with a very decided ho of assent as it well might be for during nearly all the year there was nobody in that uninhabited land to attempt any of those violent proceedings  dilating his eyes and nostrils with a look of superlative wisdom he continued  but at last the eskimos dared to come and look at our huntinggrounds we were peacefully disposed  we warned them not to come again  they came again notwithstanding  we took our guns and swept them away like leaves that are swept by the winter winds  are not their scalps drying in our lodges  what we did then we will do again  has not one of our chiefsnazinredbeen attacked by one of them  no doubt more will follow that one  my counsel is to send out a band of our braves on the warpath  but first we would like to know something  as the eskimo did not take the scalp of nazinred how is it that nazinred did not bring home the scalp of the eskimo  the old chief ceased amid many hos and hoos with the air of one who has propounded an unanswerable riddle and all eyes were at once turned upon nazinred  accepting the challenge at once he stretched forth his hand  my father has spoken he said but his words are not the words of wisdom  why should we fight the eskimos again and lose some of our best young men as we lost them in the last great fight  the eskimos have come near our lands but they have not of late hunted on them they have only looked and gone away  and even if they did hunt what then  the land is wide  we cannot use it all  we cannot kill all the birds and deer and even if we could we cannot eat them all  would it not be wise to live at peace with the eskimos  they have many great teeth of the walrus and skins of the seal  might not the white traders who take our furs and give us guns and powder be willing to take these things too  thus we could buy from the one and sell to the other and fill our lodges with tobacco and guns and beads and cloth and powder and ball and other good things  the indian stopped at this point to ascertain the effect of his remarks but only a few faint hos greeted him  the councillors did not feel quite sure of their own minds  his remarks about peace and war were not palatable and his suggestions about trade were a novelty  evidently nazinred was born much in advance of his time  it is true he continued that i had a struggle with a young eskimo but he was very strong and so was i  before i could kill him he caught hold of my gun but he could not force it from me and i could not force it from him  as we strove we looked into each others eyes and we each saw peace and goodwill there  so we ceased to fight  we kindled a fire and sat down and fed together  as the light slowly increases while the sun rises so light came into my mind  the dogribs have always talked of the eskimos as if they were fools  i found that this young man was not a foolthat he was wisewiser than some of our own braves his mind was deep and wide  he did not talk only of food and sleep and hunting  he spoke of things past and present and future and of the great spirit and the world to come  also of peace and war and we both agreed that peace was good and war hateful  more than that we found that it was foolish  then we parted  he went i suppose to his people on the sea of ice and i came home  he told me that none of his people were with himthat he was alone there is therefore no occasion for the young men to look fierce or go on the warpath  having thus tried to throw oil on the troubled waters nazinred came to an abrupt pause  instantly one of the younger councillors named magadar sprang to his feet  he was unusually excitable for an indian  indeed he differed a good deal from his companions in other respects being passionate impulsive hasty and matteroffact in his speechmaking too he scorned the use of symbol and metaphor but went straight to the point at once in the simplest and most forcible language at his command  braves he said looking at the previous speaker with a dark frown the dogribs know nothing of those strange and stupid notions that have just come out of the lips of nazinred  he says that this dirty eskimo is a deep thinker and a man who loves peace  how does he know that one of that sort may not think so deeply as to deceive him  how does he know that the young man is not a liarthat many of his warriors may not be in our huntinggrounds even at this moment though he says there are none  as for his talk about the great spirit and the future what does he know about either the one or the other  is he wiser than the dogribs  does his attack on nazinred look like a lover of peace  his leaving off when he found that nazinred was his match seems to me more like sly wisdom than the hatred of war  my advice is not to trust these dirty men of the ice but to take our guns at once and drive them from the land  it was quite evident from the way in which this speech was received that the warparty was in the ascendant and there is no doubt that magadars advice would have prevailed and a warparty been organised forthwith but for the arrival of a band of successful hunters who had been out for some time in quest of food  for a considerable part of that winter those indians had been in a condition of semistarvation  they had managed with difficulty to sustain themselves and families on rabbits which were scarce that year with the return of spring and the wildfowl however things had begun to improve and the hunting party above referred to was the first of the season that had returned to camp heavily laden with geese ducks plover and other supplies of food so that the halffamished people gave themselves up to feasting and had no time to think further of war  thus many days were passed without any reference being made to a fight with the eskimos and nazinred believing that the fancy to go on the warpath had passed away set off on what was to be a long hunting expedition with three of his comrades who were likeminded with himself among other plans this party intended to visit the establishment of the furtraders on great bear lake  thus when the belligerent party of eskimos arrived at the mouth of greygoose or whale river they found the place as they had been accustomed to find it a complete solitude  at first they expected to overtake their comrade cheenbuk there but he was not found having gone a considerable way inland in pursuit of game being aware of his peaceful proclivities however the eskimos were not sorry to miss him and they set about making an encampment on the shore at the mouth of the river intending to leave the women there while they should be engaged in hunting and in searching for the firespouters  meanwhile these firespouters having eaten and slept and eaten and slept again to the extent of their capacities began to experience a revival of the warspirit  in front of one of the lodges or leather tents one morning early there sat two squaws engaged in ornamenting moccasins and discussing the news of their little world  it was one of those bright genial mornings in spring peculiar to arctic lands in which warmth comes out with a burst victorious and cold shrinks away discomfited  everything looked as if a great revival of nature were at handas in truth it was for the long arctic winter is always driven away with a rush by the vigour if not the violence of the brief arctic spring  one of the women was young and prettyyes we might almost say beautiful  it is quite a mistake to suppose that all savages are coarse rough and ugly  many of them no doubtperhaps most of them are plain enough but not a few of the indian squaws are fairly goodlooking and this one as we have said at the risk of being doubted was beautiful at all events she had a fine oval face a smooth warmcoloured skin a neat little nose a wellformed mouth and jetblack hair with large lustrous eyes to say nothing of her teeth which like the teeth of most indians were regular and brilliantly white  her name was adolaythat being the indian name for summer  the other squaw was her mother  she was usually styled isquaywhich means womanby her husband when he was at home but being a great hunter he was not often at home  poor isquay might have been goodlooking in her youth but alas hard work occasional starvation and a rough life had prematurely dissipated her beauty whatever it might have been yet these conditions could not put to flight the lines and dimples of kindliness which played about her weatherworn eyes and cheeks  you see she had a gentle indulgent husband and that made her happy and kept her so  magadar is stirring up the young men again to go on the warpath said the younger woman without looking up from the embroidered moccasin with which she was engaged  yes i know it  i heard him as he passed our tent talking to alizay i dont like alizay he is like gunpowder the least thing sets him off and he flashes up horribly  but many of our other braves have no desire to quarrel with the eskimos said adolay indeed some are even fond of them  and some of the men of the ice are very handsome  dont you remember that one mother that we met when we went last spring with some of our men to shoot at the greygoose river  he was a fine manbig and strong and active and kindalmost good enough to be a dogrib  i remember him well returned isquay for he saved my life  have you forgotten that already  no i have not forgotten it answered the girl with a slight smile did i not stand on the riverbank with my heart choking me when i saw the ice rushing down with the flood and closing on your canoefor i could do nothing to help you and none of our men were near  and did i not see the brave man of the ice when he heard my cry come running like the deer and jump into the river and swim like the otter till he got to you and then he scrambled on a big bit of ice and lifted you and the canoe out of the water as if he had the strength of a moosedeer after which he guided the icelump to the bank with one of your paddles forget it no  i only wish the brave eskimo was an indian  i think you would be offering to be his squaw if he was said the mother with a short laugh  perhaps i would  but hes only an eaterofrawflesh  adolay sighed as gently as if she had been a civilised girl  but he has gone away to the great ice lake so i suppose we shall never see him again  unless said isquay he comes back this spring with his people and our braves have a fight with themthen you would be likely to see his scalp again if not himself  adolay made no reply to this neither did she seem shocked at the suggestion  indeed indian women are too much accustomed to real shocking to be much troubled with shocks of the imagination  holding out her moccasin at armslength the better to note the effect of her work she expressed regret that her father had gone off with the hunters for she felt sure he would have been able to allay the warfever among the young braves if he had remained at home  ay he would easily have put down alizay and magadar but the old chief can do nothing he is growing too old  the young men dont mind him now  besides he is warlike as well as they  while they were conversing thus the young men referred to had finally decided to go on the warpathto search for the eskimo who had fought with their chief nazinred find him and kill him and then continue the search for his companions for they had set him down as a liar believing that no eskimo had the courage to visit their huntinggrounds by himself  to resolve and to act were almost simultaneous proceedings with those energetic savages  in a very short time between twenty and thirty of them left the village in single file armed with the deadly gun besides tomahawks and scalpingknives and took their way to a neighbouring creek on the banks of which their canoes were lying    chapter five  a rencontre and flight  thus it naturally came to pass that the two bands of men who had gone to the same place to meet each other met in the course of time  there was a good deal of wandering about however before the actual meeting took place for the eskimos had to provide a quantity of food on landing on the arctic shore not only for themselves but to supply the four women who had accompanied them and were to be left on the coast to fish and mend their spare garments and boots and await their return  we shall not be long of coming back said gartok as he was about to leave his mother old uleeta who was in the crew of one of the oomiaks  i wish i saw you safe back my son returned the woman with a shake of her head but i fear the firespouters  i dont fear them returned the young man boastfully and it does not matter much what you fear  he will never come back said one of the other women when he was gone i know that because i feel it  there is something inside of me that always tells me when there is going to be misfortune  the woman who thus expressed her forebodings was a mild young creature so gentle and inoffensive and yielding that she was known throughout her tribe by the name of rinka a name which was meant to imply weakness her weakness however consisted chiefly in a tendency to prefer others before herselfin which matter christians do not need to be told that she was perhaps the strongest of all her kin  as the weather was comparatively warm the women contented themselves with a tent or bower of boughs for their protection  they were not long in erecting it being well accustomed to look after themselves  in less than an hour after their men had left them they were busy with sealsteaks over the cookinglamp and the place was rendered somewhat homelike by several fur garments being spread on the rocks to dry  yes gartok will get himself killed at last said old uleeta drawing her finger across the frizzling steak and licking it for her appetite was sharpset and she was impatient he was always a stubborn boy  but he is strong and a good fighter remarked rinka as she spread a sealskin boot over her knee with the intention of patching it  i wish all the other men were as strong as he is and ready to fight said one of the other women giving the steak a turn  it must not be supposed that although the eskimos are known to their indian friendsor foesas eatersofrawflesh they always prefer their food in the raw condition  they are only indifferent on the point when the procuring of fire is difficult or the coldness of the weather renders it advisable to eat the flesh raw as being more sustaining  i only wish that they would not fight at all said rinka with a sigh as she arranged the topknot of her hair  it makes the men too few and the women too many and that is not good  the fourth woman did not express an opinion at all  she was one of those curiously if not happily constituted creatures who seem to have no particular opinion on any subject who listen to everything with a smile of placid content who agree with everybody and object to nothing they are a sort of comfort and relief in a world of warfareespecially to the obstinate and the positive  her name was cowlik  there is no reason why we should continue to roast our sealmeat over a lamp now observed old uleeta  there is plenty of wood here  come we will gather sticks and make a fire  the others agreeing to this three of them rose and went into the bush leaving cowlik to watch the steaks  meanwhile the young men who had followed the lead of gartokfifteen in numberwere cautiously ascending the greygoose river each in his kayak armed with a throwingspear lance and bow  one of their number was sent out in advance as a scout  raventik was his name  he was chosen for the duty because of his bold reckless nature sharpness of vision general intelligence and his wellknown love for excitement and danger  you will always keep well out of sight in advance of us said gartok to this scout and the first sight you get of the firespouters shove in to some quiet place land haul up your kayak and creep near them through the bushes as quietly and cleverly as if you were creeping up to a bear or a walrus  then come back and tell us what you have seen  so we will land and attack them and throw them all into the river  i will do my best answered raventik gravely  it is not likely added gartok that you will find them today for they seldom come down as far as here and they dont know we are coming  the scout made no reply  having received his orders he stepped into his kayak and paddled off into the stream against which he made but slow progress however for the river happened to be considerably swollen at the time  he was also impeded at first by his comparative ignorance of river navigation  being accustomed to the currentless waters of the ocean he was not prepared by experience to cope with the difficulty of rushing currents  he went too far out into the stream at first and was nearly upset  natural intelligence however and the remembrance of talks to which he had listened between men of his tribe who had already visited the place taught him to keep close in to the banks and make as much use of eddies and backwater as possible  the doublebladed paddle hampered him somewhat as its great length which was no disadvantage in the open sea prevented him from keeping as close to the banks as he desired  despite these drawbacks however raventik soon acquired sufficient skill and in a short time a curve in the river hid him from the flotilla which followed him  now it so happened that the indians who were supposed to be a considerable distance inland were in reality not many miles from the spot where the eskimos had held their final conference which ended in raventik being sent off in advance  it was natural that accustomed as they were to all the arts of woodcraft they should discover the presence of the scout long before he discovered them and so in truth it turned out  the indians had ten birchbark canoes with three warriors in most of themall armed as we have said with the dreaded firespouters and tomahawks etceterafor as they were out on the warpath for the express purpose of driving the dirty eskimos off their lands magadar had resolved to make sure by starting with a strong and wellequipped force  of course magadars canoe led the van the others followed in single file and owing to the nature of their paddles which were singlebladed and could be dipped close to the sides of the canoes they were able to creep along much nearer to the bank than was possible to the kayaks  at a bend in the river where a bushcovered point jutted out into a large pool magadar thrust his canoe in among some reeds and landed to reconnoitre  scarcely had he raised his head above the shrubs when he caught sight of raventik in his kayak  to stoop and retire was the work of a few seconds  the men in the other canoes who were watching him intently at once disembarked and at a signal from their chief carried their light barks into the bushes and hid them there so that the eskimo scout would certainly have passed the place in half an hour without perceiving any sign of his foes but for an incident which enlightened him  accidents will happen even in the best regulated families whether these be composed of red men or white  just as the last canoe was disappearing behind its leafy screen one of the young braves who was guilty of the unpardonable offence of carrying his gun on fullcock chanced to touch the trigger and the piece exploded with in the circumstances an appalling report which not satisfied with sounding in the ears of his exasperated comrades like a small cannon went on echoing from cliff to cliff as if in hilarious disregard of secrecy and to the horror of innumerable rabbits and wildfowl which respectively dived trembling into holes or took to the wings of terror  fool exclaimed magadar scarce able to refrain from tomahawking the brave in his wrathlaunch the canoes and give chase  the order was obeyed at once and the flotilla dashed out into the stream  but raventik was not to be caught so easily as they had expected  he had turned on hearing the report and swept out into the middle of the river so as to get the full benefit of the current  his kayak too with its sharp form was of better build and material for making headway than the light indian canoespropelled as it was with the long doublebladed paddle in the strong hands of one of the stoutest of the eskimos  he shot down the stream at a rate which soon began to leave the indians behind  seeing this magadar laid aside his paddle for a moment raised his gun to his shoulder and fired  again were the echoes and the denizens of the woods disturbed and two other indians fired thus rendering confusion worse confounded  their aims were not good however and raventik was interested and surprised though not alarmedby the whizzing sounds that seemed close to his ears and the little splashes in the water just ahead of him fortunately a bend in the river here concealed him for some time from the indians and when they once more came in sight of him he was almost out of range  in the meantime his comrades amazed by the strange sounds that burst on their ears put hastily on shore carried their kayaks into the bushes and climbed to the summit of a rising ground with the double purpose of observing the surrounding country and of making it a place of defence if need be  raventik must have found our enemies said gartok to ondikik his lieutenant as he led his men up the slope  that is certain returned ondikik and from the noise they are making i think the firespouters are many  but this is a good place to fight them  yes we will wait here said gartok  as he spoke raventik was seen sweeping into view from behind a point in the middle of the most rapid part of the river and plying his long paddle with the intense energy of one whose life depends on his exertions  the eskimos on the knoll gazed in breathless anxiety  a few minutes later the canoe of magadar swept into view  the firespouters exclaimed ondikik  three men in it cried gartok  then as one after another of the canoes came into view four six ten of them and three men in each  and all with firespouters gasped the lieutenant  come exclaimed gartok it is time for us to go  the eskimos were by no means cowardly but when they saw that the approaching foe was double their number and reflected that there might be more behind them all armed with guns it was no wonder that they bethought themselves of retreat  to do them full credit they did not move until their leader gave the wordthen they sprang down the hillock and in three minutes more were out in their kayaks making for the mouth of the river at their utmost speed  on seeing this the indians uttered a wild warwhoop and fired a volley but the distance between them was too great  only a few of the balls reached the fugitives and went skipping over the water each wide of its mark  point high said magadar to alizay who had just recharged his gun  the indian obeyed fired and watched for the result but no visible result followed  that is strange muttered the chief my brother must have pointed too highso high that it has gone into the sun for i never yet saw a bullet fired over water without coming down and making a splash  it may have hit a canoe said alizay  i will try again  the second shot was to all appearance not more effective than the first  perhaps my brother forgot to put in the balls  is alizay a squaw asked the insulted brave angrily  magadar thought it wise to make no answer to this question and in a few seconds more the kayaks doubled round a point that jutted into the stream and were hid from view  but the two bullets had not missed their billets  onethe first firedhad dropped into gartoks canoe and buried itself in his left thigh  with the stoicism of a bold hunter however he uttered no cry but continued to wield his paddle as well as he could  the other ball had pierced the back of his lieutenant ondikik  he also with the courage of a savage warrior gave no sign at first that he was wounded  at this point where the eskimos were for a time sheltered by the formation of the land the greygoose river had a double or horseshoe bend and the indians who knew the lie of the land well thought it better to put ashore and run quickly over a neck of land in the hope of heading the kayaks before they reached the sea  acting on this belief they thrust their canoes in among the reeds and leaping on shore darted into the bushes  the eskimos meanwhile knowing that they could beat the indians at paddling and that the next bend in the stream would reveal to them a view of the open sea kept driving ahead with all the force of their stout arms  they also knew that the firing would have alarmed their women and induced them to embark in their oomiak push off to sea and await them  and this would have turned out as they had expected but for an unforeseen event which delayed the women in their operations until too lateat least for one of the party    chapter six  a surprise a struggle and a capture  when the eskimo women as before related made up their minds to discard the cookinglamp and indulge in the luxury of a wood fire they sent one of their number into the bush to gather sticks  the one selected for this duty was rinka she being active and willing besides being intelligent which last was a matter of importance in one totally unaccustomed to traversing the pathless woods  the girl obeyed orders at once and soon had collected a large armful of dried branches with which she prepared to return to the encampment but when she looked up at the small trees by which she was surrounded she felt considerably puzzled as to the direction in which she ought to walk  of course remembering that her back had been toward the sea when she set out nothing seemed simpler than to turn round with her face towards it and proceed  but she had not done this for many minutes when it occurred to her that she must have turned about more or less several times during her outward journey  this brought her to an abrupt halt  she looked up and around several times and then feeling quite sure that the shore must lie in a certain direction pointed out by hope set off in that direction at a good round pace  as the wood seemed to get thicker however she concluded that she was wrong and changed direction again  still the undergrowth became more dense and then suddenly coming to the conclusion that she was lost she stood stockstill and dropped her bundle of sticks in dismay  for a few moments she was stunned as if her position were unbelievable then she became horrified and shouted to her companions but her feeble unassertive voice was unable to travel far and drew forth no response  indeed she had wandered so far into the forest that even if possessed of a mans voice she might have failed to attract the attention of the women  then the sound of distant firing began to salute her ears and in an agony of anxiety she ran hither and thither almost blindly  but there were other ears besides those of rinka which were startled by the guns  sitting under a treeall ignorant of the presence of his brethren or of the warlike indianscheenbuk was regaling himself on the carcass of a fat willowgrouse which he had speared a little before the firing began  our eskimo was making for the coast where he had left his kayak and had halted for a feed  the sport in the woods after its novelty wore off had lost interest for one whose natural game so to speak was bears and walruses and he was on his way back when this rattle of musketry arrested him  the sudden eruption of it was not more puzzling to him than its abrupt cessation  could it be that some of his tribe had followed him to the river and fallen in with the men of the woods  he thought it not unlikely and that if so his assistance either as fighter or peacemaker might be required  bolting the remainder of the willowgrouse precipitately he jumped up grasped his weapons and made for the coast as near as he could guess in the direction of the firing  it happened at the same time that one of the young indians who was on his first warpath and thirsted for scalps as well as distinction chanced to keep a more easterly direction than his fellows when they took to the bush as already related  this man coming to an open glade whence he could see the shore beheld the eskimo women launching their oomiak in a state of frantic alarm  they were also signalling or beckoning eagerly as if to some one in the woods  casting a hurried glance to his right he observed poor rinka who had just got clear of the forest and was running towards her companions as fast as her short legs could carry her  without a moments hesitation he took aim at her and fired  the poor girl uttered a loud shriek threw up her arms and fell to the ground it chanced that cheenbuk was within a hundred yards of the spot at the moment but the bushes prevented his seeing what had occurred  the report however followed by the womans shriek was a sufficient spur to him  darting forward at full speed he quickly cleared the underwood and came suddenly in view of a sight that caused every nerve in his body to tinglerinka prostrate on the ground with blood covering her face and hands and the young indian standing over her about to operate with the scalpingknife  the howl of concentrated rage and horror uttered by cheenbuk instantly checked the savage and made him turn in selfdefence  he had run to finish his horrible work and secure the usual trophy of war without taking time to reload his gun and was thus almost unarmed  grasping his powderhorn he attempted to rectify this errorwhich would never have been committed by an experienced warriorbut before he could accomplish half the operation the wellaimed spear of cheenbuk went whistling through the air and entering his chest came out at his back he fell dead almost without a groan  cheenbuk did not stop to finish the work by stabbing or scalping but he kneeled beside the wounded girl and gently raised her  rinka he said softly while he undid her jacket and sought for the wound is it bad  has he killed you  i feel that i am dying  there is something here  she laid her hand upon her side from a small wound in which blood was issuing freely  the heart of the man was at once torn by tender pity and bitter indignation when he thought of the gentle nature of the poor creature who had been thus laid low and of the savage cruelty of the indian who had done itfeelings which were not a little complicated by the reflection that the warspiritthat is the desire to kill for mere selfglorificationamong some of his own people had probably been the cause of it all  it is useless  i am dying gasped the girl drawing her bloody hand across her forehead  but dont leave me to fall into the hands of these men  take me home and let me die beside my mother  she was yet speaking when old uleeta and her companions came forward seeing that no other indian appeared and that the one who had shot rinka was dead they had quelled their alarm and come to see what had occurred  cheenbuk after stanching the flow of blood availed himself of their aid to carry the wounded girl to the oomiak more comfortably than could have been possible if he had been obliged to carry her in his own strong arms  with much care they placed her in the bottom of the boat then the women got in and cheenbuk was about to follow when the report of a gun was heard and a bullet whizzed close past old uleetas headso close indeed that it cut off some of her grey hair  but the old creature was by no means frightened  quick jump in she cried beginning to push off with her paddle  cheenbuk was on the point of accepting the invitation but a thought intervenedand thought is swifter than the lightningflash  he knew from slight but sufficient experience that the spouters could send only one messenger of death at a time and that before another could be spouted some sort of manipulation which took time was needful  if the indian should get the manipulation over before the oomiak was out of range any of the women as well as himself might be killed  no he cried giving the boat a mighty shove that sent it out to sea like an arrow be offpaddlefor life  i will stop him  old uleeta did not hesitate  she was accustomed to obedienceeven when there were no firespouters astern  she bent to her paddle with arctic skill and vigour  so did her mates and the oomiak darted from the shore while the indian who had fired the shot was still agonising with his ramrodfor happily breechloaders were as yet unknown  cheenbuk was quite alive to his danger  he rushed up the beach towards his foe with a roar and an expression of countenance that did not facilitate loading  having left his spear in the body of the first indian he was unarmed but that did not matter much to one who felt in his chest and arms the strength of hercules and samson rolled into one so close was he to the indian when the operation of priming was reached that the man of the woods merely gave the stock of his gun a slap in the desperate hope that it would prime itself  this hope in the artillery used there at that time was not often a vain hope  indeed after prolonged use the trade gun of the norwest got into the habit of priming itselfowing to the enlarged nature of the touchholealso of expending not a little of its force sidewise  the consequence was that the charge ignited when the trigger was pulled and the echoes of the cliffs were once more awakened but happily the eskimo had closed in time  grasping the barrel he turned the muzzle aside and the ball that was meant for his heart went skipping out to sea to the no small surprise of the women in the oomiak  and now for the second time since he had landed on those shores was cheenbuk engaged in the hated work of a handtohand conflict with a foe  but the conditions were very different for alizay was no match for the powerful eskimoin physique at least though doubtless he was not much if at all behind him in courage  cheenbuk felt this the moment they joined issue and on the instant an irresistible sensation of mercy overwhelmed him  holding the gun with his right hand and keeping its muzzle well to one side for he did not feel quite certain as to its spouting capacities he grasped the indians throat with his left  quick as lightning alizay with his free hand drew his scalpingknife and struck at the eskimos shoulder but not less quick was cheenbuk in releasing the throat and catching the indians wrist with a grip that rendered it powerless  for a minute the eskimo remained motionless considering how best to render his adversary insensible without killing him  that minute cost him dear  five of alizays comrades led by magadar came upon the scene and as it happened cheenbuks back chanced to be towards them  they did not dare to fire for fear of hitting their comrade but they rushed unitedly forward with tomahawk and scalpingknife ready  take him alive said magadar  cheenbuk heard the voice  he disposed of poor alizay by hurling him away as if he had been a child and was in the act of facing round when magadar threw his arms round his body and held him  to be seized thus from behind is to most men a serious difficulty but our eskimo made short work of his assailant  he bent forward with his head to the ground so violently that the indian was flung completely over him and fell flat on his back in which position he remained motionless  but it was impossible for cheenbuk to cope with the other four indians who flung themselves on him simultaneously and seized him by arms legs and throat  of course they could have brained or stabbed him easily but remembering their chiefs order to take the man alive they sought to quell him by sheer force  stout and sinewy though the four braves were they had their hands full during a good many minutes for the eskimos muscles were tougher and harder than indiarubber his sinews resembled whipcord and his bones bars of iron  so completely was he overwhelmed by the men who held him down that little or nothing of him could be seen yet ever and anon as he struggled the four men seemed to be heaved upward by a small earthquake  alizay who had risen stood looking calmly on but rendered no assistance first because there was no room for him to act and second because his left wrist had been almost broken by the violence of the throw that he had received  as for magadar he was only beginning to recover consciousness and to wonder where he was  suddenly cheenbuk ceased to strive  he was a crafty eskimo and a thought had occurred to him  he would sham exhaustion and when his foes relaxed their grip would burst away from them  he knew it was a forlorn hope for he was well aware that even if he should succeed in getting away the spouters would send messengers to arrest him before he had run far  but cheenbuk was just the man for a forlorn hope  he rose to difficulties and dangers as trouts to flies on a warm day  the indians however were much too experienced warriors to be caught in that way  they eased off their grip with great caution  moreover magadar having risen and seeing how things were going took off his belt and made a running noose of it  he passed the loop deftly round cheenbuks legs and drew it tight while the others were still trying vainly to compress his bullneck  the moment that cheenbuk felt the noose tighten on his legs he knew that it was all over with him  to run or fight with his legs tied would be impossible so like a true philosopher he submitted to the inevitable and gave in  his captors however did not deem it wise or safe to relax their hold until they had swathed his body with deerskin thongs then they removed the belt from his legs and assisted him to rise  it is not the custom of indians to indulge in much conversation with vanquished foes  they usually confine their attentions to scowling torturing and ultimately to killing and scalping them  the dogribs who had captured cheenbuk could not speak the eskimo tongue and being unaware of his linguistic powers did not think it possible to speak to him but one of their number stood by him on guard while the others dug a grave and buried the indian whom he had slain  we have already made reference to our young eskimos unusually advanced views in regard to several matters that do not oftenas far as we knowexercise the aboriginal mind  while he stood there watching the indians as they silently toiled at the grave his thoughts ran somewhat in the following groove  poor man  sorry i killed him but if i had not he would have killed meand then perhaps some of the women for they had not got far away and i dont know how far the spouter can send its little arrows  i wonder if they are little  they must be surely for ive never seen one  hoi hoi what fools men are to kill one another  how much better to let each other alone  i have killed him poor man and they will kill me  what then  the ice and snow will come and go all the same no one will be the better for it when we are gone  some will surely be the worse  some wife or mother may have to rub her eyes for him  no one will care much for me  but the walrus and the sealhunt will not be so big when i am gone  i wonder if the maker of all cares for these things  he mustelse he would not have made us and put us here  did he make us to fight each other  surely not  even i would not shape my spear to destroy my kayakand he must be wiser than me  yet he never speaks or shows himself  if i had a little child would i treat it so noi must be wrong and he must be right  speech is not always with the tongue  now it comes to my mind that we speak with the eyes when we look fierce or pleased  perhaps he whispers to me inside sometimes and i have not yet learned to understand him  cheenbuk had now dropped into one of his frequent reveries or trains of thought in which he was apt to forget all that was going on around him and he did not waken from it until the burial being concluded one of the indians touched him on the shoulder and pointed to magadar who had shouldered his gun and was entering the bushes  understanding this to be a command to follow he stepped out at once the others fell into line behind him and thus bound and a captive our eskimo turned his back finallyas he believedon what we may style his native homethe great mysterious northern sea    chapter seven  flight and misfortune  while the scene we have described was being enacted the other indians who had crossed the neck of land for the purpose of cutting off the men in the kayaks failed in the attempt partly owing to the distance being greater than their memories had assigned to it and partly to the great speed of the kayaks when propelled by strong men fleeing for their lives  all the kayaks were well out of gunshot range when the shore was reached except one which lagged behind  at this one the indians discharged several volleys but without effect and soon after it also was beyond range  the little vessel which thus lagged behind belonged to the unfortunate gartok whose leg it will be remembered was wounded by one of the balls discharged by alizay  despite his energy and desperate though the situation was gartok could not overcome the depressing influence of pain and haemorrhage  he fell gradually behind the others each of whom was too anxious about his own safety to think much of his comrades  when the firing ceased and the flotilla was well out of range gartok laid down his paddle and bound up his wounded limb with some scraps of sealskin at the same time hailing the kayak nearest to him  as soon as it was discovered that their chief was wounded all the eskimos came clustering round him  among them was his lieutenant ondikik  you also are wounded said gartok observing the pallor of his face  yes i can find no arrow but there is blood  is it bad asked the chief with an angry exclamation at their misfortune  i cannot tell replied ondikik but  he finished the sentence in the most expressive manner by fainting dead away and falling over to one side so heavily that he would have infallibly upset the little craft if his comrades had not been close at hand to prevent that catastrophe  hail the oomiak cried gartok in a voice that for him felt singularly feeble  put him into it and let two of the women change with two of the men  in a few minutes the womens large open boat was alongside and poor ondikik was with some difficulty transferred to it  two men then gave up their kayaks to two of the women and took their places in the oomiak  while this was being done some of the people gave a shout of alarm for it was observed that gartok himself had quietly fallen back in a state of insensibility  the men therefore lifted him also out of his kayak and laid him beside his lieutenant  this accomplished the little fleet paddled out to sea and they soon lost sight of the arctic shore  they did not again pause until they reached a group of small islets on one of which they encamped for the night  fortunately the weather at this time was calm and warm so that those hardy inhabitants of the icy north required no better lodging or bed than the cold ground with the starspangled sky for curtains  with lamps flaring sealsteaks and wildfowl simmering and hot oil flowing they quickly made themselves comfortablewith the exception of course of the warlike gartok and the hotheaded ondikik  these two being fellowsufferers were laid beside each other in order perhaps to facilitate mutual condolence  to do them justice they did not grumble much at their fate but entertained each other with a running commentary on the events of the day  and that is strange news that my old mother tells me resumed gartok after a short pause in the conversation  cheenbuk must have given the firespouters sore heads from the way he gripped them  i wish i had been there growled ondikik  im glad i was not there returned gartok  i could not have saved him from so many and it would not have been pleasant to go into slaveryif not to torture and death  poor cheenbuk he was ever against waryet war has been forced on him  i fear we shall never see him again  hoi my leg is bad  i cant understand how the firespouters could hit it without the little thing going through my back first  i wish all the firespouters were deep in the inside of a whales belly growled ondikik whose wound was beginning to render him feverish and rusty  arrows and spears can be pulled out but when the little spouter things go in we dont know where they go to  they disappear and leave an ugly hole behind them  at this point raventik on whom the command had devolved came forward with a choice piece of juicy walrus blubber on a flat stone for a plate  our chiefs will eat he said it will do them goodmake their hearts strong and ease the wounds  no said gartok decisively none for me  take it away cried the other sharply  no exclaimed raventik in surprise  you see he had never in his life been wounded or ill and could not understand the possibility of refusing food except when too full of it  being a sympathetic soul however he pressed it on the invalids but received replies so very discouraging that he was induced to forbear  old uleeta turned out to be a more intelligent it not more kindly nurse  after she had eaten her supper and succeeded in bolting the last bite that had refused to go down when she could eat no more she came forward with a bladder full of water and some rabbitskins for the purpose of dressing the wounds  gently mother said gartok with a suppressed groan you lay hold of me as if i were a seal  you are quite as selfwilled my son replied the old woman  if you had not gone out to fight you would not have come back with a hole in your leg  if i had not come into the world i should not have been here to trouble you mother  theres truth in that my son returned the woman as if the idea were new to her  at this ondikik groanedwhether at the contemptibly obvious character of the idea or at ideas in general or in consequence of pain we cannot tell  you said mother that cheenbuk gave them a good deal of trouble  ay he gave them sore hearts and sore bodies  they deserved it what right had they to come with their firespouters to attack us  what right had you to go without your firespouters to attack them demanded old uleeta somewhat maliciously  gartok who was destitute neither of intelligence nor of humour laughed but the laugh slid into a most emphatic hoi as his mother gave the leg a wrench  softly mother softly  treat me as you did when i was so big he exclaimed indicating about one foot six between his hands  the old woman chuckled or rather hee heed a little and continued  yes cheenbuk fought like a bear  we could not see him for they were all on top of him at once but hi how he made them heave  i wonder they did not use their knives  they felt sure they had him said her son they wanted to drive him to their huts and kill him slowly to amuse their women  this was such a horrible idea that the old woman became unusually grave  these firespouters are worse than white bears she said for these never torture other beasts though they often kill them  true mother  now i wish you would go away and leave my leg alone ondikik there needs your help  go to him and hurt him as much as you please  i wont grumble  you were always a thankless boyever since you could speak replied the dame reproachfully  did you ever hear of any one being thankless before he could speak hoi mother youve tied it too tight  slack it a little  after complying with her sons request old uleeta went to ondikik to whom however she could render but little service owing to the nature of his wound  then she paid a visit to rinka whose injuries however proved to be more alarming than severe after which she joined the rest of the tribe at supper  while the eskimos were thus proceeding to their home among the islands of the arctic sea the captors of cheenbuk were paddling upstream to the lands of the dogrib indians  at first the stout eskimo meditated an attempt to escape  indeed he made one vigorous effort when they were leading him through the bush with his hands tied behind him  just as they came to the place where the canoes were lying the thought of home and of his probable fate as a prisoner pressed so heavily on him that he suddenly became furious tripped up the man beside him with his foot kicked over the one behind him with his heel ran his head like a batteringram into the back of the man in front of him and then strove to burst his bonds with a succession of mighty wriggles but not being quite equal to samson he failed and on seeing that two savages stood over him with drawn scalpingknives while magadar put the muzzle of a gun to his head he deemed it wise to give in and uttered the exclamation hoi with the air of one who feels that his game is played out  he marched forward after that in submissive silence  on reaching the canoes however a fresh burst of indignation assailed him and for a moment he meditated sending his foot through the bottom of the frail craft which was to carry him into exile but on second thoughts he decided to delay the performance of that violent measure till they were well out in the middle of the current when there would be the chance of drowning some of his foes as well as himself  by the time the desired position was reached however his spirit had calmed down a little and his philosophic mindto say nothing of his hearthad begun to suggest the uselessness of gratifying his feelings by a revenge which he probably could not enjoy much while in the process of drowning and doubtless could not enjoy at all after he was drowned  thus it came to pass that our hero restrained his passions and in process of time found himself a prisoner in one of the lodges of the dogrib indians    chapter eight  in the hour of need  on reaching the indian village cheenbuk was firmly bound to a tree a little way outside the camp and left there to his meditations while his captors went to the old chiefs tent to hold a council  meanwhile the women and children went to look at the captive  among them were adolay and her mother  the moment the former set eyes on cheenbuk she recognised him as the youth who had rescued her mother from drowning the previous year  mother she whispered drawing her parent aside that is him  dont you remember him  i think it is returned isquay gazing steadily at the eskimo who looked at the crowd which surrounded him with a gaze of supreme contempt though he did not by any means feel contemptuous  come mother said adolay with sudden earnestness he has not recognised us in the crowd  i must go and find out what the braves are palavering  as she spoke she drew her mother towards their own lodge and there left her while she hurried on to the counciltent  in the shelter of some bushes she crept as near to it as possible  there was no difficulty in making out what was said for the warriors made no secret of their intentions and spoke in loud tones  he shall die was the remark of alizay just as the girl came within hearing he has killed one of our braves  ay and he shall die by torture said magadar who was a relation of the man that had been slain  ho ho exclaimed most of the warriors in tones of approval but there were a few among them who were silent  they leaned to mercys side  better to spare his life and make a slave of him said one of these we can keep him always tied like a bad dog till we need him then we can loose his legs and make him drag our sledges  the brave who has spoken is young said the old chief  he does not know much about men  will not the eskimo watch for his chance get free from his bonds kill some of us when we are off our guard and perhaps escape  that is so  he must be killed remarked magadar with a glance of scorn at the merciful youth and the sooner the better  let us do it at once said one of the bloodthirsty  on hearing this the heart of adolay beat anxiously and for a few moments she was undecided whether to run to the tree to which the eskimo was bound and set him free by cutting his bonds or enter the counciltent tell the story of his having saved her mothers life and plead that the youths might be spared  both courses she knew were about equally desperate  if she were to follow the first all the children would see her do it and give the alarm in which case the eskimo would be pursued and certainly recaptured for a fugitive in a strange country would have no chance with men well acquainted with every nook and corner of their native land  besides which she knew not what terrible punishment might be inflicted on herself for making such an attempt  on the other hand for a woman to violate the sanctity of a counciltent was so unprecedented that she felt sure it would be sternly resented and therefore useless  fortunately she was saved the necessity of acting on either alternative by the arguments of the next speaker who was one of the bloodthirsty braves  let us not be in haste like women and children he said if we leave him bound to the tree all night he will have time to think of the fate that is coming and we shall have good sunlight in the morning which will enable even the oldest squaw to see well  after some palaver it was agreed that the execution of cheenbuk should be postponed to the following day and that a sentinel should be posted beside him during the night to make sure that he did not manage to undo his fastenings and escape  on hearing this decision arrived at adolay crept back into the bush and hastened to her mothers tent  they have fixed to kill him mother she exclaimed anxiously on entering  i expected that and im sorry returned isquay but we cannot help it  what can women do  the men will not mind what i say  if only nazinred was here they would listen to him but  yes they always listen to father interrupted the girl with an anxious frown on her pretty brows but as father is not here you must do what you can for the man  you are very fond of him said the squaw with a keen look at her daughter  yes i am very fond of him replied adolay with an air of unblushing candour and i think mother that you should be fond of him too  so i am girl so i am but what can i do  you can go and tell the story to the old chief  he is not hard like some of the young men  perhaps he may help us  isquay shook her head but nevertheless agreed to try her influence with the old man and went out for that purpose  meanwhile adolay who had not herself much faith in her mothers advocacy of the poor eskimos cause resolved upon a separate course of action  throwing a blanket over her head and shoulders she started for the place where cheenbuk stood scornfully regarding the little boys who surrounded and insulted him by flourishing knives and hatchets close to his defenceless nose  they did not however dare to touch him as the time had not yet arrived for actual torture  running forward adolay who was a favourite with the young people drove them back  keep clear of him she cried with a fierce glare in her eyeswhich was wonderfully realistic considering that it was a mere piece of actingi want to speak to himto terrify himto fill him with horror  this was quite to the taste of the wretched little creatures who fell back in a semicircle and waited for more  can you understand my speech she demanded as she turned on cheenbuk with flashing eyes  the eskimo thought he had never seen such magnificent eyes before and wished much that they would look on him more kindly  yes he replied i understand a little  listen then cried adolay in a loud tone and with looks more furious than before  you are to die tomorrow  i expected it would be tonight replied cheenbuk calmly  and you are to be tortured to death  at this the boys set up a howl of delight  at the same time the girl advanced a step nearer the captive and said in a low voice hurriedly  i will save you  be ready to acttonight  the softened look and altered tone opened the eyes of the captive  although the blanket partially concealed adolays face cheenbuk at once recognised the girl whose mother he had saved the previous spring  i am awake he said quietly but with a glance of bright intelligence  yes you are doomed to die continued adolay when the boys howling had subsided and if you are to be tortured we will all come to see how brave you are  as she said this she went close up to the captive as if to make her words more emphatic and shook her little fist in his face  thenin a low voiceyou see the cliff behind me with the dead tree below it  yes  run for that tree when you are freeand wait  turning round as though her rage was satisfied for the time being adolay left the spot with a dark frown on her face  leave him now boys she said in passing  give him time to think about tomorrow  whether it was the effect of this advice or the fact that the shades of evening were falling and a feedingtime was at hand we cannot say but in a short time cheenbuk was left to his meditations  he was however quite within sight of several of the lodges  as the daylight gradually faded a young brave left his tent and shouldering his gun went to the place where the captive was bound  examining the bonds to make sure that they were secure the youth carefully renewed the priming of his weapon shouldered it and began to pace to and fro  his mode of proceeding was to walk up to the captive take a look at him turn round and walk about thirty or forty yards away from him and so on to and fro without halt or variation for upwards of two hours  during all that time he uttered no word to the eskimo  cheenbuk on his part took no notice whatever of his guard but stood perfectly still and looked with calm lofty indifference over his head which he was well able to do being a considerably taller man  as the night advanced the darkness deepened and the poor captive began to entertain serious misgivings as to his prospects  would the girl try to carry out the plan whatever it was  yes he had not the slightest doubt on that head because somehow she had inspired him with a confidence that he had never felt in woman before  but would she be able to carry out her plan  that was quite another question  then the darkness had become so intense that he could barely see the outline of the cliff towards which he was to run and could not see the dead tree at all  moreover it occurred to him that it would be impossible even to walk much less to run over unknown and perhaps rough ground in darkness so great that he could hardly see the trees around him and could only make out the whites of the sentinels eyes when he came close up  it was therefore with a feeling of relief that he at length observed a faint glow of light in the sky which indicated the rising of the moon  soon afterwards a dark figure was seen approaching  it was alizay the bloodthirsty brave who had come to relieve guard    chapter nine  trying moments and perplexing doubts  the first thing that the new sentinel did was carefully to examine the cords that bound the captive to the tree and tie one or two additional knots to make him more secure  then he turned to the other indian and asked sharply  has he been quiet  quiet as the tree to which he is bound  has he uttered speech  no  good  you may go  i will watch him till morning after that he will need no more watching  alizay looked sharply at the eskimo while he uttered these words perhaps to ascertain whether he understood their drift but cheenbuks visage was immovable and his eyes were fixed as if in meditation on the moon which just then was beginning to rise over the cliffs and shed a softened light over the indian village  the new sentinel shouldered his gun and began his vigil while the other left them  but other ears had listened to the concluding words of alizay  the tree to which the eskimo was bound stood close to the edge of the bush or underwood  in front of it was an open space up and down which the sentinel marched  had the indian dreamed of a traitor in the camp he would not have deemed the captives position as secure as it should be but the idea of any one in the village favouring a contemptible eaterofrawflesh never once entered his imagination  nevertheless adolay was in the bush behind the tree and not only heard his words but saw his movements  watching her opportunity when the sentinel had just turned and was marching away from the tree she cut with a scalpingknife the cord that bound cheenbuks right arm and placed the knife in his hand  almost at the same moment she slipped back into the bush  cheenbuk made no attempt however to free himself  the sentinels beat was too short to permit of his doing so without being observed  he therefore remained perfectly motionless in his former attitude  it was a trying moment when the indian approached to within a couple of feet and looked him straight in the face as was his wont at each turn but cheenbuk was gifted with nerves of steel  his contemplation of the moon was so absorbing that a civilised observer might have mistaken him for an astronomer or a lunatic  alizay suspected nothing  he turned round and the eskimo allowed him to take about five paces before he moved  then with the speed of lightning he ran the sharp blade down his side severing all his bonds at one sweep  next moment he was free but he instantly resumed his former position and attitude until his guard was within a yard of him  then he sprang upon him dropped the knife and seized him by the throat with both hands so tightly that he was quite incapable of uttering a cry  alizay made a vigorous struggle for life but he had no chance with the burly eskimo who quickly decided the fight by giving his adversary a blow with his fist that laid him insensible on the ground  springing over his prostrate form he ran straight for the cliff that adolay had pointed out to him leaping over fallen trees and across what looked like young chasms in a state of reckless uncertainty as to whether he would plunge into ponds or land at the bottom of precipices with a feeling of absolute confidence that the girl with the lustrous eyes would not have told him to run where the feat was impossible he held on until he reached the bottom of the cliff and stood beside the dead tree unhurt though considerably winded  there he resolved to wait according to orders  to most ordinary men waiting when they are filled with anxiety is much more trying than energetic action  but cheenbuk was not an ordinary man therefore he waited like a hero  meanwhile adolay having seen the eskimo fairly in grips with the sentinel ran swiftly back towards the village intending before going to cheenbuk at the cliff to let her mother know what she had done and what she still purposed to donamely to embark with the eskimo in a birchbark canoe guide him across the small lake that lay near the village and show him the rivulet that would lead him into the greygoose river  but she had not gone far when on turning a bush she almost ran into the arms of a young indian girl named idazoo an event which upset all her plans and perplexed her not a littleall the more that this girl was jealous of her believing that she was trying to steal from her the affections of alizay whom she regarded as her own young man  why run you so fast asked the girl as adolay stood panting before her  have you seen a bad spirit  yes i have seen a bad spirit answered adolay thinking of alizay i have seen two bad spirits she added thinking of idazoo  but i cannot stop to tell you  i have totogo to seesomething very strange tonight  now it must be told that idazoo was gifted with a very large bump of curiosity and a still larger one perhaps of suspicion  the brave alizay she knew was to mount guard over the eskimo captive that night and she had a suspicion that adolay had taken advantage of that fact to pay the captivenot the indian oh dear noa visit  unable to rest quietly in her tent under the powerful influence of this idea she resolved to take a walk herselfa sort of moonlight ramble as it were in that direction  as we have seen she met her friend not unexpectedly on the way  i will go with you she said to see this strange thing whatever it be  there may be danger two are better than one and you know i am not easily frightened  poor adolay was dismayed by this proposition and hurried forward but idazoo kept pace with her  suddenly she made up her mind and changing her direction made for the cliff at a rapid run closely followed by her jealous friend who was resolved to see the mystery out  she purposely led her companion round in such a way that they came suddenly upon the waiting eskimo whose speaking visage betrayed his surprise at seeing two girls instead of one  on beholding cheenbuk standing there unbound idazoo stopped short drew back and gazed at him in alarm as well as surprise  you have now seen the strange sight i spoke of but you must not tell it in the lodges said adolay  without answering her idazoo turned to fly but adolay grasped her by the wrist and held her tightat the same time motioning with her hand to cheenbuk  the eskimo was prompt as well as intelligent  he did not wait for explanations or allow surprise to delay him  with a bound he was beside the girls had grasped idazoo and looked to adolay for further instructions  hold her till i tie up her hands she said drawing a stout line of deerskin from a pocket in the breast of her dress  with this she proceeded to bind her inquisitive friends wrists perceiving that she was to be made a captive the girl opened her mouth and began a shriek which had it been allowed full play would no doubt have reached her friends in the village but cheenbuk had observed the intention and before the first note had struggled into being he clapped his hand on her mouth and quenched it  idazoo wore round her neck a brightly coloured cotton kerchief such as the furtraders of those days furnished for barter with the indians  cheenbuk quietly plucked this off her neck and tied it firmly round her face and mouth so as to effectually gag her  this done they fastened her to the stem of the dead tree  the whole operation was performed without unnecessary rudeness and with great celerity  now idazoo said adolay when they had finished you have done me great injury this night  i am sorry to treat you in this way but i cannot help it  you would come with me you know  if i could trust you even now i would take the cloth off your mouth but i dare not you might yell and everybody knows you were never good at keeping your promises  but it does not matter much  the handkerchief is not too tight to prevent the air getting up your noseand it will give your tongue a rest which it needs  besides the night is not cold and as our braves pass here every morning when starting off to hunt you will soon be set free  the eskimo showed all his brilliant teeth from ear to ear while this little speech was being made  then he accompanied adolay through the bush until they reached the shores of a small lake beside which a birchbark canoe was lying partly in the water  at an earlier part of that evening the girl had placed the canoe there and put into it weapons and provisions suitable for a considerable voyage  you have got this ready for me said cheenbuk  yes  you saved my mothers life once and i will save yours replied the girl pointing to the bow of the canoe as if ordering him to embark  are you going with me asked the youth with a look of hopeful surprise and a very slight flutter of the heart  you do not know the lake  i will guide you to the place where the little river runs out of it and then by following that you will get into greygoose river which i think you know  the eskimos heart ceased to flutter and the hope died out of his expressive eyes as he said still hesitating butbuti am very heavy and you are very light  a canoe does not go well with its head deep in the water  dont you think that i should sit behind and steer  and where would you steer to asked adolay with a somewhat pert smile  besides look there she added pointing to the stern of the little craft do eskimos not use their eyes  cheenbuk used his eyes as directed and saw that a heavy stone had been placed in the stern so as to counteract the difference of weight  with an air of humility therefore he stepped into his allotted place took up a paddle and sat down  adolay pushed the craft into deeper water stepped lightly in and giving a vigorous shove sent it skimming out on the lake  then the two dipped their paddles with a will and shot over the water like an arrow  profound silence was maintained until the other end of the lake was reached when the moon came out from a bank of clouds and enabled the girl to find the reedy source of the little river without difficulty  we will land here and lift the canoe past the reeds she said steering the little craft to the side of a grassy bank  walking along this bank and guiding the canoe with their hands they soon came to an open space in the forest whence they could see the rivulet winding like a thread of silver through the land in front of them  this is the place where we must part said adolay with a sudden determination of manner which surprised and puzzled the eskimo  you have now no further need for me  you have only to go straight on with the running of the water  there are only two falls on the way but you will hear the noise before you come to them and you have only to lift the canoe a short way through the bush to the still water below the falls  our braves often do that you will find it quite easy  i know something of that returned cheenbuk we have no falls in our great salt lake but we have plenty big lumps of ice and when these are like to crush together we have to jump out of our kayaks and lift them out of the waterho and we do it quick too sometimes or we get squeezed flat  but if i go on with the canoe how will you get home you cannot swim back  i can walk round the lake  are the eskimo girls not able to walk that you ask such a question said the girl raising her dark eyes with something of an amused look to the face of her companion who was looking anxiously down at her  oh yes they can walk well  ay and run too when needful  butbut im sorry that we must part  mustwhy must  the youth said this in a meditative tone for it had occurred to him for a moment that the girl was now in his power that he could compel her to get into the bow of the canoe and might steer her to his home at waruskeek if he chose whether she would or no  but cheenbuks soul was chivalrous  he was far in advance of his kindred and his times  he scorned himself for having even thought of such a thing for a moment and it was with an air of profound humility that he continued  mustof course you must  one of the young braves would have a sore heart if you did not return  no one that i know of she replied quickly  i care not for the braves but my mother would have a sore heart if i did not return  yet i fear to go back for that idazoo will tell and perhaps they will kill me for helping you to escape  then you must not go back said the eskimo stoutly  come with me and i will take good care of you  no i cannot returned the girl thoughtfully i cannot forsake my mother and father in such a way without even a word at parting  what is your name asked the youth promptly  mine is cheenbuk  they call me adolay that in our language means the summertime  well adolay i dont know what my name cheenbuk meansperhaps it means wintertime  anyhow listen to me  if there is any chance of you being killed you must not go back  i will take you to my mothers igloe and you will live with her  have you too got a mother asked adolay with interest  ho yes and a father tooand theyre both fat and heavy and kind when they come to know that you have been so kind to me they will receive you with joy  no said adolay shaking her small head decidedly i will not go they may kill me if they like but i will never forsake my mother  are you determined  yesfor sure  then so am i said cheenbuk taking hold of the canoe and turning the bow upstream  get in adolay and we will return to the lodges of your people and die together  cheenbuk had a way of saying and doing things that convinced his hearers that he was thoroughly in earnest  the indian girl felt this and regretted much that she had said anything at all about her danger  she now tried to counteract the evil  what do you mean she said anxiously  i mean that i am not afraid to go back and die with you  but it is not certain she replied that they will kill me  if my father was at home they would not dare to do it and perhaps they will be afraid of his revenge when he comes back  but for you there is no chance at all  they will be sure to kill you with slow tortures  i care not  if i go back they will not be so likely to kill you  but listen to me adolay  i have a thought  if you come with me to my home in waruskeek i will take you safe to my fathers igloe and you shall live with my mother and sister  i will not ask you to be my squaw but you will stay with them till we collect a strong band of young men when we will go to visit your people and take you with us  if they are friendlywell and we can traffic together  if they receive us ill there will be a fightthat is all  i do not like fightingbut whatever happens i promise that you shall be restored to your father and mother  now will you go  adolay looked up earnestly into the grave countenance of the young man there could be no doubt of his thorough sincerityshe felt thatstill she hesitated  it was a bold step to takeeven for an indian heroine  at that critical moment there broke upon their ears a distant sound that caused them both to start and look round anxiously  it was faint and so far away that at first they could make nothing of it  a few seconds later it was repeated louder than before  then a look of intelligence broke over adolays countenance  i know she exclaimed idazoo is shrieking  we should have put the cloth over her nose  she has got her mouth free and  another sharp yell rendered it needless for her to complete the sentence  come she said laying hands on the canoe  turn it round  we will go  a few minutes more and the pair were flying down the swift current of the little river as fast as they could dip their paddles in the stream    chapter ten  a wild chase and a bad failure  it does not necessarily require the influences of civilised life to make an honourable upright man any more than it needs the influences of savage life to make a thorough scoundrel  of course the tendency of civilisation is to elevate of savagery to debase nevertheless it is certain that as we occasionally see blackguards in the highest ranks so we sometimes find men and women with exalted conceptions of right and wrong in the lowest circles of life  the truth would seem to be that the spirit of god is not confined to ranks or conditions of mena fact that appears to be confirmed by the scripture statement that in every nation he that feareth god and worketh righteousness is acceptable to him  cheenbuks mind must assuredly have been influenced by a good spirit when after descending the little river at the utmost speed possibleso as to render recapture for a time at least improbablehe directed his companion to run the canoe on the bank in an eddy formed by a flat rock and then against his own most earnest desires advised adolay to return to her people  while we were paddling downstream he said i have been thinking much and i cannot believe that your people would be so hard as to kill you for only helping a poor eskimo to escape  now i have changed my mind  i have often found that it is better to think more than once before acting if you have time to do so  what i think now is that we should hide the canoe here and return to your village on foot together when we get thereor when we meet them chasing usyou will go on and i will hide to see how they receive you and if they receive you kindlyas i feel sure they will doi will return here to this spot take the canoe and go to my home alone  i cannot bear to take you from your father and mother  i think the great spirit who is the father of all would be angry with me  but i will not force you to return if you are afraid  i am afraid returned adolay quickly  you do not know how angry the men will be and you dont know how sharp their eyes are  if you were to return with me they would see you long before you could see them and would give you no chance to hide  then there is nothing to be done but to go on said cheenbuk with a sigh which he loyally strove to vent as a sign of regret but which insisted on issuing forth as a distinct sound of satisfaction  you have promised to take me safe to your mothers igloe and to bring me back to my own home said adolay with a look of confidence  i will go on and trust you  without another word the eskimo pushed off the head of the canoe which was caught by the current and swept downstream  ere long they reached the greygoose river and paddling into the centre of the current were soon careering towards the sea at a pace which they thought rendered their being overtaken almost impossible  to make quite sure however they continued the voyage far into the night and did not land for a very brief rest until the grey dawn had begun to appear over the eastern treetops  being both somewhat fatigued by that time they scarcely uttered a word as they encamped but went about the work as if half asleep  cheenbuk lifted the canoe out of the water and laid it on the bank bottom up in which position it formed a rough and ready tent for his companion who meanwhile carried up the provisions  seated on the grass beside it they ate a little dried venison which required no cookinguttering only a monosyllable now and then with halfclosed eyes and sometimes with an imbecile smile which terminated occasionally in an irresistible nod  the feebleness of the light too as well as the quietness of the hour contributed not a little to this state of semiconsciousness  the frugal supper having been washed down with a draught of water from natures own cupthe joined handsadolay lay down under the canoe cheenbuk retired to a neighbouring sprucefir and stretched himself under its branches  need we add that sleep closed their eyelids instantly  but the eskimo was much too experienced a hunter and warrior to allow the drowsy god to enchain him long  like a dead log he lay for little more than two hours then he awoke with a start and stretched himself  hoi he exclaimed sharply looking towards the canoe which was distant from his lair about five or six yards  the exclamation had scarcely passed his lips when adolay sprang up and next moment went blinking yawning and stumbling down the bank with the provisions under one arm the paddles and weapons under the other cheenbuk lifted the canoe and followed her  in a few minutes they were once more out in the middle of the strong current paddling with might and main  now it was well that they had used such diligence in their flight for the pursuers were closer behind them than they had supposed  when the unfortunate alizay was felled by the eskimo as we have described he lay for a considerable time in a state of insensibility but he was by no means killednot even seriously damagedfor cheenbuks intense dislike to take life had not only induced him to drop the knife with which the indian girl had supplied him to cut his cords but inclined him to use his ponderous fist with moderation so that alizay on recovering found himself none the worse except for a severe headache and an unnaturally large bridge to his nose  gathering himself up and gradually swelling with rage as he reflected on the treatment to which he had been subjected he ran at full speed to alarm the camp and begin a search  but where were they to searchthat was the question  there were four points to the compassthough they knew nothing about the compassand the fugitive might have gone off in the direction of any of these or between them and it was too dark a night to permit of his trail being followed by sight for although the moon might aid them in the open it would be quite useless in the darkness of the woods  a hurried council was held and a good deal of distracting advice given while the young braves were arming themselves  to add to their perplexities a lad rushed suddenly into the counciltent with glaring eyes saying that the girl idazoo had disappeared from the village this news greatly increased the fury of alizay but he had scarcely realised the truth when another lad with if possible still more glaring eyes and a gaping mouth rushed in to tell that the girl adolay was also missing  this blew up the agitation to a frenzy of excitementnot usual among the red men of the northbecause the necessity for prompt action was great while the impossibility of doing anything definite was greater  it was just at this point when the clamour was at its height that a sound was heard which instantly produced dead silence while every man and boy became as if petrified with eyes enlarged and ears cocked to listen  again the sound was hearda distant yell undoubtedly coming from the direction of the cliff  all the selfpossession and promptitude of the indians returned in a moment  in a second the braves glided out of the counciltent and disappeared each making a straight line for the sound while the women and children left behind listened with profound attention and expectation  there was no lack of guiding sounds now for the moment idazoo managed to clear her mouth of the gag she began and continued a series of shrieks and yells which were intensified in vigour by the fact that she gradually became hysterical as well as wrathful  the first to reach the spot was alizay  on beholding him the girl stopped and after two or three exasperated echoes had finished their remarks a profound silence reigned  lovers among the dogribs are not yet very gallant  civilisation may do something for them as to this in time  you can make a noise said the youth stepping up to her  i have reason to do so replied the maiden somewhat abashed  did adolay go with him asked alizay as several of the other braves ran up  yes  willingly  yesshe helped to tie me and showed him the way  where did they go  in the direction of the lake  instantly the whole band turned and ran off in the direction mentioned alizay being last as he paused just long enough to cut the bonds of idazoo but left her to disentangle herself as she best could  on reaching the shores of the lake the footsteps of the fugitives showed clear in the moonlight and the marks of launching the canoe were visible so that there was no further doubt as to what should be done the indians knew well that there was only one outlet from the lake their canoes were close by and their guns and tomahawks in their hands nothing therefore required to be done but to embark and give chase for this purpose two canoes were deemed sufficient with three men in each  magadar took charge of the leading canoe  alizay steered the other and the rest of the braves returned to the village to gloat over the news that idazoo had to tell to feast on the produce of the previous days hunt and to clearor obfuscatetheir intellects more or less with their tobaccopipes  as the six pursuers were very wrathful and pretty strong they caused their canoes to skim over the lake like swallows and reached the head of the little river not very long after the fugitives had left it  a stern chase however is proverbially a long one and as they overhauled the chase only inch by inch there seemed little chance of overtaking it that night  the leaders however being men of great endurance resolved to carry on without rest as long as possible  this they did until about dawnthe same hour at which the fugitives had succumbed and both parties put ashore at last for a rest neither being aware of the fact that their separate campinggrounds were not more than three miles apart  well was it then for adolay that her stout protector was a light sleeper as well as a man of iron frame and that he had aroused her fully an hour and a half sooner than the time at which the indians left their camp to resume the chase  it was well also that cheenbuk required but a short rest to recruit his strength and enable him to resume the paddle with his full vigour  the joy also consequent upon the discovery that he loved the indian girl and that she had made up her mind without any persuasion on his part to run away with him lent additional power to his strong back  perhaps also a sympathetic feeling in the breast of the maiden added to the strength of her wellformed and by no means feeble arm so that many miles were soon added to the three which intervened between the chasers and the chased to the horror of adolay she found when she and cheenbuk reached the mouth of the river that the sea was extensively blocked by masses of ice which extended out as far as the eye could reach  although thus encumbered however the sea was by no means choked up with it and to the gaze of the young eskimo the ice presented no insurmountable obstacle for his experienced eye could trace leads and lanes of open water as far as the first group of distant islets which lay like scarce perceptible specks on the horizon  but to the inexperienced eye of the girl the scene was one of hopeless confusion and it filled her with sudden alarm and despair though she possessed more than the usual share of the dogrib womens courage observing her alarm cheenbuk gave her a look of encouragement but avoided telling her not to be afraid for his admiration of her was too profound to admit of his thinking that she could really be frightened whatever her looks might indicate  the ice is our friend today he said with a cheery smile as they stood together on the seashore beside their canoe surveying the magnificent scene of snowy field fantastic hummock massive berg and glittering pinnacle that lay spread out before them  adolay felt but did not express surprise for she was filled with a most commendable trust in the truth and wisdom as well as the courage of the man to whose care she had committed herself  if you say the ice is our friend it must be so she remarked quietly but to the indian girl it seems as if the ice was our foe for she can see no escape and my people will be sure to follow us  let them follow returned cheenbuk with a quiet laugh as he rearranged the lading of the canoe before continuing the voyage  they wont follow beyond this place  lifting out the big stone which had formed a counterpoise to his weight he flung it on the beach  we will change places now adolay he said you have guided our canoe when on the inland waters it is now my turn to steer for i understand the sea of ice  get in we will start  when magadar and his comrades arrived at the mouth of the greygoose river and beheld the aspect of the sea a cry of mingled surprise and disappointment escaped them but when they had landed and discovered the canoe of the fugitives far away like a speck among the icefloes the cry was transmuted into a howl of rage  quick embark  let us after them shouted magadar  death to them both yelled alizay  for a few minutes the indians followed the lanes of open water till their turnings began to appear somewhat complicated then the warlike spirit became a little subdued  presently one of the indians discoveredor thought he discoveredthat the lead of water was narrowing and that the ice was closing in  promptly both canoes were put about and the shore was regained with amazing speed  after that the dogribs paddled quietly up the greygoose river and meekly returned to their woodland home    chapter eleven  encamped on the islet  it was with feelings of profound thankfulness and relief that adolay landed on the first of the islets and surveyed the chaotic though beautiful floes from which they had escaped  and in truth cheenbuk had required all his skill and experience more than once to avoid the dangers by which they had been beset for although the weather was perfectly calm and the ice nearly motionless they had frequently to pass through channels so narrow that the slightest current might have caused a nip and obliged them to take hurried refuge on the floes while at other times when compelled to pass rather close to the small bergs lumps dropped into the water perilously near to them from the overhanging icecliffs  there has been some danger remarked the girl turning to her protector  all is well when it ends well replied the eskimo nearly but unconsciously quoting shakespeare  but the danger was not very great for if the ice had closed in we could have jumped on it and carried the canoe to the nearest open water  but what if a lump had dropped into the canoe and sunk it asked adolay  we should have had to scramble on the floes and wait there tilltill we died together  he said this with some degree of solemnity for it was an uncomfortable reflection  i would prefershe stopped suddenly for in the haste of the moment she was going to have saidthat we should live together rather than die togetherbut maiden modesty not unfamiliar even among savages restrained her and cheenbuk who was not observant in the matter of imperfect speech took no notice of the abrupt pause  the evening was far advanced for it had taken them the whole day to reach the islet owing to the windings of the lanes of water and the frequency with which they had to turn back in consequence of having run into what may be termed blind alleys  it was resolved therefore that they should rest there for the night  as there was no fear by that time of their being pursued by indians cheenbuk resolved that they should have a good warm supper to recruit their somewhat exhausted energies  of course adolay was only too glad to fall in with this arrangement and said that she would go along the shore and collect small masses of driftwood for the fire while her companion lifted up the canoe and made the encampment  you will not find much driftwood i think said cheenbuk as she was about to set off for the currents dont set upon this island much the long point of the bigger island over there turns the currents off from this one but perhaps you may find a little  adolay found this to be true for she wandered several miles along shoreindeed went nearly round the islet which was a low rocky one almost devoid of verdurebefore she had collected a good bundle of dry sticks  meanwhile the eskimo set to work with characteristic enthusiasm to arrange the camp  choosing a spot where a low wall of rock sheltered him from the north he laid a few stones in a heap to mark the place for the fire  then he carried up the canoe and laid it down bottom up so as to face the fire  underneath it he made a snug nest of twigs and leaves for adolay to rest in  then on the opposite side of the fire he made another laira sort of openair nestfor himself after which he collected a good many of the small dead twigs among the scrub which he piled up in readiness around a large piece of drift timber he had the good fortune to discover not far from the spot where they landed  this done he stood back a few paces and admired his handiwork his head on one side with quite the air of a connoisseur  presently he began to wish that adolay would return and then sat down to make fire by the slow and laborious eskimo process of rubbing two pieces of stick rapidly together until the friction should ignite them he was still absorbed in the work when the indian girl returned with a bundle of wood which she threw down beside the rest  you have had better luck than i expected said cheenbuk  see i have made you a nest to sleep in he added pointing to the canoe  it is very nice she observed with an appreciative smile  what are you doing  making fire he answered resuming his work and continuing it with such vigour that beads of perspiration stood on his brow  without speaking the girl went to the canoe and opened a bundle wrapped in deerskin which formed part of its lading  she drew therefrom a firebag richly ornamented with beads such as indian chiefs and braves are wont to carry under their belts  it contained the pipe tinderbox flint steel and tobacco which are usually supplied by the furtraders to the red men  cheenbuk was so interested in the proceedings of his companion that he ceased to carry on his own work thereby allowing the sticks to cool and losing his labour  you need not work so hard said adolay taking a flint steel and piece of tinder from the bag and beginning to strike a light to the great interest of the eskimo  we manage to get fire differently and more easily  in a few seconds a spark caught on the tinder which began to smoke and the girl wrapping it in a bundle of dry grass whirled it round at armslength until the draught caused it to burst into flame  thrusting the burning mass into the heart of the twigs which had been previously prepared she glanced up at her protector with a look that said plainly watch now the result  but cheenbuk required no encouragement to do so  he had been watching all the time with mouth as well as eyes wideopen and a loud hoi hoi ho burst from him as the flame leaped up suffusing the canoe and wall of rock and the near objects with a ruddy glow which paled everything else to a cold grey by contrast  ive seen that once before exclaimed cheenbuk with delight taking up the firebag tenderly and have often wished that i had these things for making fire  well you may have them now  they belonged to my father  all our men carry bags with these things in them  and ive seen this tooonce continued the youth smiling as he pulled out a tobaccopipe  then he bent his head suddenly put his nose to the bag and made a face expressive of supreme disgust  ho and ive seen this too  i have tasted it and after tasting it i was very miserableso miserable that i hope never to be as miserable again  as he spoke he looked at adolay with that extreme solemnity which was one of the characteristics of his face  the girl returned the look but did not smile  she did not speak but waited for more  the man who showed me these things was a good man continued cheenbuk i do not know his name but i liked him much  yet i think he was not wise to fill his mouth with smoke and his inside with sickness  was he sick asked adolay  nohe was not buti was  while he was speaking he drew a long piece of canada twist tobacco out of the bag and looked at it sagaciously for some time nodding his head as if he knew all about it  yes that is the thing he put in the pipe and after making a small fire over it drew the smoke into himself  at first i thought he would die or catch fire and burstbut hehe didnt and he seemed to like it  all our men like it said adolay they smoke every daysometimes all day  and some of our women like it too  do you like it asked the eskimo quickly  no i dont like it  goodthat is well  now we will cook some of your dried meat for supper  by that time the fire was blazing cheerily  as the shades of night deepened the circle of light grew more and more ruddy until it seemed like a warm cosy chamber in the heart of a cold grey setting  a couple of small stakes were thrust into the ground in such a way that the two pieces of venison impaled on them were presented to the heart of the fire  soon a frizzling sound was heard then odours of a kind dear to the hearts of hungry soulsto say nothing of their nosesbegan to arise and the couple thus curiously thrown together sat down side by side to enjoy themselves and supply the somewhat clamorous demands of nature  they said little while feeding but when the venison steaks had wellnigh disappeared a word or two began to pass to and fro  at last cheenbuk arose and taking a small cup of birchbark which with a skin of water formed part of the supplies provided by adolay he filled it to the brim and the two concluded their supper with the cheering fluid  ah sighed the girl when she had disposed of her share the white traders bring us a black stuff which we mix with water hot and find it very good to drink  yes  what is it asked cheenbuk applying his lips a second time with infinite zest to the water  i know not what it is  the white men call it tee said adolay dwelling with affectionate emphasis on the ees  ho  i should like to taste that teeee said the youth with exaggerated emphasis on the ees  is it better than water  im not sure of that answered the girl with a gaze of uncertainty at the fire but we like it better than waterthe women do the men are fonder of firewater when they can get it but the white traders seldom give us any and they never give us much  we women are very glad of that for the firewater makes our men mad and wish to fight  tee when we take too much of itwhich we always doonly makes us sick  strange said cheenbuk with a look of profundity worthy of solomon that your people should be so fond of smokes and drinks that make them sick and mad when they have so much of the sparkling water that makes us comfortable  adolay made no reply to this for her mind was not by nature philosophically disposed though she was intelligent enough to admire the sagacity of a remark that seemed to her fraught with illimitable significance  have you any more strange things in your bundle asked the eskimo whose curiosity was awakened by what had already been extracted from it have you some of the tee or the firewater or any more of the thing that smokeswhat you call it  tubukono i have no more of that than you saw in the firebag  the white men sometimes call it bukey and i have no firewater or tee sometimes we put a nice sweet stuff into the tee which the white men call shoogir  the indian girls are very fond of shoogir  they like it best without being mixed with water and tee  but we have that in our own land  we make it from the juice of a tree  the interest with which cheenbuk gazed into the girls face while she spoke was doubtless due very much to the prettiness thereof but it is only just to add that the number and nature of the absolutely new subjects which were thus opened up to him had something to do with it his imperfect knowledge of her language however had a bamboozling effect  here is a thing which i think you will be glad to see continued the girl as she extracted a small hatchet from the bundle  yes indeed that is a very good thing said the youth handling the implement with almost affectionate tenderness  i had one onceand that too is a fine thing he added as she drew a scalpingknife from her bundle  you may have them both she said i knew you would need them on the journey  cheenbuk was too much lost in admiration of the giftswhich to him were so splendidthat he failed to find words to express his gratitude but seizing a piece of firewood and resting it on another piece he set to work with the hatchet and sent the chips flying in all directions for some time to the amusement and no small surprise of his companion then he laid down the axe and taking up the scalpingknife began to whittle sticks with renewed energy  suddenly he paused and looked at adolay with ineffable delight  they are good she remarked with a cheerful nod  good good very good  we have nothing nearly so good  all our things are made of bone or stone  now returned the girl with a blink of her lustrous eyes and a yawn of her pretty mouth which nature had not yet taught her to conceal with her little hand now i am sleepy  i will lie down  cheenbuk replied with a smile and pointed to the canoe with his nose  adolay took the hint crept into the nest which the gallant youth had prepared for her curled herself up like a hedgehog and was sound asleep in five minutes  the eskimo meanwhile resumed his labours with the scalpingknife and whittled on far into the nightwhittled until he had reduced every stick within reach of his hand to a mass of shavingsa beaming childlike glow of satisfaction resting on his handsome face all the while until the embers of the fire began to sink low and only an occasional flicker of flame shot up to enlighten the increasing darkness  then he laid the two implements down and covered them carefully with a piece of deerskin while his countenance resumed its wonted gravity of expression  drawing up his knees until his chin rested on them and clasping his hands round them he sat for a long time brooding there and gazing into the dying embers of the fire then he rose stretched himself and sauntered down to the shore  the night although dark for the arctic regions at that time of the year was not by any means obscure  on the contrary it might have passed for a very fair moonlight night in more southern climes and the flush of the coming day in the eastern sky was beginning to warm the tops of the higher among the icemasses thereby rendering the rest of the scene more coldly grey  the calm which had favoured the escape of our fugitives still prevailed and the open spaces had gradually widened until the floes had assumed the form of ghostly white islets floating in a blueblack sea in which the fantastic cliffs lumps and pinnacles were sharply reflected as in a mirror  there was a solemnity and profound quietude about the scene and the hour which harmonised well with the sedate spirit of the young eskimo as he stood there for a long time contemplating the wonders and the beauties of the world around and about him  we know not what passes through the minds of untutored men in such circumstances but who shall dare to say that the spirit of their creator may not be holding intercourse with them at such times  turning his back at length upon the sea cheenbuk returned to the camp lay down on the couch which he had made for himself on the opposite side of the fire from the canoe and in a few moments more was in the health and strengthrestoring regions of oblivion    chapter twelve  homesweet homeand smoke etcetera  the favouring calm continued until cheenbuk with his companion arrived at waruskeek  it was about midday when their canoe turned round the headland and entered the inlet near the head of which lay the eskimo village  the boy anteek happened to be standing on the shore at the time beside the young girl nootka  they were looking out to sea and observed the canoe the moment it turned the point of rocks  hoioi yelled anteek with an emphasis that caused the inhabitants of the whole village to leap out of every hut with the celerity of squirrels and rush to the shore  here those who had first arrived were eagerly commenting on the approaching visitors  a kayak of the firespouters cried anteek with a look of intense glee for nothing was so dear to the soul of that volatile youth as that which suggested danger except perhaps that which involved fun  the kayak is indeed that of a firespouter said old mangivik shaking his grey head but i dont think any firespouter among them would be such a fool as to run his head into our very jaws  im not ready to agree with you old man began gartok  no youre never ready to agree with any one growled mangivik parenthetically  for the firespouters continued gartok disregarding the growl are afraid of nothing  why should they be when they can spout wounds and death so easily  poor gartok spoke feelingly for his wounded leg had reduced his vigour considerably and he was yet only able to limp about with the aid of a stick while his lieutenant ondikik was reduced to skin and bone by the injury to his back  suddenly mangivik became rather excited  woman he said earnestly to his wife who stood beside him do you see who steers the kayak  look your eyes are better than mine  no  i do not  look again cried anteek pushing forward at that moment  he is not a firespouter  he is one of us  but the one in front is a firespouter woman  look at the man  dont you know him  there was an intensity of suppressed fervour in the manner of the boy and an unwonted glitter in his eyes which impressed every one who noticed him  yes he is one of us said mangivik shading his eyes with one hand and he has stolen a firespouting girl with her kayak  there was a look of pride in the face of the old man as he spoke but it was as nothing to the shout of triumphthe shriek of ecstasythat burst from anteek as he uttered the wordcheenbuk  just then a strong clear voice came rolling over the water to the shore and a roar of joy burst from the whole assemblage for there was no mistaking the voice of their comrade and best hunter  the hearts of nootka and her mother beat with no ordinary flutter as they heard the familiar shout and as for anteek he went into a paroxysm of delight which he sought to relieve by bounding and yelling till the canoe touched the shore  then by a powerful effort he subdued himself and turned his energies into a prolonged look of unutterable amazement at adolay  of course the eyes of the entire population were turned in the same directionfor eskimos do not count it rude to stareso that the poor girl felt somewhat abashed and shrank a little behind her stout protector  observing the action cheenbuk took hold of her arm gently and led her towards his mother  this is my mother adolay he said she will take care of you  your wife asked mrs mangivik with an anxious look  no not my wife replied the youth with a laugh  take her to our hut you and nootka while i go and speak with the menshe saved my life father he added turning to mangivik be good to her  on hearing this nootka and her mother took the girl affectionately by both hands and led her away  cheenbuk meanwhile went up to the big hut just outside of which was held a meeting of nearly the whole population to receive an account of his adventures from the man whom they had long ago given up as lost  my friends he began surveying the expectant assembly with a grave straightforward look when i went by myself to the whale river my intention was to hunt around and find out if there were many birds and beasts on lands near to it and if many men lived or hunted there for it came into my mind that this little island of waruskeek is not the best place in the world to live in for our tribe is continually increasing  i thought that if there were firespouters there already we must be content with the lands we have got for it is not right to take what belongs to other men  cheenbuk paused here and looked round because he knew that he was treading on somewhat new and delicate ground in thus asserting a principle of right and he was not mistaken for while the most of his audience remained silent several of them expressed dissent  besides he continued it is not wise to attack men with firespouters which send into their enemies heavy little things like that which was lately picked out of gartoks leg the same as still seems to be sticking in ondikiks back  ho ho exclaimed a number of the men as if that truth commended itself to their understandings  well when i got to the river i found plenty of whitewhales at the mouth of it and great plenty of birds of all kinds and of deera land good for man to dwell in with many trees that would make sledgerunners and much dead wood for our fires and no one living there nor signs of anybody  then i thought to myself why should we live always among the floes and bergs  the few firespouters whom we have seen and heard of have better food better homes better tools of every kind  why should not we have the same  here the wise cheenbuk drew from the breast of his sealskin coat the axe and scalpingknife which adolay had given him and held them up  this was a politic move for it won over almost the entire audience to the young hunters views while looks of ardent admiration were bestowed on the coveted implements  when men find it not easy to get food resumed cheenbuk in the tone and with the air of a man who has much to say and means to say it they change to some place where hunting is better  when fish become scarce they do not remain still but go to places where the fishing is better they always seek for something that is better and better  is this not true  is this not wise  ho ho exclaimed the assembly assenting  why then should not we go to a land where there is much that is far better than we find here and live as the firespouters live  did the great maker of all things intend that we should remain content with these treeless islands among the ice when there are lands not very far away where we may find much of all kinds of things that are far better if it is wise to change our hunting and fishing grounds close at hand surely it may be wise to change to those that are far awayespecially when we know that they are better and likely to make us more comfortable and happy  this suggestion was such a tremendous innovation on ordinary eskimo ideas such a radical conception of change and upheaval of agelong habits that the assembly gazed in awestruck and silent wonder at the bold young man much as the members of parliament of the last century might have gazed if any reckless mp had dared to propose universal suffrage or vote by ballot or to suggest that measures should henceforth be framed in accordance with the golden rule  after i had travelled a short way inland continued cheenbuk i met a firespouter  he was all alone  no one was with him  he pointed his spouter at me and it clicked but would not spouti dont know why  i threw my spear  it went straightas you know it always doesbut the man was quick he put his head to one side and escaped  again he pointed his spouter at me but again it only clicked  then i rushed upon him and caught hold of it before it could spout  we wrestledbut he was a very strong man and i could not overcome himand he could not overcome me  our breath came short  the sweat poured down our faces and our eyes glared but when we looked steadily into each others eyes we saw that we were both men of peace  we let our bodies go soft and dropped the spouter on the ground  why should we fight said he  that was just in my thought said i  so we stood up and he took hold of my hand in the way that the white traders do and squeezed it  i will show you howgive me your hand anteekno the other one  the boy extended his hand and cheenbuk grasping it gave it a squeeze that caused the little fellow to yell and throw the assembly into convulsions of laughter for eskimos unlike the sedate indians dearly love a practical joke  from this point cheenbuk related the rest of his interview with the indian and was particularly graphic in his description of the pipe which he exhibited to them though he refrained from any reference to its effect upon himself  then he discoursed of his subsequent exploration of the mainland and finally came to the point where he met and rescued rinkabut tell me before i speak more is rinka dead  no she is getting well  that is good he continued in a tone of satisfaction  old uleeta i doubt not told you of the fight i had with the firespouters  she did cried anteek with delight and how you gave them sore hearts  hm they gave me a sore heart too but i dont care now  and they would have roasted me alive but one of their girls had pity on me helped me to escape and came away with me  adolay is her namethe girl you saw today  ho ho hoioi broke forth the chorus of satisfaction  yes but for her continued cheenbuk i should have been under the ground and my hair would have been fluttering on the dress of a firespouter chief by this time  now i have promised this girl that i will get a large party of our young men to go back with her to whale river and give her back to her father and mother  at this there were strong murmurs of dissent and a man whom we have not yet introduced to the reader lifted up his voice  this mans name was aglootook  he was the medicineman of the tribea sort of magician a sharp clever unscrupulous presumptuous and rather fine lookingfellow who held the people in some degree of subjection through their superstitious fears though there were some of the men among them who would not give in to his authority  as eskimos have no regular chiefs this man tried to occupy the position of one he had just returned from a hunting expedition the day before and was jealous of the interest aroused by cheenbuks arrival  moreover cheenbuk was one of the few men of the tribe whom he disliked and rather feared  what folly is this that i hear said aglootook as he frowned on the assembly  are we to get up a warparty and put ourselves to all this trouble for a womanand a firespouter woman  it is not a warparty that i want said cheenbuk quietly  it is a peaceparty and such a strong one that there will be no fear of war  i will conduct it and as i know the way will go by myself unarmed to the village of the men of the woods tell them that i have brought back their girl and that a large party of my people are waiting at the mouth of the river with plenty of skins and walrus teeth and other things to trade with them  but does any one think they will believe that said aglootook with something of scorn in his looks and tone  will the firespouters not accept the girl and roast cheenbuk and then meet us with their spouters and kill many of us even though we should beat them at last  it is my opinion there is something in that remarked mangivik  besides continued the magician what folly is it to talk of changing our customs which have never been changed since the first man created fish and animals  are we not satisfied with whales and walruses bears and seals deer and birds  is not our snow igloe as comfortable as the firespouters skin tent  what do we care for their ornaments or other things  what does cheenbuk know about the great maker of all things has he seen him  has he talked with him  if there is such a maker did he not place us here and surround us with all the things that we need and intend us to remain here  why should we go and look for better things  if he had thought that woods and lakes and rivers had been good for us would he not have made these things here for us so that we should have no need to go far away to seek for them  ay and if aglootook is right interrupted cheenbuk in a calm but firm voice why should we go far away to seek the bear the walrus and the seal  why does aglootook go hunting at all  if the great maker thought these things good for us would he not have made them to walk up to our igloes and ask to be killed and eaten  why should they even do that why not walk straight down our throats and save all trouble  is it not rather quite plain that man was made with wants and wishes and the power to satisfy them and so advance from good to better  does not aglootook prove by his own conduct that he thinks so  he might make life easy by sitting near his hut and killing for food the little birds that come about our dwellings but he goes on long hard journeys and takes much trouble for he knows that slices of fat seal and walrusribs are better than little birds  there was a general laugh at the expense of the magician for his mental powers were inferior to those of cheenbuk and he felt himself unable to see through the entanglement of his logic  boh he ejaculated with a sweep of his long arm as if to clear away such ridiculous arguments  what stuff is this that i hear  surely cheenbuk has been smitten with the folly of the firespouters  his words are like a lamp with a very bad wick it makes too much smoke and confuses everything near it  aglootook is right said cheenbuk who resolved to end the dispute at this point many words are like the smoke of a bad lamp they confuse especially when they are not wellunderstood but the firespouters confuse themselves with real smoke as well as with words  see here is one of their things the white traders call it a paip or piep  as he spoke he opened the firebag which adolay had given him and took out of it the clay pipe tobacco and materials for producing fire  the medicineman was instantly forgotten and the mouths as well as the eyes of the whole assembly opened in unspeakable wonder as cheenbuk went through the complex processes of filling and lighting the pipe  first he cut up some of the canada twist which he explained was the tubuk of the white men  then having filled the pipe he proceeded to strike a light with flint and steel  in this he was not very successful at first not yet having had much practice  he chipped his knuckles a good deal and more than once knocked the flint and tinder out of his fingers  but his audience was not critical  they regarded this as part of the performance  when however he at last struck a succession of sparks he also struck an equal number of short sharp expressions of astonishment out of his friends and when the tinder caught there was a suppressed grunt of surprise and pleasure but when he put the fire into the pipe and began to smoke there burst forth a prolonged shout of laughter  to see a man smoking like a bad lamp was a joke that seemed to tickle those unsophisticated children of the ice immensely  is it good asked one  do you like it cried another  let me try it begged a third  mindful of past experiences cheenbuk did not indulge in many whiffs  no no he said taking the pipe from his lips with solemn gravity not every one who wishes it shall have a taste of this today  only a great man of our tribe shall try it  some one who has done great things above his fellows  he looked pointedly at aglootook as he spoke with solemnity on his face but mischief in his heart  oolalik however with the reverse of mischief in his heart interfered unwittingly with his designs  he seized hold of anteek who chanced to be near him and thrust him forward  here said he is one of the great ones of our tribe at least he will be one if he lives long for he has killed a walrus all by himselfon land too  the boy although pretty full of what is known among the civilised as cheek was almost overwhelmed by this public recognition of his prowess and was about to retire with a halfshy expression when the audience received the proposal with a burst of applause  yes yes they cried he is a brave boy let him try it  seeing that they were set upon it cheenbuk handed the pipe to the boy and bade him draw the smoke in and puff it out taking care not to swallow it  but anteek did swallow some at first and choked a little to the great amusement of the assembly  his pride carried him through however he tried again and was successful  then his cheek came back and he went on puffing out far larger volumes than his instructor had done  you had better stop said cheenbuk reaching out his hand to take the pipe but the boy dodged him with a laugh and went on worse than ever seeing this cheenbuk smiled significantly and waited  he had not to wait long  suddenly the face of anteek became unusually pale  placing the pipe hurriedly in the bands of a man near him he bolted out of the hut and disappeared  he was not seen again during the remainder of that conference    chapter thirteen  doings in waruskeek  while cheenbuk was thus entrancing the souls of his friends near the big hut his mother and sister were exercising hospitality to the indian girl in their private residence  it was rather a dark and smoky residence with only one hole in the roof about eight inches square to let in light  if truth must be told it was also somewhat dirty for besides having only one large room in which living cooking receiving company and sleeping were carried on the dogs of the family were permitted to repose therewhen they were good  anything approaching to badness ensured their summary and violent ejection  branching from this family room was a little recess screened off by skin curtains which formed nootkas private apartment or boudoir  it was singularly unlike the boudoirs of other lands  black smoke instead of whitewash coloured the walls and ceiling  no glass hung on the wall to reflect the visage of the arctic beauty but there were several pegs from one of which hung nootkas sealskin badweather jacket the tadpoletail of which reached to the ground while from another depended a pair of her long waterproof boots  one half of the floor being raised about eight inches constituted the eskimo maidens couchalso her chair and sofa  there was no table but the skull of a walrus did service as a stool  to this apartment nootka introduced her young indian friend leaving her mother in the outer hall and the two maidens at once began as might have been expected an earnest and confidential conversation  in their eagerness they had not reflected that each knew not one word of the others language but of course the first sentences opened their eyes to the melancholy fact  they had indeed been opened already to some extent but not so impressively as now when they longed for a good talk  come here said nootkaof course in eskimoas she dragged rather than led her new friend into the boudoir i want you to tell me all about your saving my brothers life  i dont understand a word you say replied adolayof course in dogrib indianwith a look of great perplexity in her wideopen eyes  oh  im stupid and sorry  i forgot  you dont speak our language  what funny sounds  it seems like nonsense remarked adolaymore to herself than to her friend  so curious soliloquised nootka what one might expect from a seal if it tried to speak  say that over again  i like to hear it  the perplexity on the face of the indian maid deepened and she shook her head while the look of fun in that of the eskimo maiden increased and she smiled knowingly  here at last they had hit on common groundtapped a universal spring of human communication  adolay at once beamed an answering smile and displayed all her brilliant teeth in doing so  this drew a soft laugh of pleasure from nootka and an intelligent nod  nods and smiles however pleasant in their way though they be form a very imperfect means of intercourse between souls which wish to unite and the perplexed expression was beginning again to steal over both their youthful countenances when something in the nature of a happy thought seemed to strike the indian girl for a gleam as of sunlight flashed from her eyes and teeth as she suddenly beat with her little fist three times on her own bosom exclaiming adolay  adolay adolay with much emphasis  then poking her finger against her friends breast she addedyou you  here again was a touch of nature which made these two damsels kin although the you you was not intelligible to the eskimo the gaze of inquiry was a familiar tongue  with a smile of delight she nodded struck her own bosom with her fist and said nootka  nootka  then tapping her friend she saidaddilay  the indian nodding assent tapped her in return and exclaimed noootko  after this little sparring match they both burst into a fit of hearty laughter which roused the curiosity of mrs mangivik in the outer hall  what is the joke shouted the old lady who was hospitably preparing a feast of steaks and ribs for her guest  oh mother she is so funnycome addilay let her hear your fun said the girl taking her guests hand and leading her back to the hall her name is addilay  i know for she told me herself  we quite understand each other already  speak to mother addilay  tell her something  i dont know what you want me to do noootko returned the indian girl with a bright look but i know that whatever you are saying must be kind for youve got such a nice face  by way of emphasising her opinion she took the face between her hands and laid her own against it  we have never been quite sure as to what adolay did on this occasion whether she rubbed noses or chins or touched lips  all that we are sure of is that the operation was equivalent to a kiss and that it was reciprocated heartily  didnt i tell you mother that she was funny  ill explain to you what she said when we are alone but addilay is hungry now and so am i  let us feed mother  without more ado the trio sat down beside the cookinglamp and began to do justice to the savoury viands the odour of which was so enticing that it was too much for the dogs of the family  these had to be expelled by means of old bones  mrs mangivik being an expert shot with such artillery the hall was soon cleared  after the meal conversation was resumed and conducted with considerably greater ease owing to the chief subject of it being the indian girls costume which was somewhat elaborate for being a chiefs daughter her dress was in many respects beautifulespecially those portions of it such as the leggings and the headdress which were profusely ornamented with coloured beads and porcupinequill work the examination of the various parts occupied a considerable time  the mode of ascertaining names had been already discovered and looks of admiration require no translation so that the three women were deeply engaged in a most interesting talk when cheenbuk and his father entered the hut after the conference  ribs ribs and slices  quick woman cried mangivik cheerily as he sat down  cheenbuk has been talking and i have been listening till we are both quite hungrythat is a pretty girl you have brought home with you my son said the old man with a stare of approval  almost as pretty as some of our own girls  much prettier i think returned the youth as he quietly selected a rib of walrus that seemed suitable to his capacity  tell your mother how you got hold of her said mangivik whose teeth were next moment fastened in a steak  cheenbuk made no reply  eskimo manners did not require an answer in the circumstances  but when he had taken the edge off his appetiteand it took a good deal of dental grinding to do thathe looked across at adolay with a genial expression and began to give his mother and sister a second and much more graphic edition of the speech which he had just delivered to the men  of course the narration served to strengthen the bonds of friendship which had already been formed between the mangivik family and the indian girl who had been thus unexpectedly added to their circle  that evening nootka begged her brother to give her a lesson in the dogrib language  on the same evening during a moonlight ramble adolay asked him to give her a little instruction in the eskimo tongue and just before he retired for the night his mother asked him if he intended to take the indian girl as one of his wives  you know mother was cheenbuks reply i have always differed from my friends about wives  i think that one wife is enough for one man sometimes too much for him  i also think that if it is fair for a man to choose a woman it is also fair for the woman to choose the man  i would gladly take adolay for a wife for she is good as well as pretty but i do not know that she would take me for a husband  have you not asked her then persisted mrs mangivik  no  i have been till now her protector  i can wait  if she wants to return to her people i have promised to take her to them  but surely my son is not bound to keep a promise given to one of our firespouting enemies  that may seem right to you mother but it seems wrong to me  i do not understand why i disagree with you and with most of my people but there is something inside of me which i think is not me  it tells me not to do many things that i want to do and sometimes bids me go forward when i wish to draw back  what it is i cannot tell but i must not disobey it i will not disobey it  with this answer the old lady had to be content for she could extract nothing more from her son after that but a smile  as for old mangivik he asked and said nothing but he thought much  a few days after cheenbuks arrival it was arranged by the heads of the village that there should be a general scattering of the tribe for a great hunt after seals and wildfowl as provisions were not so plentiful as might have been desired  an expedition of this kind was always hailed with great glee by anteek whose youth and very excitable disposition were not easily satisfied with the prosaic details of village life  previous to setting out however an event occurred which was wellnigh attended with disastrous consequences  it had been arranged that cheenbuk and his friends oolalik and anteek should keep together in their kayaks accompanied by an oomiak to carry the game  this womans boat was to be manned so to speak by young uleeta cowlik and two other girls  adolay had been offered a place in it but she preferred going in her own bark canoe with the management of which she was familiar  perhaps a touch of national pride had something to do with this preference of the indian craft  nootka who had made several trials of the canoe was judged sufficiently expert to wield the bow paddle  while preparations were being made adolay and nootka went to the bay where the canoe was lyinga short distance from the village on the other side of a high cliff that sheltered the bay from any breeze that might blow in from the sea  the light craft was turned bottom up on the beach and the two girls carried it down to the waters edge  launching it nootka got in first and adolay was preparing to follow when a boyish shout arrested her and she saw anteek come skimming round the point in his kayak wielding his doublebladed paddle with great dexterity and power  in a few seconds the kayak was alongside the canoe and the boy stepped out upon the shore  let me try to steer your canoe he said pointing eagerly to the place where the indian girl was about to seat herself  although adolay did not understand the words she had no difficulty with the boys expressive pantomime  she nodded assent cheerfully  anteek took the paddle stepped into her place and the girl pushed them off into deep water  delighted with the novelty of their position the two paddled away with great vigour and were soon a considerable distance from the shore then it occurred to adolay that she would have some fun on her own account and perhaps give her new friends a surprise  with this intent she floated the kayak and pushed it alongside of a flat stone in the water from which she could step into it  but she found that stepping into a small round hole in the centre of a covered craft was not the same as stepping into her own canoe and even when with great care she succeeded she found that her garments rendered the process of sitting down rather difficultnot a matter of wonder when we consider that the kayak is meant only for men  however she succeeded at last and grasping the paddle pushed off to sea  but the long paddle with its blade at each end perplexed her greatly and she had not quite overcome the awkwardness and begun to feel somewhat at ease when she chanced to touch on a ledge of rock that cropped up at that place near to the surface  fortunately the rock was quite smooth else it would have ripped up the skin with which the vessel was covered but the shock and the paddle together were too much for the inexperienced girl  she lost her balance and next moment was in the water with the kayak bottom up and she incapable of extricating herself from the hole into which she had squeezed  it happened that anteek and nootka had observed what adolay was about and were watching her with interest so that before the kayak had turned fairly over their paddles dipped with a flash in the water and they rushed to the rescue  and not a moment too soon for the poor girls power of endurance was almost exhausted when her friends turned the kayak violently up  this was well and adolay drew a long gasping breath but now the inexperience of the rescuers came into play for being ignorant of the cranky nature of a birchbark canoe they acted without the necessary caution the canoe overturned and they all found themselves in the water  this time adolay managed to wriggle out of her position but being unable to swim she could only cling helplessly to the kayak  nootka equally helpless clung to the canoe  fortunately anteek could swim like a fish and bravely set to work to push both crafts towards the shore  but they were a long way out the weight of the two girls made them difficult to push and being separate they had a tendency to diverge in different directions  after a few vigorous efforts the boy perceiving the difficulty and the extreme danger of their position at once set up a series of yells that awoke sympathetic echoes in the neighbourhood but he did not for a moment relax his efforts to push his charge towards the shore  startled by the sudden outburst of alarming cries several men ran along shore in the direction whence they came  foremost among these was the powerful and active oolalik  on turning the point and seeing what had occurred he plunged into the sea and swam like a dolphin to the rescue great was the size of his eyes and intense the swelling of his heart when he saw that nootka was one of the swimmers  take care of addilay and the kayak he remarked to anteek as he drew near i will look after nootka and the canoe  what nootka felt on hearing these words we cannot tell but any one might have seen that despite her unpleasant position there was a pleased expression on her wet face  a very few minutes more sufficed to bring them all safe to land and no one was a whit the worse but as the girls required a complete change of garments it was finally decided that the hunting expedition should be postponed until the following day    chapter fourteen  in the wildwoods again  while these events were taking place among the islands of the arctic sea the indian chief nazinred was slowly pushing his canoe southward in the direction of great bear lake  he was accompanied as we have said by three likeminded comrades one of whom was named mozwaor moosedeerfrom some fancied resemblance in him to that uncouth animal  but mozwa although uncouth was by no means ungenial  on the contrary he was a hearty goodnatured fellow who always tried to make the best of things and never gave way to despondency however gloomy or desperate might be the nature of his circumstances  moreover he was a big strong man full of courage in the prime of life and modest withal so that he was usually rather inclined to take than to give adviceto be led rather than to lead  for hours together these men dipped their paddles over the side in concert without uttering a single word or giving more than a slight exclamation when anything worthy of notice attracted their attention the interchange of thought during the labours of the day did not seem to strike them as necessary  the mere being in company of each other was a sufficient bond of sympathy until an encampment was reached each evening supper disposed of and the tobaccopipes in full blast  then at last their native reserve gave way and they ventured to indulge a littlesometimes a good dealin the feast of reason and the flow of soul  yet the nature of their voyage was such that white men might have deemed verbal intercourse an occasional necessity as their route lay through much rugged and wild scenery where the streams up which they had to force their way were in some places obstructed by rapids and shallows and a mistake on their part might have brought sudden disaster and ruin for their canoe was deeply laden with the furs which they had secured during the labours of the past winter and on the sale of which to the furtraders depended much of their and their families felicity or misery during the winter which was to come  but the steersman and bowman understood their work so well and were so absolutely in accord that the slightest action with the paddle on the part of either was understood and sympathetically met by the other  this unity of action is much more important than the navigators of lakes and oceans may suppose  in those almost currentless waters a steersman in any craft is usually selfsufficient but among turbulent rapids where rocks and shoals lie in all directions and the deepwater track is tortuous with it may be abrupt turnings here and there a bowman is absolutely essential and sometimes indeed may become the more important steersman of the two  one evening long after the period when they left their native encampment the friends paddled their little vessel into the backwater at the foot of a long rapid which roared in foaming white billows right ahead of them offering what seemed an effectual barrier to their further progressat least by waterand as the sides of the gorge through which the river rushed were almost perpendicular without margin and with impenetrable bush everywhere advance by land seemed equally blocked  looking backward mozwa gave his friend an interrogative glance nazinred replied with an affirmative nod and all four dipping their paddles vigorously at the same moment they shot out into the stream almost before the canoe was caught by the current it swung quickly into another eddy which carried it up a few yards close under the frowning cliffs  here again the indians paused and gazed earnestly at the foaming torrent ahead which to an unpractised eye might have seemed a raging flood to enter which would ensure destruction  and indeed the two guides seemed to entertain some such thoughts for they continued to gaze for a considerable time in silent inaction  then the bowman threw back another glance the steersman replied with another nod and again the canoe shot out into the stream  this time the struggle was more severe  a short distance above the point where they entered it a large rock reared its black head in midstream  below it there was the usual long stretch of backwater  to reach the tail of this stretch was the object of the men but the intervening rush was so powerful that it swept them down like a cork so that they almost missed it despite their utmost efforts  almost however is a hopeful phrase  they were not quite beyond the influence of the eddy when they reached the end of the tail  a superhuman effort might yet save them from being swept back to the point far below that from which they had started  mozwa was just the man to make such an effort  nazinred and the others were preeminently the men to back him up  ho cried mozwa  hoi shouted nazinred as they bent their backs and cracked their sinews and made the big veins stand up on their necks and foreheads  a few seconds more and the canoe was floating under the shelter of the blackheaded rock and the indians rested while they surveyed the battleground yet before them  the next reach carried them right across the river to a place where a long bend produced a considerable sweep of eddying water up which they paddled easily  above this one or two short bursts into the tails caused by nearly sunken rocks brought them to a point full halfway up the rapid  but now greater caution was needed because anything like a miss would send them downward and might hurl them with destructive force against the rocks and ledges which they had already passed  a birchbark canoe is an exceedingly tender craft which is not only certain of destruction if it strikes a rock but is pretty sure of being swamped if it even grazes one  with the utmost care therefore and consummate skill they succeeded in pushing up the rapid inch by inch without mishap until they reached the last shoot when their skill or good fortune or whatever it was failed them for they missed the last eddy were swept downwards a few yards and just touched a rock  it was a very slight touch  a boatman would have smiled at it nevertheless it drew from the indians hos and hois such as they had not given vent to since the voyage began at the same time they rushed the canoe with all their strength for the nearest point of land  they were scarcely a minute in reaching it yet in that brief space of time their craft had almost sunk a large piece of the bark having been torn from its side  the instant they touched land the two leaders stepped quickly out and while they held the craft close to the bank their comrades threw out the bundles of fur as fast as possible  then the canoe was turned over to empty it and carried up the bank  that is good luck said mozwa quietly as they stood looking at the large hole in the canoe  i have seen better luck remarked nazinred with something that might almost have been mistaken for a smile on his grave countenance  mozwa did not explain  nazinred knew that the luck referred to was the fact that before the accident occurred they had surmounted all the difficulties of the rapid and that the place on which they stood was convenient for camping on as well as for opening out and drying the furs on the following day  and mozwa knew that nazinred knew all that  while the latter kindled a fire arranged the camp and prepared supper under a spreading tree the former mended the canoe  the process was simple and soon completed  from a roll of birchbark always carried in canoes for such emergencies mozwa cut off a piece a little larger than the hole it was designed to patch  with this he covered the injured place and sewed it to the canoe using an awl as a needle and the split roots of a tree as thread  thereafter he plastered the seams over with gum to make them watertight and the whole job was finished by the time the other men had got supper ready  indians are in the habit of eating supper in what may be styled a businesslike mannerthey mean business to use a familiar phrase when they sit down to that meal  indeed most savages do it is only civilised dyspeptics who dont  when the seriousness of the business began to wear off the idea of mental effort and lingual communication occurred to the friends  hitherto their eyes alone had spoken and these expressive orbs had testified as plainly as could the tongue to the intense gratification they derived from the possession of good appetites and plenty of food  i think said mozwa wiping his mouth with that familiar handkerchiefthe back of his handthat there will be trouble in the camp before long for when you are away that beast magadar has too much power  he will try to make our young men go with him to fight the eskimos  it must not be supposed that the indian applied the word beast to magadar in that objectionable and slangy way in which it is used among ourselves  indians happily have no slang  they are not civilised enough for that  mozwa merely meant to express his opinion that magadars nature was more allied to that of the lower than of the higher animals  yes and alizay will encourage him returned nazinred with a frown the man is wellnamed  this remark about the name had reference to the word alizay which means gunpowder and which had been given to the indian in his boyhood because of his fiery and quarrelsome disposition  the geese and the ducks are in plenty just now continued nazinred i hope that he and magadar will be more taken up with filling their mouths than fighting till i returnand then i can hinder them  hm responded mozwa  he might have said more but was busy lighting his pipe at the moment  nazinred made no further remark at the time for he was in the full enjoyment of the first voluminous exhalation of the weed  after a few minutes the chief resumed  our old chief is full of the right spirit  he is losing power with the young men but i think he can still guide them  i will hope so and we will return as soon as we can  poor nazinred  if he had known that his only and beloved daughter even while he spoke was on her way to the mysterious icy sea in company with one of the despised eskimosdriven away by the violence of the fireeaters of the camphe would not have smoked or spoken so calmly but fortunately for his own peace of mind he did not knowhe did not dream of the possibility of such a catastrophe and even if he had known and returned home at full speed he would have been too late to prevent the evil  for a long time these indians lay side by side on their outspread blankets with their feet to the fire gazing through the branches at the stars and puffing away in profound silence but probably deep thought  at least a sudden exclamation by mozwa warrants that conclusion  you think he said that our old chief has the right spirit  how do you know what is the right spirit  alizay and magadar and many of our bravesespecially the young onesthink that a fiery spirit that flares up like powder and is always ready to fight is the right one you and our old chief think that gentleness and forbearance and unwillingness to fight till you cannot help it is the right spirit  how do you know which is right  you and the warlovers cannot both be right  there was an expression of great perplexity on the indians face as he uttered the last sentence  my son replied nazinred who although not much older than his companion assumed the parental role in virtue of his chieftainship how do you know that you are alive  this was such an unexpected answer that mozwa gazed fixedly upwards for a few minutes without making any reply  i know it he said at length because iiknow it  ii feel it  how do you know continued the chief with perplexing pertinacity that the sun is not the moon  again mozwa became astronomically meditative  because i see it and feel it he replied  the sun is brighter and warmer  it cheers me more than the moon and gives me more light and warms me  it warms the bushes and flowers too and makes them grow and it draws the beasts out of their holes  even a rabbit knows the difference between the sun and the moon  my son returned nazinred i have not lived very long yet but i have lived long enough to see and feel and know that the kind spirit is the right spirit because it warms the heart and opens the eyes and gives light and it is the only spirit that can make friends of foes  is it not better to live at peace and in goodwill with all men than to live as enemies  ho responded mozwa by way of assent  then the peaceful spirit is the right one rejoined the chief with a longdrawn sigh that indicated a tendency to close the discussion  as mozwa felt himself to be in a somewhat confused mental condition he echoed the sigh laid down his pipe drew his blanket round him and without the formality of goodnight resigned himself to repose  nazinred after taking a look at the weather pondering perchance on the probabilities of the morrow and throwing a fresh log on the fire also wrapped his blanket round him and lost himself in slumber    chapter fifteen  wild doings of the furtraders and red men  in course of time after many a hard struggle with rushing rapids and not a few narrow escapes from dangerous rocks the indian voyagers swept out at last upon the broad bosom of great bear lake  this mighty inland sea of fresh waterabout two hundred miles in diameter and big enough to engulf the greater part of scotlandwas at the time we write of and still is far beyond the outmost verge of civilisation in the remotest solitudes of the great lone land  here the furtraders had established a small tradingpost close to the shores of the lake  it was in charge of a scotchmanwe had almost said of course for it would seem as if these hardy dwellers in the north of our island have a special gift for penetrating into and inhabiting the wildest and most unlikely parts of the world  his name was macsweenie and he had a few orkneymen and halfcastes to keep him company while vegetating there  it was a sort of event a mild excitement a pinkif not a redletter day when our indians arrived at that lonely outpost and macsweenie who was in the prime of life and the depths of ennui gave the strangers a hearty and warm reception  nazinred had been there before and was able somewhat to subdue his feelings of admiration and notquiteexhausted surprise at all the wonderful things he saw but to the others it was comparatively new and mozwa had never been at a tradingpost in his life  being a sympathetic man he found it difficult to retain at all times that solemnity of manner and look which he knew was expected of him  the chief who was also sympathetic experienced deep pleasure in watching his companions face and observing the efforts he made to appear indifferent knowing as he did from former experience that he must in reality be full of surprise and curiosity  and truly in the store of the furtraders there was a display of wealth which to unaccustomed indian eyes must have seemed almost fabulous  for were there not in this enchanted castle bales of bright blue cloth and bright scarlet cloth and various other kinds of cloth sufficient to clothe the entire dogrib nation  were there not guns enoughcheap flintlock bluebarrelled onesto make all the eskimos in the polar regions look blue with envy if not with fear  were there not bright beads and brass rings and other baubles and coloured silk thread enough to make the hearts of all the dogrib squaws to dance with joy  were there not axes and tomahawks and scalpingknives enough to make the fingers of the braves to itch for war  were there not hooks and lines enough to capture all the fish in great bear lake and nests of copper kettles enough to boil them all at one tremendous culinary operation  and was there not gunpowder enough to blow the fort and all its contents into unrecognisable atoms  yes there was enough in that store fully to account for the look of awestricken wonder which overspread the visage of mozwa and for the restrained tendency to laughter which taxed the solemn nazinred considerably  you are fery welcome said macsweenie as he ushered the chief and mozwa into the store the day after their arrival  we hev not seen one o your people for many a day an its thinking i wass that you would be forgettin us altogether  tell them that tonal  tonal or donald mowat was macsweenies interpreter and factotum he was a man of middle age and middle height but by no means middle capacity  having left his native home in orkney while yet a youth he had spent the greater part of his life in the norwest and had proved himself to be one of those quick learners and generally handy fellows who because of their aptitude to pick up many trades are too commonly supposed to be masters of none  mowat besides being a firstrate blacksmith had picked up the indian language after a fashion from the crees and french of a kind from the canadian halfcastes and even a smattering of gaelic from the few scotch highlanders in the service  he could use the axe as well as forge it and in short could turn his hand to almost anything  among other things he could play splendidly on the violinan instrument which he styled a fiddle and which macsweenie called a fuddle  his repertoire was neither extensive nor select  if you had asked for something of beethoven or mozart he would have opened his eyes perhaps also his mouth  but at a strathspey or the reel o tulloch he was almost equal to neil gow himselfso admirable were his tune and time in a lonesome land where amusements are few and the nights long the power to fuddle counts for much  besides being macsweenies interpreter donald was also his storekeeper  give them both a quid tonal to begin with said macsweenie  it iss always politic to keep indians in good humour  donald cut off two long pieces of canada twist and handed it to them he cut them from a roll which was large enough in the estimation of mozwa to last a reasonable smoker to the crack of doom  they received the gift with an expression of approval  it would have been beneath their dignity to have allowed elation or gratitude to appear in their manner  solemn humbugs thought the traderye know that youre as pleased as punch but he was careful to conceal his thoughts  now then let us hev a look at the furs  it took the trader and his assistant some time to examine the furs and put a price on them  the indians had no resource but to accept their dictum on the point for there were no rival markets there  moreover the value being fixed according to a regular and wellunderstood tariff and the trader being the servant of a company with a fixed salary there was no temptation to unfair action on his part  when the valuation was completed a number of goosequills were handed to the indianseach quill representing a sum of about two shillingswhereby each man had a fair notion of the extent of his fortune  what iss it you will be wanting now said the trader addressing himself to nazinred with the air of a man whose powers of production are illimitable  but the chief did not reply for some time  it was not every day that he went shopping and he was not to be hurried  his own personal wants had to be considered with relation to the pile of quillwealth at his elbow and what was of far greater importance and difficulty to a kind man the wants of his squaw and adolay had also to be thought of  mozwa having left a squaw two little daughters and a very small son had still greater difficulties to contend with  but they both faced them like men  pasgissegan said both men at length simultaneously  i thought so observed the trader with a smile as he selected two tradegunsthe firespouters of the eskimoand handed them across the counter  the indians received the weapons with almost tender care examined them carefully took long and steady aim at the windows several times snapped the flints to make sure that the steels were good and generally inspected every detail connected with them  being satisfied they rested them against the wall the trader withdrew the price of the guns from the two little piles threw the quills into an empty box under the counter and lookedif he did not say what next  powder shot and ball came next and then the means of hunting and selfdefence having been secured beads and scarlet cloth for the women claimed their attention  it was an interesting sight to see these tall darkskinned sons of the forest handling the cloth and fingering the various articles with all the gravity and deliberation of experts with now and then a lowtoned comment or a quiet question as to the price  youll want that suggested mowat as he threw a small thick blanket quite a miniature blankettowards mozwa your small boy will want it  ho exclaimed the indian with a look of surprise in spite of himself how do you know  i didnt know  i only guessed but your question shows me im right any more  yes two more but bigger  of course bigger for its not likely they were all born at the same time returned mowat with a grin  what iss this man wantin tonal  i cant make him out at all asked macsweenie  it was found that nazinred had been pointing with eager pertinacity at something lying on one of the shelves which had caught his eye but the name of which he did not know  oh  i see added the trader it iss a cocktail feather you want  yes for my daughter exclaimed the indian as he received the feather and regarded it with some uncertaintyas well he might for the feather in question was a thing of brilliant scarlet made up of many feathers rigid and over a foot in height  its not a good plaything for a child remarked mowat  my daughter is not a childshe is a woman  wow man said macsweenie tell him that feather is not for a woman it iss for a man  the indian however needed no explanation  that which had captivated him at a distance lost its attraction on closer examination  he rejected it with quiet indifference and turned his eyes to something not less attractive but more usefula web of brilliant lightblue cloth  he was very fond of adolay and had made up his mind to take back to her a gift which she would be certain to like  indeed to make sure of this he determined to take to her a variety of presents so that among them all she would be sure to find something to her taste  in this way the indians spent several days at the fort of the traders on great bear lake and then prepared to return home with a canoeload of goods instead of furs  before leaving however they had a specimen of one of the ways in which furtraders in those lonely regions of the far north enjoy themselves the whole establishment consisted of the officer in chargemacsweenie his interpreter donald mowat and seven mentwo of whom were french canadians two halfcastes and three orkneymen  there were also three women two being wives of the men from orkney and one the wife of one of the halfcastes  the greater part of the day previous to that on which they were to set out on the return voyage nazinred and mozwa spent in testing the quality of their new guns in company with macsweenie who took his faithful donald mowat with him partly to assist in carrying the game and partly for interpreting purposes  and a superb testingground it was for the swampy spots and mud flats were alive with wildfowl of all kinds from the lively sandpiper to the great canada grey goose while the air was vocal with their whistling wings and trumpet cries so that whether they walked among the shrubs and sedges or sat in ambush on the rocky points ample opportunity was afforded to test the weapons as well as the skill of the owners  the beginning of the day however was not quite satisfactory  they had scarcely proceeded more than a few hundred yards from the fort when a flock of ducks was observed flying low and straight towards them  down man quick exclaimed macsweenie crouching behind a large bush you will get a goot chance and the gun will kill if ye point straight for the tradeguns are fery goot the most ofwow  the sudden end of his remark was caused by nazinred firing and thereafter rising with the shattered fragments of the gun in his hand and a little blood trickling from one of his fingers while an expression of stern perplexity overspread his visage  well now that iss most extraordinary said the trader examining the weapon  i hev not seen such a thing for years  to be sure they are cheap and made of castiron but they seldom burst like that an they usually shoot straight whatevertell him tonal that he need not concern himself for i will give him another  on this being translated nazinred seemed content and began to examine his hurt which by good fortune was a slight one  it might have been worse remarked mowat gravely ive seen many a man in this country with a short allowance of fingerjoints from the same cause  what you observe is fery true tonal said the trader with a serious air it might have been worse  there was a bit of the barrel went past my head that fery nearly put me on a short allowance of life  but come with me to the store an we will choose a better one  half an hour sufficed to select another fowlingpiece which stood all the tests to which it was subjected and as evening was about to close in the whole party returned well laden with game and thoroughly pleased with the weapons  meanwhile the men of the establishment had been variously employed cutting and hauling firewood attending the nets etcetera while the women had been busy making moccasins and mending garments  the cookan orkneymanhad made extensive preparations for a feast but this was a secret between him and macsweenie the latter being fond of occasionally giving his people a surprisetreat  it was not indeed easy to surprise them at that time with unusually good food for the land was swarming with spring life and they daily enjoyed the fat of it  but there were some little delicacies which were not to be had every day in the wilderness of the far north  among them was a round object about the shape size and consistency of a large cannonball which was tied up in a cloth and seemed to require an immense amount of boiling  the smell of this was delicious and when ultimately turned out of its cloth it presented a whiteybrown mottled appearance which was highly suggestive  the cook also had a peculiar talent for making cakes which no norwester could imitate but which any norwester in the land could eat  there were other trifles which it would take too long to mention and large pots of tea which it would not take very long to drink  that was all the drink they had happily for strong young people with high spirits do not require strong spirits to keep their spirits up  after the feast the tables and chairs were cleared away from the central or reception hall of the fort and preparations were made for spending a harmonious evening for you see stout people in the prime of life who have not damaged themselves with strong drink find it difficult to exhaust their energies by means of an ordinary days work  now tonal said macsweenie get out your fuddle an strike up  the ladies have not finished their tea yet sir replied the interpreter  nefer mind that  just let them hear the strains of lord macdonalds reel an youll make them chump whether they will or no  thus encouraged mowat began and sure enough there was something so inspiriting in the tuneful tones the vigorously indicated time and the lively air that the excited highlander gave a whoop that threw indian warcries quite into the shade seized one of the ladies by an arm and unceremoniously led her to the middle of the floor  the cook who was used to his masters ways led out one of the other ladies in a similar freeandeasy manner and soon two couples were thundering on the boards in all the glorious abandon of a scotch reel  they danced nothing but scotch reels for the good reason that none of them could dance anything else  indeed none of them except macsweenie could dance even these in correct fashion but the reel like the scotch character is adaptable  it lends itself to circumstances if we may say so and admits of the absolutely ignorant being pushed trundled shoved or kicked through at least a semblance of it which to the operators is almost as good as the reality  nazinred and mozwa had never seen anything of the kind before or heard the strains of a fuddle  it may well be imagined therefore what was the condition of their minds  native reticence stood them in good stead for a considerable time though in spite of it their eyes opened to an extent that was unusual but as the fun became faster and more furious their grave features relaxed their mouths expanded their teeth began to show and they looked at each other with the intent probably of saying we never even dreamed of such things  but that look wrought a transformation for when each beheld the others grin of unwonted levity he burst into a short laugh then becoming ashamed of themselves they suddenly resumed their expressions of owlish gravity from which they could not again be driven until a late period of the evening  frequent slices of the mottled cannonball however and unlimited mugs of highlysugared tea had the effect of thawing them down a little but nothing could induce them to dance  next morning they were up by daybreak and ready to start for the farther north  now mind said macsweenie through his interpreter dont you be fechtin wi the eskimos  dance wi them if ye will but dont fecht better try an trade wi them  an be sure ye bring some more o your people wi you the next time you come here  well be glad to see you the more the merrier  how donald mowat translated these words we cannot tell  perhaps he added to them a few sentiments of his own  however that may be it is certain that the indians bade their entertainers farewell with feelings of hearty goodwill and leaving the lonely outpost behind them set off on the return journey to their wilderness home    chapter sixteen  sorrows and sins and a bold adventure  it was autumn before nazinred and mozwa drew near to their village they took things leisurely on the return voyage for as indians have little else to do besides hunt trap fish eat and sleep they have no particular inducement to hurry their movements  it is true that being affectionate men they were naturally anxious to rejoin their families but being also steadygoing with considerable powers of selfdenial they were good menofbusiness from a savage point of view and gave leisurely attention to the duties in hand  on arriving at the outskirts of their village they were surprised to see that one or two children who were playing among the bushes and who could not have failed to see them slunk away as if to avoid a meeting whatever anxiety the men might have felt their bronzed and stern countenances betrayed no sign whatever  landing near the old chiefs hut they drew up their canoe and nazinred and mozwa went to announce their arrival  it was contrary to indian etiquette to betray excitement or to ask hasty questions  they saluted the old man handed him a plug of tobacco and sat down to smoke and it was not till some time had elapsed that nazinred calmly asked if isquay was well  isquay is well replied the old chief and a barely perceptible sigh of relief escaped nazinred  then mozwa asked about his wife and received a satisfactory answer still it was obvious to both men from the old chiefs manner that there was something wrong  adolay said the old man and stopped  dead asked nazinred with a look of alarm that he did not attempt to conceal  no not deadbut gone away he replied and then related in detail the circumstances of the girls disappearance  it must have been a terrible blow to the poor father all the more that he was ignorant at the time of the girls motive for forsaking her home  but no vestige of feeling did he betray save a slight contraction of his brows and a nervous play of his fingers about the handle of his scalpingknife when the recital was ended he made no reply but rising slowly left the hut and went to his own home  we will not follow him thither there are some homecomings which are better left undescribed  but next day nazinred relaunched his canoe and with a small quantity of provisions and a large supply of ammunition set off alone for the shores of the arctic sea  what he told his wife is not known but he gave no explanation whatever to any of his comrades as to his intentions  arrived at the coast however his further advance was rendered impossible by a sharp frost which created the first thin crust that was ultimately destined to turn the sea into thick ice  as even the thinnest coat of ice would be certain destruction to birchbark the canoe he was well aware was now useless  he therefore returned home and quietly engaged in the ordinary hunting and fishing occupation of his tribe but from that date he sank into a state of silent despair from which his most intimate companions failed to rouse him  not that he gave expression to his feelings by word or look  it was longcontinued silence and want of interest in anything that told of the sorrow that crushed him  it is probable that the fact of adolay being capable of forsaking her parents in such a way tended to increase the grief occasioned by her loss  but he spoke of his feelings to no one not even to his wife  mozwa who was very fond of his friend and pitied him sincerely made no attempt to comfort him for he knew the nature of the man too well to think that by any words he could assuage his sorrow  all the fine things that nazinred had brought home and with which he had hoped to rejoice the hearts of his wife and child were utterly neglected  he let isquay do what she pleased with them  the only thing that seemed to comfort him was the tobacco for that he found when smoked to excess blunted the edge of his feelings  he therefore gave himself up to the unlimited use of this sedative and would no doubt have become like many others a willing slave to the pipe but for the fortunate circumstance that the supply of tobacco was limited  as the autumn advanced the diminishing quantity warned him to restrain himself  he eked it out by mixing with it a kind of leaf much used by indians for this purpose but which by itself was not considered worth smoking  even with this aid however he was compelled to curtail the indulgence then the weed failed altogether and he was finally induced to engage in philosophical meditations as to the folly of creating a needless desire which could not be gratified  the unsatisfied craving coupled with the injury to his health added considerably to the grief with which he was already oppressed  he had a powerful constitution however  the enforced abstinence soon began to tell in his favour and he actually had the courage not to say wisdom to refuse occasional pipes offered him by mozwa when he chanced to visit his friend  as that friend had not the loss of an only child to mourn but on the contrary was called upon to rejoice in the addition of a new baby the fine things that he had brought home were the cause of great satisfaction to his family  but alas  mozwa although almost perfect for a savage had one faultone besetting sin and moral diseasehe gambled  we almost hear the exclamation of surprise if not doubt with which our reader receives this information  yes north american indians are gamblers many of them are confirmed gamblers  they do not indeed affect anything so intellectual as chess or so skilful as billiards but they have a game to the full as intellectual and scientific as that rouge et noir of monaco with which highly cultivated people contrive to rob each other by mutual consent and without being ashamed  their game is not unknown to the juveniles of our own land  it goes by the name oddoreven  the manner of conducting the game varies a little here and there in its details but its principle is the same everywhere i want your possessions and get them i will by hook or crook  i couldnt think of robbing youo no there might be jail or penal servitude on the back of that and i wont accept your giftsgood gracious no that would involve the loss of selfrespect  no no  let us humbug each other  i will rob you if i can and you will rob me if you can and well mutually agree to throw dust in each others eyes and call it play nothing surely could be fairer than that  of course poor mozwa did not reason thus  he was not cultured enough for that  in fact he did not reason at all about the matter as far as we know but there can be no question that the poor fellow was smitten with the disease of covetousness and instead of seeking for a cure like a manly savage he adopted the too civilised plan of encouraging and excusing it  aware of his propensities mrs mozwa was much too knowing to allow the goods and trinkets destined for herself and family to remain in his power  she at once appropriated them and secreted such of them as she did not require for present use  but there were articles which she could not well treat in that way with any shadow of excuse for instance the gun powder and shot bows and arrows tobacco and pipes hatchets and scalpingknives blankets and masculine garments which were in daily use  these were frequently lost and rewon before winter had fairly begun but mozwa was too fond of the excitement of gambling to make desperate ventures all at once  he liked to spin it out  one night he had what is styled a run of bad luck  being in something of a reckless mood he went to visit a young friend who was as fond of gambling as himself and took most of his worldly possessions with him the friend with a number of companions was seated beside the wigwam fire and quite ready to begin  taking a button or some such object in his hand and putting both hands behind his back the friend began to bob his head and shoulders up and down in an idiotic fashion at the same time chanting in a singsong monotone ho yo yo ho hi ya yoho for a considerable length of time while mozwa staked his blanket a fine thick green one purchased at great bear lake  we forget the friends stake but it was probably supposed to be an equivalent  suddenly the yohoing ceased both hands tightly closed were brought to the front and the whole party gazed at mozwa with intense expectation  he was not long in making up his mind  he pointed to the left hand  it was opened and found to be empty  the blanket was lost back went the hands again and the yohoing was continued  the new gun was the next stake  it also was lost and thus the game was carried on far into the night with smaller stakes until mozwa had lost almost all that he had brought with himgun blanket pipes tobacco flint and steel firebag and even his coat so that he walked home a halfnaked and nearly ruined man  but ruin in the wilderness of north america is not usually so thorough as it often is in civilised lands owing partly to the happy circumstance that strong drink does not come into play and complete the moral destruction as well as the physical which gambling had begun the character therefore although deteriorated is not socially lost the nature of property also and the means of acquiring it render recovery more easy  when mozwa returned home minus his new blanket and the beautiful deerskin coat which his wife had made and richly ornamented for him with her own brown hands while he was away he found his old coat and his old blanket ready for him  the old gun too was available still so that he was not altogether disabled from attending to the duties of the chase and in a short time afterwards luck being in his favour he had won back some of his lost possessions  but he was too often in that fluctuating state of alternating excitement and depression which is the invariable accompaniment in a greater or less degree of the gamblers sin whether carried on in the depths of the arctic wilderness the wellnamed hells of london or the gilded salons of monaco  you are a fool said nazinred one day to his friendfor even among savages there are plainspoken familiar friends gifted with common sense enough to recognise folly and spiritual honesty to point it out and warn against it  why does my brother say so asked mozwa who was not in the least offended by the observation  because you gain nothing by all your gaining except trouble and excitement and sometimes you gain loss  here you are now obliged to take to your old gun whose flint will hardly strike fire more than four times out of ten you are obliged to wrap yourself in the old blanket full of holes and you come to me to borrow powder and ball  that is true replied mozwa with a look of selfcondemnation  but he added with a sort of brightly apologetic glance sometimes i win and then i am well off and it is magadar who is the fool  does it make you less of a fool because magadar is one also  are you comforted today in your poverty by the thought that you were well off yesterday  mozwas bright glance faded slowly  he was no match for his friend in argument and possessing an honest spirit the look of selfcondemnation began to creep again over his visage but being of a sanguine temperament and hopeful nature the bright glance returned suddenly  wisdom falls from the lips of my brother he said  i was well off yesterday and i am badly off today but i may be well off again tomorrowif i have good luck  yes and if magadar has bad luck returned his friend  you cannot both have good luck  whatever one gains the other must loseand so it goes on  should wise men act thus  mozwa was silent  his friend had never before spoken to him in this way  indeed no member of the tribe had ever before given utterance to such curious opinions  he knew not what to reply and nazinred relapsed into the moody silence which had characterised him more or less since he became aware of his daughters departure  the short autumn of those hyperborean regions having passed away the land was speedily locked in a garment of ice and snow and the long stern winter began  it was not long before all the lakes and rivers set fast  at first only the lakes solidified then the more sluggish streams while the rapids showed out inky black by contrast  gradually the liquid margins of these were encroached on by the irresistible frost until they were fairly bridged over and their existence was only recalled to memory by hollow rumblings below the ice  at last the intensity of the cold overcame the salt sea itself the floes hummocks and bergs became united into one universal mass and every sign of liquid disappeared from the polar regions  it was when this condition of things had arrived that the heartcrushed nazinred proceeded to carry out a plan over which he had been brooding ever since his return from great bear lake  his inquiries had led him to believe that the eskimo who had carried off his child belonged to the tribe which had recently been pursued by his compatriots and that they probably dwelt among the islands some of which were seen and others known to exist off the arctic coast opposite the mouth of the greygoose river  moreover a faint hope that he would have found it difficult to define was aroused by the fact that the kidnapper of his child had formerly been the rescuer of his wife  as we have seen his first attempt to go off in his canoe in search of adolay was frustrated by young ice forming on the sea and for a considerable time afterwards the arctic sea was impassable to any kind of craft  now that the sea had set fast however his difficulty was removed and he resolved to undertake the journey on foot  well he knew that no man of his tribe not even mozwa would agree to accompany him on such a wildgoose chase  he therefore not only refrained from making to any of them the proposal but avoided any allusion to his intentions  knowing also that isquay was gifted with such an intense desire for sympathy that she could not resist communicating whatever she knew to a few of her dearest friendsin the strictest confidencehe did not mention the matter to her until all his preparations were completed  then he told her  like a good submissive squaw she made no objection though the expression of her face showed that she felt much anxiety  who goes with you she asked  no one  is it wise to go alone she ventured to suggest  it may not be wise but no one would go with me i know and i am determined to find adolay  how will you travel  with a sledge and four dogs  that will enable me to carry food enough for a long journey  i will take my gun of course  but what will you do for fire objected isquay there are no woods on the ice  i will do without it  the poor woman was so amazed at this reply that she gave up further questioning  you have plenty strong moccasins ready have you not asked nazinred and pemmican and dried meat  yes plenty  and your snowshoes are mended and very strong  that is well  i will take them but i do not expect to use them much for the snow on the great salt lake is not soft like the snow in the woods  it was afternoon when this conversation was held and very dark for the sun had by that time ceased to rise much above the horizon even at noon  late in the night however there was brilliant light both from the stars and the aurora  taking advantage of this nazinred left his lodge and hastened to the outskirts of the village where a little boy awaited him with the sledge and team of dogs all ready for a start  without saying a word the indian put on his snowshoes and took hold of the tailline of the sledge which was heavily laden and well packed with a slight crack of the whip he set the team in motion  tell the old chief he said to the boy at parting that i go to seek for my daughter among the people of the frozen lake  when i find her i will return    chapter seventeen  nazinreds journey over the arctic sea  while our indian travelled through the woods he and his dogs were on familiar ground  he encamped at night in the way to which he had been accustomed all his life  that is to say he selected a spot under a spreading firtree dug away the snow until he got to the ground which he covered with a carpet of pine branches  at one end of this encampmentor hole in the snow of ten feet or so in diameterhe made a huge fire of dead logs  at the other end he spread his blanket unpacked his sledge fed his dogs with some willowgrouse provided for the purpose warmed up his pemmican and dried meat melted some snow for drink and spent the night in comparative comfort  and it is wonderful reader how cosy such an encampment in the snow is when food is plentiful and health strong  but when our indian quitted the shore and began his daring journey on the arctic sea he was surrounded by new and unfamiliar conditions  no trees were to be had for firewood no branches for bedding no overhanging pines for shelter  he had gone there however prepared for the change  the sea near the shore had been set fast when in a comparatively smooth condition so that the first days march over it was easy  as he had expected the surface of the snow had been drifted quite hard so that he could dispense with snowshoes altogether and the four dogs found the sledge so light that they felt disposed now and then to run away with it but nazinred checked this propensity by holding on to the tailline thus acting as a drag  ere long the shore was left out of sight behind and the first of the isletsa small groupalso passed and left behind  when night was well advanced the indian found himself on the ice of the open sea with nothing but hummocks and bergs to shelter him  being acquainted by hearsay at least with some of the methods of the eskimos he avoided the bergs for there was the danger of masses falling from their sides and from overhanging icecliffs and selected a small hummocka heap of masses that had been thrown or crushed up earlier in the winter covered with snow and formed into a solid mound the light air that blew over the frozen plain was scarcely worth taking into account nevertheless the indian chose the lee side of the hummock and then began to try his prentice hand at the erection of a snowhut  nazinred had indeed some doubts as to the value of such a cold habitation without fire but he knew that eskimos sometimes used such and what they could do he could dare  besides love is strong as deathand he meant to find adolay or die  his hut as might have been expected was not such as an eskimo architect would have praised but it was passable for a first attempt he knew that the northern masons built their winter dwellings in the form of a dome therefore he essayed the same form but it fell in more than once before the keystone of the arch was fixed  never mind thought nazinred they have done iti can do it  nothing is impossible to men of this stamp  he persevered and succeeded after a couple of hours in producing a sort of misshapen beehive about six feet in diameter and four feet high  the slabs of snow of which it was composed were compact and solid though easily cut with his scalpingknife and formed bricks that could resist the influence of the fiercest gale  at one side of the hut he cut a hole for a doorway and reserved the piece cut out for a door  it was just big enough to let his broad shoulders pass through and when he got inside and lay down at length to test it he gave a slight humph of satisfaction  not that the chamber was cheerfulfar from it for it was intensely darkbut our indian was a practical man  he did not require light to enable him to sleep or rest  while engaged in constructing the hut he observed that the four dogs were sitting on their tails doing nothing except gazing in curiosity if not surprise at his unwonted proceedings  being a busy man he naturally disliked idlers and therefore unlashed some food from his sledge and served out their supper by way of giving them something to do  they ceased idling at once but after supper sat down on their tails again to watch as before though in a more languid frame of mind  when the hut was finished he sat down outside the night being clear and comparatively warm or rather we should say not bitterly cold  during the meal he kept up the interest of the dogs to a keenly hopeful point by occasionally tossing a morsel to each  when the meal was over and they knew from long experience that nothing more was to be hoped for they curled themselves up in the lee of the hut and with a glorious disregard of bedding and all earthly things went to sleep  it was found rather difficult to get the sledge into the hut as nazinred had forgotten to make allowance for its size but by enlarging the door and manoeuvring the difficulty was overcomea matter of considerable importance for there was no knowing what arctic monsters might take a fancy to play havoc with its contents while its owner slept  then the indian spread a large deerskin with the hair on over the floor of his hut and was about to spread his blankets above that when he remembered that he would want water to drink in the morningfor it is wellknown that eating snow during the intense cold of arctic winters is very hurtful  he had provided for this by taking a bladder with him which he meant to fill with snow each night and take it to bed with him so that his animal heatand he had plenty of thatmight melt some of it before morning  he was then on the point of closing up the doorway when it occurred to him that if the dogs were inside they might make the place warmer but upon reflection he feared that they might also make it suffocatingfor the dogs were large and the hut was small  after pondering the subject for a few minutes he decided to take only one of them inside  attim come he said quietly as if speaking to a human friend  attim without any remark save a wag of his tail arose promptly entered the hut and lay down  you see he was accustomed to little attentions of the sort  at last everything being completed nazinred closed the door plastered it well with snow round the seams so as to render the place airtight wrapped himself in his blankets took the bladder of snow to his bosom laid his wearied head on one of his bundles and prepared to slumber  but ere he reached the land of forgetfulness an idea struck him which indian though he was caused him to smile even in the dark  attim he murmured  here you are replied attims tail with a flop that was quite as expressive as the tongueand softer  you take charge of that said the sly man transferring the bladder of snow from his own bosom to that of the dog you have more heat than i have  whether the indian was right in this belief we cannot say but the humbleminded dog received the charge as a special favour and with an emphatic i will from its eversensitive tail again lay down to repose  thereafter the two went to sleep and spent six or seven hours of unbroken rest awaking simultaneously and suddenly to find that the dogs outside were also awake and wishing to get in  indeed one of them had already scraped a hole in the wall that would soon have admitted him had not his master given him a tap on the nose with the butt of his gun  of course it was still dark for the morning was not far advanced but the starlight and the aurora were quite sufficient to enable them to see their way as they set out once more on their lonesome journey  breakfast was a meal of which nazinred made no account  supper was his chief standby on the strength of which he and his dogs slept and also travelled during the following day  soon after they had awakened therefore they were far from the hut in which the night had been spent  the indians plan was to travel in a straight line in the direction in which the eskimos had been last seen  by so doing he counted upon either crossing their tracks which he would follow up or coming to some large island which might prove to be their winter quarters would skirt the shores of it in the hope of meeting with some of the tribes of which he was in search  the expedition it will be seen was somewhat of the nature of a forlorn hope for drifting snow quickly obliterates tracks and if the natives when found should turn out to be hostile they would probably take from him his little possessions if not also his life  but nazinreds love for adolay was too strong to admit of his allowing such thoughts to weigh with him  ere long he found himself far from his woodland home lost among the rugged solitudes of ice with a fast diminishing supply of provisions and worst of all no sign of track or other clue to guide him  one day as he was plodding slowly northward guided by the stars his faith in the success of his mission began to flag  hard continuous toil and a weakening frame had no doubt something to do with his depression his dogs also were in much the same condition with himselfgrowing thin and becoming less lively  clambering to the top of a hummock he surveyed the prospect before him  it was not cheering  the faint daylight of noon was spreading over the frozen sea bringing the tops of the larger bergs out into bold relief against the steelblue sky and covering the jumble of lumps and hummocks with a cold grey light  despite his resolute purpose the poor man sat down on a lump of ice buried his face in his hands and meditated  can it be he thought that the great manitou knows my grief and does not care  surely that cannot be  i love my child though she has fled from me  i am a child of the manitou  does he not love me  i will trust him  a cold object touched his hand at the moment  it was the nose of the faithful attim  nazinred regarded the touch as a good omen  he rose up and was about to resume the journey in a more hopeful frame of mind when a dark cloud on the horizon arrested his eye  after a long gaze he came to the conclusion that it was land  two hours later he arrived at waruskeek and with a beating heart made straight for the huts which could be plainly seen on the shore  but terrible disappointment was in store for him  on reaching the eskimo village he found that it was deserted  nevertheless the improved state of mind did not quite forsake him  it was a comfort to have made a discovery of any kind and was it not possible that during the brief daylight of the morrow he might be able to distinguish the tracks made by the party when they left the place and follow them up  with this idea in his mind he resolved to encamp on the spot and indulge himself as well as his dogs with a good feed and sleep  with this purpose in view he collected all the bits of wood he could find and with a few lumps of muchdecayed blubber made a rousing fire in one of the huts  the flame cheered his canine friends as well as himself and filled the place with a ruddy glow  as the hut was sufficiently large he invited all the dogs to sup with himan invitation which it is needless to say they gladly acceptedand we may add that the humbleminded attim was not jealous  the hut of which nazinred thus took possession was that which belonged to old mangivik  with his usually observant nature our indian looked keenly about him while cooking his pemmican noting every particular with an intelligent eye  suddenly his gaze became fixed on a particular corner  rising slowly as if afraid of frightening away some living creature he advanced step by step toward the corner with eyeballs starting nearly out of his head  then with a light bound he sprang forward grasped a little piece of cord and pulled out from beneath a heap of rubbish what appeared to be an old castoff moccasin  and such indeed it was  it had belonged to adolay  nazinred hastening to the fire examined it with minute care and a deep hoh of satisfaction escaped from him for he knew it well as being one of a pair made by isquay for her daughters little feet  need we say that joy filled the indians heart that night and a feeling of gratitude to that mysterious everpresent yet never visible being whohe had come to recognise in his philosophical waymust be the author of all good though his philosophy failed to tell him who was the author of evil  nazinred was not by any means the first savage philosopher who has puzzled himself with that question but it is due to him to addfor it proves him more scientific than many trained philosophers of the present daythat he did not plead his ignorance about his creator as an excuse for ingratitude much less as a reason for denying his existence altogether  but there was a surprise in store for our indian chief which went far to increase his grateful feelings as well as to determine his future course  on looking about the deserted village the following day for further evidences of his child having been there he came upon a post with a piece of birchbark fastened to it  the post was fixed in the ice close to the shore where in summertime the land and sea were wont to meet and from which point tracks in the snow gave clear indication that the eskimos had taken their departure  this post with its piece of bark was neither more nor less than a letter such as unlettered men in all ages have used for holding intercourse with absent friends  knowing her fathers love for her and suspecting that sooner or later he would organise a search partythough it never occurred to her that he would be so wild as to undertake the search aloneadolay had erected the post when the tribe set out for winter quarters and had fixed the bark letter to it for his guidance  the writing on the letter we need hardly say was figurative brief and easily read  it did not give the intelligent father much trouble in the decipherment  at the top was the picture of a hand fairly if not elegantly drawn with one finger pointing  below it were several figures the last of which was a girl in unmistakable indian costume the figure in front of her was meant to represent cheenbuk in advance of him was an eskimo woman with her tail flowing gracefully behind while before her was a hazy group of men women and children which represented the tribe on the march  adolay had obviously the artistic gift in embryo for there was a decided effort to indicate form and motion as well as to suggest an idea of perspective for the woman and the tribal group were drawn much smaller than the foreground figures and were placed on higher planes  the sketchiness of the group too also told of just ideas as to relative degrees of interest in the legend while the undue prominence of the leading facial feature was an attempt to give that advice which is so forcibly expressed in the wellknown phrase follow your nose  ten dots underneath with a group of snowhuts at the end of them were not so clear at first but in the end nazinred made out a sentence of which the following may be given as a freeandeasy translation  my hand points the direction in which we have gone  your loving daughter is following the man who ran away with her  the eskimo women and men and dogs and all the rest of them are marching before us follow me for ten days and you will come to the snowhuts where we are to winter  could anything be plainer  the happy father thought not  he took an extra meal  his team gave themselves an extra feed of bits of old blubber picked up in the camp and while daylight was still engaged in its brave though hopeless struggle with the arctic night he tied up his sledge thrust the old moccasin into his bosom gave attim the order to advance and set off with revived strength and hope on his now hopeful journey    chapter eighteen  a surprise and a catastrophe  the trail of the eskimos as they traversed the frozen sea although not always very distinct on the hard snow was as plain as a highway to one so skilled in tracking as the indian chief nazinred  the weather having been clear and calm ever since he left home the marks had not been obliterated and he pursued his way without halt or hesitation  but on the fourth day out there came symptoms of a change  the chief had adopted the plan of travelling during every hour of the short day or twilight in order to make more sure of not missing the trail and the stars with frequent aurora borealis had made each night so brilliant that he advanced almost as easily as during the daytime  the fourth day however on awaking his ears were greeted with sounds that caused him to rise in haste and force out the door of his sleeping hut when to his dismay he found that a furious gale was blowing that the sky was black and that he could hardly see the poor dogs whom he found crouching as close as possible on the sheltered side of the hut  in these circumstances to advance without losing his way was impossible so that he was compelled to make the most of his time by sleeping as much as he could  to do him justice he possessed a wonderful capacity in that way  having put the sledge outside in order to make room he called all the dogs in resolving that the poor things should not be exposed to the pitiless storm  then having fed himself and them he lay down with them and was soon in happy oblivion  of course he had no artificial means of measuring time and the sky being overclouded darkness visible pervaded the region  but a healthy stomach helped in some degree to furnish a natural chronometer and its condition when he awoke suggested that he must have slept till near daylight of the following day  rousing the dogs he gave them a feed ate heartily himself and then went out to look at the weather  the sight which the grey dawn rendered barely visible was one which caused him to return to the hut with extreme promptitude for his gun for about fifty yards off were two white polar bears of apparently colossal size frolicking about in a curious manner and evidently amusing themselves with something  the something turned out to be the chiefs sledge which the bears had unpacked eating whatever they had a fancy for scattering about what they did not want smashing the sledge itself to pieces and twisting the leathern wraps and cordage into unimaginable knots  nazinred did not discover all this at once being too much excited by the unexpected visit to note trifling details  besides prompt action was necessary for the four dogs on becoming aware of what was transacting outside made a united and clamorous dash at the foe  two of them being too valorous ran close up to the bears who seemed to regard them with haughty surprise  another movement and the two dogs rose into the air with a yell in unison and fell back upon the snow where they lay motionless  the other two learning wisdom from experience kept back and barked furiously  nazinred although taken by surprise was used to sudden alarms and not easily frightened  knowing that the two dogs were very courageous and therefore all the more likely to run into danger he sprang forward towards the nearer of the two bears  it rose on its hindlegs to receive him and in this position appeared to stand at least eight feet high  without a moments hesitation the indian pointed his gun when the muzzle was not more than a foot from the creatures breast and fired the bear fell dead on the instant shot through the heart  the loud report and flash frightened the other bear away  it was closely followed however by the dogs and the chief availed himself of the opportunity to reload  while he was thus engaged a peculiarly loud yell told only too plainly that one of the remaining dogs was injured if not killed  he called to the remaining one to come back  obedient to the call it returned and to its masters great relief proved to be his favourite attim a good deal cut about the shoulders and much crestfallen but not seriously injured  down attim said his master  the poor creature obeyed at once and his master hurried forward but the bear had retired  the result of this encounter was that three of the dogs were killed many of his things destroyed and his provisions rendered almost useless while the sledge was irreparably broken to pieces  there was daylight enough to render the extent of his misfortune visible and to show him that the trail which he had been following so long was drifted over and entirely obliterated  to a man of weak resolution this might have been overwhelming but nazinred was very much the reverse of weak and his utter recklessness of life in his endeavour to recover his lost child would have rendered him a hero for the time being even if he had not been one by nature  after collecting the remains of his property and ascertaining that the sledge was hopelessly destroyed he made up his mind to carry the provisions on his back and push forward in the direction pointed out by adolay until he found her  if he did not succeed the failure of his food would soon end the struggle  it was some consolation to the unfortunate man that his favourite dog had been spared  the amount of company afforded even by an ordinary dog is wellknown but the civilised world can but feebly understand the value of a more than usually affectionate creature in the forlorn circumstances in which our indian was now placed  like many other people he had got into the habit of talking to the dog about himself and his affairs as if it were human  whether he held the opinion we have heard so often expressed that he understands every word i say we cannot tell but the gravity of his expression and the solemnity of his tone when conversing with it encouraged that belief and the very earnest attention of the dog almost justified it  but the friendly feelings existing between them did not relax the chiefs notions of discipline  attim was not permitted to follow his master as an idle companion  he was made to carry or rather to drag his own food by means of a collar with two pieces of stick attached the ends of which trailed on the ice thus forming as it were a pair of trains without wheels  this is a simple contrivance largely used by the prairie indians with their horses as well as dogs  the two sticks or poles being long project a good way behind the animal thus leaving space for a load  as the poles are suited to their size each horse or little dog is loaded with an appropriate bundle and it is to be presumed does not feel overburdened  when all was arranged nazinred started off with a large pack on his broad shoulders and attim with a small bundle followed close at his heels  of course the indian shouldered his gun and he slung upon it his snowshoes for the harddriven snow rendered these unnecessary at the time  he also carried with him a bow and quiver of arrows with the ornamented firebagmade for him by adolaywhich contained his flint steel and tinder as well as his beloved pipe and tobacco  things went well with him for the first few days and although the trail was now lost he guided himself easily by the stars of which he had been careful to take note and make comparison with the hand in the letter before disturbing its position  but one night the sky became overcast and he would have been compelled to halt had he not previously laid his course by several huge icebergs which towered up in the far distance  when he had passed the last of these bergs however he began to hesitate in his movements and attim trotting quietly by his side looked inquiringly up into his face once or twice with the obvious question whats the matter in his soft brown eyesor some dogrib idiom equivalent thereto  im afraid to go on murmured the indian gravely  to this attim replied with a reassuring wag of his tail  without stars it wont be easy to keep the straight line continued the chief stopping altogether and looking up at the clouds  attim also looked up but evidently could make nothing of it for he turned his eyes again on his master and wagged his tail dubiously  at the moment a rift in the clouds revealed some of the stars and the indian regaining his direction again hurried forwardall the more rapidly that a pretty stiff fair wind was blowing to speak nautically right astern of him  by degrees the breeze increased to a gale and then to a regular hurricane which whirled among the bergs and hummocks shrieked round the icepinnacles and went howling over the plain of the solid sea as if all the hyperborean fiends had been let loose and told to do their worst  its violence was so great that the indian was forced to scud before it and more than once attims little bundle caught the blast and whirled him round like a weathercock while the drifting snow at last became so thick that it was impossible to see anything more than a few yards ahead  in these circumstances to advance was madness  it wont do pup cried nazinred turning suddenly to his right round a mass of ice and taking shelter in the lee of a towering berg come we will encamp here  he had scarcely uttered the words when a tremendous rending sound was heard above the noise of the hurricane  the indian looked up quickly but nothing was to be seen anywhere save that wild confusion of whirling snow which in more southerly lands is sometimes called a blizzard and the backwhirl of which nearly suffocated man and dog  suddenly there came a crash as if a mountain were being shattered near them  then nazinred saw to his horror that an icepinnacle as big as a church steeple was bowing forward like some mighty giant to its fall  to escape he saw was impossible  it was too near and too directly above his head for that  his only hope lay in crushing close to the side of the berg  he did so on the instant promptly followed by the dog and happily found that the icewall at the spot was slightly concave  another moment and the stupendous mass fell with an indescribable crash which was prolonged into sounds that bore quaint resemblance to the smashing up of gigantic crockery as the shivered atoms shot far away over the frozen plain  but the chief heard nothing of this save the first great crash for the avalanche although it passed harmlessly over his head had buried him in what seemed to him a living tomb  the chamber in which he and his dog were thus enclosed was of course absolutely darka darkness that might be felt and the man would have been more than human if he had not experienced a sinking of the heart as he contemplated his awful position  once again arose in his mind the question does the maker of all care nothing about such things  the feeling deepened in him that such could not be truethat the allfather must certainly care more for his children than ordinary fathers for theirs and with that thought came also the old feeling i will trust him  the poor dog too had the consolation of trust for it rubbed its head against its master with a touch that implied implicit belief in his power to deal effectively with any difficulty whatever  feeling his way carefully round the walls of his prison the indian ascertained that it was not much more than about twelve feet long by three or four broad  on one side was the comparatively smooth wall of the berg but for the hollow in which he would have been crushed in front was the rugged heap of confused masses which had thoroughly closed him in  there was no outlet anywhere he felt assured of that after three careful examinations of the chamber and how many thousand tons of ice lay between him and liberty of course he could not guess  there was only one course open to him now and that was to cut his way out with his hatchet  before beginning to act he unstrapped his bundle and sat down to eat having previously relieved attim of his load and given him some food  everything he did had to be done by feeling for he could not see his hand even when held only an inch from his face  then he set to work  it was difficult at first for he had to strike out at random sometimes hitting a lump of ice unexpectedly sometimes just tipping it and occasionally missing it altogether when the axe would swing round behind him to the great danger of attim who insisted on keeping close to his masters heels wherever he went  by degrees however he learned to guess more correctly the position of the walls especially after he had advanced a few feet and cut a tunnel with the shape and dimensions of which he soon became familiar  for hours he laboured with unflagging diligence clearing back the ice debris into the cavern from which he had started  but no sign of open air rewarded him  at last when almost exhausted he made preparations for passing the night where he was  before lying down he ate a hearty meal and fed the dog who indicated his satisfaction by an occasional whine and the usual wag of the tail which could be faintly heard though not seen  a pipe of course followed and during the process of lighting it he and attim obtained a fleeting glimpse of their abode  as his materials could not produce a flameonly a dull red glowthe glimpse was not cheering or of much value  then nazinred spread a deerskin on the ice rolled himself in his blanket pillowed his head on the dog who seemed to be perfectly satisfied with the arrangement and went to sleep tillwe cannot say morning for pitch darkness still prevailed but till that point of time when the stomachic chronometer awoke them  after another feed the chief again set to work with indomitable perseverance and extended the tunnel during many hours yet when he had accomplished what appeared to him a long and severe days work it seemed as if he were as far off as ever from deliverance  just as he was giving way to weary disappointment however a rush of cold air came against his face and with an irrepressible exclamation of satisfaction he found that his last blow with the axe had opened a way to the outer world  a few more strokes delivered with unwonted vigour set him free to find that the gale was over that a profound calm prevailed and that the faint grey light of the arctic noon was illuminating the ghostly scene  he also discovered that during his imprisonment a heavy fall of snow had taken place so that he sank a full foot into itif not moreat every step  congratulating himself on having brought his snowshoes with him he at once put on those useful implements and having secured the pack on his back he once more set forth on his journey beating a track as he went on which the dog followed him with ease though without such a track the poor thing could not have travelled at all until the surface of the snow had hardened  but although our indians heart was lighter after his deliverance the toil which he had undergone and the cold which he had experienced in the berg had told somewhat severely even on his hardy frame and when he built his hut that night it was with a feeling of despondency for he became aware of a considerable diminution of strength  an unusually keen frost on the following day increased this feeling and when he was about to encamp at night nazinred said to himself as well as to his dog that he feared they would never complete their journey  but hope springs eternal in the human breast  on looking round for a sheltered spot on which to build the snowhut he observed three objects in the distance which bore a strong resemblance to eskimo dwellings pushing forward eagerly he soon reached them and found that they were indeed huts of these children of the ice but that they were deserted the disappointment was very great yet our chief bore up against it manfully  he made use of one of the huts as a restingplace for the night  next morning he found that the prolonged strain had rendered him much weaker than he had believed to be possible  diminishing provisions also had increased the evil and a still further fall in the temperature induced a feeling of feebleness which the hitherto vigorous man had never before experienced  the idea of giving in however had never once entered his mind  to persevere in the search until success or death should arrest him had been his fixed resolve from the beginning  come on pup he said patting the head of his faithful friend as he fastened on his snowshoes and set forth  to his surprise he found that he staggered a little at first but as he warmed to the work his vigour increased and his powers of endurance seemed almost as strong as ever    chapter nineteen  the eskimos again and a great discovery and rescue  while nazinred under the influence of strong affection was thus fighting with the unfamiliar difficulties and dangers of the polar sea cheenbuk and his eskimo friends were enjoying life in what may be called their native element  will adolay come for a drive said our gallant eskimo one day when the sun had risen near enough to the eastern horizon to almost but not quite extinguish the stars  we go to seek for walruses  the indian maiden was sitting at the time in the snow residence which belonged to mangivik  mrs mangivik was sitting opposite to her mending a sealskin boot and cowlik the easygoing was seated beside her engaged with some other portion of native attire  nootka was busy over the cookinglamp and old mangivik himself was twirling his thumbs awaiting the result of her labours  oolalik was there toohe was frequently therecourting nootka in the usual way by prolonged silent staring  the process might have been trying to some women but nootka did not mind  like many young damsels she was fond of admiration and could stand a good deal of it no matter how peculiar the mode in which it was expressed  i dont care to go said adolay with a sigh  cheenbuk did not repeat the invitation or press for a reason  he was a considerate as well as a gallant youth  he knew that the poor girl was pining for her parents and that she regretted having left themeven although remaining in her native village might have involved her being wed against her will to the hated magadar or subjected to his persecutions during her fathers absence  cheenbuk did his best to comfort her with the assurance that he would take her back to her home with the very first of the open water  but when adolay began to realise what a very long time must elapse before the ice would reopen its portals and set the waters free her heart sank and she began to mope  we may as well have some women with us remarked oolalik with a pointed glance at nootka but nootka took no notice of either the observation or the glance  even eskimo girls understand how to tease  will cowlik go asked cheenbuk  yes  cowlik smiled and was quite ready to go  no she wont said mrs mangivik with a positiveness almost european in its tone  very well  cowlik smiled and was equally ready to remain  mangivik himself expressed no opinion on the subject but twirled his thumbs faster as he expressed a hope that the cooking would be soon completed  it was finally arranged that only young men should go with sledges and teams of dogs to fetch the meat home  the little town in which this scene was being enacted was composed of between twenty and thirty whiteybrown beehives of snow of the usual shape ranged on the ice near the shore of a large island  the scene presented was a lively one for while some of the inhabitants were creeping into the small tunnels which formed as it were porches before the doors others were creeping out  men and dogs were moving about the former harnessing the latter to sledges in preparation for the approaching hunt while hairy little balls of children were scampering about in play or sitting on the tops of the snow beehives watching the proceedings with interest  the eskimo sledge is a contrivance of wood capable of accommodating five or six men and usually drawn by a team of from six to ten dogs each dog being fastened to it by means of a separate line of tough walrushide  in a short time the longlashed shorthandled powerful whips cracked the teams yelped the men shouted and away they all went with much noise over the frozen sea  after a short run the parties separated and went in different directions  cheenbuk and his men drove in a southerly direction  soon they came to a place which had been kept open by walruses as a breathinghole  here they got out hid the sledge and dogs behind a hummock and getting ready their spears and harpoons prepared for an encounter  after waiting some time a walrus thrust its ungainly head up through the young ice that covered the hole and began to disport itself in elephantine or rather walrusian gambols  tiring of this in a few minutes it dived and the natives ran to the edge of the hole to be ready when it should come up again  the animal was a female and a small one  when it reappeared harpoons and lances were at once driven into it and it was killed almost immediately  this is not always the result of such an encounter for this elephant of the polar seas is naturally a ferocious brute and when bulls are attacked they are prone to show fight rather than take fright  leaving the young men to skin and cut up the meat cheenbuk went on with only anteek to keep him company in search of another breathinghole  you must harpoon the next one all alone and kill him without help said cheenbuk to his companion soon after they had started  ill try returned the boy with the air of confidence befitting a knight who had already won his spurs yet with the modesty of a youth who was aware of his fallibility  but anteek was not destined to distinguish himself that day for about three miles beyond the place where the walrus had been slain they came across a track so singular that on beholding it they were stricken dumb with surprise  stopping the dogs they gazed at it for a few moments in speechless wonder  i am not an old man said cheenbuk at length in a solemn tone but i have seen most of the wonderful things in this world yet have i never seen a track like that  he pointed to the track in question and turned a look of blazing inquiry on anteek  and i am not an old boy returned the other but i too have seen a good many of the wonderful things of this world yet have i never even dreamed of the like of that  it will doubtless strike the reader here as an evidence that eskimos are under similar delusions to the rest of the human family that these two referred to that world of theirs as equivalent to the world at large  what can it be murmured cheenbuk  the very biggest bear that ever was come to frighten the wisest people that ever lived out of their wits suggested anteek  the face of the elder eskimo underwent a sudden change and an intelligent expression flitted over it as he said  i know nowi rememberi guess  you have often heard me talk of the firespouters anteek  well the snow where they live is very deep and softnot at all like the snow here except when our snow is newfallenso that they cannot travel in the cold time without great things on their feet  thatpointing downwardmust be the track of those great things and there must be a firespouter not far off  perhaps a number of firespoutersa warparty suggested anteek becoming excited  i think not for there is only one track  but they may have walked in a rowbehind each other  that is true  you notice well anteek  you will be a good hunter soon  he stooped as he spoke to examine more carefully the track which was indeed none other than that made by the snowshoes of nazinred on his weary and wellnigh hopeless journey over the frozen sea  look here cheenbuk cried the boy whose excitement was increasing is there not here also the track of a dog with a strange mark on each side of it as if it were drawing two lines as it went along  you are right again boy  there is here the track of a dog but there is only one man  come we will follow it up  jumping on the sledge again the eskimo cracked his whip and set the dogs off at full gallop  for some time they advanced looking eagerly forward as if expecting every minute to come in sight of the man and dog who had made the tracks but nothing appeared for some hours  then they arrived at the three huts where the indian had received such a disappointment on finding them deserted  a close examination showed that the stranger had spent a night in one of them and from various indications cheenbuk came to the conclusion that he had been much exhausted if not starving while there  getting on the sledge again he continued to follow up the trail with renewed diligence  they had not gone far when an object was seen lying on the ice not far ahead of them  anteek was first to catch sight of it and point it out to his companion who did not speak but let out his lash and urged the dogs on  as they approached the object was seen to move then there came towards them what sounded like a prolonged melancholy howl  the dog is alive whispered anteek  i hope the man isbut i fear returned his comrade  in a few moments more they were alongside and the dog started up with a snarl as if to defend its master who was lying motionless on the ice but the snarl was feeble and the poor beast was obviously in a state of exhaustion  he is not dead said cheenbuk putting his hand over the indians heart while anteek caught poor attim by the nose and held him gently back  it turned out as the eskimo had said  nazinred was not dead but he was very nearly so and it is probable that another hour of exposure and inaction would have ended the career of both himself and his dog  he had walked on persistently until that peculiar feeling of an irresistible desire to lie down and sleep overcame him  no one knew better than himself the danger of his condition yet the fatal lethargy is such that no resolution is sufficient to overcome it  lying or rather falling down he had remained still for a few momentsthen the state of quiet but deadly repose had supervened and he would never have risen again if succour had not been sent  as it was the eskimos set to work with tremendous energy to chafe and resuscitate him but it seemed at first that they were too late  by dint of untiring perseverance however they became successful  a slight effort to exert himself was observable in the indian and then getting him on his feet cheenbuk on one side and anteek on the other they forced him to stagger about until vitality began to revive  now boy well get him into the sledge and away back to the igloes  without delay they led nazinred to the sledge rolled him in a large white bearskin and tied him on  while thus engaged anteek observed that cheenbuk gazed for a few moments intently into the indians face and then became much and strangely excited  is he going to die asked the boy anxiously  no it is not thatbutbut i have seen this firespouter before  i know him  quick we must save his life  if the life of nazinred had depended on the speed of the eskimo dogs there would have been much hope of it for cheenbuk made them fly like the wind until he regained the three igloes  as for attim having with prompt sagacity perceived that the strangers were friendly he resigned himself to his fate  indeed his master had in a dazed sort of way adopted the same course and willingly submitted to whatever was done to him  arrived at the deserted huts the indian was allowed to lie in his white bearskin until the eskimo had kindled a lamp cooked some food warmed some water and prepared a comfortable couch  then he went out to unlash the sleeper  now anteek im going to send you away and will expect you to be quick and act like a man  drive the sledge back to where we killed the walrus  let the men pack the meat on it and away back to our igloes it is not far  you will soon get there if you make the dogs yelp  when you have arrived and told your story get a fresh team of dogs and two men and come back here with a little meat and some more bearskinsand do it all boy as fast as you can  i will answered anteek in a tone and with a look of decision that were quite satisfactory  it was difficult to rouse the indian at first so as to get him to stagger into the snowhut and he was more than half asleep all the time insomuch that when inside he fell down on the couch prepared for him and again sank into profound slumber  then anteek started up jumped on the sledge and set off for home at full speed    chapter twenty  strange converse and discoveries  returning to the hut cheenbuk continued his culinary preparations with great diligence gazing often and earnestly as he did so at the thin and careworn countenance of the sleeper  although nazinred was considerably altered by fatigue and suffering the eskimo entertained not the smallest doubt that he was the same indian with whom he had once struggled on the banks of the whale or greygoose river  equally sure was he that the indian owing to his wornout condition when discovered had not recognised himself and the fancy occurred to him that he would at first try to avoid recognition  to this end he pulled his hood a little more over his eyes deepened the colour of his face by rubbing it with a little lampblack and oil and resolved to lower his voice a note or two when the time for speaking should arrive  that time was not long of coming probably the increasing warmth of the hut or the smell of the sealsteak in the nostrils of the halfstarved man may have had something to do with it but the meal was hardly ready when the indian yawned stretched himself sat up and gazed solemnly around  you are feeling better said cheenbuk in his deepened tone and in broken dogrib tongue  the indian fixed a steady gaze on him for nearly a minute before replying  yes he said in a dreamy tone im better  if the eskimo had not been sent to me i had now been with my ancestors  no one sent me to you returned cheenbuk i found you lying on the snow  the great manitou sent you said the indian gravely  it was this touch of seriousness which had originally drawn those two men together but the eskimo remembered that he was acting a part at the moment and that any expression of sympathy might betray him  he therefore made no rejoinder but placing the sealsteak on a flat stone bade the hungry man eat  nazinred required no pressing he began at once and was ready for more almost before more was ready for him  by persevering industry however cheenbuk kept his guest supplied and when appetite began to fail he found time to attend to his own wants and keep the other company  silence reigned at first  when the indian had finished eating he accepted a draught of warm water and then had recourse to his firebag and pipe  cheenbuk expected this and smiled inwardly though his outward visage would have done credit to an owl  at last he looked up and asked the indian how he came to be travelling thus alone and so far from his native land  nazinred puffed a voluminous cloud from his lips and two streaming cloudlets from his nose ere he replied  when my son he said was on the banks of the greygoose river his voice was not so deep  cheenbuk burst into a laugh and threw back his hood  you know me then you manofthewoods said he holding out his hand in the white trader fashion which the other had taught him  when the menofthewoods see a face once they never forget it returned the indian grasping the proffered hand heartily but without a sign of risibility on his countenance for in this as we know he differed considerably from his companion yet there was a something about the corners of his eyes which seemed to indicate that he was not quite devoid of humour  but how did you discover me resumed cheenbuk  i not only spoke with a deeper voice but i put black and oil on my face and pulled my hood well forward  when the eskimo wants to blind the manofthewoods answered nazinred sententiously he must remember that he is a man not a child  the cry of the grey geese is always the same though some of them have deeper voices than others  a face does not change its shape because it is dirtied with oil and black  men draw hoods over their faces when going out of a lodge not when coming in  when smoking tobacco is seen for the first time surprise is always created waugh  what you say is true manofthewoods returned cheenbuk smiling i am not equal to you at deceiving  whether the indian took this for a compliment or otherwise there was no expression on his mahogany face to tell as he sat there calmly smoking and staring at the lamp  suddenly he removed the pipe from his lips and looked intently at the eskimo who in turn regarded him with evident expectation  my son said nazinred i have one or two questions to put to you you and i agree about many things  tell me what would you think of the fawn that would forsake its dam  cheenbuk was puzzled but replied that he thought there must be something the matter with itsomething wrong  i will tell you a story continued the indian and it is true  it did not come into my head  i did not dream it  there was a manofthewoods and he had a squaw and one child a girl  the parents were very fond of this girl  she was graceful like the swan  her eyes were large brown and beautiful like the eyes of a young deer  she was active and playful like the young rabbit  when she was at home the wigwam was full of light  when she was absent it was dark  the girl loved her father and mother and never disobeyed them or caused them to suffer for a moment  one day when the father was far away from home a number of bad eskimos came and fought with the menofthewoods who went out and drove their enemies away  they took one prisoner a strong finelooking man  one night the prisoner escaped  it was discovered that the girl helped him and then went away with him  he paused and frowned at this point and the startled cheenbuk at once recognised himself and adolay as the hero and heroine of the story  did the girl he asked go away with the escaped prisoner of her own will or did he force her to go  she went of her own will returned the indian  one of the women of the tribe followed her and heard her speak  but the father loved his child  he could not hate her although she forsook her home  at first he thought of taking all his young men and going on the warpath to follow the eskimos slay the whole tribe and bring back his child  but manitou had put it in the fathers mind to think that it is wrong to kill the innocent because of the guilty  he therefore made up his mind to set off alone to search for his child  again nazinred paused and cheenbuk felt very uncomfortable for although he knew that it was impossible for the indian to guess that the eskimo with whom he had once had a personal conflict was the same man as he who had been taken prisoner and had escaped with his daughter still he was not sure that the astute red man might not have put the two things together and so have come to suspect the truth  so then manofthewoods said cheenbuk at last you are the father who has lost his daughter  i am returned the indian and i know not to what tribe the young man belongs with whom she has gone away but i am glad that i have met with you because you perhaps may have heard if any strange girl has come to stay with any of the tribes around you and can tell me how and where to find her  we named her adolay because she reminds us of that bright season when the sun is hot and high  cheenbuk was silent for some time as well he might be for the sudden revelation that the indian who had once been his antagonist and for whom he had taken such a liking was the father of the very girl who had run away with him against her inclination quite took his breath away it was not easy to determine how or when the true facts should be broken to the father and yet it was evident that something must be said for cheenbuk could not make up his mind to lie or to act the part of a hypocrite  i have heard of the girlofthewoods you speak of he said at last i have seen her  for the first time since they met the characteristic reserve of the indian broke down and he became obviously excited yet even then he curbed his tongue for a few moments and when he again spoke it was with his habitual calmness  does my son know the tribe to which she has been taken  and is it well with the girl  he does  and it is well with adolay  do they dwell far from here asked nazinred anxiously in spite of himself  not far  i can soon take you to their igloes  but tell me manofthewoods do you think your child had no reason for leaving home in this way except fondness for the young man  i know not returned the indian with a doubtful almost a hopeful look  what other reason could she have  her mother and i loved her more than ourselves  all the young men loved her  one of thema bad onehad sworn to his comrades that he would have her for a wife in spite of her fatherhe smiled very slightly at this point with a look of ineffable contemptbut magadar did not venture to say that in her fathers ears  may it not have been fear of this man this magadar which drove her away suggested cheenbuk  you were not there to defend her  she may have been afraid of him although you fear him not  that is true returned the indian with a brighter look though i thought that adolay feared nothingbut she is not her father  this wise and obvious truism or the words of the eskimo seemed to afford some comfort to the poor man for he became more communicative and confidential after that  do you think asked cheenbuk that your daughter has married this young man  i know not  dont you think it is likely  i fear it is not unlikely  why should you fear it  are not the eskimos as strong and brave as the menofthewoods  for a moment the indian looked at his companion with high disdain for the boastful question had aroused within him the boastful spirit but the look quickly disappeared and was replaced by the habitual air of calm gravity  it may be as you say that your nation is as brave and strong as ours  i did not say that remarked the freeandeasy eskimo interrupting his companion in a way that would have been deemed very bad manners in an indian i asked you the question  with a look of deeper gravity than usual the indian replied  to your question no true answer can be given till all the men of both nations have tried their courage and their strength  but such matters should only be discussed by foolish boys not by men  yet i cannot help confessing that it is a very common thing among our young braves to boast  is it so among the eskimos  the eskimo laughed outright at this  yes said he our young men sometimes do thatsome of them but not all  we have a few young men among us who know how to hold their tongues and when to speak  that is useful knowledge  will my son speak now and tell me what he knows about adolay  he knows that she is well spoken of and much loved by the tribe with which she lives  that is natural said the indian with a pleased look  no one who sees adolay can help loving her  does the young man who took her away treat her kindly  no one can tell that but herself  what if he treated her ill  i would hope never to meet with him face to face replied nazinred with a frown and a nervous clenching of the fist that spoke volumes  i have heard continued cheenbuk in a quiet way that the girl is very sad  she thinks much of her old home and blames herself for having left it  good said the indian emphatically  that is like the child to be sorry when she has done wrong  and i have heard that the young man who took her away is very fond of herso fond that he will do whatever she likes to please her  his name is cheenbuk  she asked him to take her home again and he has promised to do so when the hot sun and the open water come back  good  the young man must be a good man  will he keep his promise  yes  i know him well  he loves truth and he will do what he says  it is a long time till the open water comes  will the young eskimos mind not change  cheenbuks mind will not change  he loves adolay better than himself  nazinred pondered this statement for some time in silence caressing the sleek head of attim as he did so  will this young man this cheenbuk be willing do you think to leave her in the lodges of her people and give her up altogether he asked with a somewhat doubtful look  if adolay wishes to be given up he will replied the eskimo confidently  and you know him well  very well  no one knows him better  again the indian was silent for some time  then he spoke in a low tone  my son has made glad the heart of the manofthewoods  when we met by the river and strove together we were drawn by a cord that anger could not snap  it is strange that you should now be chosen by manitou to bring me such good news  manitou can do stranger things than this my father  no more was said at that time for as both were thoughtful men a considerable space of time was allowed to elapse between each question and answer  before it could be resumed the crack of a whip and loud yelping were heard in the distance and in a few minutes anteek and two men drove up to the igloe with the sledge and a fresh team of dogs  i sent for them explained cheenbuk  my father is tired he will lie down on the sledge with a bearskin round him while i take him to the igloes of my people  after that i will take him to adolay  nazinred will not lie down  he is no longer tired for his heart is glad    chapter twenty one  kickball and an important meeting  we beg the reader now to accompany us to the eskimo village where the men and boys are having a game at kickball a favourite game with those menoftheice which goes far to prove their kinship with ourselves  but the details of the game are dissimilar in many waysonly the spirit is the same namely an effort to rouse the bodily system to as near the burstingpoint as possible without an absolute explosion  it was a lovely northern night  there was a clearness in the still frosty air which gave to the starry host a vivid luminosity and seemed to reveal an infinite variety of deep distances instead of the usual aspect of bright spots on a black surface  besides the light they shed the aurora was shooting up into the zenith with a brilliancy that almost equalled that of moonlight and with a vigour that made the beholder think there was a rustling sound  indeed some of the natives stoutly asserted that these lights did rustlebut among eskimos as among ourselves there are highly imaginative people  oolalik was there of course  no game was thought complete without the cooperation of that robust eskimo  so was raventik for the game of kickball suited his bold reckless nature to perfection and there were none of the other players except himself capable of opposing oolalik with any hope of success  aglootook the magician also took part  the dignity of his office did not forbid his condescending to the frivolities of recreative amusement  gartok was also there but alas only as a spectator for his wound was not sufficiently healed to permit of his engaging in any active or violent work  his fellowsufferer ondikik sat beside him  he poor man was in a worse case for the bullet which was in him kept the wound open and drained away his strength  he was wrapped in a white bearskin being unable to withstand the cold  the whole male population except the old men and the wounded took part in the game for the ball frequently bounded to the outskirts of the icefield where the boys of every shape and size had as good a chance of a kick as the men  as the women stood about in all directions looking on and sending back the ball when it chanced to be kicked out of bounds it may be said to have been an exceedingly sociable game  old mangivik took great interest though no part in it and mrs m was not a whit behind him in enthusiastic applause whenever a good kick was given  of course the fair nootka was beside them forwas not oolalik one of the players  she would have scorned the insinuation that that was the reason  nevertheless there is reason to believe that that had something to do with her presence  our friend adolay however was not there  the absence of cheenbuk may have had something to do with her absence but as she was seated in mangiviks igloe moping over the lamp it is more charitable to suppose that a longing for homesweet homewas weighing down her spirits  old and young uleeta were looking on with great delight so was cowlik the easygoing and rinka the sympathetic and it was noticeable that every now and then the latter distracted her mind from the play in order to see that the bearskin did not slip off the shoulders of ondikik and to replace it if it did  not that rinka had any special regard for ondikik but it afforded her intense pleasure merely to relieve suffering in any wayso strong was the weakness for which she got credit  the game had lasted for a considerable time and the players were beginning to blow hard when the ball kicked by a surprisingly small boy in disproportionately big sealskin boots chanced to fall between raventik and oolalik  oh exclaimed nootka to herself with a gasp of hope  ho exclaimed oolalik with a shout of determination  raventik exclaimed nothing but both young men rushed at the ball with furious vigour  the active oolalik reached it first  ah sighed nootka with satisfaction  hoh cried oolalik with a kick so full of energy that it would have sent the ball far over a neighbouring iceberg if it had not been stopped dead by the broad face of raventik who went flat on his back in consequenceeither from the tremendous force of the concussion or because of a slip of the foot or both  this incident was received with shouts of laughter and great applause while raventik sprang to his feet  instead of taking it in good part however the reckless man allowed his temper to get the better of him and made a rush at oolalik who being naturally peaceful in temperament dodged his adversary and with a laugh ran away from him but the other was not to be baulked in this way  a fight he was bent on so he gave chase at the top of his speed  the man of peace however was too fleet for him  he kept just out of his reach thereby stimulating his rage and inducing many a spurt which proved abortive at last being desirous of putting an end to the chaseor himself losing patience who knowsoolalik suddenly dropped on his hands and knees and raventik plunging headlong over him fell flat on his breast and went scooting over the ice for about ten or fifteen yards before he could stop himself  what would have happened after that no one can tell for just then the attention of the whole party was diverted by a shout in the distance accompanied by the cracking of a whip and the usual sounds that announced an arrival  a few seconds later and cheenbuk drove his team into the village  he had warned anteek to say nothing about the finding of the indian and the boy had been faithful to his trust so that the whole population was thrown into a state of wideeyed amazement not to mention excitement when the tall form of the firespouter was seen to rise from the sledge and turn his grave countenance upon them with the calm dignity characteristic of his race  the dogs of the village showed not only surprise but also their teeth on observing attim among the newcomers and they made for him but a welldirected and sweeping cut from the whip of the watchful anteek scattered them right and left and rebuked their inhospitality  thereafter cheenbuk began to tell how he had discovered the indian on the ice and introduced the subject with some prolixity like not a few white men when they have a good story to tell  moreover the wily man had an eye to dramatic effect and observing that adolay was not among the women he made up his mind to what is called prolong the agony as far as possible  unfortunately for his purpose there happened to be blowing at the time a gentle norwest breeze which in its direct course towards them had to pass over the igloe that belonged to mangivik and the humbleminded attim keen of scent recognised something there that caused him suddenly to cock his ears and tail open his eyes and give vent to a sharp interrogative yelp  next moment he charged through the canine throngscattering them in abject terrordashed into the tunnel of mangiviks dwelling and disappeared from view  another moment and there issued from the igloe not a scream indian girls seldom or never screambut a female ebullition of some sort which was immediately followed by the sudden appearance of adolay with the dog waltzing around her wriggling his tail as if he wished to shake off that member and otherwise behaving himself like a quadrupedal lunatic  eager inquiry was intensified in every line of her expressive face and withal a halfscared look as if she expected to see a ghost  if she had really seen one the effect could scarcely have been more impressive when her eyes encountered those of her father  she stood for a few moments gazing and utterly unable to move then with a wild cry of joy she bounded towards him  in like manner the indian stood at first as if thunderstruck for cheenbuks information had not led him to expect this  then his wonted dignity utterly forsook him for the first time in his life perhaps he expressed his feelings of affection with a shout and meeting the girl halfway enfolded her in an embrace that lifted her completely off her legs  the eskimos as may well be imagined were not only surprised but profoundly interested in the scene and cheenbuk was constrained to draw his narrative to an abrupt conclusion by informing them hurriedly that the firespouter was the father of adolay that he had left home alone and on foot to search for her that he was also the very man with whom on the banks of the whale river he had fought and fraternised and that therefore it behoved them to receive him hospitably as his particular friend  cheenbuk spoke the concluding sentence with a look and tone that was meant to convey a warning to any one who should dare to feel or act otherwise but there was little need of the warning for with the exception of aglootook the medicineman the chief leaders of the fireeating portion of the tribe gartok and ondikik were at the time helpless  while this irrepressible display of dogrib affection was enacting attim was performing a special wardance or rather lovedance of his own round the reunited pair  he was an unusually wise dog and seemed to know that he could expect no attention just then he therefore contented himself with a variety of hindlegged pirouettes and a little halfsuppressed yelping knowing that his turn would surely come in time  meanwhile an incident occurred which seemed further to enhance the dramatic character of the meeting  there burst suddenly and without warning upon the amazed and horrified multitude a miniature thunderclap which being absolutely new to their experience shook them to their spinal marrow  several boys of unusually inquisitive disposition taking advantage of the preoccupation of the tribe ventured to poke about the sledge which had just arrived and discovered the firespouter of the indian  with awestricken countenances they proceeded to examine it  of course when they came to the trigger it went off  so did the boysexcepting the one who had touched the trigger  he having the butt against his chest at the moment received a lesson which he never forgot and was laid flat on his backas much with fright as violence  fortunately there was nothing in front of the gun at the time save the tip of a dogs tail  into this one leaddrop entered  it was enough  the owner of the tail sprang into space howling  every one else including dogs and bairns with the exception of mrs mangivikwho being as it were petrified with consternation remained absolutely immovablefled for shelter behind the igloes leaving nazinred adolay cheenbuk and anteek in possession of the field  by degrees their fears were calmed and according to their courage the rest of the population returned to the scene of the explosion some half ashamed of having run away others more than half ready to run again  do they sometimes do like that by themselves asked cheenbuk referring to the gun  never said the indian  some one must have touched it  the boys remarked anteek i know them  adolay laughed  yes she said i know them too and they meddle with everything  come manofthewoods said cheenbuk and see my fathers igloe  he is hiding inside of it since the spouter made its noise  this is my sister nootka and that he added pointing to mrs mangivik who was gradually becoming untransfixed is my mother  have you told my father all cheenbuk asked adolay as they went towards the hut  the indian stopped abruptly and looked with a piercing glance at the eskimo  cheenbuk he exclaimed in a low voice  yes that is my name said the young man with a smile and yet with a something in his face which implied that he was not ashamed to own it  for a moment the indian frowned as if he were displeased at the same time drawing his daughter close to him  the prejudices of race were at work within him then and that very human weakness which shows itself in esteeming all nations inferior to ones own strove with his better feelings but as he looked on the handsome face and brave bearing of the young manoftheice and remembered his sentiments and sympathy he suddenly stepped up to him and held out his hand  the white trader has taught me he said that the difference in men is only skindeep  the same manitou made us all  cheenbuk my son i am grateful to you for your care of my child  my father said the eskimo returning his grasp your mind is in a good state  so is mine  you must be tired and hungry  let us go and feed    chapter twenty two  tells of hunting extraordinary  this advent of a male firespouter into the little community was a source of much interest and delight to old and youngall the more that he had brought the mysterious spouter with him  not less interesting to nazinred was the community in the midst of which he found himself for as we have more than once indicated our indian was intellectually far in advance of his fellows and the opportunity he now had of observing closely the life of the menoftheice in all its details could not be otherwise than full of interest to an inquiring and largeminded man  on the day or rather the night of his arrival he was allowed quietly to eat his supper in the igloe of mangivik and go to sleep in peace but next morning there was a crowding of relatives and friends into the hut which rendered the meal of breakfast not quite so pleasant as it might have been for the indian having been accustomed all his life to the comparatively open wigwam did not relish the stifling atmosphere of the densely crowded snowhut  however he belonged to a race of stoics and restraining his feelings ate his meal with moderate appetite and becoming gravity  there is reason to believe that he rather liked the earnest attention with which all his movements were closely and openly scrutinised at all events he proceeded with his meal as calmly as if he had been alone and in his own wigwam with none but the faithful isquay and amiable adolay to observe him  staring as we have already said is not considered rude among the eskimos they therefore sat openmouthed and eyed taking mental notes in silence till breakfast was over when nazinred according to custom opened his firebag took out his pipe and began to fill it  this created a sensation which was expressed by hard breathing and eloquent looks  they had been waiting for this  of course cheenbuk had often descanted to them on the subject of smoking besides showing them how the thing was done but now they were going to see the amazing thing done in the right way by the real simon purea live firespouter  my father said cheenbuk at this point the igloe is hot and there are many more who wish to see you do that thing  will you come outside  with a condescending smile the indian rose  it was somewhat destructive of his dignity that he was obliged to go down on hands and knees and creep out through the short snow tunnel but as there was no other mode of egress he had to submit and did it with the best grace possible making up for the brief humiliation by raising himself when outside with ineffable dignity and throwing his deerskin robe over one shoulder a la roman toga  he was greeted with something like a british cheer by the entire community of men women children and even dogs who were waiting outside for him  sitting down on a snowclad rock he went through the process of filling the pipe striking a light and beginning to smoke to the unutterable delight of the natives  this delight became not only utterable but obstreperous when cheenbuk gravely took out the pipe which adolay had given him and began to keep him company at the same time bestowing a looka wink not yet being known to himon anteek who forthwith went off into uncontrollable laughter and was promptly hustled out of the crowd  the interest aroused by the pipe however was as nothing compared with that bestowed on the firespouter  for there was a mystery noise and deadliness about the latter which tended to evoke feelings of awe rather than amusement  i dont like to trouble your father too much adolay whispered cheenbuk would you say to him that we wish very much to see him use the spouter  nazinred was an amiable man  he at once consented and went back to the hut for his gun which remembering the tendency of the boys to meddle he had kept close beside him all night  loading it inside he reappeared with it ready  taking up a lump of ice about the size of ones hand he set it up on a hummock and retired to a distance of about thirty yards  tell them all to keep back out of the way of that cheenbuk said nazinred  the excitement and nervous expectation of the eskimos had been worked up considerably by these preparations so that they not only retired to a safe distance but some of them even took refuge behind the igloes and all held their breath while their guest took aim  he had loaded with shot and when the explosion took place the piece of ice vanished having been blown to atoms  of course a yell of admiration greeted the result and all the dogs of the tribe fled on the wingsor pawsof terror while attim sat quietly looking on with somewhat of his masters dignity  but the curiosity of the eskimos was only whetted by this  they immediately began to clamour for explanations so that the indian found himself at last obliged to undertake a lecture on gunnery as far as he understood it  my father said cheenbuk whose respect for the indian was rapidly deepening some of my people want to know if you can kill bears with the spouter  yes it will kill bears  i killed a white one not long before you found me  and will it kill the walrus too  yes it will kill the walrus  it kills anything that has life  there was an expression of great astonishment at this  some even ventured to doubt it  then there was a noisy consultation for a few minutes after which cheenbuk was told to ask if their guest would go with them then and there to hunt for a walrus  oh yes the indian was quite ready to go whereupon the men scattered to harness the dogs and make preparation for an immediate hunt  go and get my sledge ready said cheenbuk to anteek  the boy was only too glad to obey for the mission implied that he should have a place on the sledge along with the firespouter  in a very short time several sledges were ready  nazinred seated himself on one  cheenbuk and the others jumped in the whips cracked and away they went amid the shouting of the drivers and the yells of children and women left behind  it did not take long to find one of those giants of the frozen seas some miles out on the ice they came to a place which the walruses had kept open as a breathinghole  at the time of their arrival it had not been disturbed for some hours for the water was covered by a coat of young ice which was quite able to bear the weight of the men singly though scarcely sufficiently strong for the sledges  just as they arrived a walrus took it into its very thick head to crash up through the young ice and have a gambol  the party retired behind a hummock and prepared for action  will the manofthewoods go first and try the spouter asked cheenbuk  no replied nazinred the manofthewoods prefers to watch how the menoftheice do their work  after that he will use the spouter which we call pasgissegan  the white traders call it gun  harpoons and lances were at once got ready  come anteek with me bring a harpoon and a coil with you  we will show the manofthewoods what we can do  he said this with a look of selfconfidence for cheenbuk being a noted hunter among his fellows was naturally rather proud of his powers  waiting until the walrus dived the eskimo and his companion ran towards the hole of open water and then suddenly lay down for they knew the habits of the brute and that he would soon reappear  this in fact happened before they had lain more than a few minutes  after another gambol the ungainly animal dived again  up got the two eskimos and ran at full speed to the very edge of the hole  on rising the third time the walrus found cheenbuk standing with the harpoon raised  one look of huge astonishment it gave at the man who instantly drove the harpoon deep into its side and then ran from the hole as fast as he could uncoiling the long line of hide until he was some distance off  then he struck a piece of bone sharppointed into the ice and put the loop at the end of the line over it  this checked the dive of the walrus which in furious rage came up and smashed another hole in the ice looking fiercely around as if in search of its persecutor  anteeks opportunity had now come  he ran towards the creature which so far from being afraid smashed up the ice in vain attempts to get upon it  another harpoon was deftly driven into it and the boy running back fixed his line as the man had done  these two now began to play the walrus easing off and tightening their lines as required  meanwhile the other eskimos ran forward and taking advantage of the creatures combative disposition fixed several more harpoons in it besides giving it many severe thrusts with their lances  but the hide of a walrus is nearly an inch thick and it was not easy to pierce it with an effective thrust  at last however they succeeded in killing it after a battle of over three hours  that is hard work observed nazinred to cheenbuk as they stood watching the cutting up and packing of their prize on the sledges and takes a long time  come now let my father show us what thethe passpassgispouter gun can do said cheenbuk pointing to his sledge which anteek had got ready  there are more walruses yonder  he pointed to another hole not far off where several were seen rolling about in the water  the indian stepped on the sledge the others followed and in a short time the whole party was concealed behind a hummock close to the hole  nazinred now loaded his gun with ball  you must first throw a harpoon for fear it should sink he said when ready to start  without a word cheenbuk grasped his harpoon and coil and ran forward for the walrus had dived at that moment  anteek followed and nazinred kept close to both  once they lay down to let the animal come up and dive again  the moment it did so they ran at full speed as before to the edge of the hole and waited  send it deep in muttered the indian  i will replied the eskimo  so will i thought the boy but he was too modest to say so  the thought had barely passed when the walrus came up with a puff and snort that might have been heard a mile off  cheenbuks weapon was successfully launched in a moment  so was that of anteek though he missed the animals side but hit in the neck  nazinred took quick but sure aim at one of its glaring eyes and before the smoke of the shot had cleared away the walrus fell over dead with a bullet in its brain    chapter twenty three  a bearhunt and a sad end  the indian chief was after this an object of almost veneration to the eskimo men of admiration to the women and of delight to the boys and girls who highly appreciated his kindly disposition as well as his skill with the spouter  he was taken out on all their hunting expeditions and fully initiated into all the mysteries of seals walrus deer and muskox killing  of course the wonderful gun was brought into frequent requisition but its owner was obliged to have regard to his powder and shot and had to explain that without these the spouter would refuse to spout and all its powers would vanish  when this was thoroughly understood his hosts ceased to persecute him with regard to displays of his skill  one day in the dead of the long winter cheenbuk proposed to nazinred to go on a hunt after bears  the latter declined on the ground that he had already arranged to go with mangivik to watch at a sealhole cheenbuk therefore resolved to take anteek with him instead  gartok was present when the expedition was projected and offered to accompany it  i fear you are not yet strong enough said cheenbuk whose objection however was delivered in pleasant tonesfor a change for the better had been gradually taking place in gartok since the date of his wound and his old opponent not only felt nothing of his ancient enmity towards him but experienced a growing sensation of pityfor the once fireeating eskimo did not seem to recover health after the injury he had received from the firespouters bullet  i am not yet stout enough to fight the bears he said with a halfsad look but i am stout enough to look on and perhaps the sight of it might stir up my blood and make me feel stronger  old mangivik who was sitting close by heaved a deep sigh at this point  doubtless the poor man was thinking of his own strength in other daysdays of vigour which had departed for everat least in this life yet the old mans hopes in regard to the life to come were pretty strong though not well defined  well you may come said cheenbuk as he rose and went out with anteek to harness the dogs  in less than half an hour they were careering over the ice in the direction of a bay in the land where fresh beartracks had been seen the day before  the bay was a deep one extending four or five miles up into the interior of the island  we have assumed that the land in question was an island because of its being in the neighbourhood of a large cluster of islands which varied very considerably in size but there is no certainty as to this for the region was then and still is very imperfectly known  indeed it is still a matter of dispute among geographers we believe whether continents or seas lie between that part of the coast of america and the north pole  as far as appearance went the land might have been the edge of a vast continent for the valley up which the eskimos were driving extended inwards and upwards until it was lost in a region where eternal glaciers mingled with the clouds or reared their grey ridges against the dark winter sky  it was a scene of cold wild magnificence and desolation which might have produced awe in the hearts of civilised men though of course it must have seemed commonplace and tame enough to natives who had never seen anything much softer or less imposing  the party had travelled about four miles up the valley and reached a steep part which was trying to the mettle of the dogs when a track was observed a short distance to their right  bear said gartok in a low voice pointing towards it  cheenbuk made no reply but at once ran the team under the shelter of a neighbouring cliff and pulled up  the dogs were only too glad to obey the order to halt and immediately lay down panting with their tongues out  fastening the sledge to a rock and leaving it in charge of a little boy who had been brought for the purpose the other three set off to examine the track and reconnoitre intending if they had reason to believe the bear was near to return for the dogs and attack it in force  the track was found to be quite fresh  it led upwards in the direction of a neighbouring ridge and towards this the party hastened  on reaching the summit they bent low and advanced after the manner of men who expected to see something on the other side  then they dropped on hands and knees and crawled cautiously craning their necks every now and then to see what lay beyond  now the little boy who had been left in charge of the sledge happened to be a presumptuous little boy  he was not a bad boy by any means he did not refuse to obey father or mother or anybody else that claimed a right to command and he was not sly or doubletongued but he was afflicted with that very evil quality presumption he thought that he knew how to manage things better than anybody else and if not actually ordered to let things remain as they were he was apt to go in for experimental changes on his own account  when therefore he was left in charge of the dogs with no particular direction to do or to refrain from doing anything he found himself in the condition of being dissatisfied with the position in which the team was fastened and at once resolved to change it only a few yards farther to the right near to a sheltering cliff  with this end in view he untied the cord that held the sledge and made the usual request in an authoritative voice that the team would move on  the team began to obey but on feeling themselves free and the sledge light they proceeded to the left instead of the right and despite the agonising remonstrances of the little boy began to trot then appreciating doubtless the eskimo version of home sweet home they suddenly went off downhill at full gallop  the presumptuous one puckering his face was about to vent his dismay in a lamentable yell when it suddenly occurred to him that he might thereby disturb the hunters and earn a severe flogging  he therefore restrained himself and sat down to indulge in silent sorrow  meanwhile the explorers topped the ridge and peeping over saw a large white bear not more than a hundred yards off sitting on its haunches engaged apparently in contemplation of the scenery  at this critical moment they heard a noise behind them and glancing back beheld their dogs careering homeward with the empty sledge swinging wildly in the rear  cheenbuk looked at gartok and then both looked at the bear  apparently the ridge prevented the distant sound from reaching it for it did not move  we must go at it alonewithout dogs said gartok grasping his spear while a flash of the old fire gleamed in his eyes  you must not try said cheenbuk the drive here has already tired you out  anteek will do it with me  this is not the first time that we have hunted together  the boy said nothing but regarded his friend with a look of gratified pride while he grasped his spear more firmly  good returned gartok in a resigned tone i will stand by to help if there is need  nothing more was said but cheenbuk looked at anteek and gave the brief order  go  the boy knew well what to do  grasping his spear he ran out alone towards the bear and flourished it aloft  turning with apparent surprise the animal showed no sign of fear at the challenge of such an insignificant foe  it faced him however and seemed to await his onset  the boy moved towards the right side of the bear  at the same time cheenbuk ran forward towards its left side while gartok went straight towards it at a slow walk by way of further distracting its attention  as the three hunters approached from different directions their prey seemed a good deal disconcerted and looked from one to the other as if undecided how to act  when they came close up the indecision became more pronounced and it rose on its hindlegs ready to defend itself gartok now halted when within five or six yards of the animal which was anxiously turning its head from side to side while the other two ran close up  the plan was that usually followed by eskimos in similar circumstances anteeks duty was to run forward and prick the bear on its right side so as to draw its undivided attention on himself thereby leaving its left side unguarded for the deadly thrust of cheenbuk  of course this is never attempted by men who are not quite sure of their courage and powers  but cheenbuk and anteek knew each other well  the latter was not perhaps quite strong enough to give the deathdealing thrust but he had plenty of courage and knew well how to administer the deceptive poke  as for gartok besides being incapable of any great exertion he would not on any account have robbed the boy of the honour of doing his work without help  he merely stood there as a spectator  with active spring anteek went close in and delivered his thrust  the bear uttered a savage roar and at once turned on him  just at the moment the boys foot slipped and he fell close to the animals feet in the same instant the two men sprang forward  cheenbuks spear entered the bears heart and that of gartok struck its breast  but the thrust of the latter was feeble  in his excitement and weakness gartok fell and the dying bear fell upon him  his action however saved anteek who rolled out of the way just as his preserver fell  cheenbuk and anteek did not hesitate but regardless of the few deathstruggles that followed rushed in and grasping its thick hair dragged the monster off the fallen man  gartok was insensible and it was a considerable time before he fully recovered consciousness  then it was found that he could not rise and that the slightest motion gave him intolerable pain  he will die exclaimed anteek with a look of painful anxiety  yes he will die if we do not quickly get him home said cheenbuk he cannot walk and he would freeze long before we could make an igloe i must depend on you now anteek  go back as fast as you can run and send men with a sledge and skins and something to eat  the boy will remain with me  away  without a word anteek leaped up and dropping his spear ran as if his own life depended on his speed  the little boy who had acted so foolishly came up with an anxious look on being hailed but soon forgot himself in his anxiety to be of use to the injured man  there was a mound of snow within three yards of the spot where the combat had taken place  to the lee side of this cheenbuk carried gartok  being very strong he was able to lift him tenderly as if he had been a child but despite all his care the poor man suffered terribly when moved  it was well that this mound happened to be so close for a dark cloud which had been overspreading the sky for some time began to send down snowflakes and frequent gusts of wind gave indications of an approaching storm  having placed gartok in such a position that he was quite sheltered from the wind cheenbuk took off his upper sealskin coat laid it on the snow and lifted the injured man on to it  he then wrapped it round him and folded the hood under his head for a pillow bidding the boy bank up the snow beside him in such a way as to increase the shelter  while thus engaged he saw with some anxiety that gartok had become deadly pale and his compressed lips gave the impression that he was suffering much  come here said cheenbuk to the boy quickly rub his hands and make them warm  the boy obeyed with alacrity while the other hastening his movements began to skin the bear  being an expert with the knife in such an operation he was not long of removing the thickskinned hairy covering from the carcass and in this while it was still warm he wrapped his comradenot a moment too soon for despite the boys zealous efforts the intense cold had taken such hold of the poor man that he was almost unconscious  the warmth of the bearskin however restored him a little and cheenbuk sitting down beside him took his head upon his lap and tried to shelter him from the storm which had burst forth and was raging furiously by that timefine snow filling the atmosphere while the wind drove it in huge volumes up the valley  cheenbuk noted this and congratulated himself on the fact the wind would favour the progress of the rescue sledge  sometimes the whirling snow became so suffocating that the little boy was compelled to cease his labours on the sheltering wall and crouch close to it while cheenbuk buried his nose and mouth in the white fur of the bear until the violence of the blasts abated  by keeping the skin well over the face of the wounded man he succeeded in guarding him from them effectually  but his mind misgave him when he tried to look through the whirling confusion around and thought of the long tramp that anteek would have ere he could commence his return journey with the sledge  it turned out however that this was one of those shortlived squalls not uncommon in the arctic regions which burst forthwith unwonted fury sweep madly over the plains of the frozen seas rush up into the valleys of the land and then suddenly stop as though they felt that all this energy was being spent in vain  in a short time which however seemed interminable to the watchers on the hillside the wind began to abate and the wild gusts were less frequent  then it calmed down finally it ceased altogether and the stormcloud passing away to the southeast left the dark sky studded with the myriad constellations of the starry host  uncovering gartoks face to see how it fared with him and hoping that he slept cheenbuk found that he was wide awake but in a condition that made him more anxious than ever  he looked up at the face of his protector with a faint but grateful smile  i have always been your enemy he said in a low voice but you have been my friend  that does not matter now replied cheenbuk  i have never been your enemy  we will be friends from this time on  gartok closed his eyes for a few seconds but did not speak  then he looked up again earnestly  no he said with more of decision in his tone we shall neither be friends nor enemies  i am going to the country where all is dark from which no sound has ever come back where there is nothing  our people do not talk in this way  they think that we shall all meet again in the spiritland to hunt the seal the walrus and the bear returned cheenbuk  our people talk foolishness  they think but they do not know rejoined this hyperborean agnostic as positively and as ignorantly as if he had been a scientific briton  how do you know that there is nothing in the place where you are going asked cheenbuk simply  gartok was silent  probably his logical faculty told him that his own thinking and coming to a conclusion without knowing was as foolish in himself as in his comrades  the subject of conversation happened to be very congenial to cheenbuks cast of mind  he remained thinking and gazing upwards for a minute or two then he said meditatively as if he were trying to work out some mental problem  did you ever make a sledge or a spear and then destroy it utterly while it was yet good and new  never  i have been bad it may be but i am not a fool  is the great maker of all a fool  he has made you and if he lets you die now utterly he destroys you in your best days  is it not more likely that he is calling you to some other land where there is work for you to do  i dont understand  i do not know replied gartok somewhat doggedly  but you do understand and you do know that he would be foolish to kill you now unless he had some work and some pleasure for you in the unknown land from which no sound ever comes back  when a father gives his son a work to do he does not destroy his son when the work is done he gives him another piece of work perhaps sends him on a long journey to another place  when the maker of all sees that we have finished our work here i ask again is it not likely that he will send us to work elsewhere or is it more likely that he will utterly destroy usand so prove himself to be more foolish than we are  i do not know repeated gartok but i do know that if the maker of all is good as i have heard say then i have not done his work here for you know everybody knows i have been bad  cheenbuk was much perplexed for he knew not how to minister to a mind diseased  i have often wondered he said at last why it is that some things are wrong and some right  the maker of all being good and allpowerful could have made things as he pleasedall right nothing wrong  perhaps men like children will understand things better when they are olderwhen they have reached the land from which no sound comes back  but i am not much troubled  the maker of all must be allgood and allwise  if he were not he could not be the maker of all  i can trust him  he will throw light into our minds when the time comes  he has already thrown some light for do we not know right from wrong  true but although i have known right i have always done wrong returned gartok moodily  i am sorry now  if you had not been kind to me your enemy cheenbuk i should never have been sorry  ever since i was hurt by the firespouters you have been kind to me and now you would save my life if you could  but it is too late  you have known right and done it  you mistake rejoined cheenbuk gravely  like you i have known right but i have not always done it only sometimes  it is not long since i began to think and it is since i have been thinking that my spirit seems to have changed so that i now hate wrong and desire right  i think that the maker of all must have caused the change as he makes the icemountains melt for it is not possible that i could change myself i had no wish to change till i felt the change  i wish said gartok earnestly thatif he exists at allhe would change me  at that moment cheenbuk who was gazing up into the brilliant sky seemed to be moved by a sudden inspiration for he gave utterance to the first audible prayer that had ever passed his lips  maker of all he said give to gartok the spirit that loves right and hates wrong  the dying eskimo raised his eyes to cheenbuks face in astonishment then he turned them to the starry host as if he almost expected an immediate answer  do you think he hears us he asked in a faint voice for the strength of his feelings and the effort at conversation had exhausted him greatly  i will trust him answered cheenbuk  i will trust him repeated gartok  for some time they sat in profound silence and gartok closed his eyes as if he were falling asleep  the silence was broken by a distant sound  it was the approach of anteek with the sledge  he had found the runaway dogs anchored fast between two masses of ice where the sledge had got jammed  turning the team round he plied his whip with vigour insomuch that they would have arrived much sooner if the storm had not caused delay  having arranged the sledge and its wraps so as to form a comfortable couch for the wounded man they lifted him on to it but when they removed the bearskin from his face it was found that he was beyond earthly care he had passed over to the land from which no sound has ever come back    chapter twenty four  the traders at work  wherever half a dozen average men are banded together and condemned to make the best of each others society for a prolonged period there is apt to be a stagnation of ideas as well as of aspirations which tends more or less to develop the physical and to stunt the spiritual part of our nature  so thought macsweenie as he sat one fine spring morning on a rude chair of his own making in front of the outpost on great bear lake which he had helped to build  the scottish highlander possessed a comparatively intellectual type of mind  we cannot tell precisely the reach of his soul but it was certainly above buttons  the chopping of the firewood the providing of food the state of the weather the prospects of the advancing spring and the retrospect of the long dreary winter that was just vanishing from the scene were not sufficient to appease his intellectual appetite  they sufficed indeed for his square solid easygoing matteroffact interpreter donald mowat and for his chief fisherman guide and bowman bartong as well as for his other men but they failed to satisfy himself and he longed with a great longing for some congenial soul with whom he might hold sweet converse on something a little higher than buttons  besides being thus unfortunate in the matter of companionship our highlander was not well off as to literature  he had indeed his bible and being a man of serious mind he found it a great resource in what was really neither more nor less than banishment from the world but as for light literature his entire library consisted of a volume of the voyages of sir john franklin a few very old numbers of chamberss edinburgh journal and one part of that pioneer of cheap literature the penny magazine  but poor macsweenie was not satisfied to merely imbibe knowledge he wished also to discuss it to philosophise and to ring the changes on it  he occasionally tried his hand on mowat who was undoubtedly the most advanced of his staff intellectually but the results were not encouraging  donald was goodnatured amiable ready to listen and to accord unquestioning belief but not having at that time risen above buttons he was scarcely more able to discuss than an average lamppost  occupying the position of a sort of foreman or confidential clerk the interpreter had frequent occasion to consult his superior on the details of the establishment and trade  im thinking sir said he approaching his master on the spring morning in question that we may as well give the boat an overhaul for if this weather lasts the open water will soon be upon us  you are right tonal answered the trader knocking the ashes out of his pipe and proceeding to refill it  that iss just what wass in my own mind for we must be thinkin about makin preparations for our trip to the ukon ruver  we will hev to start whenever my successor arrives here  man it will be a goot job when we are off for i am seektired of this place  wan hes nothin in the world to think about but his stamik an that iss not intellectooal whatever  are we to use the inch or the inchanahalf nails asked mowat after a moments pause  whichever you like tonal  there iss plenty of both in the store an ye are as goot a judge o these metters as i am myself  just help yoursel man only see that the work is done well for there iss a rough trup before us when we do git away  an the load will be heavy moreover for there will be a deal of stuff needed if we are to build an outpost fit to spend a winter in  man it iss pleasant to think that we will break up new groundopen up a new country among savitches that scarce knows what like a white man iss  we will feel quite like what we felt as boys when we was readin robinson crusoe  we will need two pitsaws remarked the practical orkneyman in a meditative tone  no doubt no doubt returned macsweenie and a grindstone too  do you remember what that man nazinred said when he came here on his last trupthat the indians about his country would be fery pleased to see traders settle among them  he little thoughtan no more did ithat we would be so soon sent to carry out their wishes but our governor is an activeminded man an ye never know what hell be at next  hes a man of enterprise and action that wont let the gress grow under his feetno nor under the feet of anybody that he hes to do wi  i am well pleased whatever that he hes ordered me on this service  an no doubt ye are also well pleased to go tonal  it will keep your mind from gettin rusty  i am not illpleased returned the interpreter gravelyim thinkin there wont be enough o pitch to go over all the seams o the boat  i was  hoot man never mind the putch tonal  what there iss will do fery well an the boat that comes with supplies for the new post will be sure to hev plenty  by the way i wonder if that fine man nazinred will hev come back when we get to the ukon river  it wass a strange notion of his the last comers told us about to go off to seek his daughter all by himself  i hev my doubts if hell ever come back  poor man it wass naitural too that he should make a desperate attempt to get back his only bairn but it wass not naitural that a wise man like him should go off all his lone  im afraid he wass a little off his head  did they tell you what supplies he wass supposed to have taken  yes  the wife said he had a strong sled with him an the best team o dogs in the campdo you think the boat will need a new false keel  i was lookin at it an it seemed to me rather far gone for a long trup  i will go an hev a look at it tonal  but i hev been wonderin that mozwa who seemed so fond o his frund should hev let him start away all by his lone on such a trup  he couldnt help lettin him said mowat for he didnt know he was goin till he was gone  you did not tell me that said the trader sharply  well perhaps i did not returned the interpreter with an amiable smile  it is not easy to remember all that an indian says an a good deal of it is not worth rememberinwould you like me to setto an clean up the store today or let the men go on cuttin firewood  let them do whatever you think best tonal replied macsweenie with a sigh as he rose and reentered his house where he busied himself by planning and making elaborate designs for the new fort or outpost which he had been instructed to establish on the ukon river  afterwards he solaced himself with another pipe and another dip into the wellworn pages of the penny magazine  not long after the conversation just narrated the boat arrived with the gentleman appointed to relieve macsweenie of his charge on great bear lake and with the supplies for the contemplated new post  action is not usually allowed to halt in those wild regions  a few days sufficed to make over the charge pack up the necessary goods and arrange the lading of the expedition boat and soon after macsweenie with donald mowat as steersman bartong as guide and bowman and eight mensome orkneymen some halfbreedswere rowing swiftly towards the arctic shore  passing over the voyage in silence we raise the curtain again on a warm day in summer when animal life in the wild norwest is very lively especially that portion of the life which resides in mosquitoes sandflies and suchlike tormentors of man and beast  we should arrive at the ukon tomorrow if my calculations are right or nixt day whatever said macsweenie to his interpreter and steersman as he sat smoking his pipe beside him  bartong is of the same opeenion returned mowat so between you we should come right  but bartong is not quite sure about it himself i think  at least he wont say much  in that respect the guide shows himself to be a wise man returned macsweenie sententiously  it iss only geese that blab out all they think to everybody that asks them questions  ay that is true rejoined mowat with a cynical smile an some geese manage by sayin nothin at all to anybody and lookin like owls to pass themselves off as wise menfor a time  bartong who was being thus freely discussed in the stern of the boat sat in his place at the bowoar pulling a steady stroke and casting serious looks right and left at the banks of the river as they went along  he was a dark finelooking stalwart man of what may be called mixed nationality for the blood of scotchmen french canadians and indians flowed in his veinsthat of indians predominating if one were to judge from appearance  he was what is called in the parlance of the norwest a good manthat is to say he was mentally and physically well adapted for the work he had to do and the scenes in the midst of which his lot had been cast  he pulled a good oar he laboured hard could do almost any kind of work and spoke english french and indian almost equally well  he also had a natural talent for finding his way almost anywhere in the wilderness  hence he had been sent as guide to the expedition though he had never been at the ukon river in his life but he had been to other parts of the arctic shore and had heard by report of the character and position of the river in question  it iss gettin late bartong dont you think it would be as well to camp here asked macsweenie  the bowman ceased rowing and the crew followed his example while he glanced inquiringly up at the sky and round his limited horizon as guides and seamen are wont to do when asked for an opinion as to professional movements  there will yet be daylight for an hour and there is a small lake ahead of us  if we cross it we come to a place where one of the indians said he would meet us if we came to his country  that is true tonal said the leader turning quickly to his steersman i had almost forgot that it wass so long ago since we met them  both nazinred and mozwa said something about meetin us if we came to settle though i paid little attention at the time  but are ye sure bartong that this is the lake  i know not  it is not unlikely  if it is the lake it is small and we will soon come to the end of it  if it is not the lake an turns out to be big we can camp on the shore  the night will be fine  go ahead then boys cried the leader we will try  the oars were dipped at once and the men pulled with a will encouraged by the conversation which seemed to indicate the approaching end of their voyage  the lake over the bosom of which they were soon sweeping proved to be a small one as they had hoped but whether it was the one referred to by the indians remained to be seen  a sharp lookout was kept for the smoke of wigwams but nothing of the kind was seen on either side and the end of the lake was finally reached without any sign of the presence of natives being observed  no doubt mozwa has forgotten or it may be that he iss away to seek for his frund nazinred among the eskimos  no metter  we will camp here whatever for the night  i think on the other side o that point will be a goot campin ground  he pointed in the direction indicated and there was just daylight enough left to enable mowat to steer into a narrow creek  there is something calming if not almost solemnising in the quietude with which a boat glides ashore on a dark night under the overhanging trees of a wilderness lake  the oars are necessarily stopped and the voices hushed while the bowman standing erect with a long pole in hand tries to penetrate the thick mysterious darkness that seems to be the very gate of erebus  bartong stood ready to thrust the head of the boat off any rocks that might suddenly appear in their course or give the order to back all should the water become too shallow  but no obstacles presented themselves and the boat forged slowly ahead until it lay alongside a ledge of rock or natural jetty  then the spell was broken as the men leaped ashore and began to unload the things that were required for the nights bivouac  still the voices were moderated for it is not easy to shake off the tranquillising effect of such a scene at such an hour and it was not till the campfire was lighted and the kettles were on and the pipes going full blast that the cheering effect of light chased the depressing influence of darkness away  then indeed macsweenie dropping the role of leader assumed that of bon camarade and mowat descending from the dignity of steersman enlarged upon his experiences in other days and bartong still retaining his dignity however relaxed his anxious frown and listened with an air of intelligent appreciation that charmed every speaker and induced the belief that he could cap every anecdote and story if he only chose to open his mouth while the men divided their sympathies between the narratives the tobaccopipes and the music of the fryingpan and bubbling kettle  then too the darkness into which they had penetrated fled awaynot indeed entirely but forsaking the bright spot thus created in the wilderness it encircled the camp as with a wall of ebony  it was not long however ere appetites were appeased and the voyagers sought repose for men who have to work hard all day at a healthy occupation are not addicted to late hoursat least not in the wildernesses of the norwest  ere long every man was rolled in his blanket stretched out with his feet to the fire and his head on his coat while the blaze sank low until at last the red embers alone remained to render darkness visible  among the last to seek repose were the leader of the expedition the interpreter and the bowman  having the cares of state on their shoulders these three naturally drew together for a little consultation after the others had retired  what iss your opeenion bartong asked macsweenie pushing down the tobacco in his pipe with the end of a very blunt and much charred forefinger do you think the savitches will come here at all  maybe they will and maybe they wont answered the guide with a caution worthy of the scottish portion of his blood  we niver know what injins is goin to do till they do it  umph ejaculated the highlander if solomon had been your grandfather you could scarcely hev made a wiser speechwhat think you tonal  weel as ye put it to me i must say that im strongly of bartongs opeenion  just so remarked macsweenie with a thoughtful air so as i agree wi you both i think it iss about time for us all to turn in  he turned in accordingly by lying back in his place and drawing his blanket over him  the other statesmen immediately followed his example and the camp subsided into silence    chapter twenty five  the outpost and effect of a fuddle  soon afterwards the expedition of the furtraders reached the ukon river a comparatively insignificant stream but from its character and position with reference to the indians of that region well suited for the establishment of an outpost  at least so thought the natives who had reported upon it  there iss no doubt remarked macsweenie as he surveyed the banks of the river that the place is no that bad but in my opeenion the summer will be short whatever an the winter it will be long  ye may be sure that you are not far wrong if its like the rest o this country replied mowat  there now look at that cried macsweenie who was a sketcher and an enthusiast in regard to scenery did ever you see a prettier spot than that tonal  just the place for a forta wee burn dancin doon the hull wi a bit fa to turn a grindstone an a long piece o flat land for the houses an what a grand composeetion for a picturwi trees gress water sky an such light and shade  man its magneeficent  im thinkin that itll be a bad job if that keg o screwnails we forgot at our last camp is lost  hoot man never mind the screwnails  we can easy send back for it but wow theres a far grander place were comin in sight ofaniss that an indian tent i see  ay an theres more than wan tent said mowat giving his steering oar a sweep that sent the boat farther out into the stream and enabled them better to see what lay beyond the bend of the river in front of them  hold on lads stop pullin  the men lay on their oars and turned round to look ahead  the view presented there was indeed a pleasant and inspiring one though it was scarcely entitled to the appellation magneeficent which macsweenie applied to it  the river at that place made a wide sweep on the right round a low cliff which was crowned with luxuriant foliage  the stream opened out into something like a miniature lake and the water was so calm that the cliff and its foliage made a clear dark reflection  the left bank was edged by a wide grass plateau some fifty yards wide beyond which was a background of bushes and trees with another wee burn which doubtless suggested to macsweenie the useful as well as the picturesque  the distance was closed by ground varied in form as well as in character indicating that a stream of considerable size joined the ukon at that point  but that which interested the beholders most of all was a number of indian wigwams which were pitched on the grassy plateau above referred to  yonder are our frunds i make no doubt said macsweenie in high glee that man mozwa iss as goot as his word an i do believe they have chosen the spot an been waitin for us  gif way boys an tonal make for that landinslupit must either be a naitural wan or the redskins hev made it for us  by that time the natives having observed the boat had launched several of their canoes  the first man who came alongside was mozwa himself  what cheer what cheer mozwa cried the trader as he reached over the side and shook the indian heartily by the hand  watchee watchee repeated mozwa returning the shake with equal goodwill though undisturbed solemnity  the traders surmise proved to be correct  mindful of the prospect which had been held out to him and nazinred that an expedition might possibly be sent to establish an outpost and open up the fur trade in their immediate neighbourhood on the ukon river mozwa had made more than one trip to the contemplated scene of operations after the disappearance of his friend nazinred with the view of making himself well acquainted with the land and ascertaining the best site for the new fort  he did not of course suppose that the palefaces would be guided entirely by his opinion but he thought it not unlikely that they might weigh that opinion and if acted on at once much time might be saved during the very brief summer season they had in which to place themselves comfortably in winter quarters before the hard weather should set in  you are a wise man mozwa said macsweenie when the indian had explained his views to him in the united smoke of their pipes and the campfire  your notion of a place for a fort iss not a bad one an efter i hev had a look round i hev no doubt that i will agree wi you that this is the very best site in the neighbourhood  tell him that tonal an say that i am fery much obleeged to him for all the forethought and trouble he hes taken  whether donald translated all this as it was delivered we know not from the peculiar cast of his mind however coupled with the moderate depth of his knowledge of the indian tongue it is probable that his translation was neither literal nor comprehensive  indeed it is not unlikely that his subsequent remark to one of his comradeswe told mozwa it was very good of him to come to meet us an the place would do well enoughwas more like the sentence to which he had reduced it but whatever he said mozwa seemed to be quite pleased with it  by the way tonal ask him about his friend nazinred  the serious way in which the indian shook his head showed that he had no good news to tell  in a short time he had related all that was known about the sudden departure of his friend  while mozwa was thus engaged with the leader of the expedition their guide bartong was wandering among the wigwams and making himself agreeable to the natives who because of his mixed blood and linguistic powers regarded him as a halfbrother  who is this man nazinred that our leader is always talking about he asked of the old chief while seated in his tent  he is one of our chiefs one of our boldest braves  but not so brave as he looks interrupted magadar who was present he is fonder of peace than of fighting  foolish man exclaimed bartong with a smile so peculiar that magadar did not feel quite sure that his remark was sincere  but has he not left your tribe  i heard our steersman say something about that  he left us in the winter to seek for his daughter who was carried off by an eskimo and has never come back since  we dont expect to see either of them again  magadar said this with a grave countenance for however little he cared for the loss of the father that of the daughter distressed him a littlenot much however for could he not console himself with another wife  having questioned the old chief a little more on this point he wandered off into other subjects and finally leftintending to visit the wife of nazinred on his way back to camp  isquay was sitting beside her niece idazoo embroidering a moccasin when bartong entered squatted on a deerskin unceremoniously and began to fill his pipe  what kind of a man is your husband asked the guide  a good man replied isquay who was tenderhearted and could not speak of him without moist eyes  he was a good hunter  none of the young men could equal him  and he was kind  he always had plenty of things to give me and adolay  they say he did not love war remarked bartong  no he hated it but he was brave and a good fighterthe best in the tribe  none of the young men dared to touch him  was the young brave alizay afraid to touch him asked the guide with a sly glance at the younger woman  at this idazoo flushed and looked up angrily  no she said sharply alizay fears nothing  bartong took no notice of the remark but continued gravely to question the other  was nazinred very fond of his daughter he asked  yes very  and was the girl fond of him and of you  yes replied the poor woman beginning to weep gently  and she seems to have been very fond of this eskimo who they tell me saved your life once  she was but i did not think she would go away with him  it was not like hershe was always so good and biddable and told me everything  why did your husband go off alone  i cannot tell  i suppose he knew that none of the young men would go with him or feared they might lose heart and turn back  no doubt he thought it best to go by himself for he was very brave nothing would turn him back  a fresh though silent dropping of tears occurred here and a severe pang of remorse shot through the heart of idazoo as she thought of her unkind report of what had taken place beside the dead tree under the cliff  dont cry isquay nazinred will come back you may be sure of that said the guide in a confident tone and he will bring your little girl along with him for when a man is good and brave he never fails  the brevity of summer near the shores of the arctic sea rendered it advisable that no time should be wasted in looking about too particularly for a site for the new tradingpost and as macsweenie was well pleased with mozwas selection he at once adopted it and set to work  deeming it important to open the campaign by putting a good taste in the mouths of his friends the indians he began by distributing a few gratuities to themsome coloured beads to the women and a few lines fishhooks and tobacco to the men  then he marked out a site for the future dwellinghouse and store got out the tools and set to work to fell saw and shape suitable timber for the buildings  he constituted magadar chief hunter to the establishment supplied him with a new gun powder and ball and sent him off to the woods as proud as and doubtless much happier than a king  mozwa he kept by him as a counsellor to whom he could appeal in all matters regarding the region and the people as well as an overseer of those among his countrymen who were hired to render assistance  alizay was sent off in a canoemuch to the satisfaction of mowatfor that forgotten keg of screwnails which had lain so heavy on his mind and the old chief was supplied with unlimited tobacco and allowed to wander about at will under the agreeable impression that he was superintendentgeneral of the works isquay idazoo and some of the other women were furnished with moosedeer skins and needles and employed to make moccasins for the men as well as to do all the needful repairs to garments  thus the plateau on the banks of the ukon river presented during the weeks that followed a scene of lively bustle and unfamiliar noise to the furred and feathered inhabitants of those vast solitudes and formed to the red men a new and memorable era in their monotonous existence  at last there came a day when the roof of the principal dwelling was completely covered the doors were fixed up and the glazed windows fitted in  now tonal remarked macsweenie on the morning of that auspicious day it iss a housewarming that i will be giving tonight for the indians will be expectin something o the sort so you will be telling the cook to make the biggest lump o plumduff he ever putt his hands to an tell him not to spare the plums  it iss not every day we will be givin thiss goot people a blowout an it iss a matter of great importance to my thinking that first impressions should be good ones it iss the duty of a new broom to sweep clean  if it continues goot and well but if it does not begin that way it iss not likely to come to it whatever  there iss far more than people think in sentiment  if you fail to rouse a sentiment of gootwill or confidence or whatever it may be at a first startoff it iss not easy to rouse it afterwards hev ye not noticed that tonal  i cant say that i have answered the interpreter with a matteroffact frown at the ground but i have noticed that the pitsaw they was usin yesterday has been allowed to saw into the holdinirons and damaged half o  hoots man never mind the pitsaw exclaimed macsweenie with a touch of asperity  all the planks we want are sawn an if they were not surely we could mendtut man i wonder ye can play the fuddle  it always seemed to me that a goot fuddler must be a man of sentiment but ye are the exception tonal that proves the rule  away wi you an gie my orders to the cook an see that you have the fuddle in goot tune for we will want it tonight  an let him hev plenty of tea for if we gain the women were sure o the men  mowat retired with a smile on his broad benignant face  he understood his leader and was not offended by his plain speaking  besides it was not easy to make the interpreter take offence  his spirit was of that happy nature which hopeth all things and believeth all things  it flowed calm and deep like an untroubled river  nothing short of a knockdown blow would have induced donald mowat to take offence but that would certainly have stirred him and as he possessed vast physical strength and was something awful to behold when roused and his comrades were aware of these facts the serenity of his life was not often or deeply ruffled  the cook who was an enthusiast in his art did his best and was eminently successful  his plumduff dumpling was bigger than any gun at least of ancient typecould have swallowed and the plums as mowat afterwards said did not need to seek for each other  he made enough of delightfully greasy cakes to feed an army and according to his own statement infused lashins o tea  before the hour for the feast arrived that night mowat got out his violin and went into one of the rooms of the new house to put it in order  the window of the room looked towards the back of the house where the forest was seen just beyond the plateau  drawing a bench to the window he sat down and opened the case  of course he found the first string broken but that did not break his heart for he had a good supply of spare strings and if these should failwell there were plenty of deersinews in the land  it was soon put to rights and leaning his back against the wall he began to tickle the strings gently  whatever he was at other times there is no doubt that the interpreter was full of genuine sentiment the moment he got the violin under his chin  now at that moment three young dogrib braves chanced to be passing under the window which was about seven feet from the ground  though equally young and no doubt equally brave as well as equally dogribbed those three youths were not equally matched for one was tall and thin another was short and thick while the third was middlesized and fat they had been huntingsuccessfullyfor the thick man carried a small deer on his lusty shoulders  on hearing the first notes of the instrument the three youths started into three different attitudes as if of petrified surprise and remained so waiting for more  they had not to wait long for after tickling the fiddle once or twice to get it in perfect tune mowat raised his eyes to the pineplank ceiling and glided softly into one of those exquisite scottish airs by means of which a firstrate performer on the violin can almost draw the soul out of a mans body  we think it was the flowers of the forest  whatever it was the three dogribs were ravished  they turned their heads slowly as if afraid to break the spell and looked at each other showing the whites of their great eyes increasingly while each raised a hand with spread fingers as if to keep the others from speaking  they had never heard anything approaching to it before  they had never even imagined anything like it  it was an utterly new sensation  what could it be  they had heard of something strange in the musical way from nazinred and mozwa but with the carelessness of youth they had scarce listened to the comments of these men  now it burst upon their awakened sense like sounds from some other planet  their mouths opened slowly as well as their eyes and there was an expression of awe in their faces which betokened a touch of superstitious fear  suddenly mowat drew his bow across all the strings with a skirl that might have shamed the bagpipes and burst into the reel o tullochgorum  the effect was electrical  the thick man dropped the deer the thin man sloped forward the fat man sprang into the air and all three made for the woods as if all the spirits of evil were after them in full cry  we need hardly say after this that those dogrib indians spent an excited and agreeable evening with the furtraders  they appreciated the dancing undoubtedly though very few of them would condescend to join  they appreciated the plumduff and the greasy cakes highly and they more than appreciated the teaespecially the womenwhich macsweenie took care to provide hot strong and sweet  but there is no doubt that the lion of the evening wasthe fuddle    chapter twenty six  a mysterious journey and a great discovery  putting on the wings of imagination good reader let us once more fly over the snowfields of the lone norwest and return to the regions of thickribbed ice  we have to apologise humbly for asking you also to fly back a little in time and plunge once more into the dreary winter from which no doubt you thought you had fairly escaped  one morning toward the beginning of spring referred to in last chapter while yet the northern seas were covered with their solid garment cheenbuk announced to all whom it might concern that he intended to go off on a long journey to the eastwardhe called it the place where the great light risesfor purposes which he did not see fit publicly to reveal  at that time the great light to which he referred had begun to show symptoms of intention to return to the dark regions which it had forsaken for several months  the glimmer on the eastern sky had been increasing perceptibly each day and at last had reached the point of producing a somewhat rosy twilight for two or three hours before and after noon  king frost however still reigned supreme and the dogsledge as yet was the only mode of travelling among the islands or on the sea  why go you towards the rising sun asked nazinred when cheenbuk invited him to be one of the party  because it is from my countrymen who dwell there that we get the hard stuff that is so good for our spearheads and lances and arrows  we know not where they find the stuff and they wont tell  i shall go and find out for myself and take back plenty of it to our people  the hard stuff referred to was hoopiron which as well as nails and a few hatchets the eskimos of the eastern parts of the arctic shores obtained from whaleships and passed on to their friends in the more remote regions of the farther north  i can tell you how they get it said the indian  white traders to whom our people go with their furs have spoken of such things and my ears have been open  they say that there are white men who come over the great salt lake from faroff lands in big big canoes  they come to catch the great whales and it is from them that the hard stuff comes  for some minutes the eskimo was silent  a new idea had entered his head and he was turning it over  have you ever seen these white men or their big canoes asked cheenbuk with great interest  never  the salt lake where they kill the whale is too far from my peoples huntinggrounds  but the white traders i have visited have seen them  some traders have come from the same faroff lands in big canoes of the same sort  is it very far from here to the seas to which these whalekillers come  very far from the huntinggrounds of the dogribs but it may not be far from here  i will go and see said cheenbuk with much decision and he went off forthwith to make preparations  the expedition consisted of one large sledge with a team of twelve dogs  being resolved not to risk failure by taking too many companions the eskimo limited the number to seven besides himselfnamely nazinred with his firespouter oolalik whom he deemed the strongest and bravest among the young men anteek the most plucky of the big boys aglootook the medicineman whom he took for luck and nootka as being the most vigorous and hardworking among the women  she could repair the boots etcetera and do what little cooking might be required  cowlik the easygoing was also taken to keep nootka company  it was high noon when the party set out on their mysterious journey and a brighter glow than usual was suffusing the eastern sky while a gleam of direct sunshine the first seen that spring was tipping the peaks of the higher bergs as if with burnished gold  it was merely a whim that induced cheenbuk to throw an air of mystery over the expedition  having no definite idea himself of what he was going in search of or how long he should be away he thought it wisest to look solemn and keep his thoughts to himself thereby impressing his kinsmen with the belief that he was one of the wisest men of the tribe which in truth he was  being as we have said elsewhere a man of humour and a goodnatured fellow he thought that the presence of the magician whom he believed to be an arrant humbug would add mystery as well as interest to the expedition  aglootook was himself thoroughly convinced on this point and sought by every means to induce the leader to disclose his object and plans but as cheenbuk maintained inflexible reticence on this matter the magician made a virtue of necessity shook his head solemnly when spoken to about it and gave it to be understood generally that in his and the leaders minds there were rolling about thoughts and intentions that were far too deep for utterance  cheenbuk would have offered a seat to adolay but her father thought it better to decline for her  she was therefore left in the camp in care of old mangivik and his amiable spouse  travelling by dogsledge among the eskimos is rapid and exhilarating when the ice is unbroken  when the explorers left the village and made for the far east the plain of ice before them was level and smooth as far as the eye could reach  they therefore went along at a swinging pace the team stretching out at full gallop a crack from the whip resounding only now and then when one of the dogs inclined to become refractory  the short day soon vanished and the long night with its galaxy of stars and shooting aurora still found them gliding swiftly over the white plain  at last a line of hummocks and icebergs rose up before them as if to bar their further progress and the dogs reduced their speed to a trot until on reaching the broken ice they stopped altogether  we will camp here said cheenbuk jumping off and stretching himself make the igloe there he added pointing to a convenient spot in the lee of a small berg  the whole party went to work and in a wonderfully short time had constructed one of their snow beehives large enough to contain them all  here they ate a hasty supper and spent several hours in a slumber so profound and motionless that it seemed as if they were all dead not a sigh not even a snore broke the stillness of the night  next morning they were up and off long before the first glimmer of dawn proclaimed the advent of a new day  fortunately a passage among the ridges of broken ice was found through which the sledge was hauled with comparative ease and before noon they had reached the open seaice beyond over which they again set forth at full swing  little food had been brought for they depended chiefly on their weapons to supply them and as seals abounded everywhere as well as walruses they had no lack  thus they advanced for several days sometimes being retarded a little by broken ice but for the most part dashing at full speed over smooth surfaces  one day they came to a long stretch of land extending to the right and left as far as the eye could reach which seemed to be a check to their progress for it was extensively covered with willow bushes  cheenbuk climbed a neighbouring berg with nazinred to have a look at it  the eskimo looked rather glum for the idea of landtravelling and struggling among willows was repugnant to him  i dont like the look of this he said turning to his companion there seems no end to it  let not my son be cast down returned the indian menofthewoods understand the nature of land  this looks like a low flat running out from the mainland  if so it is not likely to be very wide and we shall be sure to find the great salt lake on the other side of it besides away to the left i see something like a small lake  if we go there we may find hard snow on which the dogs can run  there is bad fortune here said aglootook endeavouring to look oracular as he came up at that moment with anteek  we must go far away in that direction he added pointing to the right and looking at his leader with the aspect as well as the wisdom of an owl  the fact was that from the start the magician had been thirsting for some opportunity to display his profound sagacity and in his opinion the time had arrived for in other mens extremity he was wont to find his opportunity  true he knew no more than the king of ashantee which was the best line to takeright or leftbut much of the power he had acquired over his fellows was due to his excessive selfsufficiency coupled with reckless promptitude in taking action  if things went well he got the credit if wrongwell he was ingenious in devising explanations  aglootook is wise said cheenbuk with gravity and a glance at anteek i will act on his advice but first i must take just a little run to the left to find out something that i see there  anteek was not naturally rude but there was a sensation in him at that moment which induced him to turn his back on the magician and become absorbed in the contemplation of a neighbouring berg  when he turned round again his face was a little flushed  nazinred was right  there was not only a lake at the place which he pointed out but a chain of small lakes over which the dogs scampered as well as if they had been on the open sea  that night however they were obliged to encamp among the willows but next night they reached the other side of what was evidently a large promontory and finally swept out again on the familiar frozen sea  the day following they arrived at an obstruction which it appeared as if neither the wisdom of aglootook the sagacity of nazinred nor the determination of cheenbuk could enable them to surmount  this was a mighty barrier of broken ice which had probably been upheaved by the flow of cross currents when the sea was setting fast in autumn or the action of conflicting bergs many of which were imbedded in the mass thus giving to it the appearance of a small mountain range with higher peaks rising above the general elevation  on beholding it aglootook recovered some of his selfrespect and with a look of wisdom quite inconceivable by those who have not seen it expressed his solemn belief that they would have escaped this difficulty if they had only acted on his advice and travelled to the right  cheenbuk admitted that he seemed to have been mistaken in a tone which again set anteek contemplating one of the neighbouring bergs with a countenance not altogether devoid of colour and the leader drove the team towards the least forbidding part of the ridge  you will never get across said aglootook in a low voice  i will try returned cheenbuk  it is madness said the magician  people have often called me mad responded cheenbuk so if they were right i am well fitted to do it  it was an exceedingly difficult crossing  in some places the blocks and masses were heaped together in such confusion that it seemed as if the attempt to pass were useless and the magician solaced himself by frequent undertoned references to the advantage in general of travelling right instead of left  but always when things looked most hopeless the indefatigable cheenbuk found a passageoften very narrow and crooked it is truethrough which they managed to advance and when the way was blocked altogether as it was more than once cheenbuk and the indian cleared a passage with their axes while anteek led the dogs over the obstruction and oolalik guided the sledge over it  nootka usually stood on a convenient icemound and admired the proceedings while aglootook who had no axe stood beside her and gave invaluable advice to which nobody paid the slightest attention  at last after many a fall and slip and tremendous slide they reached the other side of the ridge and once again went swiftly and smoothly over the level plain  we shall not find them remarked oolalik becoming despondently prophetic as he surveyed the wide expanse of frozen sea with nothing but bergs and hummocks here and there to break its uniformity  we must find them replied cheenbuk with that energy of resolution which usually assails a man of vigorous physique and strong will when difficulties accumulate  but my son if we do not find them it will not matter much for the white traders of the woods have plenty of the hard stuff and all other things also and when we return to the greygoose river at the opening of the waters we may take the teeth of the walrus and the skins of the seal and begin a trade with them  i have much of their goods in my own wigwam and cheenbuk knows that i can guide him to the home of the trader on the great fresh lake  oolalik glanced at nootka while the indian spoke as if he felt that a splendid prospect of decorative ornamental and other delights was opening up to her  nootka returned the glance as if she felt that a splendid opportunity of securing such delights for her was opening up to him  cheenbuk did not reply being engaged in the profound abysses of thought which had been opened up by his red friends suggestion  before he could find words to reply nazinred whose vision was keen and practised pointed out something that appeared like a cloud on the horizon ahead of them and which he declared to be land  i have noticed that the eyes of the manofthewoods are sharper than those of the eskimo said cheenbuk  the indian received this compliment with a gaze of calm indifference as though he heard it not  just then an exclamation from anteek attracted general attention  he pointed to a mound of snow on the ice a short way to the left of the track which had a peculiar shape  something covered over with snow said cheenbuk turning the dogs in that direction by the simple but significant expedient of sending his long whip with a resonant crack to the right of the team  it is a man remarked nazinred as they drew near  he was right  on clearing away the snow they found the dead body of a man some portions of whose costume resembled that of a sailor though of course none of those who discovered it were aware of that fact  kablunet exclaimed cheenbuk using the eskimo term for white man  how long the poor man had lain there it was not easy to guess for the body was frozen stiff so that decay was impossible but the fact that it had not been discovered by bears argued that it could not have lain long  its emaciated appearance and the empty sack slung across the shoulder showed that death must have been the result of starvation there was a short loaded carbine lying beside the body and in a pouch a flask of powder with a few bullets  i think said nazinred after careful inspection of the remains that this is one of the white men who come over the salt lake in their big canoes  if so said cheenbuk we will follow his track and may come to the big canoe itself perhaps some of the kablunets may be yet alive  the indian shook his head  men do not start off alone on a journey to nowhere he replied  the big canoe must have been crushed in the ice and the men must have started off together to search for eskimos  i think they must all have died on the way and this one walked farthest  the manofthewoods is wise said oolalik  if we follow the track we shall soon find out  yes said aglootook putting on his most prophetic air  go on the track straight as we can gothat is my advice and we shall be quite sure to come to something  cheenbuk acted on the advice  having buried the body of the unfortunate sailor in a snowgrave and taken possession of the carbine and other things they leaped on the sledge again and continued to advance along the track which though in some places almost obliterated was easily followed  they had not advanced more than a mile when another mound was discovered with another seaman below it whom they buried in the same way and close to it a third whose costume being in some parts a little finer they correctly guessed to be a chief  at last they came in sight of a large mound and on uncovering it found a boat with four dead men lying near it  all seemed to have died of starvation and the reason why some of them had forsaken the boat was obvious for it was crushed out of shape by ice the bottom having been cut completely away so that all the provisions they had to depend on had no doubt been lost  this is not the big canoe remarked the indian while they examined it  the big one must have been sunk and they had to try to escape in the little one  the party spent a long time in examining the boat and as there was a good deal of iron about it which might be useful they resolved to revisit it on the homeward journey  setting off again they now made straight for the land discovered by nazinred which now lay like a dark blue line of hills in the far distance  from the abrupt termination of the land at either extremity of the range it was judged to be a large island  as the night was clear and the ice level the party travelled all that night and arrived at the island about daybreak the following morning  the shore was rocky and desolate with high cliffs behind it so that further progress to the eastward was evidently impossible unless by passing round the island to the north or south of it  i said you would come to something said the magician sententiously as they drew near to the forbidding coast  you were right aglootook  indeed it would be impossible for you to be wrong replied cheenbuk with one of those glances at anteek which rendered it hard for the boy to preserve his gravity yet he was constrained to make the effort for the magician was very sensitive on the point and suspected the boy  they were by this time running between the headlands of a small bay and suddenly came in sight of an object which caused them all to exclaim with surprise and excitementfor there under the shelter of a high cliff lay a threemasted ship or as the indian termed it the white mans big canoe    chapter twenty seven  interesting amusing and astounding discoveries  although close under the cliffs and apparently on the rocks the vessel was by no means a wreck neither had it the aspect of one  there were no broken masts or tattered sails or ropes dangling from the yards  on the contrary the masts were straight and sound such of the yards as had not been lowered were squared and all the ropes were trim and taut  the deck was covered over with a roof of canvas and the snow banked up all round so as to meet the lower edges of it and form a protection from the wind  up one side of this bank of snow a flight of stairs had been cut leading to the port gangway and the prints of many feet were seen all round the ship converging towards the stairs the steps of which were worn as if by much use  at first the natives approached the vessel with extreme caution not being sure of what might be their reception if any man should be on board and with a sense of awe at beholding a mysterious object which had hitherto been utterly beyond the range of their experience though not quite unknown to them by report  by degrees however they drew nearer and nearer until they reached the bottom of the snow staircase still there was no sound to be heard in the white mans big canoe to indicate the presence of a human being  at last cheenbuk uttered a shout with the view of attracting attention but there was no reply  make the firespouter speak he said looking at his indian friend  nazinred silently obeyed pointed his gun at the clouds and fired then the whole party awaited the result listening intently  they heard much more than had been expected for the cliffs embraced several echoes which being thus rudely awakened sent the shot crashing back with multiplied violence to the no little surprise as well as alarm of the hearers  still all was silent on board of the ship and at last coming to the conclusion that there was no living soul there at all the indian having reloaded his gun began to ascend the staircase closely followed by cheenbuk oolalik anteek and aglootookwhich last being a cautious man was careful to bring up the rear  nootka and cowlik remained on the ice to observe the end of it allthe former anxiously curious the latter curiously easy  for some time these two stood in silent expectancy  then oolalik appeared at the top of the staircase and looking down with a face in which solemn wonder had reached its utmost limit of expression beckoned them to come up  nootka obeyed with alacrity her companion leisurely  what the party saw on entering the vessel was well fitted to arouse wonder in their unsophisticated minds  whether it was one of the numerous discovery ships that have invaded those regions in the present century or a whaler which had been driven out of its course by stress of weather or power of ice is uncertain for although some relics of the expedition ultimately reached the outpost of the furtraders nothing was brought away by the eskimos which bore name or date or writing of any kind  although ignorant of the meaning as well as the uses of almost everything they saw those natives were quite sufficiently intelligent to guess that the white mans big canoe had been set fast in the ice the previous autumn and laid up for the winter in this place of safety to serve as a big igloe or hut  their examination of the ship was at first very slow for they stepped about on tiptoe as if afraid of disturbing some of the ghosts of its former inhabitants  then a speculative gaze had to be turned on each object for a few moments followed by an inquiring glance at each other the deck and its accompaniments of masts rising through the canvas roof and ropes and blocks hatches skylights companions etcetera afforded them matter for unbounded astonishment though what they afterwards discovered below was productive of unutterable amazement  hoi exclaimed cheenbuk pointing at something with all his ten fingers expanded  he had discovered the binnacle and was gazing for the first time at the mariners compass  hi cried the responsive anteek in a wideeyed condition  he had discovered the aftercompanion which was partially open and was gazing solemnly into the depths below  the unwonted nature of their surroundings developed an unsuspected vein of curiosity in cowlik who pushed the companiondoor open and seeing a flight of steps with some degree of light below she began to descend whether nootkas surprise at this sudden act of selfassertion or her curiosity was the stronger it would be hard to say but she immediately went after cowlik  the men seeing the way thus indicated did not hesitate to follow  of course they all held tenaciously by the brass rail being afraid to slip on the steep stair and some of them slewing round almost naturally went down in true sailor fashion backwards  reaching the bottom the girls probably by chance turned to the left and entered the aftercabin  the men of the party turned to the right and became absorbed in contemplation of the stewards pantry  it smelt deliciously but that was all that remained of its native attractions for of food or drink there was nothing left  they had just made this discovery when a loud laugh and then a wild scream from the cabin horrified them  cheenbuk and oolalik drew their knives nazinred cocked his gun anteek grasped a rollingpin that lay handy and all four sprang to the rescue  the scream came from cowlik  she had suddenly faced a mirror that hung in the cabin and beheld a perfect representation of her own fat face it was by no means an unknown face for she had often had an imperfect view of it in pools and in calm seas but it quite took her aback when thus unexpectedly and clearly presented  the blaze of astonishment that followed the first glance caused the burst of laughter referred to and the display of her wide mouth and white teeth in the changed expression induced the scream of alarm  it also made her start backward so quickly that she sent poor nootka crashing against the starboard bulkhead  look cried the frightened girls pointing to the mirror  the three eskimos sprang forward and received something like an electric shock on beholding their own faces  cheenbuk turned to nazinred but that usually grave indian was indulging in a patronising smile instead of sharing their surprise  i know what it is he said quietly  i have seen it before in the stores of the furtraders but never so big as that  familiarity it is said breeds contempt  after gazing at themselves in the miraculous mirror for some time an idea occurred to anteek  he suddenly shot out his tongue which happened to be a very long one anteeks reflection did the same  thereupon oolalik opened his mouth wide and laughed  so did oolaliks reflection which had such an effect upon cheenbuk that he also burst into a fit of laughter  the girls pressing forward to see what it was likewise presented grinning faces which formed such a contrast to the grave countenance of nazinred as he stood there in all the dignity of superior knowledge that the whole party went off into uncontrollable explosions which fed upon what they created until the tears were running down the cheeks of the eskimos and the indian himself was constrained at last to smile benignly  but mirth gave place to solemnity again not unmingled with pity as they spent hour after hour examining the various parts of the forsaken ship  of course they could go over only a small part of it that day when the short day came to a close they went to the shore and encamped in their usual waynot daring to sleep on board a big canoe about which as yet they knew so little  on shore they found more subjects of interest and perplexity for here were several mounds marked by crosses and a large mound surmounted by a pole on the top of which were fluttering a few remnants of red cloth the shape of the smaller mounds naturally led them to infer that they were the graves of white men who had died there but the large mound was inexplicable until nazinred recollected having seen a flag hoisted on a pole at the fort on great bear lake  i remember he said to cheenbuk that the traders used to hoist a piece of cloth to the top of a pole like this at times when something of importance happened  perhaps the chief of the big canoe died and was buried here and they hoisted the red cloth over him to mark the place  my father may be right observed the eskimo but why did they put such a heap of stones above him  perhaps to keep the bears from getting at him returned the indian thoughtfully or it may be to show him great respect  resting satisfied with these surmises the two men returned to their encampment without disturbing the mound which was in all probability a cairn covering a record of the expedition which had come to such an untimely end  next day the moment there was enough of light to enable them to resume the search the eskimos hurried on board the ship and began to ransack every hole and corner and they found much that caused their eyes to glitter with the delight of men who have unexpectedly discovered a mine of gold  among other things they found in a small room which had been used as a blacksmiths forge large quantities of hoop bar and rodiron  while cheenbuk and oolalik were rejoicing over this find anteek rushed in upon them in a state of considerable excitement with something in his hand  it was a large watch of the doublecased warmingpan tribe  listen exclaimed the boy holding it up to cheenbuks ear and giving it a shake it speaks  what is it murmured the eskimo  i dont know but it does not like shaking for it only speaks a little when i shake it  i tried squeezing but it does not care for that  here again nazinreds superior knowledge came into play though to a limited extent  i have seen a thing like that he said  the trader at the great freshwater lake had one  he carried it in a small bag at his waist and used often to pull it out and look at it  he never told me what it was for but once he let me hear it speak  it went on just like this onetik tik tikbut it did not require shaking or squeezing  i think it had a tongue like some of our squaws who never stop speaking one day when i went into the traders house i saw it lying on the thing with four legs which the white men put their food on when they want to eat and it was talking away to itself as fast as ever  they were still engaged with this mystery when a cry of delight from nootka drew them back to the cabin where they found the girl clothed in a pilotcloth coat immensely too large for her  she was standing admiring herself in the mirrorso quickly had her feminine intelligence applied the thing to its proper use and from the energetic but abortive efforts she made to wriggle round so as to obtain a view of her back it might have been supposed that she had been trained to the arts of civilisation from childhood  with equal and earnest assiduity cowlik was engaged in adorning her head with a black flannellined souwester but she had some trouble with it owing to the height of her topknot of hair  ridiculous though the two girls might have looked in our eyes in those of their companions they only seemed peculiar and interesting for the step between the sublime and ridiculous is altogether relative in eskimoland as elsewhere  there was no opportunity however to dwell long in contemplation of any new thing for the discoveries came thick and fast  cowlik had barely succeeded in pulling the earpieces of the souwester well down and tying the strings under her fat chin when a tremendous clanking was heard as of some heavy creature approaching the cabin door  cheenbuk dropped forward the point of his spear and nazinred kept his gun handy  not that they were actually alarmed of course but they felt that in such unusual circumstances the least they could do was to be ready for whatever might befallor turn up  a moment later and aglootook stalked into the cabin his legs encased in a pair of fishermens seaboots so large that they seemed quite to diminish his natural proportions  in all their discoveries however they did not find a single scrap of any kind of food  it was quite clear that the poor fellows had held by the ship as long as provisions lasted in the hope no doubt that they might ultimately succeed in working their way out of the ice and then when inevitable starvation stared them in the face they had tried to escape in their boats but without successat least in one case though how many boats had thus left to undertake the forlorn hope of storming the strongholds of the polar seas it was impossible to tell  on the second night as the eskimos sat in their igloe at supper talking over the events of the day nazinred asked cheenbuk what he intended to do  for said he it is not possible to take back with us on one sledge more than a small part of the many good things that we have found  the manofthewoods is right interposed the magician he is wise one sledge cannot carry much  i told you that we were sure to find something  was i not right  have we not found it  my advice now is that we go back with as much as we can carry and return with four or five sledgesor even moreand take home all that it is possible to collect  aglootook is always full of knowledge and wisdom remarked cheenbuk as he drove his powerful teeth into a tough bearsteak and struggled with it for some moments before continuing his remarks butbutha he does not quite see through an iceberg  i willgive me another nootka with more fat on iti will go back as he wisely advises with as much as the sledge will carry and will return not only with four or five sledges but with all the sledges we have got and all the dogs and all the men and women and childreneven to the smallest babe that wears no clothes and lives in its mothers hood and sucks blubber the whole tribe shall come here and live here and make use of the good things that have fallen in our way till the time of open water draws near  then we will drive to the place where we have left our kayaks and oomiaks some of us will go to waruskeek and some to pay a visit to the firespouters at whale rivergive me another lump nootka  the last was a little one and i am hungry  the grandeur of cheenbuks plan as compared with aglootooks suggestion was so great that the poor magician collapsed  anteek looked at him  then he covered his young face with his hands and bent his head forward upon his knees  it was too early for going to rest  the boy might have been sleeping but there was a slight heaving of the young shoulders which was not suggestive of repose  later on in the evening while nazinred was enjoying his pipe and the eskimos were looking on in unspeakable admiration cheenbuk remembered that the last time he quitted the ship he had left his spear behind him  ill go and fetch it said anteek who possessed that amiable and utterly delightful nature which offers to oblige or do a service without waiting to be asked  in a few minutes he was out upon the ice on his errand  soon he gained the snow staircase and running up made his way to the cabin where the spear had been left  now it chanced that a polar bear attracted perhaps by the odour of cooked food had wandered near to the ship and observed the young eskimo ascend  polar bears are not timid  on the contrary they are usually full of courage  they are also full of curiosity  the night was clear and when that bear saw the youth go up the stair it immediately went to the place to inspect it  courage and caution are not necessarily antagonistic  on arriving at the foot of the stair it paused to paw and otherwise examine it  then it began to ascend slowly as if doubtful of consequences  now if it were not for coincidences a great many of the extraordinary events of this life would never have happened  for instancebut the instances are so numerous that it may be well not to begin them  it happened that just as the bear began to ascend the snow staircase anteek with the spear in his hand began to ascend the companionladder  but the chief point of the coincidence lay herethat just as the bear reached the top of the stair the boy reached the very same spot and next moment the two stood face to face within four feet of each other  we will not go into the irrelevant question which was the more surprised  anteek at once uttered a yell compounded of courage despair ferocity horror and other ingredients which startled into wild confusion all the echoes of the cliffs  the bear opened its mouth as if to reply and the boy instantly rammed the spear into it  he could not have done anything worse except run away for a bears mouth is tough  happily however the monster was standing in a very upright position and the violence of the thrust sent him off his balance  he fell backwards down the stair and came on the ice with an astounding crash that doubled him up and crushed all the wind out of his lungs in a bursting roar  fortunately his great weight caused the destruction of five or six of the lower steps so that when he rose and tried viciously to reascend he was unable to do so  of course the uproar brought the men on shore to the rescue and while the bear was making furious attempts to reconstruct the broken staircase nazinred went close up and put a bullet in its brain    chapter twenty eight  the ship revisited and reexplored  cheenbuks plan was afterwards fully carried out  on the return of the party with all their wonderful news and wealth of old iron the greatest excitement prevailed in the tribe and the persons composing the expedition became heroes and heroines for the time being  each member formed a centre of attraction and a subject of crossexamination to its own particular relatives and friends  in the igloe of aglootook was assembled perhaps one of the most surprised if not one of the most credulous of the gatheringsfor the magician had a strong hold on the imagination of the greater number of his tribe and a wonderful power of oratory  his wife in particular idolised him which said much for his amiability and his only sister worshipped him which spoke volumes for her gullibility  yes he exclaimed gazing round on the circle of his admirers i said from the first that this would be a wonderful trip and that we would be sure to find something  and did we not find it  vigorous assent by look and voice from the audience  and he continued with a lowered voice and solemn look if cheenbuk had not turned to the left when i told him we never would have found it  but what was it like asked an elderly man with a squatnose whose mind was not quite clear although he had already listened to an elaborate description  like  ho it was likelike  like a big kayak remarked some one  no no  far far bigger said the magician making an imbecile attempt to indicate inconceivable size by waving arms and outspread fingers it wasas bigasas  a whale suggested squatnose  biggerbigger said aglootook with a lost look in his eyes  you could stuff twenty igloes into it and there were three great poles rising out of it as thick asas me with other poles across them low down and high up and walruslines hanging about in all directions some as thick as my wrist others as thin as my finger and strange igloes inside of itnot of snow but of woodwith all kinds of things you could think of in there and things thatthatyou could not think of even if you were to trythat nobody ever thought of since the world beganwonderful  this seemed to fairly take away the breath of the audience for they could only glare and remain dumb  for a few moments they breathed hard then squatnose said in a deep whisper  go on  aglootook did go on and kept going on so long that his audience were forced to go off and assuage the pangs of hunger which prolonged abstinence and mental excitement at last rendered unendurable  but no sooner was appetite appeased than the magician and his hearers returned to the subject with redoubled energy  is it very very far away asked aglootooks wife with a sigh when he explained to her the wonders of the mirror  yes a long long way and some of the ice is very rough for the dogs  not too far for some of us to go and return before the open water squatnose ventured to hope  plenty of time returned aglootook with a patronising smile  in fact i advised cheenbuk to start away back as fast as possible with many sledges so that my woman will see it with her own eyes  and me too exclaimed the sister bringing her palms together with a smack  and you too  i advised cheenbuk to take the whole tribe there to stay till the time of open water and he agreed  cheenbuk is a wise young man he always takes my advice  the subject of this eulogium was meanwhile giving a graphic and much more truthful account of the expedition to adolay mangivik his mother and a select circle of friends yet although he did his best like aglootook to convey an adequate impression of what they had seen we make bold to say that the utmost power of language in the one and of imagination in the other failed to fill the minds of those unsophisticated natives with a just conception of the truth  but they did succeed in filling most of their hearts with an unconquerable desire to go and see for themselves so that no difficulty was experienced in persuading the whole tribemen women children and dogsto consent to a general migration  even anteek held his court that night in the tent of old uleeta  since the death of gartok anteek had shown much sympathy with that poor old woman  illnatured people for there are such in eskimoland said that sympathy with young uleeta had something to do with his frequent visits to the tent  well and why not  the sympathy was not the less sincere that it was extended to both  anyhow a large circle of juvenile admirers of both sexes assembled under the snow roof to hear the young lecturer and we are inclined to think that his discourse was quite as instructive and interesting as the narratives of his seniors  he did not exaggerate anything for anteek was essentially truthful in spirit  nothing would induce him to lie or to give a false impression if he could help it but the vivid play of his fancy and the sparkling flow of his young imagination were such that he kept his audience in a constant ripple of amusement and fever of anticipation  he was particularly strong on aglootook and whatever that wily magician gained in the esteem of the adults he certainly lost among the juveniles  so eager were the eskimos to see the wonderful sights that had been described to them that they at once set about preparation for departure  on the second day after the return of the exploring party the entire village having previously hidden away in a secure place the things already obtained from the ship mounted their sledges and commenced their journey amid much noise and glee in the direction of what was to them the far east  it is needless and would be tedious to carry the patient reader a second time over the same ground  suffice it to say that when they reached the spot and were introduced to the white mans big kayak they felt disposed to echo the words of the queen of sheba and exclaim that half had not been told themnot even although that huge humbug aglootook had told them a great deal too much  new circumstances are apt to engender new conditions in savage as well as civilised life  it is scarcely credible what an amount of hitherto latent vanity was evoked by that mirror in the cabin and that too in the most unlikely characters  mangivik for instance spent much of his time the first few days in admiring his grey locks in the glass  and old uleeta although one of the plainest of the tribe seemed never to tire of looking at herself  squatnose also was prone to stand in front of that mirror making hideous faces at himself and laughing violently but there is reason to believe that it was not vanity which influenced him so much as a philosophical desire to ascertain the cause of his own ugliness  aglootook likewise wasted much of his valuable time before it  a new sense of shame was by this means developed among these natives as well as the power to blush because after people had been interrupted frequently in this act of selfadmiration they were laughed at and the constant recurrence of this laughter aroused a feeling of indignation at the same time a tendency to hop away and pretend interest in other things  squatnose never did this  all his actions were open as the dayof course we mean the summer dayand he would sometimes invite an intruder to come and have a look at his reflection as if it were a treat  hence our opinion of his motive  not so the magician  the very way he stood and moved about and frowned at his double betrayed his state of mind while the sensitive way in which he started off to gaze out at the stern windows or have a look at the swinging barometer showed his feeling of guilt when caught in the act  anteek soon found this out and was wont to lie in wait so as to catch him in the act suddenly and with exasperating frequency  after the first excitement of arrival was over the eskimos built igloes on the shore and settled down to dismantle the vessel and take possession of her stores and of all that could be of use to them  they built an elongated oval igloe on the shore as a store to receive the lighter and as they esteemed them more valuable articles  among these were included all the axes hoopiron and other pieces of manageable metal that could be easily carried  there were also numbers of tin cans iron pots cups glass tumblers earthenware plates and other things of the kind which were esteemed a most valuable possession by people whose ordinary domestic furniture consisted chiefly of sealskin bowls and shallow stone dishes  during the few days that followed the whole colony of men women and children were busily occupied in running between the ship and the big store with loads proportioned to their strength and with joviality out of all proportion to their size for it must be borne in mind that these children of the ice had discovered not only a mine of inconceivable wealth but a mine so to speak of inexhaustible and ever recurring astonishments which elevated their eyebrows continually to the roots of their hair and bade fair to fix them there for ever  perplexities were also among the variations of entertainment to which they were frequently treated  sometimes these were more or less cleared up after the assembled wit and wisdom of the community had frowned and bitten their nails over them for several hours  others were of a nature which it passed the wit of maneskimo man at leastto unravel  a few of these like the watch had some light thrown on them by nazinred who had either seen something like them in use among the furtraders or whose sagacity led him to make a shrewd occasional guess  one object however defied the brainpower alike of indian and eskimo and no wonder for it was a wooden leg discovered by anteek in what must have been the doctors cabinor a cabin which had been used for doctors stuff and material  like letters of the alphabet given in confusion for the purpose of being formed into words this leg puzzled investigators because of their inevitable tendency to lead off on a wrong scent by assuming that the leg part was the handle of the instrument and the part for the reception of the thigh aasomething forfordoing they couldnt tell what  sitting round the stone lamp after supper some of them passed the mysterious object from hand to hand and commented on it freely  the leg was quite new so that there were no marks of any kind about it to afford a clue to its use  probably it had been made by the ships carpenter for some unfortunate member of the crew who had come by an accident and died before he could avail himself of it  suddenly the magician exclaimed  i know  i always knew that i would know if i only thought hard enough  it is a club for fighting with  when the white men go to war they always use these things  grasping it in both hands he swung it round his head and made as though he would knock oolalik down with it causing that young eskimo to shrink back in feigned alarm  that may be so said cheenbuk with serious gravity  i wonder we did not think of it before  but if so objected nazinred who always took things seriously what is the use of the hollow in its head and for what are these lines and ties fixed about it  dont you see said cheenbuk with increased seriousness after knocking your enemy down with it you pour his blood into the hollow till it is full let it freeze and then tie it up to keep it safe so that you can carry it home to let your wife see what you have done  the usual quiet glance at anteek had such an effect on that youth that he would have certainly exploded had he not been struck by an idea which displaced all tendency to laugh  i know he cried eagerly  youre all wrong it is a hat  so saying he seized the leg out of the magicians hand and thrust it on his head with the toe pointing upwards  there was a tendency to approve of this solution and the boy tying two of the straps under his chin sprang up in the pride of his discovery but his pride had a fall for the leap thrust the leg through the snow roof of the hut and the novel headdress was wrenched off as he staggered back into cheenbuks arms  despite this mishap it was received by most of those present as a probable explanation of the difficulty and afterwards anteek went proudly about wearing the wooden leg on his head  the style of cap proved rather troublesome however when he was engaged in his researches between decks for more than once forgetting to stoop low he was brought up with an unpleasant jerk  in a forest as nazinred suggested the high crest might have been inconvenient but out on the floes the unencumbered immensity of the arctic sky afforded the boy room to swagger to his hearts content  another discovery of great interest was the carpenters cabin  unlike most of the other cabins the door of this one was locked and the key gone though if it had been there no one would have guessed its use peeping in through a crack however cheenbuk saw so many desirable things that he made short work of the obstruction by plunging his weight against it  the door went down with a crash and the eskimo on the top of it  the sight that met his gaze amply repaid him however for there were collected in symmetrical array on the walls saws chisels gimlets gouges bradawls etcetera while on a shelf lay planes mallets hammers nails augersin short every variety of boring hammering and cutting implement that can be imagined  an hour after the discovery of that cabin there was not a man or boy in the tribe who was not going about with cut fingers more or less experience however very soon taught them caution  and here again the superior knowledge of nazinred came in usefully like most indians he was a man of observation  he had seen the furtraders in their workshops and had noted their tools  taking up a handsaw he seized a piece of stick and although not an expert sawed a lump off the end of it in a few seconds  as this would probably have cost an eskimo full half an hour to accomplish with his blunt knives they were suitably impressed and cheenbuk seizing the saw forthwith attempted to cut off the end of a rod of ironwith what effect it is scarcely necessary to explain  in the course of a few days the quantity of material brought on shore was so great that it was found necessary to begin a second storehouse while most of the natives were engaged on this cheenbuk and the indian continued their researches in the ship for a vast part of its deep hold still remained unexplored owing partly to the slowness of the investigation in consequence of the frequent bursts of amazement and admiration as well as the numerous discussions that ensuedall of which required time  while going more minutely into the contents of the cabin they came among other things on a variety of charts and books  have you ever seen things like these asked cheenbuk in a tone of veneration based on the belief that the indian had seen nearly everything the world contained  neverexcept that he replied pointing to a logbook the traders use things like that  they open them and make marks in them  cheenbuk immediately opened the book in question and found marksplenty of them but of course could make nothing of them even after turning them sideways and upsidedown  as the indian was equally incapable they returned the whole into the locker in which they had found them intending to carry them on shore when the new store should be ready for the reception of goods  this was unfortunate in some respects as the next chapter will show    chapter twenty nine  curiosity and presumption followed by catastrophe  most of the ablebodied men and a few of the youngsters set off next day to obtain a supply of walrus seal and muskox fleshor anything else that happened to be procurable  mrs mangivik and other ladies were left to look after the camp and prepare for the return of the men strict orders being left that no one should go on board the ship on any pretext whatever  but strict orders are not always obeyed  there was one little boy in that communitynot a bad boy but a precocious and very ambitious boy who chanced not to hear the orders given  whether he was partially deaf or purposely did not hear the orders we cannot say  this little boys chief weakness was a desire to mimic  having admired the wooden leg on anteeks head and having observed where anteek had stowed the leg away before setting off with the hunters he possessed himself of it put it on his head and strutted about the camp to the admiration and envy of all his compeers for he was a very daring and domineering boy although small  his name was doocheek  another of doocheeks weaknesses was a desire to ape the men and think himself a man in consequence  this coupled with a consuming curiosity in regard to nazinreds tobaccopipe caused him to observefor he was remarkably observantthat the indian had for the first time since he resided among them gone off on an expedition and left his pipe behind himaccidentally no doubt  doocheek watched his opportunity and secured the firebag which contained the smoking implements  stolen waters are sweet even in cold climates where all the waters freeze and the boy cast about for a secluded place in which he might enjoy the sweetness of his pipe to the full without fear of interruption  a blue cavern in an iceberg might do but the atmosphere in such caves was rather cold  under the cliffs there were many sheltered places but the juvenile members of the community were playing there and would certainly intrude  out on the floes was an exposed placeto vision as well as to wind and drift  what was left to him then but the ship  hurrying through the village in order to carry out his plans the boy encountered mrs mangivik at the entrance to her hut  where are you going doocheek demanded the woman with a look of suspicion born of frequent experience  with that spirit of ambiguous contradiction which would seem to prevail among the youth of all nations doocheek replied nowhere  it is interesting to observe how that remarkable answer seems to satisfy inquirers in nine cases out of ten everywhere  at all events mrs mangivik smiled as if she were satisfied and reentered her hut where nootka was engaged in conversation with adolay while she taught her how to make eskimo boots  did not cheenbuk forbid every one to go near the big kayak while the men were away demanded the woman  yes he did answered nootka without raising her eyesnow look here addolay  you turn the toe up this way and the heel down that way and shove your needle in so and then  i am very sure interrupted mrs mangivik that little doocheek has gone down there  theres not another little boy in the tribe but himself would dare to do it  he will lose some of his skin if he does said nootka quietly referring not to any habit of the eskimos to flay bad boys alive but to their tendency to punish the refractory in a way that was apt to ruffle the cuticle  quite indifferent to all such prospects in store for him the boy hurried on until he reached the foot of the snow staircase  it had been repaired by that time and the deck was easily gained  descending to a part of the interior which was rather darkfor the boy was aware that his deeds were evilhe sat down on a locker and opened his firebag  eskimos are not quite free from superstition  doocheek had plenty of natural courage but he was apt to quail before the supernatural  apart from the conscience which even in arctic bosoms tends to produce cowardice the strange surroundings of the placethe deep shadows merging into absolute obscurity and the feeling of mystery that attached to everything connected with the vesselall had the effect of rendering doocheeks enjoyment somewhat mixed  to look at him as he sat there glaring nervously on all sides one would have been tempted to say that his was what might be called a fearful joy  if a rat or a mouse had scurried past him at that moment he would have fled precipitately but no rat or mouse moved  probably they were all frozen and he had the place entirely to himselftoo much to himself he began at that point to wish that he had brought another little boy or even a girl with him to keep up his courage and share in his triumphant wickedness  however as nothing happened his courage began to return and he emptied the contents of the bag on the locker  he knew exactly what to do for many a time had he watched the indian fill his pipe and produce fire with flint steel and tinder  beginning with the pipe he filled it and then proceeded to strike a light  of course he found this much more difficult than he had expected  it seemed so easy in the indians handsit was so very difficult in his  after skinning his knuckles however chipping his thumbnail and knocking the flint out of his hand several times he succeeded in making the right stroke and a shower of sparks rewarded his perseverance  this was charming  the place was so dark that the sparks seemed as large and bright as stars while the darkness that followed was deeper by contrast  forgetting the pipe and tobacco in this newfound joy doocheek kept pelting away at the flint sending showers of sparks past his knees and some of them were so large that they even fell upon the deck before going out  but an abrupt stop was put to his amusement  whether it was that something or other in the sides of the ship had given way or the energetic action of the boy had shaken some fastening loose we cannot say but just as he was in the act of raising his hand for another feudejoie a shelf over his head gave way and a perfect avalanche of pots pans and noisy tin articles came down with a hideous crash on the deck  to leap from the locker like a bombshell and go straight up the hatchway like a rocket was only natural  doocheek did that as far as was compatible with flesh and blood  he could not remember afterwards by what process he reached the ice and found himself on the skirts of the village  but at that point his selfcontrol returned and he sauntered homeflushed it is true and a little winded yet with the nonchalant air of a man who had just stepped out to have a look at the weather  his conscience was rather troubled it is true when he thought of the firebag and the pipe etcetera left behind but nothing would have induced him to return for these at that time  towards evening the walrushunters returned  they had been very successful  the sledges were loaded up with the meat of several large animals so that there was a prospect of unlimited feasting for more than a week to come  now old woman said cheenbuk with cheery irreverence to his mother and with that goodnatured familiarity which is often engendered by good fortune stir up the lamps and get ready the marrowbones  regardless of lamps and marrowbones all the children of the community even to the smallest babes were sucking raw blubber as children in less favoured lands suck lollipops  had you to go far asked adolay  not far  we found them all close by and would have been back sooner but some of them fought hard and took up much time answered cheenbuk who awaited the cooking process for since he had discovered the indian girls disgust at raw meat he had become a total abstainer on the point  and he added beginning to pull off his boots if your father had not been there with the spouter we should have been out on the floes fighting still for some of the walruses were savage and hard to kill  after supper as a matter of course nazinred looked round with an air of benign satisfaction on his fine face  is my firebag behind you adolay he asked in a low voice  doocheek was present and heard the question but of course did not understand it as it was put in the dogrib tongue  the search however which immediately began induced him to retire promptly and absent himself from home for the time being  it is not here father  a more careful search was made then a most careful one but no firebag was to be found  perhaps nootka took it to her sleepingplace to keep it safe suggested old mangivik  no nootka had seen nothing of it and nootka was not a little annoyed when in spite of her assertion a search was made in her boudoir and not a little triumphant when the search proved fruitless  surely no one has taken it away said cheenbuk looking round with an expression that would have sunk doocheek through the snow into the earth if he had been there  if any one has taken it away said aglootook with a profundity of meaning in his tone that was meant to paralyse the guilty and serve as a permanent caution to the innocent something awful will happen  i dont say what but something so it will be as well to confess for im sure to find it outif not soon then in a long time  for some moments after this there was dead silence but nobody confessed and they all looked at each other as if they expected some one to go off like a cannon shot through the roof suddenly and were somewhat disappointed that no one did  by degrees they began to breathe more freely and at last some went out to seek repose in their own huts while the inmates of mangiviks dwelling began to turn in for the night  nootka and adolay retired to the boudoir and the men drawing bear or sealskins over them lay down each where he had feasted  nazinred alone remained sitting up the victim of unsatisfied craving north american indians are noted for their power to conceal their feelings and nazinred was not an exception to the rule for no sign did he betray of the longing desire for a pipe that consumed him  only a tendency to silence and a deeper solemnity than usual seemed to indicate that all was not as he would wish  at last he lay down  about an hour afterwards finding that he could not sleep he arose cast an envious glance at the peaceful slumberers around him crept through the entrance tunnel and stood erect outside with a gaze of subdued inquiry at the starry host overhead  bringing his eyes slowly down to the things of earth his gaze changed suddenly into one of wild alarm  the cause was obvious enough  when doocheek fled from the avalanche of pots and tins as before mentioned he failed to observe that one of the sparks which had filled him with delight had remained nestling and alive in a mass of cottonwaste or some such rubbish lying on the lower deck  with the tendency of sparks to increase and propagate their species this particular one soon had a large and vigorous family of little sparks around it  a gentle puff of wind made these little ones lively and induced them after the manner of little ones everywhere to scatter on exploring rambles  like juveniles too their food at first was simplea few more mouthfuls of waste and a bit of rope here and there hence their progress was slow and quiet  but time and increasing strength soon made them impatient of such light food  ere long they created a draught of their own and were blown into a flame  then some of them laid hold of some bedding while others seized upon a bulkhead and gathering courage from success they finally enveloped the tweendecks in a mass of flame  it was at this point in the business that the eyes of nazinred beheld a column of smoke rising from the aftercompanion hatch which threw his own smoking powers entirely into the shade and induced him to utter an unreasoning warwhoop that roused the eskimo tribe as if by a shock of electricity  the entire population rushed out like one man  they saw the smoke with a lurid flame licking out here and there amid the blackness and seeing the indian flying down the beach as if he were witchpossessedas indeed he wasthey uttered a united howl and made off in the same direction  fire brigades of course are unknown among the eskimos but the way in which cheenbuk improvised and organised an arctic brigade might have roused the envy even of the london force  great men are always with us though not always recognised  it requires specially great occasions to draw them forth and make them visible even to themselves  many a time in former years had cheenbuk spilt water on the cookinglamp and put it out  water at once occurred to his mind in connection with the tremendous lamp that was now fairly alight  but water was at that time locked up seven or eight feet under the solid ice  the active mind of the eskimo naturally reverted to snow ere yet he had covered the distance between ship and shore  we say naturally because he was quite aware that snow also extinguished lamps  cutting a huge block of snow with his bone knife from the beaten plain he shouted in a voice of thunder hi every one  look at me  do as i do  he shouldered the mass sprang up the snow stair and plunged down the smoking hatchway  cheenbuk and oolalik who were as quick to obey as to commandperhaps quickerfollowed their leaders example  others followed suit according to their respective natures and capacities  anteek bearing a mass nearly as big as himself also dashed below in wild excitement some of the young men tumbled their burdens of snow down the smoking hole and went back for more  even old mangivik did that as fast as his rheumatic limbs would let him  raventik reckless as usual sprang down with a mighty lump but finding the atmosphere below uncongenial hurled it towards his predecessors and sprang up again for a fresh supply watering at the eyes and choking  the poor invalid ondikik walked as hard as his fastfailing strength would permit  the women even led by the thoroughly roused cowlik bore their share in the work  the children took prompt advantage of the occasion to enjoy by far the wildest game that had ever yet been suggested to their imaginations and aglootook the magician seeing that something had come at last to verify his predictions stood by the capstan and appointed himself to the command of the upper deck brigade while the others were battling with the flames below  the battle was indeed a tough one for the fire had got a firm hold not only of the materials already mentioned but also of a mass of canvas and cordage in what must have been the sailmakers department and the smoke was growing so dense that it was becoming difficult for the firemen to breathe  here  nazinred oolalik throw the biggest lumps you can lift over there  cheenbuk pointed to what seemed a redhot spot in the dense smoke before them and set them the example by heaving a gigantic mass at the same place  a tremendous hiss came forth as the snow was converted into steam but there was no abatement in the roar of the devouring element as it licked up everything around it making the iron bolts red and though not themselves combustible assistants to combustion  more snow anteek more snow gasped cheenbuk  the boy with a mass of halfmelted snow still in his hand sprang up the ladder scarce knowing what he did and appeared on deck blackened and wildly dishevelled  aglootook was close to the opening at the moment giving sententious directions to some little boys  anteek hurled the snowmass full at his face with the force of an ardent nature intensified by contempt and sent him sprawling among the children as he leaped over the side to carry out his orders  but no energy on the part of cheenbuk and his comrades no efforts on the part of their assistants strong or feeble could avert that ships doom  ere long the smoke and heat between decks became unbearable and drove the gallant leaders back inch by inch foot by foot until they were compelled to take refuge on the upper deck when nothing more could be done to arrest the progress of the flames  they retired therefore to the quarterdeck where the whole of the eskimosmen women and childrenassembled to look on at the destruction which they could not now prevent  this is a great loss observed cheenbuk regretfully as he sat on the afterrail mopping the perspiration off his blackened face with his sleeve  it might have been a greater loss said nazinred glancing towards the wellfilled storehouses on shore  that is true but just think of what a supply of wood for spears and sledges  it would have been enough to last the lives of our childrens children if not longer  did i not tell you that something would happen said aglootook coming forward at that moment  yes and something did happen said old mangivik though i could not see how it happened for the smoke  did not a lump of snow fly in your face and knock you over among the children  the magician ignored the question altogether and turning to cheenbuk asked if he thought there was yet any chance of saving the ship  not unless you manage to send some of your magic down and stop the fire  that is not possible returned the other with a wisely grave look i can do much but i cannot do that  as he spoke a fresh roar of the fire up the hatchway attracted attention  gathering strength it burst up in a bright flame showing that the quarterdeck could not long remain a place of security  suddenly nazinred showed signs of excitement which were very unusual in him  fighting the walrus or bear or battling with the fire had never produced such an expression as crossed his face while he cast a hasty glance round on the women and children whose forms were by that time lit up by the dull red glow that issued from the column of smoke  cheenbuk he said in a low voice the black stuff that i put in my spouter is kept by traders in round thingsi forget the name  if there is one of these round things here and it catches fire we shall every one of us with the ship be sent up to the stars  the remark was meant to reach the ear of the leader alone but several of those around heard it and a wild rush was instantly made for the snow stair amid feminine and juvenile shrieks  aglootook incontinently hurled himself over the side and fell on his hands and knees on the ice where an opportune snowdrift saved him  most of the party ran or leaped out of the threatened danger  does not my father think that we should go asked cheenbuk who began to feel uneasy as a fresh burst of flame set fire to the canvas awning and made the place they stood on unpleasantly hot  yes my son he does replied nazinred but it does not become men to run from danger  so saying he began to move as if in a funeral procession closely followed by cheenbuk oolalik and old mangivik  as they reached the head of the staircase something like an explosion occurred for the deck was partially burst up by the heat  the three eskimos who did not think their dignity affected by haste leaped down the stair in two bounds but nazinred did not alter his walk in the least  step by step he descended deliberately and walked in stolid solemnity to the spot on which the community had assembled as a place of safety  they did not speak much after that for the sight was too thrilling and too novel to admit of conversation  shouts and exclamations alone broke forth at intervals  the danger to which they had been exposed while on the quarterdeck became more apparent when a clear bright flame at length shot upwards and catching some of the ropes ran along and aloft in all directions  hitherto the fire had been much smothered by its own smoke and the want of air below but now that it had fairly burst its bonds and got headway it showed itself in its true character as a fierce and insatiable devourer of all that came in its way  catching hold of the awning over the deck it swept fore and aft like a billow creating such heat that the spectators were forced to retreat to a still safer distance  from the awning it licked round the masts climbed them caught the ropes and flew up them sweeping out upon the yards to their extreme ends so that in a few minutes the ship was ablaze from hold to truck and stem to stern  then the event which nazinred had referred to occurred  the flames reached the powder magazine  it exploded and the terrified natives yelled their feelings while the entire structure went up into the heavens with a roar to which the loudest thunder could not compare and a sheet of intense light that almost blinded them  the explosion blew out every fork of flame great and small and left an appalling blackness by contrast while myriads of redhot fragments fell in a shower on the ice and rebounded from it like evil spirits dancing around the tremendous wreck that they had caused  fortunately the eskimos were beyond the range of the fiery shower  when they ventured with awestricken looks to approach the scene of the catastrophe only a yawning cavern in the floe remained to tell of the stately vessel that had thus ended her final voyage    chapter thirty  a declaration an interruption and a great fight  the loss which the eskimos sustained in the destruction of the ship was in one sense considerable for the woodwork about her would have been of immense value to them nevertheless their gains in what had already been stored were very great so that they were able to regard their losses with philosophic composure  the weeks that followedweeks of ever increasing light and warmthwere spent in examining and sorting their material into packages suitable for transport on sledges to their summer quarters at waruskeek  and here again the knowledge possessed by nazinred of the habits and implements of the white men was of great service  adolay also helped to instruct for when among the sailmakers tools they found a number of the finer sort of needles and threads as well as a few feminine thimbles so to speak she was able to show the women at once how to use them and thus saved them from the trouble of puzzling out the matter for themselves  what is this asked anteek of nazinred one day presenting a file which he had just picked up  that is a thing replied the indian who being ignorant of the names of most tools got over the difficulty by calling all objects thingsthat is a thing made for cutting iron with rubbing it down and cutting it short  it cuts things that are too hard for a knife  i think returned the boy regarding it attentively we might try it on aglootooks nose  that wants cutting short and rubbing down too for it seems very hard to look at it  nazinred did not smile  he was slow to understand a joke  perhaps he thought it a poor one but cheenbuk appreciated it and met it with the suggestion that an axe might be more effective  they were gravely debating this point in front of the snow stores when ondikik came up and asked when it was likely that a start would be made for home as he styled their old winter village  go and ask mangivik  when he gives the order im ready said cheenbuk  dont say a word to aglootook said anteek as the young man turned to go he will be sure to say that something will happen if you do  yes and as something always does happen remarked cheenbuk hes sure to be right the moosquat  moosquat seemed to be used as a term of extreme contempt it may not therefore be incorrect to translate ithumbug  on being consulted old mangivik who was generally credited with being weatherwise and intelligent gave it as his opinion that as the things from the white mans kayak were all ready packed on the sledges and the weather was very warm and the days were growing long and the ice and snow were melting fast the sooner they set out the better  aglootook coincided with that opinion because he had been led to the same conclusion some days before chiefly in consequence of profound thought during the dark hours of night  and if we dont start off now he added at the end of a portentous oration no one can tell what will happensomething fearful i know though of course it is not possible to say what  as no one felt disposed to object the preparations were hurried forward and soon after the whole tribe went off on the return journey leaving behind them a black and yawning gulf in the arctic solitude where so lately a noble ship had been  arrived at the old village these lively and energetic nomads occupied themselves during the brief remainder of winter and the early spring in securely hiding the goods of which they had become possessed excepting such light portions as they meant to carry along with them to their summer retreat  among these were a number of bows spears and arrows made from the wood of the burnt vessel with cleverly adapted iron heads filed to fine sharp points and burnished until they glittered in the light  of knives and axes there were also sufficient to equip most of the young men and those for whom there were none made to themselves pretty good knives out of pieces of hoopiron  when at last the ocean currents and summer heat broke up the solid floes and set the icebergs free to resume their majestic southward course our eskimos put their sledges en cache got out kayaks and oomiaks and wielding both the short and the long paddle started off towards the southwest in the direction of waruskeeksome of the tribe however with a few of the old people remaining behind  now adolay we are going to take you home said cheenbuk the day they started while walking with her towards the oomiak in which she was to take her seat and a paddle  will the indian girl be glad to leave us  the faintest possible tinge of red suffused her cheek as she dropped her eyes and replied  she will be glad to get home  when you have got home and stayed for a time with your people returned cheenbuk who was usually blunt and tothepoint in his conversation will you come away with me and be my womanmy squaw he added accommodating his words to the indian vocabulary  i cannot leave my mother answered the maiden in a low voice  that is good returned the gallant eskimo but cheenbuk can leave his mother and his father too  if i go and live with the menofthewoods will you be my squaw  adolay with downcast eyes gave no answer  it is said that silence gives consent  we are ignorant as to arctic opinion on this point but before light could be thrown on the subject anteek came rushing round the corner of a stranded berg with the exclamation  hoi  cheenbukhere you are  we thought you must have got into the teeth of a walrus or the arms of a bear  cheenbuk frowned savagely caught anteek by his nether garments and the nape of his neck and lifting him high above his head seemed about to dash him on the ground  but instead he replaced him gently on his feet and with a benignant smile told him to run down to the shore and put his kayak in the water so as to be ready for him  anteek who was obedience personified hastened away at once rubbing his nether garments and sorely perplexed as to the strange spirit which seemed so suddenly to have taken possession of the friend he so ardently idolised  it was arranged that nazinred being unaccustomed to the eskimo kayak should voyage with the women in one of the oomiaks  to a younger brave this might have been regarded as an undignified position but to a man of his years and tried experience it was only a subject for a passing smile  but the indian did not accept the position of an idle passenger although inexpert in the use of the twobladed paddle and the light kayak he was thoroughly capable of using the womens paddle with the single blade as it bore much resemblance in shape and size to that used in his native canoe  he therefore quietly assumed the post of steersman in the oomiak which contained madam mangivik nootka the easygoing cowlik the gentle rinka adolay and a variety of children and babies the young man oolalik in defiance of immemorial custom also took a seat and a paddle in that oomiakout of pure hospitality of course and for the sole purpose of keeping their guest company  nootka said nothing but she seemed amused as well as pleased at the innovation  so were the children for oolalik was a prime favourite with young as well as old  old uleeta was the captain of another of the oomiaks and it was observed that aglootook cast longing and frequent glances in her direction believing no doubt that a place by her side would be an easier berth than in his own kayak with nothing but the strength of his own lazy arm to urge it on but as there was no guest in this case to justify the breach of ancient custom on the ground of hospitality he felt that manhood required him to stay where he was  it was a pretty sight the starting of the little flotilla on a brilliant spring morning with the sea as calm as a millpond fantastic masses of white ice floating about in all directions and mountainous bergs here and there giving dignity as well as variety by their size and lightgreen sides and deep blue caverns to a scene which might otherwise have been too suggestive of weddingcake  seals walruses seabirds and numerous denizens of the deep and air were sporting about in fearless indifference to the presence of their great enemy man but these were unheeded until hunger began to affect the eskimo  then the war began with its usual resultthe survival of the fittest  one day however there was a battle in which it came about that the tables were almost turned and the survival as regards the animals very nearly reversed  it happened thus  we have already referred to the ferocity of the walrus when attacked as a rule man is the assailant  sometimes however the monster of the arctic deep assumes the offensive  on the occasion we are about to describe the attack was made in force  the day had been brilliantly fine  the bergs had absolutely duplicated and inverted themselves by reflection so that the sunlit pinnacles became submarine fires and refraction stepped in to reverse and as it were shatter the floes on the horizon while three mock suns glowed in the heavens at the same timethus making the beautiful confusion still more exquisitely confounded  walrus said cheenbuk pointing with the end of his long paddle in the direction of a large berg just ahead of them  nazinred who was close alongside of him ceased to paddle and shaded his eyes with his hand  so did his crew  the whole flotilla ceased to paddle and skimmed slowly along for some moments in dead silence  then aglootook in virtue of his office and presumption spoke in a low voice  let us pull softly and speak not at all  there are plenty of beasts wonders shall be done today if you attend to what i say  they all acted on his advice whether they heard it or not for eskimos need no caution to be wary and silent when approaching a herd of walruses  there appeared to be at least a hundred animals lying sunning themselves on the various icelumps into which the floes were broken up  on one mass about half a mile off there were some twenty rolling about and grunting comfortably to each other  towards these the flotilla slowly drifted for the dipping of the paddles could scarcely be seen and was quite noiseless  by slow degrees they drew near and then the oomiaks hung back with the exception of that steered by nazinred who had got his firespouter ready while oolalik stood in the bow harpoon in hand and lance ready by his side  the women were not expected to take part in the actiononly to look onbut all the men in kayaks advanced while these last went on towards the main herd our indian steered straight for the icecake on which the largest number lay and as they drew near the extreme ugliness of the creatures faces and black heads became very apparent  there was an old bull with tusks not far short of three feet long among the herd  beside him was a young bull which seemed from his wicked expression to be screwing up his courage to assault the old one  the rest were females and young ones of various ages down to what seemed the very last walrus baby  those that were grown up had bristling moustaches like porcupinequills on their flat lips and the young ones had tusks in different degrees of developmentexcept the baby whose head resembled an illshaped football  they did not seem in the least afraid of the approaching oomiak perhaps they thought it a very dirty piece of ice covered with rather grotesque seals  at all events although they looked at it they went on with their mooing and rolling about quite regardless of it until oolalik sent his harpoon deep into the side of one of the cows  then indeed there was tremendous roaring and confusion as the whole herd tumbled off the ice raft into the sea  the splash sent a cataract of spray over the eskimos and no wonder for the old bull was full sixteen feet long with barrelbulk equal to a hogshead  some of the others were not much smaller  the harpoon thrown was attached to a short line to the end of which an inflated sealskin was fastened for the purpose of forming a drag on the animal harpooned and by coming to the surface showing its whereabouts  but on this occasion the creatures required no such contrivance to bring them up for no sooner were the two bulls in their native element than they uttered a horrible succession of roars and made straight for the oomiak  a rip in the side of the skin boat would have been fatal or if one of the animals were to hook on to it with his tusks an upset would be certain  oolalik therefore grasped his long lance while nazinred steered so as to keep the bow endon to the assailants  another moment and oolalik dealt the oldest bull a thrust in the neck that sent it back roaring  the cry seemed to be a summons for answering cries were heard all round and the walruses were seen to be converging towards their savage old chief  meanwhile the young bull had reached the right side of the oomiak where cowlik sat with an easygoing look on her placid face admiring the scene  nazinred was so intent on keeping the craft right that he failed to notice it until its ugly head and ponderous tusks rose above the gunwale  but cowlik proved equal to the occasion  the easygoing look vanished and the end of her paddle went into the throat of the brute with a thrust so vigorous that the boat was driven to one side and the tusks missed their mark  at the same moment adolay who sat close to her grasped her paddle like a doublehanded sword and brought it down with surprising force on the creatures left eye  a shot from the firespouter followed the ball entered the same eye reached the brain and the young bull sank to rise no more  the indian reloaded as fast as he could but not in time for another charge from the old bull which oolalik met with a stab in the side that again turned him off bellowing  a still younger bull anxious perchance to win its spurs took advantage of the situation and made a dash at the opposite side but nootka sent about two feet of her paddle down its throat which induced it to reconsider its intentions  just then a loud report told that the spouter was again to the front this time the ball took effect on the old bulls forehead and remained there  it neither killed nor stunned though it probably surprised it for it sheered off permanently and all the rest of the herd went away to sea along with it  after this unexpected and dangerous encounter was over it was found that several other animals were splashing about in a dying state or fast to sealskin buoys which the men in the kayaks had managed to affix to them  one of these was closely followed up by anteek who had very cleverly launched his harpoon  aglootook was also seen to be struggling with a buoy which he was trying to haul in  keep off he cried in great excitement when old mangivik paddled to his assistance i have lanced it twice  i need no help  see the water is full of blood  that is my beast you are fighting remarked oolalik as the oomiak came up  look at the float it is mine  the magician looked crestfallen  he had hoped probably to kill the wounded animal secure it to his kayak and cast loose the buoy so that no one could claim it  he made the most of the situation however by asserting stoutly that if he had not lanced it well it would certainly have broken loose from the buoy  when the whole party was assembled on a large floe cutting up and stowing away the meat some of the younger men began to comment on the success of the hunt and to congratulate themselves on the large supply of fresh provisions which they had secured  did i not tell you said aglootook who appeared to be superintending the workers that wonders would be done today  you did replied cheenbuk gravely and one of the greatest wonders was that you managed to lance a walrus  it was indeed a great wonder returned the magician with a smile of supreme satisfaction for i was not hunting at all at the timeonly looking on by way of encouraging the young men  it just came in my way and i killed it easily in passing  if i had been really hunting then indeed he added with solemn emphasis you would have seen something to astonish you  i have no doubt of that remarked cheenbuk  at the same moment anteek went off into an explosion of laughter which he accounted for by pointing at a babywalrus which had just put its head out of the water with an expression of surprise on its innocent face that clearly indicated its inability to understand what was going on    chapter thirty one  an expedition and a disappointment  a few days later the whole tribe arrived at their summer quarters and no civilised family of boys and girls ever arrived at their seaside home with a more genuine expression of noisy delight than that with which those eskimos took possession of the turfmudandstonebuilt huts of waruskeek  it was not only the children who thus let loose their glee  the young men and maidens also began to romp round the old dwellings in the pure enjoyment of ancient memories and present sunshine while the elders expressed their satisfaction by looking on with approving nods and occasional laughter  even old mangivik so far forgot the dignity of his advanced age as to extend his right toe when anteek was rushing past and trip up that volatile youth causing him to plunge headlong into a bush which happened to grow handy for his reception  nazinred alone maintained his dignity but so far condescended to harmonise with the prevailing spirit as to smile now and then  as for adolay she utterly ignored the traditions of her people and romped and laughed with the best of them to the great delight of nootka who sometimes felt inclined to resent her stately ways  cheenbuk adopted an intermediate course sometimes playing a practical joke on the young men at other times entering into grave converse with his indian guest aglootook of course stuck to his own role  he stood on a bank of sand which overlooked the whole and smiled gracious approval as though he were the benignant father of a large family whom he was charmed to see in the enjoyment of innocent mirth  cheenbuk soon formed his plans for the future and laid them before the elders of the tribe the same evening after supperat that period when poor nazinred would have been enjoying his pipe if that implement had not been blown with all his tobacco and tinder into the arctic sky  it is but just to the indian to add that he took his heavy loss in a philosophical spirit and had by that time quite got over the craving insomuch that he began to wonder why he had ever come under the sway of such a taste  now said cheenbuk with an air of decision listen to my plans  hoi ho exclaimed every one especially aglootook who added hay in a peculiar tone thus giving him leave as it were to talk as much as he pleased  you all know that i have promised to take adolay back to her own home and you know that i never break my promises  it is therefore my intention to set off to the whale river after two suns have gone round the sky  hoi exclaimed some of the young men with looks of surprise at such promptitude  we may observe here that in those regions the sun in summer describes nearly an unbroken circle in the sky and that cheenbuks reference was to the next two days  i will take with me as many men and women as choose to go but no children  we will take our spears and bows to procure food but not to fight for i go to make friends with the firespouters and the white traders  so if any one wants to fighthe looked at raventik here but that fireeater happened to be absentminded at the moment and sat with downcast eyesto fight he repeated with emphasis he will have to remain at home and fight the walrusor the women  a faint ho here indicated a desire for more  nazinred says he is sure his people will be glad to meet us  i am sure we shall be glad to meet his people  what will happen after that i cannot tell  something will certainly happen murmured aglootook as if holding converse with his own spirit or with his familiar  i know it i am sure of it  i tell you all beforehand  and you will accompany us said cheenbuk turning to the magician with a nod of approval  when we go on an errand of peace we need our wisest men with us men whose knowledge and experience will make the firespouters think much of us and men who dont like fighting  now then continued the eskimo turning again to the young men who will go  i shall not allow any to go who are not quite willing  there was no lack of volunteers  the party was then and there arranged and two days later they set out on their mission a goodly band in kayaks and oomiaks  the weather continued fine the days were long islets for campingplaces were numerous and in process of time the party reached the mouth of the whaleotherwise greygooseriver which they began to ascend  oh exclaimed adolay with glistening eyes as she looked from bank to bank i know it so wellalmost every bush and tree  and you love it said nootka  yes yes is it not my own country  nootka sighed  i wish i could love my country like you but your country sticks  mine melts awaymost of itevery hot suntime and it is not easy to care much for things that melt  but waruskeek does not melt said adolay sympathetically  that is true returned nootka as if pleased to think of something solid round which her affections might entwine but we stay such a short time thereonly while the hot suntime lasts and i have not time to get very fond of itnot so as to make my eyes open and my cheeks grow red like yours  then you must come and live with me and love my country said the indian girl in a patronising tone  what and forsake oolalik exclaimed the eskimo maiden with heightened colour and flashing eyes  no never  he will not melt what ever else does  right nootka exclaimed adolay with a laugh  it would take a very hot sun indeed to melt oolalik  but perhaps the whole tribe will stay in my country  i think that cheenbuk will get us over this difficulty it is wonderful what can be done by a man with a determined mind like cheenbuk  yes some of us eskimos have very determined minds said nootka complacently  adolay laughed lightly  and dont you think that some of the firespouters have also a good deal of determinationespecially one of them who left the lodges of his people and wandered over the great salt lake all alone in search of his child  you speak truth returned nootka with a pleasant nod  ill tell you what i think both our nations are very determinedvery  having come to this satisfactory conclusion the maidens relapsed into general conversation  but a disappointment was in store which none of the party had counted on  when the village of the firespouters was reached not a soul was to be seen  the tentpoles remained and the ashes of the hearths were still there but the ashes were cold and not a man woman or child remainednot even a dog  nazinred and adolay hurried at once along the wellknown footpath which led to the spot where their own wigwam had stood but the place was deserted  as in the case of all the other lodges only the bare poles according to custom were leftthe coverings having been carried away  father and child looked at each other for some time in silent dismay it was a terrible homecomingso different from what each had been fondly anticipating  the anxious father had strode on in advance of the eskimo party but cheenbuk had followed  he hung back a little from feelings of delicacy as they neared the old home and was much moved when he saw irrepressible tears flowing from the eyes of adolay  have enemies been in the camp he asked when they had contemplated the scene for some minutes in silence  no enemies have not been here answered the indian  there is no blood on the ground no sign of a struggle  the tentpoles are not thrown down the ashes of the fires have not been scattered  this would not have been so if there had been a fight  keep up heart adolay he added turning to the weeping girl no evil can have come to our people for they have left of their own will for a new camp but i am perplexed for this is the best place in all the dogrib lands for a village and we had lived long here in contentment  but if that be so there must be good reason for their having left suggested cheenbuk  good reasonyes the menofthewoods never act without good reason  my father may be perplexed about reasons continued the eskimo but surely he will have no difficulty in finding his people for are not the menofthewoods good at following up a trail  truly you say what is true  it will be easy to find and follow the trail of a whole tribe returned nazinred with a smile  but it is disappointing to find that they have forsaken the old place and it may be many days before we find them  father exclaimed adolay at this point a bright look overspreading her features mother must have left some sign on a piece of bark as i did at waruskeek  i had expected as much said the indian looking round the camp and i had thought to find it here  not here returned the girl with a soft laugh you dont know mother as well as i do  there is a tree under the shade of which she and i used to work when the days were long  if there is a message anywhere it is there  she bounded away as she spoke like a fawn and in a few minutes returned with a piece of bark in her hand  here it is father  i knew it would be there  let us sit down now and make it out  sitting down beside the cold hearth of the old home father and child began to spell out isquays letter while cheenbuk looked on in admiring silence and listened  the letter bore a strong family likeness to that which had formerly been writtenor drawnby adolay at waruskeek showing clearly whence the girl had derived her talent  the hand at the top points the way clear enough said the indian but were you careful to observe the direction before you moved it  of course i was father  im not a baby now returned the girl with a laugh and a glance at cheenbuk  that you certainly are not thought the eskimo with a look of open admiration  it pointed there she continued extending her hand in a northwesterly direction  the ukon river flows there returned nazinred thoughtfully as he traced the various parts of the letter with his forefinger  is that river better than the greygoose one asked cheenbuk  no  it is as goodnot better replied the indian in an absent mood adolay this piece of bark carries some strange news  here we have the whole tribe starting off for the ukon with all their tents provisions and everything in sledges  so they left in the cold season  yes father interrupted adolay knitting her pretty brows as she earnestly scanned the letter but dont you see the line of geese flying over the treetops  that shows that it was at the beginning of the warm time  adolay is the worthy daughter of a dogrib chief said nazinred patting the girls shoulder  i hope shell be the worthy wife of an eskimo youth some day thought cheenbuk but as usual he said nothing  and look here father continued adolaywhat do they mean by having all their snowshoes slung on their guns instead of on their feet  it means that the snow was very soft beginning to melt and it was easier to tramp through it without snowshoes than with them  i hope they have been careful for there is great danger in crossing lakes and rivers at such a time of the year  no fear of danger said adolay with a laugh when magadar leads the way  dont you see him there in front  mother knows how to draw facesonly his nose is too long  that is to show that he is the guide observed nazinred  did you not do the very same thing yourself when you made cheenbuks nose far too longfor the same purpose  adolay laughed heartily at this and cheenbuk joined her feeling his nose at the same time as if to make sure that its handsome proportions were not changed  and looklook father resumed the girl growing excited over the letter that is your friend mozwa  i feel sure of it by the shape of his legs  who could mistake his legs  nobody is like mother  she does legs as well as faces  but what is that on his wifes backnot a new baby surely  why not my child  poor man sighed adolay  he had enough to provide for before  poor woman thought cheenbuk but he maintained a discreet silence  of course it was decided to follow up the trail of the tribe without delay  as nazinred had surmised it was easily found and not difficult to follow  that night however the party encamped round the hearths of the deserted village    chapter thirty two  an unexpected meeting  the brief summer had fled and autumn with its bright sunshine and invigorating frosts had returned to the far north when one day during that short delightful period styled the indian summer our friend macsweenie and his inseparable henchman mowat sauntered down to the beach in front of the new fort  iss it here the canoe wass lyin tonal  ay yonder it is just beyond the palin bottom up  man this iss fine weatherwhatever  it is that replied mowat who could hardly have replied otherwise for the fact did not admit of a doubt  there was an intense brilliancy yet a hazy softness in the air which was particularly exhilarating  trumpeting wildgeese piping plover the whistling wings of wildducks and the notes of other innumerable feathered tribes large and small were filling the woods and swamps with the music of autumnal revelry as they winged their way to southern lands  every view was beautiful all the sounds were cheerful  an absolute calm prevailed so that the lakelike expanse in front of the fort formed a perfect mirror in which the cliffs and brilliant foliage of the opposite banks were clearly reflected  we will go down to the bend o the ruver said macsweenie as they launched their canoe an hide in the bushes there  it iss a grand spote for birds to fly over an theres plenty o ducks an geese so we may count on soon gettin enough to fill the larder to overflow  ay theres plenty o birds remarked mowat with the absent air of a man whose mind is running on some other theme  macsweenie was a keen sportsman and dearly loved a day with his gun as a boy on his own highland hills he had been addicted to sporting a good deal without the formality of a licence and the absolute freedom from conventional trammels in the wild north was a source of much gratulation to him  perhaps he enjoyed his outings all the more that he was a stern disciplinarianso deeply impressed with a sense of duty that he would neither allow himself nor his men to indulge in sport of any kind until business had been thoroughly disposed of  it hes often seemed to me he said steering towards the bend of the river above referred to that ceevilisation was a sort o mistake  did ye ever think o that tonal  i cant say that i ever did  but if it is a mistake its a very successful oneto judge from the way it has spread  that iss true tonal an mores the peety  i cannot but think that man was meant to be a huntin animal and to get his victuals in that way  what for wass he gifted wi the power to hunt if it wass not so an think what enjoyment he hes in the chase until ceevilisation takes all the speerit out o him  hm  it never took the speerit out o me whatever  maybe there wasnt enough o ceevilisation in the place where you was brought up suggested the interpreter  ha ye hev me there tonal returned the trader with a short laugh weel i must admit that yere not far wrong  the muddle o the grampians iss but a wildish place an it wass there my father had his sheepfarm an that i first made the acquaintance o the muircock an the grouse  o man but theres no place like the heeland hills after a though the wildwoods here iss not that bad  tonal man catch hold o that bush an draw close in to the bank  theres a flock comin an theyre fleein low  the last words were spoken in a hoarse whisper for they had just turned the bend of the river and macsweenie had caught sight of a flock of wildgeese flying low as he said and crossing over the land which at that place jutted out into the stream  mowat though naturally sluggish was quick in action when circumstances required him to be so  the canoe was drawn close under an overhanging bush and quite concealed by it  the two men laying down the paddles took up their guns and examined the priming to see that it was dry long before the flock drew near  then they sat motionless and silent crouching a little and looking upwards  the unsuspicious flock of wildgeese came over the point in that curious angular formation in which they usually travelan old grey gander as usual leading  a deep trumpetnote now and then told of their approach  then the soft stroke of their great wings was heard  next moment the flock appeared over the edge of the bush that concealed their human foes  at the same instant sportsmen and geese beheld each other the guns flew to the shoulders of the former the angle was thrown into dire confusion and the woods and cliffs reverberated with two shots which crashed forth at the same moment  trumpeting and screaming the scattered flock passed on and the hunters pushed out from the bank to pick up two plump birds which lay dead upon the water  but those two shots did more than carry death and confusion into the ranks of the grey geese  they caused surprise and something like wild excitement in the hearts of a number of eskimos who in their kayaks happened to be at that moment pushing up the ukon river pioneered by a birchbark canoe which was propelled by an indian man and woman  submitting to authority while among the icefloes of the polar seas nazinred had as we have seen consented to take his place humbly among the women and children in one of the oomiaks  anteek and one of his companions were permitted to paddle the birchbark canoe to their very great satisfaction until whale river was reached  but the moment the party entered on the lakes and rivers of the land nazinred ordered adolay to take the bow paddle of his native craft himself took the steering paddle and from that moment he had quietly assumed the office of guide to the expedition  firespouters exclaimed cheenbuk on hearing the shots of the traders guns  yesmy countrymen replied nazinred  the kayak of cheenbuk was about half a length behind the canoe else the eskimo would have seen that though the indians voice was low and calm his black eyes glittered with excitement  it is not like the gun of the dogribs remarked adolay glancing back at her father  why does adolay think so  because there is too much noise  you have yourself told me father that the indian uses a smaller charge both of powder and shot than the white trader as he cannot afford to waste it  i never heard the guns of our men speak so loud  perhaps we are going to meet white men  the chief regarded his daughter with a pleased smile and a look of pride  adolay observes well he said she is like her mother  the sound was loud because the charges were bigalso because two guns were fired at once  i heard only one returned the girl  that is because you have not heard much firing of guns  adolay is not yet as old as her father  the traders from the great fresh lake must have come to our land and that is the reason why our people have forsaken the old home  as he spoke the flotilla rounded a point on the river and came in sight of macsweenies canoe making for the land after having picked up the geese  an impartial observer would not have found it easy to determine which party expressed more surprise  firespouters shouted the new arrivals  eskimos exclaimed mowat  savitcheswhatever said macsweenie  wow but this iss goot luck gif way my boy an we will meet them more than halfway  suddenly the trader ceased to paddle and raised a hand to shade his eyes from the sun  tonal man he growled with a gaelic expletive which it is impossible to spell iss that a birchbark canoe that i am seein  it is that answered the interpreter an i do believe thatthat  man  tonal interrupted the trader as he dipped his paddle violently into the water  its wishin i am that i may never see the grampians again in this world if yon iss not nazinred himself wi his daater in the bow  it iss my belief there will be rechoicing in the dogrib camp this nightthough wi such a band o eskimos there will be no small risk o fechtin also  by this time the canoe and flotilla were so near that nazinred recognised the trader and threw up a hand in salutation whereupon macsweenie and mowat taking off their caps treated the party to a rousing british cheer which was so congenial to the lively eskimos that they burst into a sympathetic howl mingled with laughter and some fair attempts to imitate the cheer while they splashed up the water with their paddles and otherwise conducted themselves jovially  of course nazinred would not condescend to conduct so undignified but in his way he expressed great satisfaction at the happy meeting  then all the paddles were dipped again with vigour and the whole party made for the fortthe two canoes leading    chapter thirty three  the last  i will be thinkin said macsweenie to mowat that it will be safer for our two canoes to go first to the fort an leave the eskimos behind the point till we warn the indians o their arrival for there iss no knowin what these fiery savitches may do if their old enemies come on them all of a sudden  tell nazinred that  the interpreter obeyed and as the chief was of the same opinion a halt was called cheenbuk was consulted and ultimately the eskimos in their kayaks were left concealed behind the nearest point below the fort while the two canoes advanced side by side  we will take them by surprise tonal  im fond o givin people a surprise said macsweenie in an undertone as they drew near to the little wharf that had been run out from the land in front of the main building  a few indians were watching the arrival with some curiosity  but there was one passenger in nazinreds canoe who cared little for interfering with human plansnamely attim whose shaggy head rested on the gunwale as he gazed and snuffed anxiously  the moment the canoes came within a few yards of the shore the excited dog plunged over the side with a huge bound  he was a magnificent swimmer and reached the land in a few seconds  springing up the bank he shook a shower from his sides and bounded into the bushes with the certain knowledge no doubt that he had reached home at last and that his faithful nose would not fail to guide him to the tent of isquay  o ye rascal growled macsweenie youve let the cat out o the bag for i make no doubt that every man an wummin o the tribe knows you by sight  and the highlander was right for in a few minutes the whole camp was roused and the sight of the dog told them that nazinred had come back but had he found his daughter  that was a point which every one who could walk run or hobble hurried to the wharf to ascertain  but the point was cleared up sooner than they expected for before they reached the wharf a graceful figure was seen to be bounding through the bushes apparently in hot pursuit of the dog  immediately after that a treble scream was heard to issue from a coppice behind the fort  it was followed by an equally treble squeal with a bass accompaniment of barking  no one took the trouble to inquire the cause of this for they knew somehow intuitively  as we have said more than once it is unusual for north american indians to demonstrate but isquay and adolay were like nazinred in advance of their times and were in the habit of snapping their fingers in the hideous face of the red indian mrs grundy  meanwhile macsweenie and his man were informing the indians at the wharf that a band of their old foes the eatersofrawflesh were at that moment lying on the other side of the point in their kayaks  the news was received with surprise not unmingled with frowns  every one looked at nazinred inquiringly but that astute red man was engaged in profound contemplation of the clouds  moreover said the trader your old prisoner who gave you the slip and ran away with adolay is among them  then cried magadar starting forward we will get our guns and go after them  the young men have long wished for a chance of revenge  the young men hev wished for nothing o the sort cried macsweenie with a fierce expression in his blue eyes that was very impressive there iss no wan here wants to fecht but yourself magadar but i will not disappoint ye  if you must fecht wi some wan ye shall fecht wi me  but it iss jokin ye arecome now men these eskimos hev come here on a veesit an full well do i know that theres not an indian tribe in all the land equal to the dogribs for hospitality so youll go and get ready a feast for our veesitors an ill gie you some goot things out o the store to help it  whatever magadar thought about this address he shrouded his feelings behind an air of impenetrable and stern reserve for he saw that the young men sympathised with the trader  nazinred also in a few words helped to confirm their sympathy by telling them that the eatersofrawflesh were not a warparty but had brought some of their women and old people along with them  the end of it was that a shot was fired as a preconcerted signal for the eskimos to advance  in a few minutes the kayaks and oomiaks came sweeping round the point and made straight for the landingplace  the reception of the menoftheice by the traders was of course hearty and sincere but the hereditary illwill of the indians was not quite overcome at the first  it was not until there had been several meetings and a feast in the fort and donald mowats violin had exercised its soothing influence on the savage breasts that harmony was produced in some degree between the two parties  at length macsweenie began to see his way to the establishment of a permanent peace and he made arrangements to have a great palaver a solemn treaty and a grand feast in connection with it  you must know tonal he said one evening when in consultation with his interpreter in the privacy of his own room i hev got a plan in my head which iss calcoolated to make things go smooth if anything will  he paused rather a long time and as mowat looked at him in expectation of hearing more it struck him that the deepened bronze on his chiefs face and the slight motion of his shoulders indicated suppressed laughter  but the orkneyman was much too sedate a character to express undue curiosity  he waited patiently  yes tonal said the trader taking a few whiffs of the long clay pipe which was his usual evening comforter i hev a plan and strange as it may seem to an unsentimental man like you love is at the bottom of it  well you might have a worse foundation returned mowat with something of goodnatured cynicism on his rugged face  yes continued macsweenie that iss at the bottom of itat least weemen are an thats the same thing  mowat shook his head doubtfully  im not so sure o that he said no doubt women have a good deal to do wi lovebut theyre hardly the same thing  weel tonal we will not fall out on that point tonight for i hev got no leisure to dispute  another time we may tackle it but i hev other fish to fry just now an we must begin this very night wi a grand palaver  after a few more vigorous whiffs and a frown indicative of intense thought the trader continued  i hev no doubt tonal that you hev observed the curious and if i may say so extensive variety of lovemakin that has broken out in the camp since the arrival o these eskimos  i cant say that i have returned mowat gravely  wow man for a fuddler ye exhibit a most extraordinary want o perception in the more delicate affairs o human life  well well it is strange  but i hev observed it an im goin to turn it to account if i can  you must know that i hev been troubled in my thoughts about that warlike fellow magadar for as you know he was sweet upon the girl adolay before she was carried off by the eskimo an cheenbuk is such a strong and bold lad that i felt sure there would be mischief between the two about her but to my surprise an satisfaction magadar hes gone over head an ears wi that little eskimo girl cowlik who must i think hev been born in an easygoing frame of mind which seems to hev stuck to her ever since and to hev gone on increasing with her years  then as we all know our indian alizay has for long been efter the girl idazoo theres no accountin for taste tonal  i would sooner be married to a ships figurehead myself but thats his lookout whatever  i hev also observeddeed it would be difficult not to observethat the man oolalik iss castin sheepseyes at that girl nootka  all this hes impressed me so much that i hev set myself to observe more closely than im used to do in such matters and i hev discovered two more cases namely that poor young eskimo that was wounded in the last fecht but seems to be slowly recovering  they call him ondikik and he would hev kicked altogether if it had not been for the nursinso they sayo that nice little craitur they call rinka or something like that  the other case is that lively stripling anteek  hes scarcely more than a boy yet but young uleeta as they call the girl seems to think that no great objection  now tonal my plan iss to marry them all offhand on the same day you know that by virtue of my poseetion in the service i am empowered to perform the marriage ceremony  of course as a christian man i would not fail to impress them with the fact that no real marriage can take place without the blessin o their manitou but i think that the readin o the marriage service over them may impress them favourably an help in the caause of peace and gootwill  it shall be tried whatever so you had better go an get your fuddle in order an send the cook to me  that night macsweenie had the central hall of his fort lighted up and called together a united council of the indians and eskimos  my friends he said after passing the pipe of peace round among the former and offering it to the latter who each took a whiff out of courtesy this is a great night for we hev met to join ourselves together in a bond of friendship which i trust will not soon be brokentell them that tonal  when the interpreter had done his duty cheenbuk was asked to translate it into the eskimo tongue  the process was rather slow but as natives and traders alike had plenty of time on their hands and the proceedings were a great novelty no one felt impatient  then macsweenie continued  we palefaces as you call us believe that our god our manitou takes a great interest in all our affairs from the least to the greatest and in the book in which some of us hev written down our prayers we ask among many other things that there may be peace in our time  for myself i may give my opeenion that the prayer would hev seemed less selfish if it had run peace in all timebut that iss by the way whatevernow tonal go ahead  donald went ahead but he took the liberty of omitting what he deemed the irrelevant commentary  peace then iss the thing that i am drivin atpeace and gootwill between the palefaces and the menothewoods and the menoftheice also  there are many things that make for peace  the first an most important thing iss goot feelin  another thing is tradecommerce barter or exchange  i dont see how the eskimo will translate these words tonal but he will hev to do his best  then there iss common sense and lastly there is marriage  now i hev said my say for the time whatever and nazinred will continoo the discourse  thus directly appealed to our indian rose and looking calmly round on the assembly said  every word that our white father has said is true and a great many more words that he has not said are also true  waugh from the red men who evidently regarded the last remark as a selfevident proposition  dispensing with the services of mowat nazinred turned to the eskimos and acted the part of his own interpreter  they received his words with an emphatic hoh as if they were equally clear on the subject of the last words being indisputable  our white father has said continued the chief that the first and most important thing in producing peace is goodfeeling  that is true it was goodfeeling in my child that led her to save the life of cheenbuk  it was goodfeeling in cheenbuk that made him care for my child and treat her well and bring her back here to her mother and her tribe  it was goodfeeling in the eskimos that made them kind to the indian chief and receive him hospitably when they might have taken his scalp and kept his daughter  it is goodfeeling very strong goodfeeling that makes the young eskimo wish to make adolay his squaw and it is the same goodfeeling that now makes nazinred willing that he should have her  hoh exclaimed the eskimos at this point with evident satisfaction and ho exclaimed the indians with equally evident surprise for it was contrary to all their notions of propriety that an indian chiefs daughter should wed an eaterofrawflesh  however they said nothing more and after gazing a few moments at each other in silent solemnity they turned their eyes again on nazinred  changing his tone somewhat that wily red man went on in a persuasive manner to expatiate on the advantages of peace in general and of peace with the eskimos in particular  he also enlarged on the great comforts to be derived from tradewhich could be carried on with the white traders on the one hand and the eskimos on the other so that between the two the menofthewoods could not fail to obtain a double benefit as to common sense being favourable to peace he did not quite understand what his white father meant by that for there was only one kind of sense among the dogribsthough perhaps there might be two or three kinds where the traders came from  but in regard to marriage there could be no doubt of his opinion on that point seeing that he was going to give his daughter to cheenbuk  having finished what he had to say nazinred sat down after expressing a desire to hear the opinions of his people on these matters  for some time nothing was said and it seemed as if the indians were not quite sure of their own minds when magadar arose suddenly  braves he began in his brusque manner i like fairplay  if cheenbuk is going to carry off one of our maidens it seems to me reasonable that an eskimo maid should be left in her place  there is one of their girls who is named cowlik  i am willing to take cowlik and make her my squaw  waugh  magadar sat down with the prompt air of a man who has conferred a favour at great personal sacrifice  then mozwa rose and delivered himself of an oration full of wise remarks and poetical allusions in which he backed his friend nazinred  after him came cheenbuk who said that he was much gratified by the speeches of mozwa and nazinred that from the latter he had learned his first lesson of goodfeeling towards the menofthewoods on the day when he strove with him on the banks of the greygoose river that his second lesson was taught him by adolaya lesson that he would never forget and could never repay for she had not only saved his life but made him happy  at this point macsweenie broke in with yes my friends an there iss a goot many more people here besides cheenbuk that wants to be made happy  for instance theres the young brave alizay an that pleasant craitur idazoo thats thinkin about marriage just now an theres magadar and cowlik and oolalik and nootka and ondikik and rinka and anteek and young uleeta an im not sure that there may not be some more of you in the same case  if so all right the more the merrier ay ye may look surprised my friends but ive got a way o findin out these things that is not known to every wannow tonal gif them that as best ye can and look sherp for there iss more to come  now my fruends i want to explain to ye that when white people get married they go through a kind of ceremony an put gold rings on the weemens fingersby way o makin it all shipshape an secure you know  now i understand how to go about this matter an we hev plenty o brass curtainrings in the store thats as goot as gold any dayin this country whatever  so if it iss agreeable to the chiefs and the braves around me im quite willin to marry ye all off at the same time and will gif ye as much baccy as ye can smoke in wan night an well hev a glorious feast on the back ot an a dance thatll keep my fuddlers fingers goin as long as they can wagnow tonal if ye tell them all that yere a cliverer man than i take ye for  whether mowat told them all that as faithfully as might be desired we cannot tell but he addressed himself to the task with a genial fluency that at all events had the desired effect for after nazinred had translated it to the eskimos it was found that they as well as the indians were quite disposed to fall in with the eccentric traders views  arrangements were accordingly made without delay for carrying them into execution  of course the ladies concerned had no objections to offer and it is generally believed to this day in those regions that the interest aroused by the promised ceremonial not to mention the brass curtainrings as well as the tobacco and the feast and fiddle had much to do with the ready assent of all parties to this somewhat violent innovation on ancient custom  be this as it may the wholesale wedding eventually took place the feast came off tonal mowat charmed the souls of the eskimos with his violin even more powerfully than he had charmed those of the indians and aglootook almost carried out of himself with delight volunteered an oration in which he reminded his hearers that he had told them that something would certainly happen  they all heartily admitted the fact and solemnly proclaimed him the most wonderful magician in the land  from that day to this as far as we know nothing has occurred to interrupt the flow of kindly intercourse that was at this time established  the eskimos returned to their icy fastnesses laden with some of the wealth of the white traders  but every spring they came back to barter for more of it as well as for the purpose of seeing the friends whom they had left behind them  for cheenbuk being unable to tear himself away from nazinred took up his permanent abode at the fort as one of the hunters to the establishment  he did not however forsake his people but frequently visited old mangivik and his mother at waruskeek and the old folk sometimes returned the visit by spending a few months on the banks of the ukon river  anteek also elected to stay with the menofthewoods being unable to forsake cheenbuk and of course young uleeta remained with him  every year nootka found it quite impossible to exist without seeing her brother cheenbuk in his own home and having a satisfactory gossip with her dear friend adolay  as oolalik agreed with nootka in all things there was no difficulty in arranging the matter  in the course of time cheenbuks youngsters and nootkas progeny insisted on keeping up the intercourse that had been so auspiciously begun and even the easygoing cowlik became uneasy unless the fireeating magadar went with her occasionally to waruskeek  as for the unselfish and tenderhearted rinka she of course returned with ondikik to the realms of ice and made that fortunate savage happy indeed she made every one happy who came within her benign influence and if the truth had been spoken out by every one we suspect it would have been found that to her attractive powers was due much of the enthusiasm for intercommunication that existed between the red men and the walrushunters for the principle still holds good in savage not less than in civilised lands that love is the fulfilling of the law  the end
