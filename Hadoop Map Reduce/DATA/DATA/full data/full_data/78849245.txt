dark   xxxii the opening of the blue chest    the story girl    chapter i the home of our fathers  i do like a road because you can be always wondering what is at the end of it  the story girl said that once upon a time  felix and i on the may morning when we left toronto for prince edward island had not then heard her say it and indeed were but barely aware of the existence of such a person as the story girl  we did not know her at all under that name  we knew only that a cousin sara stanley whose mother our aunt felicity was dead was living down on the island with uncle roger and aunt olivia king on a farm adjoining the old king homestead in carlisle  we supposed we should get acquainted with her when we reached there and we had an idea from aunt olivias letters to father that she would be quite a jolly creature  further than that we did not think about her  we were more interested in felicity and cecily and dan who lived on the homestead and would therefore be our roofmates for a season  but the spirit of the story girls yet unuttered remark was thrilling in our hearts that morning as the train pulled out of toronto  we were faring forth on a long road and though we had some idea what would be at the end of it there was enough glamour of the unknown about it to lend a wonderful charm to our speculations concerning it  we were delighted at the thought of seeing fathers old home and living among the haunts of his boyhood  he had talked so much to us about it and described its scenes so often and so minutely that he had inspired us with some of his own deepseated affection for itan affection that had never waned in all his years of exile  we had a vague feeling that we somehow belonged there in that cradle of our family though we had never seen it  we had always looked forward eagerly to the promised day when father would take us down home to the old house with the spruces behind it and the famous king orchard before itwhen we might ramble in uncle stephens walk drink from the deep well with the chinese roof over it stand on the pulpit stone and eat apples from our birthday trees  the time had come sooner than we had dared to hope but father could not take us after all  his firm asked him to go to rio de janeiro that spring to take charge of their new branch there  it was too good a chance to lose for father was a poor man and it meant promotion and increase of salary but it also meant the temporary breaking up of our home  our mother had died before either of us was old enough to remember her father could not take us to rio de janeiro  in the end he decided to send us to uncle alec and aunt janet down on the homestead and our housekeeper who belonged to the island and was now returning to it took charge of us on the journey  i fear she had an anxious trip of it poor woman  she was constantly in a quite justifiable terror lest we should be lost or killed she must have felt great relief when she reached charlottetown and handed us over to the keeping of uncle alec indeed she said as much  the fat one isnt so bad he isnt so quick to move and get out of your sight while youre winking as the thin one  but the only safe way to travel with those young ones would be to have em both tied to you with a short ropea mighty short rope  the fat one was felix who was very sensitive about his plumpness he was always taking exercises to make him thin with the dismal result that he became fatter all the time  he vowed that he didnt care but he did care terribly and he glowered at mrs maclaren in a most undutiful fashion  he had never liked her since the day she had told him he would soon be as broad as he was long  for my own part i was rather sorry to see her going and she cried over us and wished us well but we had forgotten all about her by the time we reached the open country driving along one on either side of uncle alec whom we loved from the moment we saw him  he was a small man with thin delicate features closeclipped gray beard and large tired blue eyesfathers eyes over again  we knew that uncle alec was fond of children and was heartglad to welcome alans boys  we felt at home with him and were not afraid to ask him questions on any subject that came uppermost in our minds  we became very good friends with him on that twentyfour mile drive  much to our disappointment it was dark when we reached carlisletoo dark to see anything very distinctly as we drove up the lane of the old king homestead on the hill  behind us a young moon was hanging over southwestern meadows of springtime peace but all about us were the soft moist shadows of a may night  we peered eagerly through the gloom  theres the big willow bev whispered felix excitedly as we turned in at the gate  there it was in truththe tree grandfather king had planted when he returned one evening from ploughing in the brook field and stuck the willow switch he had used all day in the soft soil by the gate  it had taken root and grown our father and our uncles and aunts had played in its shadow and now it was a massive thing with a huge girth of trunk and great spreading boughs each of them as large as a tree in itself  im going to climb it tomorrow i said joyfully  off to the right was a dim branching place which we knew was the orchard and on our left among sibilant spruces and firs was the old whitewashed housefrom which presently a light gleamed through an open door and aunt janet a big bustling sonsy woman with fullblown peony cheeks came to welcome us  soon after we were at supper in the kitchen with its low dark raftered ceiling from which substantial hams and flitches of bacon were hanging  everything was just as father had described it  we felt that we had come home leaving exile behind us  felicity cecily and dan were sitting opposite us staring at us when they thought we would be too busy eating to see them  we tried to stare at them when they were eating and as a result we were always catching each other at it and feeling cheap and embarrassed  dan was the oldest he was my agethirteen  he was a lean freckled fellow with rather long lank brown hair and the shapely king nose  we recognized it at once  his mouth was his own however for it was like to no mouth on either the king or the ward side and nobody would have been anxious to claim it for it was an undeniably ugly onelong and narrow and twisted but it could grin in friendly fashion and both felix and i felt that we were going to like dan  felicity was twelve she had been called after aunt felicity who was the twin sister of uncle felix  aunt felicity and uncle felix as father had often told us had died on the same day far apart and were buried side by side in the old carlisle graveyard  we had known from aunt olivias letters that felicity was the beauty of the connection and we had been curious to see her on that account  she fully justified our expectations  she was plump and dimpled with big darkblue heavylidded eyes soft feathery golden curls and a pink and white skinthe king complexion  the kings were noted for their noses and complexion  felicity had also delightful hands and wrists  at every turn of them a dimple showed itself  it was a pleasure to wonder what her elbows must be like  she was very nicely dressed in a pink print and a frilled muslin apron and we understood from something dan said that she had dressed up in honour of our coming  this made us feel quite important  so far as we knew no feminine creatures had ever gone to the pains of dressing up on our account before  cecily who was eleven was pretty alsoor would have been had felicity not been there  felicity rather took the colour from other girls  cecily looked pale and thin beside her but she had dainty little features smooth brown hair of satin sheen and mild brown eyes with just a hint of demureness in them now and again  we remembered that aunt olivia had written to father that cecily was a true wardshe had no sense of humour  we did not know what this meant but we thought it was not exactly complimentary  still we were both inclined to think we would like cecily better than felicity to be sure felicity was a stunning beauty  but with the swift and unerring intuition of childhood which feels in a moment what it sometimes takes maturity much time to perceive we realized that she was rather too well aware of her good looks  in brief we saw that felicity was vain  its a wonder the story girl isnt over to see you said uncle alec  shes been quite wild with excitement about your coming  she hasnt been very well all day explained cecily and aunt olivia wouldnt let her come out in the night air  she made her go to bed instead  the story girl was awfully disappointed  who is the story girl asked felix  oh sarasara stanley  we call her the story girl partly because shes such a hand to tell storiesoh i cant begin to describe itand partly because sara ray who lives at the foot of the hill often comes up to play with us and it is awkward to have two girls of the same name in the same crowd  besides sara stanley doesnt like her name and shed rather be called the story girl  dan speaking for the first time rather sheepishly volunteered the information that peter had also been intending to come over but had to go home to take some flour to his mother instead  peter i questioned  i had never heard of any peter  he is your uncle rogers handy boy said uncle alec  his name is peter craig and he is a real smart little chap  but hes got his share of mischief that same lad  he wants to be felicitys beau said dan slyly  dont talk silly nonsense dan said aunt janet severely  felicity tossed her golden head and shot an unsisterly glance at dan  i wouldnt be very likely to have a hired boy for a beau she observed  we saw that her anger was real not affected  evidently peter was not an admirer of whom felicity was proud  we were very hungry boys and when we had eaten all we couldand oh what suppers aunt janet always spreadwe discovered that we were very tired alsotoo tired to go out and explore our ancestral domains as we would have liked to do despite the dark  we were quite willing to go to bed and presently we found ourselves tucked away upstairs in the very room looking out eastward into the spruce grove which father had once occupied dan shared it with us sleeping in a bed of his own in the opposite corner  the sheets and pillowslips were fragrant with lavender and one of grandmother kings noted patchwork quilts was over us  the window was open and we heard the frogs singing down in the swamp of the brook meadow  we had heard frogs sing in ontario of course but certainly prince edward island frogs were more tuneful and mellow  or was it simply the glamour of old family traditions and tales which was over us lending its magic to all sights and sounds around us  this was home fathers homeour home  we had never lived long enough in any one house to develop a feeling of affection for it but here under the rooftree built by greatgrandfather king ninety years ago that feeling swept into our boyish hearts and souls like a flood of living sweetness and tenderness  just think those are the very frogs father listened to when he was a little boy whispered felix  they can hardly be the same frogs i objected doubtfully not feeling very certain about the possible longevity of frogs its twenty years since father left home  well theyre the descendants of the frogs he heard said felix and theyre singing in the same swamp  thats near enough  our door was open and in their room across the narrow hall the girls were preparing for bed and talking rather more loudly than they might have done had they realized how far their sweet shrill voices carried  what do you think of the boys asked cecily  beverley is handsome but felix is too fat answered felicity promptly  felix twitched the quilt rather viciously and grunted  but i began to think i would like felicity  it might not be altogether her fault that she was vain  how could she help it when she looked in the mirror  i think theyre both nice and nice looking said cecily  dear little soul  i wonder what the story girl will think of them said felicity as if after all that was the main thing  somehow we too felt that it was  we felt that if the story girl did not approve of us it made little difference who else did or did not  i wonder if the story girl is pretty said felix aloud  no she isnt said dan instantly from across the room  but youll think she is while shes talking to you  everybody does its only when you go away from her that you find out she isnt a bit pretty after all  the girls door shut with a bang  silence fell over the house we drifted into the land of sleep wondering if the story girl would like us    chapter ii a queen of hearts  i wakened shortly after sunrise  the pale may sunshine was showering through the spruces and a chill inspiring wind was tossing the boughs about  felix wake up i whispered shaking him  whats the matter he murmured reluctantly  its morning  lets get up and go down and out  i cant wait another minute to see the places father has told us of  we slipped out of bed and dressed without arousing dan who was still slumbering soundly his mouth wide open and his bedclothes kicked off on the floor  i had hard work to keep felix from trying to see if he could shy a marble into that tempting open mouth  i told him it would waken dan who would then likely insist on getting up and accompanying us and it would be so much nicer to go by ourselves for the first time  everything was very still as we crept downstairs  out in the kitchen we heard some one presumably uncle alec lighting the fire but the heart of house had not yet begun to beat for the day  we paused a moment in the hall to look at the big grandfather clock  it was not going but it seemed like an old familiar acquaintance to us with the gilt balls on its three peaks the little dial and pointer which would indicate the changes of the moon and the very dent in its wooden door which father had made when he was a boy by kicking it in a fit of naughtiness  then we opened the front door and stepped out rapture swelling in our bosoms  there was a rare breeze from the south blowing to meet us the shadows of the spruces were long and clearcut the exquisite skies of early morning blue and windwinnowed were over us away to the west beyond the brook field was a long valley and a hill purple with firs and laced with still leafless beeches and maples  behind the house was a grove of fir and spruce a dim cool place where the winds were fond of purring and where there was always a resinous woodsy odour  on the further side of it was a thick plantation of slender silver birches and whispering poplars and beyond it was uncle rogers house  right before us girt about with its trim spruce hedge was the famous king orchard the history of which was woven into our earliest recollections  we knew all about it from fathers descriptions and in fancy we had roamed in it many a time and oft  it was now nearly sixty years since it had had its beginning when grandfather king brought his bride home  before the wedding he had fenced off the big south meadow that sloped to the sun it was the finest most fertile field on the farm and the neighbours told young abraham king that he would raise many a fine crop of wheat in that meadow  abraham king smiled and being a man of few words said nothing but in his mind he had a vision of the years to be and in that vision he saw not rippling acres of harvest gold but great leafy avenues of widespreading trees laden with fruit to gladden the eyes of children and grandchildren yet unborn  it was a vision to develop slowly into fulfilment  grandfather king was in no hurry  he did not set his whole orchard out at once for he wished it to grow with his life and history and be bound up with all of good and joy that should come to his household  so the morning after he had brought his young wife home they went together to the south meadow and planted their bridal trees  these trees were no longer living but they had been when father was a boy and every spring bedecked themselves in blossom as delicately tinted as elizabeth kings face when she walked through the old south meadow in the morn of her life and love  when a son was born to abraham and elizabeth a tree was planted in the orchard for him  they had fourteen children in all and each child had its birth tree  every family festival was commemorated in like fashion and every beloved visitor who spent a night under their roof was expected to plant a tree in the orchard  so it came to pass that every tree in it was a fair green monument to some love or delight of the vanished years and each grandchild had its tree there also set out by grandfather when the tidings of its birth reached him not always an apple treeperhaps it was a plum or cherry or pear  but it was always known by the name of the person for whom or by whom it was planted and felix and i knew as much about aunt felicitys pears and aunt julias cherries and uncle alecs apples and the rev mr scotts plums as if we had been born and bred among them  and now we had come to the orchard it was before us we had only to open that little whitewashed gate in the hedge and we might find ourselves in its storied domain  but before we reached the gate we glanced to our left along the grassy sprucebordered lane which led over to uncle rogers and at the entrance of that lane we saw a girl standing with a gray cat at her feet  she lifted her hand and beckoned blithely to us and the orchard forgotten we followed her summons  for we knew that this must be the story girl and in that gay and graceful gesture was an allurement not to be gainsaid or denied  we looked at her as we drew near with such interest that we forgot to feel shy  no she was not pretty  she was tall for her fourteen years slim and straight around her long white facerather too long and too whitefell sleek darkbrown curls tied above either ear with rosettes of scarlet ribbon her large curving mouth was as red as a poppy and she had brilliant almondshaped hazel eyes but we did not think her pretty  then she spoke she said  good morning  never had we heard a voice like hers  never in all my life since have i heard such a voice  i cannot describe it  i might say it was clear i might say it was sweet i might say it was vibrant and farreaching and belllike all this would be true but it would give you no real idea of the peculiar quality which made the story girls voice what it was  if voices had colour hers would have been like a rainbow  it made words live  whatever she said became a breathing entity not a mere verbal statement or utterance  felix and i were too young to understand or analyze the impression it made upon us but we instantly felt at her greeting that it was a good morninga surpassingly good morning  the very best morning that had ever happened in this most excellent of worlds  you are felix and beverley she went on shaking our hands with an air of frank comradeship which was very different from the shy feminine advances of felicity and cecily  from that moment we were as good friends as if we had known each other for a hundred years  i am glad to see you  i was so disappointed i couldnt go over last night  i got up early this morning though for i felt sure you would be up early too and that youd like to have me tell you about things  i can tell things so much better than felicity or cecily  do you think felicity is very pretty  shes the prettiest girl i ever saw i said enthusiastically remembering that felicity had called me handsome  the boys all think so said the story girl not i fancied quite well pleased  and i suppose she is  she is a splendid cook too though she is only twelve  i cant cook  i am trying to learn but i dont make much progress  aunt olivia says i havent enough natural gumption ever to be a cook but id love to be able to make as good cakes and pies as felicity can make but then felicity is stupid  its not illnatured of me to say that  its just the truth and youd soon find it out for yourselves  i like felicity very well but she is stupid cecily is ever so much cleverer  cecilys a dear  so is uncle alec and aunt janet is pretty nice too  what is aunt olivia like asked felix  aunt olivia is very pretty  she is just like a pansyall velvety and purply and goldy  felix and i saw somewhere inside of our heads a velvet and purple and gold pansywoman just as the story girl spoke  but is she nice i asked  that was the main question about grownups  their looks mattered little to us  she is lovely  but she is twentynine you know  thats pretty old  she doesnt bother me much  aunt janet says that id have no bringing up at all if it wasnt for her  aunt olivia says children should just be let come upthat everything else is settled for them long before they are born  i dont understand that  do you  no we did not  but it was our experience that grownups had a habit of saying things hard to understand  what is uncle roger like was our next question  well i like uncle roger said the story girl meditatively he is big and jolly  but he teases people too much  you ask him a serious question and you get a ridiculous answer  he hardly ever scolds or gets cross though and that is something he is an old bachelor  doesnt he ever mean to get married asked felix  i dont know  aunt olivia wishes he would because shes tired keeping house for him and she wants to go to aunt julia in california  but she says hell never get married because he is looking for perfection and when he finds her she wont have him  by this time we were all sitting down on the gnarled roots of the spruces and the big gray cat came over and made friends with us he was a lordly animal with a silvergray coat beautifully marked with darker stripes  with such colouring most cats would have had white or silver feet but he had four black paws and a black nose  such points gave him an air of distinction and marked him out as quite different from the common or garden variety of cats  he seemed to be a cat with a tolerably good opinion of himself and his response to our advances was slightly tinged with condescension  this isnt topsy is it i asked  i knew at once that the question was a foolish one  topsy the cat of which father had talked had flourished thirty years before and all her nine lives could scarcely have lasted so long  no but it is topsys greatgreatgreatgreatgrandson said the story girl gravely  his name is paddy and he is my own particular cat  we have barn cats but paddy never associates with them  i am very good friends with all cats  they are so sleek and comfortable and dignified  and it is so easy to make them happy  oh im so glad you boys have come to live here nothing ever happens here except days so we have to make our own good times  we were short of boys beforeonly dan and peter to four girls  four girls  oh yes sara ray  felicity mentioned her  what is she like  where does she live  just down the hill  you cant see the house for the spruce bush  sara is a nice girl  shes only eleven and her mother is dreadfully strict  she never allows sara to read a single story just you fancy  saras conscience is always troubling her for doing things shes sure her mother wont approve but it never prevents her from doing them  it only spoils her fun  uncle roger says that a mother who wont let you do anything and a conscience that wont let you enjoy anything is an awful combination and he doesnt wonder sara is pale and thin and nervous  but between you and me i believe the real reason is that her mother doesnt give her half enough to eat  not that shes mean you knowbut she thinks it isnt healthy for children to eat much or anything but certain things  isnt it fortunate we werent born into that sort of a family  i think its awfully lucky we were all born into the same family felix remarked  isnt it  ive often thought so  and ive often thought what a dreadful thing it would have been if grandfather and grandmother king had never got married to each other  i dont suppose there would have been a single one of us children here at all or if we were we would be part somebody else and that would be almost as bad  when i think it all over i cant feel too thankful that grandfather and grandmother king happened to marry each other when there were so many other people they might have married  felix and i shivered  we felt suddenly that we had escaped a dreadful dangerthe danger of having been born somebody else but it took the story girl to make us realize just how dreadful it was and what a terrible risk we had run years before we or our parents either had existed  who lives over there i asked pointing to a house across the fields  oh that belongs to the awkward man  his name is jasper dale but everybody calls him the awkward man  and they do say he writes poetry  he calls his place golden milestone  i know why because ive read longfellows poems  he never goes into society because he is so awkward  the girls laugh at him and he doesnt like it  i know a story about him and ill tell it to you sometime  and who lives in that other house asked felix looking over the westering valley where a little gray roof was visible among the trees  old peg bowen  shes very queer  she lives there with a lot of pet animals in winter and in summer she roams over the country and begs her meals  they say she is crazy  people have always tried to frighten us children into good behaviour by telling us that peg bowen would catch us if we didnt behave  im not so frightened of her as i once was but i dont think i would like to be caught by her  sara ray is dreadfully scared of her peter craig says she is a witch and that he bets shes at the bottom of it when the butter wont come  but i dont believe that  witches are so scarce nowadays  there may be some somewhere in the world but its not likely there are any here right in prince edward island  they used to be very plenty long ago  i know some splendid witch stories ill tell you some day theyll just make your blood freeze in your veins  we hadnt a doubt of it  if anybody could freeze the blood in our veins this girl with the wonderful voice could  but it was a may morning and our young blood was running blithely in our veins  we suggested a visit to the orchard would be more agreeable  all right  i know stories about it too she said as we walked across the yard followed by paddy of the waving tail oh arent you glad it is spring  the beauty of winter is that it makes you appreciate spring  the latch of the gate clicked under the story girls hand and the next moment we were in the king orchard    chapter iii legends of the old orchard  outside of the orchard the grass was only beginning to grow green but here sheltered by the spruce hedges from uncertain winds and sloping to southern suns it was already like a wonderful velvet carpet the leaves on the trees were beginning to come out in woolly grayish clusters and there were purplepencilled white violets at the base of the pulpit stone  its all just as father described it said felix with a blissful sigh and theres the well with the chinese roof  we hurried over to it treading on the spears of mint that were beginning to shoot up about it  it was a very deep well and the curb was of rough undressed stones  over it the queer pagodalike roof built by uncle stephen on his return from a voyage to china was covered with yet leafless vines  its so pretty when the vines leaf out and hang down in long festoons said the story girl  the birds build their nests in it  a pair of wild canaries come here every summer  and ferns grow out between the stones of the well as far down as you can see  the water is lovely  uncle edward preached his finest sermon about the bethlehem well where davids soldiers went to get him water and he illustrated it by describing his old well at the homesteadthis very welland how in foreign lands he had longed for its sparkling water  so you see it is quite famous  theres a cup just like the one that used to be here in fathers time exclaimed felix pointing to an oldfashioned shallow cup of clouded blue ware on a little shelf inside the curb  it is the very same cup said the story girl impressively isnt it an amazing thing  that cup has been here for forty years and hundreds of people have drunk from it and it has never been broken  aunt julia dropped it down the well once but they fished it up not hurt a bit except for that little nick in the rim  i think it is bound up with the fortunes of the king family like the luck of edenhall in longfellows poem  it is the last cup of grandmother kings second best set  her best set is still complete  aunt olivia has it  you must get her to show it to you  its so pretty with red berries all over it and the funniest little potbellied cream jug  aunt olivia never uses it except on a family anniversary  we took a drink from the blue cup and then went to find our birthday trees  we were rather disappointed to find them quite large sturdy ones  it seemed to us that they should still be in the sapling stage corresponding to our boyhood  your apples are lovely to eat the story girl said to me but felixs are only good for pies  those two big trees behind them are the twins treesmy mother and uncle felix you know  the apples are so dead sweet that nobody but us children and the french boys can eat them  and that tall slender tree over there with the branches all growing straight up is a seedling that came up of itself and nobody can eat its apples they are so sour and bitter  even the pigs wont eat them  aunt janet tried to make pies of them once because she said she hated to see them going to waste  but she never tried again  she said it was better to waste apples alone than apples and sugar too  and then she tried giving them away to the french hired men but they wouldnt even carry them home  the story girls words fell on the morning air like pearls and diamonds  even her prepositions and conjunctions had untold charm hinting at mystery and laughter and magic bound up in everything she mentioned  apple pies and sour seedlings and pigs became straightway invested with a glamour of romance  i like to hear you talk said felix in his grave stodgy way  everybody does said the story girl coolly  im glad you like the way i talk  but i want you to like me tooas well as you like felicity and cecily  not better  i wanted that once but ive got over it  i found out in sunday school the day the minister taught our class that it was selfish  but i want you to like me as well  well i will for one said felix emphatically  i think he was remembering that felicity had called him fat  cecily now joined us  it appeared that it was felicitys morning to help prepare breakfast therefore she could not come  we all went to uncle stephens walk  this was a double row of apple trees running down the western side of the orchard  uncle stephen was the first born of abraham and elizabeth king  he had none of grandfathers abiding love for woods and meadows and the kindly ways of the warm red earth grandmother king had been a ward and in uncle stephen the blood of the seafaring race claimed its own  to sea he must go despite the pleadings and tears of a reluctant mother and it was from the sea he came to set out his avenue in the orchard with trees brought from a foreign land  then he sailed away againand the ship was never heard of more the gray first came in grandmothers brown hair in those months of waiting  the for the first time the orchard heard the sound of weeping and was consecrated by a sorrow  when the blossoms come out its wonderful to walk here said the story girl  its like a dream of fairylandas if you were walking in a kings palace  the apples are delicious and in winter its a splendid place for coasting  from the walk we went to the pulpit stonea huge gray boulder as high as a mans head in the southeastern corner  it was straight and smooth in front but sloped down in natural steps behind with a ledge midway on which one could stand  it had played an important part in the games of our uncles and aunts being fortified castle indian ambush throne pulpit or concert platform as occasion required  uncle edward had preached his first sermon at the age of eight from that old gray boulder and aunt julia whose voice was to delight thousands sang her earliest madrigals there  the story girl mounted to the ledge sat on the rim and looked at us  pat sat gravely at its base and daintily washed his face with his black paws  now for your stories about the orchard said i  there are two important ones said the story girl  the story of the poet who was kissed and the tale of the family ghost which one shall i tell  tell them both said felix greedily but tell the ghost one first  i dont know  the story girl looked dubious  that sort of story ought to be told in the twilight among the shadows  then it would frighten the souls out of your bodies  we thought it might be more agreeable not to have the souls frightened out of our bodies and we voted for the family ghost  ghost stories are more comfortable in daytime said felix  the story girl began it and we listened avidly  cecily who had heard it many times before listened just as eagerly as we did she declared to me afterwards that no matter how often the story girl told a story it always seemed as new and exciting as if you had just heard it for the first time  long long ago began the story girl her voice giving us an impression of remote antiquity even before grandfather king was born an orphan cousin of his lived here with his parents  her name was emily king  she was very small and very sweet  she had soft brown eyes that were too timid to look straight at anybody like cecilys thereand long sleek brown curlslike mine and she had a tiny birthmark like a pink butterfly on one cheekright here  of course there was no orchard here then  it was just a field but there was a clump of white birches in it right where that big spreading tree of uncle alecs is now and emily liked to sit among the ferns under the birches and read or sew  she had a lover his name was malcolm ward and he was as handsome as a prince she loved him with all her heart and he loved her the same but they had never spoken about it  they used to meet under the birches and talk about everything except love  one day he told her he was coming the next day to ask a very important question and he wanted to find her under the birches when he came  emily promised to meet him there  i am sure she stayed awake that night thinking about it and wondering what the important question would be although she knew perfectly well  i would have  and the next day she dressed herself beautifully in her best pale blue muslin and sleeked her curls and went smiling to the birches  and while she was waiting there thinking such lovely thoughts a neighbours boy came running upa boy who didnt know about her romanceand cried out that malcolm ward had been killed by his gun going off accidentally  emily just put her hands to her heartsoand fell all white and broken among the ferns  and when she came back to life she never cried or lamented  she was changed  she was never never like herself again and she was never contented unless she was dressed in her blue muslin and waiting under the birches  she got paler and paler every day but the pink butterfly grew redder until it looked just like a stain of blood on her white cheek  when the winter came she died  but next springthe story girl dropped her voice to a whisper that was as audible and thrilling as her louder tonespeople began to tell that emily was sometimes seen waiting under the birches still  nobody knew just who told it first  but more than one person saw her  grandfather saw her when he was a little boy  and my mother saw her once  did you ever see her asked felix skeptically  no but i shall some day if i keep on believing in her said the story girl confidently  i wouldnt like to see her  id be afraid said cecily with a shiver  there wouldnt be anything to be afraid of said the story girl reassuringly  its not as if it were a strange ghost  its our own family ghost so of course it wouldnt hurt us  we were not so sure of this  ghosts were unchancy folk even if they were our family ghosts  the story girl had made the tale very real to us  we were glad we had not heard it in the evening  how could we ever have got back to the house through the shadows and swaying branches of a darkening orchard  as it was we were almost afraid to look up it lest we should see the waiting blueclad emily under uncle alecs tree  but all we saw was felicity tearing over the green sward her curls streaming behind her in a golden cloud  felicitys afraid shes missed something remarked the story girl in a tone of quiet amusement  is your breakfast ready felicity or have i time to tell the boys the story of the poet who was kissed  breakfast is ready but we cant have it till father is through attending to the sick cow so you will likely have time answered felicity  felix and i couldnt keep our eyes off her  crimsoncheeked shiningeyed from her haste her face was like a rose of youth but when the story girl spoke we forgot to look at felicity  about ten years after grandfather and grandmother king were married a young man came to visit them  he was a distant relative of grandmothers and he was a poet  he was just beginning to be famous  he was very famous afterward  he came into the orchard to write a poem and he fell asleep with his head on a bench that used to be under grandfathers tree  then greataunt edith came into the orchard  she was not a greataunt then of course  she was only eighteen with red lips and black black hair and eyes  they say she was always full of mischief she had been away and had just come home and she didnt know about the poet  but when she saw him sleeping there she thought he was a cousin they had been expecting from scotland and she tiptoed upsoand bent oversoand kissed his cheek then he opened his big blue eyes and looked up into ediths face she blushed as red as a rose for she knew she had done a dreadful thing  this could not be her cousin from scotland  she knew for he had written so to her that he had eyes as black as her own  edith ran away and hid and of course she felt still worse when she found out that he was a famous poet  but he wrote one of his most beautiful poems on it afterwards and sent it to herand it was published in one of his books  we had seen it allthe sleeping geniusthe roguish redlipped girlthe kiss dropped as lightly as a rosepetal on the sunburned cheek  they should have got married said felix  well in a book they would have but you see this was in real life said the story girl  we sometimes act the story out i like it when peter plays the poet  i dont like it when dan is the poet because he is so freckled and screws his eyes up so tight  but you can hardly ever coax peter to be the poetexcept when felicity is edithand dan is so obliging that way  what is peter like i asked  peter is splendid  his mother lives on the markdale road and washes for a living  peters father ran away and left them when peter was only three years old  he has never come back and they dont know whether he is alive or dead  isnt that a nice way to behave to your family  peter has worked for his board ever since he was six  uncle roger sends him to school and pays him wages in summer  we all like peter except felicity  i like peter well enough in his place said felicity primly but you make far too much of him mother says  he is only a hired boy and he hasnt been well brought up and hasnt much education i dont think you should make such an equal of him as you do  laughter rippled over the story girls face as shadow waves go over ripe wheat before a wind  peter is a real gentleman and he is more interesting than you could ever be if you were brought up and educated for a hundred years she said  he can hardly write said felicity  william the conqueror couldnt write at all said the story girl crushingly  he never goes to church and he never says his prayers retorted felicity uncrushed  i do too said peter himself suddenly appearing through a little gap in the hedge  i say my prayers sometimes  this peter was a slim shapely fellow with laughing black eyes and thick black curls  early in the season as it was he was barefooted  his attire consisted of a faded gingham shirt and a scanty pair of corduroy knickerbockers but he wore it with such an unconscious air of purple and fine linen that he seemed to be much better dressed than he really was  you dont pray very often insisted felicity  well god will be all the more likely to listen to me if i dont pester him all the time argued peter  this was rank heresy to felicity but the story girl looked as if she thought there might be something in it  you never go to church anyhow continued felicity determined not to be argued down  well i aint going to church till ive made up my mind whether im going to be a methodist or a presbyterian  aunt jane was a methodist  my mother aint much of anything but i mean to be something  its more respectable to be a methodist or a presbyterian or something than not to be anything  when ive settled what im to be im going to church same as you  thats not the same as being born something said felicity loftily  i think its a good deal better to pick your own religion than have to take it just because it was what your folks had retorted peter  now never mind quarrelling said cecily  you leave peter alone felicity  peter this is beverley king and this is felix  and were all going to be good friends and have a lovely summer together  think of the games we can have  but if you go squabbling youll spoil it all  peter what are you going to do today  harrow the wood field and dig your aunt olivias flower beds  aunt olivia and i planted sweet peas yesterday said the story girl and i planted a little bed of my own  i am not going to dig them up this year to see if they have sprouted  it is bad for them  i shall try to cultivate patience no matter how long they are coming up  i am going to help mother plant the vegetable garden today said felicity  oh i never like the vegetable garden said the story girl except when i am hungry  then i do like to go and look at the nice little rows of onions and beets  but i love a flower garden  i think i could be always good if i lived in a garden all the time  adam and eve lived in a garden all the time said felicity and they were far from being always good  they mightnt have kept good as long as they did if they hadnt lived in a garden said the story girl  we were now summoned to breakfast  peter and the story girl slipped away through the gap followed by paddy and the rest of us walked up the orchard to the house  well what do you think of the story girl asked felicity  shes just fine said felix enthusiastically  i never heard anything like her to tell stories  she cant cook said felicity and she hasnt a good complexion  mind you she says shes going to be an actress when she grows up  isnt that dreadful  we didnt exactly see why  oh because actresses are always wicked people said felicity in a shocked tone  but i daresay the story girl will go and be one just as soon as she can  her father will back her up in it he is an artist you know  evidently felicity thought artists and actresses and all such poor trash were members one of another  aunt olivia says the story girl is fascinating said cecily  the very adjective  felix and i recognized its beautiful fitness at once  yes the story girl was fascinating and that was the final word to be said on the subject  dan did not come down until breakfast was half over and aunt janet talked to him after a fashion which made us realize that it would be well to keep as the piquant country phrase went from the rough side of her tongue  but all things considered we liked the prospect of our summer very much  felicity to look atthe story girl to tell us tales of wondercecily to admire usdan and peter to play withwhat more could reasonable fellows want    chapter iv the wedding veil of the proud princess  when we had lived for a fortnight in carlisle we belonged there and the freedom of all its small fry was conferred on us  with peter and dan with felicity and cecily and the story girl with pale grayeyed little sara ray we were boon companions  we went to school of course and certain home chores were assigned to each of us for the faithful performance of which we were held responsible  but we had long hours for play  even peter had plenty of spare time when the planting was over  we got along very well with each other in the main in spite of some minor differences of opinion  as for the grownup denizens of our small world they suited us also  we adored aunt olivia she was pretty and merry and kind and above all she had mastered to perfection the rare art of letting children alone  if we kept ourselves tolerably clean and refrained from quarrelling or talking slang aunt olivia did not worry us  aunt janet on the contrary gave us so much good advice and was so constantly telling us to do this or not to do the other thing that we could not remember half her instructions and did not try  uncle roger was as we had been informed quite jolly and fond of teasing  we liked him but we had an uncomfortable feeling that the meaning of his remarks was not always that which met the ear sometimes we believed uncle roger was making fun of us and the deadly seriousness of youth in us resented that  the uncle alec we gave our warmest love  we felt that we always had a friend at court in uncle alec no matter what we did or left undone  and we never had to turn his speeches inside out to discover their meaning  the social life of juvenile carlisle centred in the day and sunday schools  we were especially interested in our sunday school for we were fortunate enough to be assigned to a teacher who made our lessons so interesting that we no longer regarded sunday school attendance as a disagreeable weekly duty but instead looked forward to it with pleasure and tried to carry out our teachers gentle preceptsat least on mondays and tuesdays  i am afraid the remembrance grew a little dim the rest of the week  she was also deeply interested in missions and one talk on this subject inspired the story girl to do a little home missionary work on her own account  the only thing she could think of along this line was to persuade peter to go to church  felicity did not approve of the design and said so plainly  he wont know how to behave for hes never been inside a church door in his life she warned the story girl  hell likely do something awful and then youll feel ashamed and wish youd never asked him to go and well all be disgraced  its all right to have our mite boxes for the heathen and send missionaries to them  theyre far away and we dont have to associate with them  but i dont want to have to sit in a pew with a hired boy  but the story girl undauntedly continued to coax the reluctant peter  it was not an easy matter  peter did not come of a churchgoing stock and besides he alleged he had not yet made up his mind whether to be a presbyterian or a methodist  it isnt a bit of difference which you are pleaded the story girl  they both go to heaven  but one way must be easier or better than the other or else theyd all be one kind argued peter  i want to find the easiest way  and ive got a hankering after the methodists  my aunt jane was a methodist  isnt she one still asked felicity pertly  well i dont know exactly  shes dead said peter rebukingly do people go on being just the same after theyre dead  no of course not  theyre angels thennot methodists or anything but just angels  that is if they go to heaven  sposen they went to the other place  but felicitys theology broke down at this point  she turned her back on peter and walked disdainfully away  the story girl returned to the main point with a new argument  we have such a lovely minister peter  he looks just like the picture of st john my father sent me only he is old and his hair is white  i know youd like him  and even if you are going to be a methodist it wont hurt you to go to the presbyterian church  the nearest methodist church is six miles away at markdale and you cant attend there just now  go to the presbyterian church until youre old enough to have a horse  but sposen i got too fond of being presbyterian and couldnt change if i wanted to objected peter  altogether the story girl had a hard time of it but she persevered and one day she came to us with the announcement that peter had yielded  hes going to church with us tomorrow she said triumphantly  we were out in uncle rogers hill pasture sitting on some smooth round stones under a clump of birches  behind us was an old gray fence with violets and dandelions thick in its corners below us was the carlisle valley with its orchardembowered homesteads and fertile meadows  its upper end was dim with a delicate spring mist  winds blew up the field like wave upon wave of sweet savourspice of bracken and balsam  we were eating little jam turnovers which felicity had made for us  felicitys turnovers were perfection  i looked at her and wondered why it was not enough that she should be so pretty and capable of making such turnovers  if she were only more interesting  felicity had not a particle of the nameless charm and allurement which hung about every motion of the story girl and made itself manifest in her lightest word and most careless glance  ah well one cannot have every good gift  the story girl had no dimples at her slim brown wrists  we all enjoyed our turnovers except sara ray  she ate hers but she knew she should not have done so  her mother did not approve of snacks between meals or of jam turnovers at any time  once when sara was in a brown study i asked her what she was thinking of  im trying to think of something ma hasnt forbid she answered with a sigh  we were all glad to hear that peter was going to church except felicity  she was full of gloomy forebodings and warnings  im surprised at you felicity king said cecily severely you ought to be glad that poor boy is going to get started in the right way  theres a great big patch on his best pair of trousers protested felicity  well thats better than a hole said the story girl addressing herself daintily to her turnover  god wont notice the patch  no but the carlisle people will retorted felicity in a tone which implied that what the carlisle people thought was far more important  and i dont believe that peter has got a decent stocking to his name  what will you feel like if he goes to church with the skin of his legs showing through the holes miss story girl  im not a bit afraid said the story girl staunchly  peter knows better than that  well all i hope is that hell wash behind his ears said felicity resignedly  how is pat today asked cecily by way of changing the conversation  pat isnt a bit better  he just mopes about the kitchen said the story girl anxiously  i went out to the barn and i saw a mouse  i had a stick in my hand and i fetched a swipe at itso i killed it stone dead  then i took it in to paddy  will you believe it  he wouldnt even look at it  im so worried  uncle roger says he needs a dose of physic  but how is he to be made take it thats the question  i mixed a powder in some milk and tried to pour it down his throat while peter held him  just look at the scratches i got  and the milk went everywhere except down pats throat  wouldnt it be awful ifif anything happened to pat whispered cecily  well we could have a jolly funeral you know said dan  we looked at him in such horror that dan hastened to apologize  id be awful sorry myself if pat died  but if he did wed have to give him the right kind of a funeral he protested  why paddy just seems like one of the family  the story girl finished her turnover and stretched herself out on the grasses pillowing her chin in her hands and looking at the sky  she was bare headed as usual and her scarlet ribbon was bound filletwise about her head  she had twined freshly plucked dandelions around it and the effect was that of a crown of brilliant golden stars on her sleek brown curls  look at that long thin lacy cloud up there she said  what does it make you think of girls  a wedding veil said cecily  that is just what it isthe wedding veil of the proud princess i know a story about it  i read it in a book  once upon a timethe story girls eyes grew dreamy and her accents floated away on the summer air like windblown rose petalsthere was a princess who was the most beautiful princess in the world and kings from all lands came to woo her for a bride  but she was as proud as she was beautiful  she laughed all her suitors to scorn  and when her father urged her to choose one of them as her husband she drew herself up haughtilyso  the story girl sprang to her feet and for a moment we saw the proud princess of the old tale in all her scornful loveliness  and she said  i will not wed until a king comes who can conquer all kings then i shall be the wife of the king of the world and no one can hold herself higher than i  so every king went to war to prove that he could conquer every one else and there was a great deal of bloodshed and misery but the proud princess laughed and sang and she and her maidens worked at a wonderful lace veil which she meant to wear when the king of all kings came  it was a very beautiful veil but her maidens whispered that a man had died and a womans heart had broken for every stitch set in it  just when a king thought he had conquered everybody some other king would come and conquer him and so it went on until it did not seem likely the proud princess would ever get a husband at all  but still her pride was so great that she would not yield even though everybody except the kings who wanted to marry her hated her for the suffering she had caused  one day a horn was blown at the palace gate and there was one tall man in complete armor with his visor down riding on a white horse  when he said he had come to marry the princess every one laughed for he had no retinue and no beautiful apparel and no golden crown  but i am the king who conquers all kings he said  you must prove it before i shall marry you said the proud princess  but she trembled and turned pale for there was something in his voice that frightened her  and when he laughed his laughter was still more dreadful  i can easily prove it beautiful princess he said but you must go with me to my kingdom for the proof  marry me now and you and i and your father and all your court will ride straightway to my kingdom and if you are not satisfied then that i am the king who conquers all kings you may give me back my ring and return home free of me forever more  it was a strange wooing and the friends of the princess begged her to refuse  but her pride whispered that it would be such a wonderful thing to be the queen of the king of the world so she consented and her maidens dressed her and put on the long lace veil that had been so many years amaking  then they were married at once but the bridegroom never lifted his visor and no one saw his face  the proud princess held herself more proudly than ever but she was as white as her veil  and there was no laughter or merrymaking such as should be at a wedding and every one looked at every one else with fear in his eyes  after the wedding the bridegroom lifted his bride before him on his white horse and her father and all the members of his court mounted too and rode after them  on and on they rode and the skies grew darker and the wind blew and wailed and the shades of evening came down  and just in the twilight they rode into a dark valley filled with tombs and graves  why have you brought me here cried the proud princess angrily  this is my kingdom he answered  these are the tombs of the kings i have conquered  behold me beautiful princess  i am death  he lifted his visor  all saw his awful face  the proud princess shrieked  come to my arms my bride he cried  i have won you fairly i am the king who conquers all kings  he clasped her fainting form to his breast and spurred his white horse to the tombs  a tempest of rain broke over the valley and blotted them from sight  very sadly the old king and courtiers rode home and never never again did human eye behold the proud princess  but when those long white clouds sweep across the sky the country people in the land where she lived say look you there is the wedding veil of the proud princess  the weird spell of the tale rested on us for some moments after the story girl had finished  we had walked with her in the place of death and grown cold with the horror that chilled the heart of the poor princess  dan presently broke the spell  you see it doesnt do to be too proud felicity he remarked giving her a poke  youd better not say too much about peters patches    chapter v peter goes to church  there was no sunday school the next afternoon as superintendent and teachers wished to attend a communion service at markdale the carlisle service was in the evening and at sunset we were waiting at uncle alecs front door for peter and the story girl  none of the grownups were going to church  aunt olivia had a sick headache and uncle roger stayed home with her  aunt janet and uncle alec had gone to the markdale service and had not yet returned  felicity and cecily were wearing their new summer muslins for the first timeand were acutely conscious of the fact  felicity her pink and white face shadowed by her drooping forgetmenotwreathed leghorn hat was as beautiful as usual but cecily having tortured her hair with curl papers all night had a rampant bush of curls all about her head which quite destroyed the sweet nunlike expression of her little features cecily cherished a grudge against fate because she had not been given naturally curly hair as had the other two girls  but she attained the desire of her heart on sundays at least and was quite well satisfied  it was impossible to convince her that the satin smooth lustre of her weekday tresses was much more becoming to her  presently peter and the story girl appeared and we were all more or less relieved to see that peter looked quite respectable despite the indisputable patch on his trousers  his face was rosy his thick black curls were smoothly combed and his tie was neatly bowed but it was his legs which we scrutinized most anxiously  at first glance they seemed well enough but closer inspection revealed something not altogether customary  what is the matter with your stockings peter asked dan bluntly  oh i hadnt a pair without holes in the legs answered peter easily because ma hadnt time to darn them this week  so i put on two pairs  the holes dont come in the same places and youd never notice them unless you looked right close  have you got a cent for collection demanded felicity  ive got a yankee cent  i spose it will do wont it  felicity shook her head vehemently  oh no no  it may be all right to pass a yankee cent on a store keeper or an egg peddler but it would never do for church  ill have to go without any then said peter  i havent another cent  i only get fifty cents a week and i give it all to ma last night  but peter must have a cent  felicity would have given him one herselfand she was none too lavish of her coppersrather than have him go without one  dan however lent him one on the distinct understanding that it was to be repaid the next week  uncle roger wandered by at this moment and beholding peter said  is saul also among the prophets  what can have induced you to turn churchgoer peter when all olivias gentle persuasions were of no avail  the old old argument i supposebeauty draws us with a single hair  uncle roger looked quizzically at felicity  we did not know what his quotations meant but we understood he thought peter was going to church because of felicity  felicity tossed her head  it isnt my fault that hes going to church she said snappishly  its the story girls doings  uncle roger sat down on the doorstep and gave himself over to one of the silent inward paroxysms of laughter we all found so very aggravating  he shook his big blond head shut his eyes and murmured  not her fault  oh felicity felicity youll be the death of your dear uncle yet if you dont watch out  felicity started off indignantly and we followed picking up sara ray at the foot of the hill  the carlisle church was a very oldfashioned one with a square ivyhung tower  it was shaded by tall elms and the graveyard surrounded it completely many of the graves being directly under its windows  we always took the corner path through it passing the king plot where our kindred of four generations slept in a green solitude of wavering light and shadow  there was greatgrandfather kings flat tombstone of rough island sandstone so overgrown with ivy that we could hardly read its lengthy inscription recording his whole history in brief and finishing with eight lines of original verse composed by his widow  i do not think that poetry was greatgrandmother kings strong point  when felix read it on our first sunday in carlisle he remarked dubiously that it looked like poetry but didnt sound like it  there too slept the emily whose faithful spirit was supposed to haunt the orchard but edith who had kissed the poet lay not with her kindred  she had died in a far foreign land and the murmur of an alien sea sounded about her grave  white marble tablets ornamented with weeping willow trees marked where grandfather and grandmother king were buried and a single shaft of red scotch granite stood between the graves of aunt felicity and uncle felix  the story girl lingered to lay a bunch of wild violets misty blue and faintly sweet on her mothers grave and then she read aloud the verse on the stone  they were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided  the tones of her voice brought out the poignant and immortal beauty and pathos of that wonderful old lament  the girls wiped their eyes and we boys felt as if we might have done so too had nobody been looking  what better epitaph could any one wish than to have it said that he was lovely and pleasant in his life when i heard the story girl read it i made a secret compact with myself that i would try to deserve such an epitaph  i wish i had a family plot said peter rather wistfully  i havent anything you fellows have  the craigs are just buried anywhere they happen to die  id like to buried here when i die said felix  but i hope it wont be for a good while yet he added in a livelier tone as we moved onward to the church  the interior of the church was as oldfashioned as its exterior it was furnished with square box pews the pulpit was a wineglass one and was reached by a steep narrow flight of steps  uncle alecs pew was at the top of the church quite near the pulpit  peters appearance did not attract as much attention as we had fondly expected  indeed nobody seemed to notice him at all the lamps were not yet lighted and the church was filled with a soft twilight and hush  outside the sky was purple and gold and silvery green with a delicate tangle of rosy cloud above the elms  isnt it awful nice and holy in here whispered peter reverently  i didnt know church was like this  its nice  felicity frowned at him and the story girl touched her with her slippered foot to remind him that he must not talk in church peter stiffened up and sat at attention during the service nobody could have behaved better  but when the sermon was over and the collection was being taken up he made the sensation which his entrance had not produced  elder frewen a tall pale man with long sandy sidewhiskers appeared at the door of our pew with the collection plate we knew elder frewen quite well and like him he was aunt janets cousin and often visited her  the contrast between his weekday jollity and the unearthly solemnity of his countenance on sundays always struck us as very funny  it seemed so to strike peter for as peter dropped his cent into the plate he laughed aloud  everybody looked at our pew  i have always wondered why felicity did not die of mortification on the spot  the story girl turned white and cecily turned red  as for that poor unlucky peter the shame of his countenance was pitiful to behold  he never lifted his head for the remainder of the service and he followed us down the aisle and across the graveyard like a beaten dog none of us uttered a word until we reached the road lying in the white moonshine of the may night  then felicity broke the tense silence by remarking to the story girl  i told you so  the story girl made no response  peter sidled up to her  im awful sorry he said contritely  i never meant to laugh it just happened before i could stop myself  it was this way  dont you ever speak to me again said the story girl in a tone of cold concentrated fury  go and be a methodist or a mohammedan or anything i dont care what you are  you have humiliated me  she marched off with sara ray and peter dropped back to us with a frightened face  what is it ive done to her he whispered  what does that big word mean  oh never mind i said crosslyfor i felt that peter had disgraced usshes just madand no wonder  whatever made you act so crazy peter  well i didnt mean to  and i wanted to laugh twice before that and didnt  it was the story girls stories made me want to laugh so i dont think its fair for her to be mad at me  she hadnt ought to tell me stories about people if she dont want me to laugh when i see them  when i looked at samuel ward i thought of him getting up in meeting one night and praying that he might be guided in his upsetting and downrising  i remembered the way she took him off and i wanted to laugh  and then i looked at the pulpit and thought of the story she told about the old scotch minister who was too fat to get in at the door of it and had to hist himself by his two hands over it and then whispered to the other minister so that everybody heard him  this pulpit door was made for speeritsand i wanted to laugh  and then mr frewen comeand i thought of her story about his sidewhiskershow when his first wife died of information of the lungs he went courting celia ward and celia told him she wouldnt marry him unless he shaved them whiskers off  and he wouldnt just to be stubborn  and one day one of them caught fire when he was burning brush and burned off and every one thought hed have to shave the other off then  but he didnt and just went round with one whisker till the burned one grew out  and then celia gave in and took him because she saw there wasnt no hope of him ever giving in  i just remembered that story and i thought i could see him taking up the cents so solemn with one long whisker and the laugh just laughed itself before i could help it  we all exploded with laughter on the spot much to the horror of mrs abraham ward who was just driving past and who came up the next day and told aunt janet we had acted scandalous on the road home from church  we felt ashamed ourselves because we knew people should conduct themselves decently and in order on sunday faringsforth  but as with peter it had laughed itself  even felicity laughed  felicity was not nearly so angry with peter as might have been expected  she even walked beside him and let him carry her bible  they talked quite confidentially perhaps she forgave him the more easily because he had justified her in her predictions and thus afforded her a decided triumph over the story girl  im going to keep on going to church peter told her  i like it  sermons are more intresting than i thought and i like the singing  i wish i could make up my mind whether to be a presbyterian or a methodist  i spose i might ask the ministers about it  oh no no dont do that said felicity in alarm  ministers wouldnt want to be bothered with such questions  why not  what are ministers for if they aint to tell people how to get to heaven  oh well its all right for grownups to ask them things of course  but it isnt respectful for little boysespecially hired boys  i dont see why  but anyhow i spose it wouldnt be much use because if he was a presbyterian minister hed say i ought to be a presbyterian and if he was a methodist hed tell me to be one too  look here felicity what is the difference between them  ii dont know said felicity reluctantly  i spose children cant understand such things  there must be a great deal of difference of course if we only knew what it was  anyhow i am a presbyterian and im glad of it  we walked on in silence for a time thinking our own young thoughts  presently they were scattered by an abrupt and startling question from peter  what does god look like he said  it appeared that none of us had any idea  the story girl would probly know said cecily  i wish i knew said peter gravely  i wish i could see a picture of god  it would make him seem lots more real  ive often wondered myself what he looks like said felicity in a burst of confidence  even in felicity so it would seem there were depths of thought unplumbed  ive seen pictures of jesus said felix meditatively  he looks just like a man only better and kinder  but now that i come to think of it ive never seen a picture of god  well if there isnt one in toronto it isnt likely theres one anywhere said peter disappointedly  i saw a picture of the devil once he added  it was in a book my aunt jane had  she got it for a prize in school  my aunt jane was clever  it couldnt have been a very good book if there was such a picture in it said felicity  it was a real good book  my aunt jane wouldnt have a book that wasnt good retorted peter sulkily  he refused to discuss the subject further somewhat to our disappointment  for we had never seen a picture of the person referred to and we were rather curious regarding it  well ask peter to describe it sometime when hes in a better humour whispered felix  sara ray having turned in at her own gate i ran ahead to join the story girl and we walked up the hill together  she had recovered her calmness of mind but she made no reference to peter  when we reached our lane and passed under grandfather kings big willow the fragrance of the orchard struck us in the face like a wave  we could see the long rows of trees a white gladness in the moonshine  it seemed to us that there was in the orchard something different from other orchards that we had known  we were too young to analyze the vague sensation  in later years we were to understand that it was because the orchard blossomed not only apple blossoms but all the love faith joy pure happiness and pure sorrow of those who had made it and walked there  the orchard doesnt seem the same place by moonlight at all said the story girl dreamily  its lovely but its different when i was very small i used to believe the fairies danced in it on moonlight nights  i would like to believe it now but i cant  why not  oh its so hard to believe things you know are not true  it was uncle edward who told me there were no such things as fairies  i was just seven  he is a minister so of course i knew he spoke the truth  it was his duty to tell me and i do not blame him but i have never felt quite the same to uncle edward since  ah do we ever feel quite the same towards people who destroy our illusions  shall i ever be able to forgive the brutal creature who first told me there was no such person as santa claus  he was a boy three years older than myself and he may now for aught i know be a most useful and respectable member of society beloved by his kind  but i know what he must ever seem to me  we waited at uncle alecs door for the others to come up  peter was by way of skulking shamefacedly past into the shadows but the story girls brief bitter anger had vanished  wait for me peter she called  she went over to him and held out her hand  i forgive you she said graciously  felix and i felt that it would really be worth while to offend her just to be forgiven in such an adorable voice  peter eagerly grasped her hand  i tell you what story girl im awfully sorry i laughed in church but you neednt be afraid i ever will again  no sir and im going to church and sunday school regular and ill say my prayers every night  i want to be like the rest of you  and look here  ive thought of the way my aunt jane used to give medicine to a cat  you mix the powder in lard and spread it on his paws and his sides and hell lick it off cause a cat cant stand being messy  if paddy isnt any better tomorrow well do that  they went away together hand in hand childrenwise up the lane of spruces crossed with bars of moonlight  and there was peace over all that fresh and flowery land and peace in our little hearts    chapter vi the mystery of golden milestone  paddy was smeared with medicated lard the next day all of us assisting at the rite although the story girl was high priestess  then out of regard for mats and cushions he was kept in durance vile in the granary until he had licked his fur clean  this treatment being repeated every day for a week pat recovered his usual health and spirits and our minds were set at rest to enjoy the next excitementcollecting for a school library fund  our teacher thought it would be an excellent thing to have a library in connection with the school and he suggested that each of the pupils should try to see how much money he or she could raise for the project during the month of june  we might earn it by honest toil or gather it in by contributions levied on our friends  the result was a determined rivalry as to which pupil should collect the largest sum and this rivalry was especially intense in our home coterie  our relatives started us with a quarter apiece  for the rest we knew we must depend on our own exertions  peter was handicapped at the beginning by the fact that he had no family friend to finance him  if my aunt janed been living shed have given me something he remarked  and if my father hadnt run away he might have given me something too  but im going to do the best i can anyhow your aunt olivia says i can have the job of gathering the eggs and im to have one egg out of every dozen to sell for myself  felicity made a similar bargain with her mother  the story girl and cecily were each to be paid ten cents a week for washing dishes in their respective homes  felix and dan contracted to keep the gardens free from weeds  i caught brook trout in the westering valley of spruces and sold them for a cent apiece  sara ray was the only unhappy one among us  she could do nothing  she had no relatives in carlisle except her mother and her mother did not approve of the school library project and would not give sara a cent or put her in any way of earning one to sara this was humiliation indescribable  she felt herself an outcast and an alien to our busy little circle where each member counted every day with miserly delight his slowly increasing hoard of small cash  im just going to pray to god to send me some money she announced desperately at last  i dont believe that will do any good said dan  he gives lots of things but he doesnt give money because people can earn that for themselves  i cant said sara with passionate defiance  i think he ought to take that into account  dont worry dear said cecily who always poured balm  if you cant collect any money everybody will know it isnt your fault  i wont ever feel like reading a single book in the library if i cant give something to it mourned sara  dan and the girls and i were sitting in a row on aunt olivias garden fence watching felix weed  felix worked well although he did not like weedingfat boys never do felicity informed him  felix pretended not to hear her but i knew he did because his ears grew red  felixs face never blushed but his ears always gave him away  as for felicity she did not say things like that out of malice prepense  it never occurred to her that felix did not like to be called fat  i always feel so sorry for the poor weeds said the story girl dreamily  it must be very hard to be rooted up  they shouldnt grow in the wrong place said felicity mercilessly  when weeds go to heaven i suppose they will be flowers continued the story girl  you do think such queer things said felicity  a rich man in toronto has a floral clock in his garden i said it looks just like the face of a clock and there are flowers in it that open at every hour so that you can always tell the time  oh i wish we had one here exclaimed cecily  what would be the use of it asked the story girl a little disdainfully  nobody ever wants to know the time in a garden  i slipped away at this point suddenly remembering that it was time to take a dose of magic seed  i had bought it from billy robinson three days before in school  billy had assured me that it would make me grow fast  i was beginning to feel secretly worried because i did not grow i had overheard aunt janet say i was going to be short like uncle alec  now i loved uncle alec but i wanted to be taller than he was  so when billy confided to me under solemn promise of secrecy that he had some magic seed which would make boys grow and would sell me a box of it for ten cents i jumped at the offer  billy was taller than any boy of his age in carlisle and he assured me it all came from taking magic seed  i was a regular runt before i begun he said and look at me now  i got it from peg bowen  shes a witch you know  i wouldnt go near her again for a bushel of magic seed  it was an awful experience  i havent much left but i guess ive enough to do me till im as tall as i want to be  you must take a pinch of the seed every three hours walking backward and you must never tell a soul youre taking it or it wont work  i wouldnt spare any of it to any one but you  i felt deeply grateful to billy and sorry that i had not liked him better  somehow nobody did like billy robinson over and above  but i vowed i would like him in future  i paid him the ten cents cheerfully and took the magic seed as directed measuring myself carefully every day by a mark on the hall door i could not see any advance in growth yet but then i had been taking it only three days  one day the story girl had an inspiration  let us go and ask the awkward man and mr campbell for a contribution to the library fund she said  i am sure no one else has asked them because nobody in carlisle is related to them  let us all go and if they give us anything well divide it equally among us  it was a daring proposition for both mr campbell and the awkward man were regarded as eccentric personages and mr campbell was supposed to detest children  but where the story girl led we would follow to the death  the next day being saturday we started out in the afternoon  we took a short cut to golden milestone over a long green dewy land full of placid meadows where sunshine had fallen asleep at first all was not harmonious  felicity was in an ill humour she had wanted to wear her second best dress but aunt janet had decreed that her school clothes were good enough to go traipsing about in the dust  then the story girl arrived arrayed not in any second best but in her very best dress and hat which her father had sent her from parisa dress of soft crimson silk and a white leghorn hat encircled by flamered poppies  neither felicity nor cecily could have worn it but it became the story girl perfectly  in it she was a thing of fire and laughter and glow as if the singular charm of her temperament were visible and tangible in its vivid colouring and silken texture  i shouldnt think youd put on your best clothes to go begging for the library in said felicity cuttingly  aunt olivia says that when you are going to have an important interview with a man you ought to look your very best said the story girl giving her skirt a lustrous swirl and enjoying the effect  aunt olivia spoils you said felicity  she doesnt either felicity king  aunt olivia is just sweet she kisses me goodnight every night and your mother never kisses you  my mother doesnt make kisses so common retorted felicity but she gives us pie for dinner every day  so does aunt olivia  yes but look at the difference in the size of the pieces  and aunt olivia only gives you skim milk  my mother gives us cream  aunt olivias skim milk is as good as your mothers cream cried the story girl hotly  oh girls dont fight said cecily the peacemaker  its such a nice day and well have a nice time if you dont spoil it by fighting  were not fighting said felicity  and i like aunt olivia but my mother is just as good as aunt olivia there now  of course she is  aunt janet is splendid agreed the story girl  they smiled at each other amicably  felicity and the story girl were really quite fond of each other under the queer surface friction that commonly resulted from their intercourse  you said once you knew a story about the awkward man said felix  you might tell it to us  all right agreed the story girl  the only trouble is i dont know the whole story  but ill tell you all i do know  i call it the mystery of the golden milestone  oh i dont believe that story is true said felicity  i believe mrs griggs was just romancing  she does romance mother says  yes but i dont believe she could ever have thought of such a thing as this herself so i believe it must be true said the story girl  anyway this is the story boys  you know the awkward man has lived alone ever since his mother died ten years ago  abel griggs is his hired man and he and his wife live in a little house down the awkward mans lane  mrs griggs makes his bread for him and she cleans up his house now and then  she says he keeps it very neat  but till last fall there was one room she never saw  it was always lockedthe west one looking out over his garden  one day last fall the awkward man went to summerside and mrs griggs scrubbed his kitchen  then she went over the whole house and she tried the door of the west room mrs griggs is a very curious woman  uncle roger says all women have as much curiosity as is good for them but mrs griggs has more  she expected to find the door locked as usual  it was not locked  she opened it and went in  what do you suppose she found  something likelike bluebeards chamber suggested felix in a scared tone  oh no no  nothing like that could happen in prince edward island  but if there had been beautiful wives hanging up by their hair all round the walls i dont believe mrs griggs could have been much more astonished  the room had never been furnished in his mothers time but now it was elegantly furnished though mrs griggs says she doesnt know when or how that furniture was brought there  she says she never saw a room like it in a country farmhouse  it was like a bedroom and sittingroom combined  the floor was covered with a carpet like green velvet  there were fine lace curtains at the windows and beautiful pictures on the walls  there was a little white bed and a dressingtable a bookcase full of books a stand with a work basket on it and a rockingchair  there was a womans picture above the bookcase  mrs griggs says she thinks it was a coloured photograph but she didnt know who it was  anyway it was a very pretty girl  but the most amazing thing of all was that a womans dress was hanging over a chair by the table  mrs griggs says it never belonged to jasper dales mother for she thought it a sin to wear anything but print and drugget and this dress was of pale blue silk  besides that there was a pair of blue satin slippers on the floor beside ithighheeled slippers and on the flyleaves of the books the name alice was written now there never was an alice in the dale connection and nobody ever heard of the awkward man having a sweetheart  there isnt that a lovely mystery  its a pretty queer yarn said felix  i wonder if it is trueand what it means  i intend to find out what it means said the story girl  i am going to get acquainted with the awkward man sometime and then ill find out his alicesecret  i dont see how youll ever get acquainted with him said felicity  he never goes anywhere except to church  he just stays home and reads books when he isnt working  mother says he is a perfect hermit  ill manage it somehow said the story girland we had no doubt that she would  but i must wait until im a little older for he wouldnt tell the secret of the west room to a little girl  and i mustnt wait till im too old for he is frightened of grownup girls because he thinks they laugh at his awkwardness  i know i will like him  he has such a nice face even if he is awkward  he looks like a man you could tell things to  well id like a man who could move around without falling over his own feet said felicity  and then the look of him  uncle roger says he is long lank lean narrow and contracted  things always sound worse than they are when uncle roger says them said the story girl  uncle edward says jasper dale is a very clever man and its a great pity he wasnt able to finish his college course  he went to college two years you know then his father died and he stayed home with his mother because she was very delicate  i call him a hero  i wonder if it is true that he writes poetry  mrs griggs says it is  she says she has seen him writing it in a brown book  she said she couldnt get near enough to read it but she knew it was poetry by the shape of it  very likely  if that blue silk dress story is true id believe anything of him said felicity  we were near golden milestone now  the house was a big weathergray structure overgrown with vines and climbing roses something about the three square windows in the second story gave it an appearance of winking at us in a friendly fashion through its vinesat least so the story girl said and indeed we could see it for ourselves after she had once pointed it out to us  we did not get into the house however  we met the awkward man in his yard and he gave us a quarter apiece for our library  he did not seem awkward or shy but then we were only children and his foot was on his native heath  he was a tall slender man who did not look his forty years so unwrinkled was his high white forehead so clear and lustrous his large darkblue eyes so free from silver threads his rather long black hair  he had large hands and feet and walked with a slight stoop  i am afraid we stared at him rather rudely while the story girl talked to him  but was not an awkward man who was also a hermit and kept blue silk dresses in a locked room and possibly wrote poetry a legitimate object of curiosity  i leave it to you  when we got away we compared notes and found that we all liked himand this although he had said little and had appeared somewhat glad to get rid of us  he gave us the money like a gentleman said the story girl  i felt he didnt grudge it  and now for mr campbell  it was on his account i put on my red silk  i dont suppose the awkward man noticed it at all but mr campbell will or im much mistaken    chapter vii how betty sherman won a husband  the rest of us did not share the story girls enthusiasm regarding our call on mr campbell  we secretly dreaded it  if as was said he detested children who knew what sort of a reception we might meet  mr campbell was a rich retired farmer who took life easily he had visited new york and boston toronto and montreal he had even been as far as the pacific coast  therefore he was regarded in carlisle as a much travelled man and he was known to be well read and intelligent  but it was also known that mr campbell was not always in a good humour  if he liked you there was nothing he would not do for you if he disliked youwell you were not left in ignorance of it  in short we had the impression that mr campbell resembled the famous little girl with the curl in the middle of her forehead  when he was good he was very very good and when he was bad he was horrid  what if this were one of his horrid days  he cant do anything to us you know said the story girl  he may be rude but that wont hurt any one but himself  hard words break no bones observed felicity philosophically  but they hurt your feelings  i am afraid of mr campbell said cecily candidly  perhaps wed better give up and go home suggested dan  you can go home if you like said the story girl scornfully but i am going to see mr campbell  i know i can manage him but if i have to go alone and he gives me anything ill keep it all for my own collection mind you  that settled it  we were not going to let the story girl get ahead of us in the manner of collecting  mr campbells housekeeper ushered us into his parlour and left us  presently mr campbell himself was standing in the doorway looking us over  we took heart of grace  it seemed to be one of his good days for there was a quizzical smile on his broad cleanshaven stronglyfeatured face  mr campbell was a tall man with a massive head well thatched with thick black hair graystreaked  he had big black eyes with many wrinkles around them and a thin firm longlipped mouth  we thought him handsome for an old man  his gaze wandered over us with uncomplimentary indifference until it fell on the story girl leaning back in an armchair  she looked like a slender red lily in the unstudied grace of her attitude  a spark flashed into mr campbells black eyes  is this a sunday school deputation he inquired rather ironically  no we have come to ask a favour of you said the story girl  the magic of her voice worked its will on mr campbell as on all others  he came in sat down hooked his thumb into his vest pocket and smiled at her  what is it he asked  we are collecting for our school library and we have called to ask you for a contribution she replied  why should i contribute to your school library demanded mr campbell  this was a poser for us  why should he indeed  but the story girl was quite equal to it  leaning forward and throwing an indescribable witchery into tone and eyes and smile she said  because a lady asks you  mr campbell chuckled  the best of all reasons he said  but see here my dear young lady im an old miser and curmudgeon as you may have heard  i hate to part with my money even for a good reason  and i never part with any of it unless i am to receive some benefit from the expenditure  now what earthly good could i get from your three by six school library  none whatever  but i shall make you a fair offer  i have heard from my housekeepers urchin of a son that you are a master hand to tell stories  tell me one here and now  i shall pay you in proportion to the entertainment you afford me  come now and do your prettiest  there was a fine mockery in his tone that put the story girl on her mettle instantly  she sprang to her feet an amazing change coming over her  her eyes flashed and burned crimson spots glowed in her cheeks  i shall tell you the story of the sherman girls and how betty sherman won a husband she said  we gasped  was the story girl crazy  or had she forgotten that betty sherman was mr campbells own greatgrandmother and that her method of winning a husband was not exactly in accordance with maidenly traditions  but mr campbell chuckled again  an excellent test he said  if you can amuse me with that story you must be a wonder  ive heard it so often that it has no more interest for me than the alphabet  one cold winter day eighty years ago began the story girl without further parley donald fraser was sitting by the window of his new house playing his fiddle for company and looking out over the white frozen bay before his door  it was bitter bitter cold and a storm was brewing  but storm or no storm donald meant to go over the bay that evening to see nancy sherman  he was thinking of her as he played annie laurie for nancy was more beautiful than the lady of the song  her face it is the fairest that eer the sun shone on hummed donaldand oh he thought so too  he did not know whether nancy cared for him or not  he had many rivals  but he knew that if she would not come to be the mistress of his new house no one else ever should  so he sat there that afternoon and dreamed of her as he played sweet old songs and rollicking jigs on his fiddle  while he was playing a sleigh drove up to the door and neil campbell came in  donald was not overly glad to see him for he suspected where he was going  neil campbell who was highland scotch and lived down at berwick was courting nancy sherman too and what was far worse nancys father favoured him because he was a richer man than donald fraser  but donald was not going to show all he thoughtscotch people never doand he pretended to be very glad to see neil and made him heartily welcome  neil sat down by the roaring fire looking quite well satisfied with himself  it was ten miles from berwick to the bay shore and a call at a half way house was just the thing  then donald brought out the whisky  they always did that eighty years ago you know  if you were a woman you could give your visitors a dish of tea but if you were a man and did not offer them a taste of whisky you were thought either very mean or very ignorant  you look cold said donald in his great hearty voice  sit nearer the fire man and put a bit of warmth in your veins its bitter cold the day  and now tell me the berwick news  has jean mclean made up with her man yet  and is it true that sandy mcquarrie is to marry kate ferguson  twill be a match now sure with her red hair sandy will not be like to lose his bride past finding  neil had plenty of news to tell  and the more whisky he drank the more he told  he didnt notice that donald was not taking much  neil talked on and on and of course he soon began to tell things it would have been much wiser not to tell  finally he told donald that he was going over the bay to ask nancy sherman that very night to marry him  and if she would have him then donald and all the folks should see a wedding that was a wedding  oh wasnt donald taken aback  this was more than he had expected  neil hadnt been courting nancy very long and donald never dreamed he would propose to her quite so soon  at first donald didnt know what to do  he felt sure deep down in his heart that nancy liked him  she was very shy and modest but you know a girl can let a man see she likes him without going out of her way  but donald knew that if neil proposed first he would have the best chance  neil was rich and the shermans were poor and old elias sherman would have the most to say in the matter  if he told nancy she must take neil campbell she would never dream of disobeying him  old elias sherman was a man who had to be obeyed  but if nancy had only promised some one else first her father would not make her break her word  wasnt it a hard plight for poor donald  but he was a scotchman you know and its pretty hard to stick a scotchman long  presently a twinkle came into his eyes for he remembered that all was fair in love and war  so he said to neil oh so persuasively  have some more man have some more  twill keep the heart in you in the teeth of that wind  help yourself  theres plenty more where that came from  neil didnt want much persuasion  he took some more and said slyly  is it going over the bay the night that yourself will be doing  donald shook his head  i had thought of it he owned but it looks a wee like a storm and my sleigh is at the blacksmiths to be shod  if i went it must be on black dans back and he likes a canter over the ice in a snowstorm as little as i  his own fireside is the best place for a man tonight campbell  have another taste man have another taste  neil went on tasting and that sly donald sat there with a sober face but laughing eyes and coaxed him on  at last neils head fell forward on his breast and he was sound asleep  donald got up put on his overcoat and cap and went to the door  may your sleep be long and sweet man he said laughing softly and as for the waking twill be betwixt you and me  with that he untied neils horse climbed into neils sleigh and tucked neils buffalo robe about him  now bess old girl do your bonniest he said  theres more than you know hangs on your speed  if the campbell wakes too soon black dan could show you a pair of clean heels for all your good start  on my girl  brown bess went over the ice like a deer and donald kept thinking of what he should say to nancyand more still of what she would say to him  suppose he was mistaken  suppose she said no  neil would have the laugh on me then  sure hes sleeping well and the snow is coming soon  therell be a bonny swirl on the bay ere long  i hope no harm will come to the lad if he starts to cross  when he wakes hell be in such a fine highland temper that hell never stop to think of danger  well bess old girl here we are  now donald fraser pluck up heart and play the man  never flinch because a slip of a lass looks scornful at you out of the bonniest darkblue eyes on earth  but in spite of his bold words donalds heart was thumping as he drove into the sherman yard  nancy was there milking a cow by the stable door but she stood up when she saw donald coming oh she was very beautiful  her hair was like a skein of golden silk and her eyes were as blue as the gulf water when the sun breaks out after a storm  donald felt more nervous than ever but he knew he must make the most of his chance  he might not see nancy alone again before neil came  he caught her hand and stammered out  nan lass i love you  you may think tis a hasty wooing but thats a story i can tell you later maybe  i know well im not worthy of you but if true love could make a man worthy thered be none before me  will you have me nan  nancy didnt say she would have him  she just looked it and donald kissed her right there in the snow  the next morning the storm was over  donald knew neil must be soon on his track  he did not want to make the sherman house the scene of a quarrel so he resolved to get away before the campbell came  he persuaded nancy to go with him to visit some friends in another settlement  as he brought neils sleigh up to the door he saw a black speck far out on the bay and laughed  black dan goes well but hell not be quick enough he said  half an hour later neil campbell rushed into the sherman kitchen and oh how angry he was  there was nobody there but betty sherman and betty was not afraid of him  she was never afraid of anybody  she was very handsome with hair as brown as october nuts and black eyes and crimson cheeks and she had always been in love with neil campbell herself  good morning mr campbell she said with a toss of her head its early abroad you are  and on black dan no less  was i mistaken in thinking that donald fraser said once that his favourite horse should never be backed by any man but him  but doubtless a fair exchange is no robbery and brown bess is a good mare in her way  where is donald fraser said neil shaking his fist  its him im seeking and its him i will be finding  where is he betty sherman  donald fraser is far enough away by this time mocked betty he is a prudent fellow and has some quickness of wit under that sandy thatch of his  he came here last night at sunset with a horse and sleigh not his own or lately gotten and he asked nan in the stable yard to marry him  did a man ask me to marry him at the cows side with a milking pail in my hand its a cold answer hed get for his pains  but nan thought differently and they sat late together last night and twas a bonny story nan wakened me to hear when she came to bedthe story of a braw lover who let his secret out when the whisky was above the wit and then fell asleep while his rival was away to woo and win his lass  did you ever hear a like story mr campbell  oh yes said neil fiercely  it is laughing at me over the country side and telling that story that donald fraser will be doing is it  but when i meet him it is not laughing he will be doing  oh no  there will be another story to tell  now dont meddle with the man cried betty  what a state to be in because one goodlooking lass likes sandy hair and gray eyes better than highland black and blue  you have not the spirit of a wren neil campbell  were i you i would show donald fraser that i could woo and win a lass as speedily as any lowlander of them all that i would  theres many a girl would gladly say yes for your asking  and here stands one  why not marry me neil campbell  folks say im as bonny as nanand i could love you as well as nan loves her donalday and ten times better  what do you suppose the campbell did  why just the thing he ought to have done  he took betty at her word on the spot and there was a double wedding soon after  and it is said that neil and betty were the happiest couple in the worldhappier even than donald and nancy  so all was well because it ended well  the story girl curtsied until her silken skirts swept the floor then she flung herself in her chair and looked at mr campbell flushed triumphant daring  the story was old to us  it had once been published in a charlottetown paper and we had read in aunt olivias scrapbook where the story girl had learned it  but we had listened entranced  i have written down the bare words of the story as she told it but i can never reproduce the charm and colour and spirit she infused into it  it lived for us  donald and neil nancy and betty were there in that room with us  we saw the flashes of expression on their faces we heard their voices angry or tender mocking or merry in lowland and highland accent  we realized all the mingled coquetry and feeling and defiance and archness in betty shermans daring speech  we had even forgotten all about mr campbell  that gentleman in silence took out his wallet extracted a note therefrom and handed it gravely to the story girl  there are five dollars for you he said and your story was well worth it  you are a wonder  some day you will make the world realize it  ive been about a bit and heard some good things but ive never enjoyed anything more than that threadbare old story i heard in my cradle  and now will you do me a favour  of course said the delighted story girl  recite the multiplication table for me said mr campbell  we stared  well might mr campbell be called eccentric  what on earth did he want the multiplication table recited for  even the story girl was surprised  but she began promptly with twice one and went through it to twelve times twelve  she repeated it simply but her voice changed from one tone to another as each in succession grew tired  we had never dreamed that there was so much in the multiplication table  as she announced it the fact that three times three was nine was exquisitely ridiculous five times six almost brought tears to our eyes eight times seven was the most tragic and frightful thing ever heard of and twelve times twelve rang like a trumpet call to victory  mr campbell nodded his satisfaction  i thought you could do it he said  the other day i found this statement in a book  her voice would have made the multiplication table charming i thought of it when i heard yours  i didnt believe it before but i do now  then he let us go  you see said the story girl as we went home you need never be afraid of people  but we are not all story girls said cecily  that night we heard felicity talking to cecily in their room  mr campbell never noticed one of us except the story girl she said but if i had put on my best dress as she did maybe she wouldnt have taken all the attention  could you ever do what betty sherman did do you suppose asked cecily absently  no but i believe the story girl could answered felicity rather snappishly    chapter viii a tragedy of childhood  the story girl went to charlottetown for a week in june to visit aunt louisa  life seemed very colourless without her and even felicity admitted that it was lonesome  but three days after her departure felix told us something on the way home from school which lent some spice to existence immediately  what do you think he said in a very solemn yet excited tone jerry cowan told me at recess this afternoon that he had seen a picture of godthat he has it at home in an old redcovered history of the world and has looked at it often  to think that jerry cowan should have seen such a picture often we were as deeply impressed as felix had meant us to be  did he say what it was like asked peter  noonly that it was a picture of god walking in the garden of eden  oh whispered felicitywe all spoke in low tones on the subject for by instinct and training we thought and uttered the great name with reverence in spite of our devouring curiosityoh would jerry cowan bring it to school and let us see it  i asked him that soon as ever he told me said felix  he said he might but he couldnt promise for hed have to ask his mother if he could bring the book to school  if shell let him hell bring it tomorrow  oh ill be almost afraid to look at it said sara ray tremulously  i think we all shared her fear to some extent  nevertheless we went to school the next day burning with curiosity  and we were disappointed  possibly night had brought counsel to jerry cowan or perhaps his mother had put him up to it  at all events he announced to us that he couldnt bring the redcovered history to school but if we wanted to buy the picture outright he would tear it out of the book and sell it to us for fifty cents  we talked the matter over in serious conclave in the orchard that evening  we were all rather short of hard cash having devoted most of our spare means to the school library fund  but the general consensus of opinion was that we must have the picture no matter what pecuniary sacrifices were involved  if we could each give about seven cents we would have the amount  peter could only give four but dan gave eleven which squared matters  fifty cents would be pretty dear for any other picture but of course this is different said dan  and theres a picture of eden thrown in too you know added felicity  fancy selling gods picture said cecily in a shocked awed tone  nobody but a cowan would do it and thats a fact said dan  when we get it well keep it in the family bible said felicity  thats the only proper place  oh i wonder what it will be like breathed cecily  we all wondered  next day in school we agreed to jerry cowans terms and jerry promised to bring the picture up to uncle alecs the following afternoon  we were all intensely excited saturday morning  to our dismay it began to rain just before dinner  what if jerry doesnt bring the picture today because of the rain i suggested  never you fear answered felicity decidedly  a cowan would come through anything for fifty cents  after dinner we all without any verbal decision about it washed our faces and combed our hair  the girls put on their second best dresses and we boys donned white collars  we all had the unuttered feeling that we must do such honour to that picture as we could  felicity and dan began a small spat over something but stopped at once when cecily said severely  how dare you quarrel when you are going to look at a picture of god today  owing to the rain we could not foregather in the orchard where we had meant to transact the business with jerry  we did not wish our grownups around at our great moment so we betook ourselves to the loft of the granary in the spruce wood from whose window we could see the main road and hail jerry  sara ray had joined us very pale and nervous having had so it appeared a difference of opinion with her mother about coming up the hill in the rain  im afraid i did very wrong to come against mas will she said miserably but i couldnt wait  i wanted to see the picture as soon as you did  we waited and watched at the window  the valley was full of mist and the rain was coming down in slanting lines over the tops of the spruces  but as we waited the clouds broke away and the sun came out flashingly the drops on the spruce boughs glittered like diamonds  i dont believe jerry can be coming said cecily in despair i suppose his mother must have thought it was dreadful after all to sell such a picture  there he is now cried dan waving excitedly from the window  hes carrying a fishbasket said felicity  you surely dont suppose he would bring that picture in a fishbasket  jerry had brought it in a fishbasket as appeared when he mounted the granary stairs shortly afterwards  it was folded up in a newspaper packet on top of the dried herring with which the basket was filled  we paid him his money but we would not open the packet until he had gone  cecily said felicity in a hushed tone  you are the best of us all  you open the parcel  oh im no gooder than the rest of you breathed cecily but ill open it if you like  with trembling fingers cecily opened the parcel  we stood around hardly breathing  she unfolded it and held it up  we saw it  suddenly sara began to cry  oh oh oh does god look like that she wailed  felix and i spoke not  disappointment and something worse sealed our speech  did god look like thatlike that stern angrily frowning old man with the tossing hair and beard of the woodcut cecily held  i suppose he must since that is his picture said dan miserably  he looks awful cross said peter simply  oh i wish wed never never seen it cried cecily  we all wished thattoo late  our curiosity had led us into some holy of holies not to be profaned by human eyes and this was our punishment  ive always had a feeling right along wept sara that it wasnt right to buyor look atgods picture  as we stood there wretchedly we heard flying feet below and a blithe voice calling  where are you children  the story girl had returned  at any other moment we would have rushed to meet her in wild joy  but now we were too crushed and miserable to move  whatever is the matter with you all demanded the story girl appearing at the top of the stairs  what is sara crying about what have you got there  a picture of god said cecily with a sob in her voice and oh it is so dreadful and ugly  look  the story girl looked  an expression of scorn came over her face  surely you dont believe god looks like that she said impatiently while her fine eyes flashed  he doesnthe couldnt  he is wonderful and beautiful  im surprised at you that is nothing but the picture of a cross old man  hope sprang up in our hearts although we were not wholly convinced  i dont know said dan dubiously  it says under the picture god in the garden of eden its printed  well i suppose thats what the man who drew it thought god was like answered the story girl carelessly  but he couldnt have known any more than you do  he had never seen him  its all very well for you to say so said felicity but you dont know either  i wish i could believe that isnt like godbut i dont know what to believe  well if you wont believe me i suppose youll believe the minister said the story girl  go and ask him  hes in the house this very minute  he came up with us in the buggy  at any other time we would never have dared catechize the minister about anything  but desperate cases call for desperate measures  we drew straws to see who should go and do the asking and the lot fell to felix  better wait until mr marwood leaves and catch him in the lane advised the story girl  youll have a lot of grownups around you in the house  felix took her advice  mr marwood presently walking benignantly along the lane was confronted by a fat small boy with a pale face but resolute eyes  the rest of us remained in the background but within hearing  well felix what is it asked mr marwood kindly  please sir does god really look like this asked felix holding out the picture  we hope he doesntbut we want to know the truth and that is why im bothering you  please excuse us and tell me  the minister looked at the picture  a stern expression came into his gentle blue eyes and he got as near to frowning as it was possible for him to get  where did you get that thing he asked  thing  we began to breathe easier  we bought it from jerry cowan  he found it in a redcovered history of the world  it says its gods picture said felix  it is nothing of the sort said mr marwood indignantly there is no such thing as a picture of god felix  no human being knows what he looks likeno human being can know  we should not even try to think what he looks like  but felix you may be sure that god is infinitely more beautiful and loving and tender and kind than anything we can imagine of him  never believe anything else my boy  as for thisthis sacrilegetake it and burn it  we did not know what a sacrilege meant but we knew that mr marwood had declared that the picture was not like god  that was enough for us  we felt as if a terrible weight had been lifted from our minds  i could hardly believe the story girl but of course the minister knows said dan happily  weve lost fifty cents because of it said felicity gloomily  we had lost something of infinitely more value than fifty cents although we did not realize it just then  the ministers words had removed from our minds the bitter belief that god was like that picture but on something deeper and more enduring than mind an impression had been made that was never to be removed  the mischief was done  from that day to this the thought or the mention of god brings up before us involuntarily the vision of a stern angry old man  such was the price we were to pay for the indulgence of a curiosity which each of us deep in our hearts had like sara ray felt ought not to be gratified  mr marwood told me to burn it said felix  it doesnt seem reverent to do that said cecily  even if it isnt gods picture it has his name on it  bury it said the story girl  we did bury it after tea in the depths of the spruce grove and then we went into the orchard  it was so nice to have the story girl back again  she had wreathed her hair with canterbury bells and looked like the incarnation of rhyme and story and dream  canterbury bells is a lovely name for a flower isnt it she said  it makes you think of cathedrals and chimes doesnt it lets go over to uncle stephens walk and sit on the branches of the big tree  its too wet on the grass and i know a storya true story about an old lady i saw in town at aunt louisas such a dear old lady with lovely silvery curls  after the rain the air seemed dripping with odours in the warm west windthe tang of fir balsam the spice of mint the wild woodsiness of ferns the aroma of grasses steeping in the sunshineand with it all a breath of wild sweetness from far hill pastures  scattered through the grass in uncle stephens walk were blossoming pale aerial flowers which had no name that we could ever discover  nobody seemed to know anything about them  they had been there when greatgrandfather king bought the place  i have never seen them elsewhere or found them described in any floral catalogue  we called them the white ladies  the story girl gave them the name  she said they looked like the souls of good women who had had to suffer much and had been very patient they were wonderfully dainty with a strange faint aromatic perfume which was only to be detected at a little distance and vanished if you bent over them  they faded soon after they were plucked and although strangers greatly admiring them often carried away roots and seeds they could never be coaxed to grow elsewhere  my story is about mrs dunbar and the captain of the fanny said the story girl settling herself comfortably on a bough with her brown head against a gnarled trunk  its sad and beautifuland true  i do love to tell stories that i know really happened  mrs dunbar lives next door to aunt louisa in town  she is so sweet  you wouldnt think to look at her that she had a tragedy in her life but she has  aunt louisa told me the tale  it all happened long long ago  interesting things like this all did happen long ago it seems to me  they never seem to happen now  this was in 49 when people were rushing to the gold fields in california  it was just like a fever aunt louisa says  people took it right here on the island and a number of young men determined they would go to california  it is easy to go to california now but it was a very different matter then  there were no railroads across the land as there are now and if you wanted to go to california you had to go in a sailing vessel all the way around cape horn  it was a long and dangerous journey and sometimes it took over six months  when you got there you had no way of sending word home again except by the same plan  it might be over a year before your people at home heard a word about youand fancy what their feelings would be  but these young men didnt think of these things they were led on by a golden vision  they made all their arrangements and they chartered the brig fanny to take them to california  the captain of the fanny is the hero of my story  his name was alan dunbar and he was young and handsome  heroes always are you know but aunt louisa says he really was  and he was in lovewildly in lovewith margaret grant  margaret was as beautiful as a dream with soft blue eyes and clouds of golden hair and she loved alan dunbar just as much as he loved her but her parents were bitterly opposed to him and they had forbidden margaret to see him or speak to him  they hadnt anything against him as a man but they didnt want her to throw herself away on a sailor  well when alan dunbar knew that he must go to california in the fanny he was in despair  he felt that he could never go so far away for so long and leave his margaret behind  and margaret felt that she could never let him go  i know exactly how she felt  how can you know interrupted peter suddenly  you aint old enough to have a beau how can you know  the story girl looked at peter with a frown  she did not like to be interrupted when telling a story  those are not things one knows about she said with dignity one feels about them  peter crushed but not convinced subsided and the story girl went on  finally margaret ran away with alan and they were married in charlottetown  alan intended to take his wife with him to california in the fanny  if it was a hard journey for a man it was harder still for a woman but margaret would have dared anything for alans sake  they had three daysonly three daysof happiness and then the blow fell  the crew and the passengers of the fanny refused to let captain dunbar take his wife with him  they told him he must leave her behind  and all his prayers were of no avail  they say he stood on the deck of the fanny and pleaded with the men while the tears ran down his face but they would not yield and he had to leave margaret behind  oh what a parting it was  there was heartbreak in the story girls voice and tears came into our eyes  there in the green bower of uncle stephens walk we cried over the pathos of a parting whose anguish had been stilled for many years  when it was all over margarets father and mother forgave her and she went back home to waitto wait  oh it is so dreadful just to wait and do nothing else  margaret waited for nearly a year  how long it must have seemed to her  and at last there came a letterbut not from alan  alan was dead  he had died in california and had been buried there  while margaret had been thinking of him and longing for him and praying for him he had been lying in his lonely faraway grave  cecily sprang up shaking with sobs  oh dontdont go on she implored  i cant bear any more  there is no more said the story girl  that was the end of itthe end of everything for margaret  it didnt kill her but her heart died  i just wish id hold of those fellows who wouldnt let the captain take his wife said peter savagely  well it was awful said said felicity wiping her eyes  but it was long ago and we cant do any good by crying over it now let us go and get something to eat  i made some nice little rhubarb tarts this morning  we went  in spite of new disappointments and old heartbreaks we had appetites  and felicity did make scrumptious rhubarb tarts    chapter ix magic seed  when the time came to hand in our collections for the library fund peter had the largestthree dollars  felicity was a good second with two and a half  this was simply because the hens had laid so well  if youd had to pay father for all the extra handfuls of wheat youve fed to those hens miss felicity you wouldnt have so much said dan spitefully  i didnt said felicity indignantly  look how aunt olivias hens laid too and she fed them herself just the same as usual  never mind said cecily we have all got something to give if you were like poor sara ray and hadnt been able to collect anything you might feel bad  but sara ray had something to give  she came up the hill after tea all radiant  when sara ray smiledand she did not waste her smilesshe was rather pretty in a plaintive apologetic way a dimple or two came into sight and she had very nice teethsmall and white like the traditional row of pearls  oh just look she said  here are three dollarsand im going to give it all to the library fund  i had a letter today from uncle arthur in winnipeg and he sent me three dollars  he said i was to use it any way i liked so ma couldnt refuse to let me give it to the fund  she thinks its an awful waste but she always goes by what uncle arthur says  oh ive prayed so hard that some money might come some way and now it has  see what praying does  i was very much afraid that we did not rejoice quite as unselfishly in saras good fortune as we should have done  we had earned our contributions by the sweat of our brow or by the scarcely less disagreeable method of begging  and saras had as good as descended upon her out of the skies as much like a miracle as anything you could imagine  she prayed for it you know said felix after sara had gone home  thats too easy a way of earning money grumbled peter resentfully  if the rest of us had just set down and done nothing only prayed how much do you spose wed have  it dont seem fair to me  oh well its different with sara said dan  we could earn money and she couldnt  you see  but come on down to the orchard  the story girl had a letter from her father today and shes going to read it to us  we went promptly  a letter from the story girls father was always an event and to hear her read it was almost as good as hearing her tell a story  before coming to carlisle uncle blair stanley had been a mere name to us  now he was a personality  his letters to the story girl the pictures and sketches he sent her her adoring and frequent mention of him all combined to make him very real to us  we felt then what we did not understand till later years that our grownup relatives did not altogether admire or approve of uncle blair  he belonged to a different world from theirs  they had never known him very intimately or understood him  i realize now that uncle blair was a bit of a bohemiana respectable sort of tramp  had he been a poor man he might have been a more successful artist  but he had a small fortune of his own and lacking the spur of necessity or of disquieting ambition he remained little more than a clever amateur  once in a while he painted a picture which showed what he could do but for the rest he was satisfied to wander over the world lighthearted and content  we knew that the story girl was thought to resemble him strongly in appearance and temperament but she had far more fire and intensity and strength of willher inheritance from king and ward  she would never be satisfied as a dabbler whatever her future career should be into it she would throw all her powers of mind and heart and soul  but uncle blair could do at least one thing surpassingly well he could write letters  such letters  by contrast felix and i were secretly ashamed of fathers epistles  father could talk well but as felix said he couldnt write worth a cent  the letters we had received from him since his arrival in rio de janeiro were mere scrawls telling us to be good boys and not trouble aunt janet incidentally adding that he was well and lonesome  felix and i were always glad to get his letters but we never read them aloud to an admiring circle in the orchard  uncle blair was spending the summer in switzerland and the letter the story girl read to us among the fair frail white ladies of the walk where the west wind came now with a sigh and again with a rush and then brushed our faces as softly as the down of a thistle was full of the glamour of mountainrimmed lakes and purple chalets and snowy summits old in story  we climbed mount blanc saw the jungfrau soaring into cloudland and walked among the gloomy pillars of bonnivards prison  finally the story girl told us the tale of the prisoner of chillon in words that were byrons but in a voice that was all her own  it must be splendid to go to europe sighed cecily longingly  i am going some day said the story girl airily  we looked at her with a slightly incredulous awe  to us in those years europe seemed almost as remote and unreachable as the moon  it was hard to believe that one of us should ever go there  but aunt julia had goneand she had been brought up in carlisle on this very farm  so it was possible that the story girl might go too  what will you do there asked peter practically  i shall learn how to tell stories to all the world said the story girl dreamily  it was a lovely goldenbrown evening the orchard and the farmlands beyond were full of ruby lights and kissing shadows over in the east above the awkward mans house the wedding veil of the proud princess floated across the sky presently turning as rosy as if bedewed with her hearts blood  we sat there and talked until the first star lighted a white taper over the beech hill  then i remembered that i had forgotten to take my dose of magic seed and i hastened to do it although i was beginning to lose faith in it  i had not grown a single bit by the merciless testimony of the hall door  i took the box of seed out of my trunk in the twilit room and swallowed the decreed pinch  as i did so dans voice rang out behind me  beverley king what have you got there  i thrust the box hastily into my trunk and confronted dan  none of your business i said defiantly  yes tis  dan was too much in earnest to resent my blunt speech  look here bev is that magic seed  and did you get it from billy robinson  dan and i looked at each other suspicion dawning in our eyes  what do you know about billy robinson and his magic seed i demanded  just this  i bought a box from him forforsomething  he said he wasnt going to sell any of it to anybody else  did he sell any to you  yes he did i said in disgustfor i was beginning to understand that billy and his magic seed were arrant frauds  what for  your mouth is a decent size said dan  mouth  it had nothing to do with my mouth  he said it would make me grow tall  and it hasntnot an inch  i dont see what you wanted it for  you are tall enough  i got it for my mouth said dan with a shamefaced grin  the girls in school laugh at it so  kate marr says its like a gash in a pie  billy said that seed would shrink it for sure  well there it was  billy had deceived us both  nor were we the only victims  we did not find the whole story out at once indeed the summer was almost over before in one way or another the full measure of that shameless billy robinsons iniquity was revealed to us  but i shall anticipate the successive relations in this chapter  every pupil of carlisle school so it eventually appeared had bought magic seed under solemn promise of secrecy  felix had believed blissfully that it would make him thin  cecilys hair was to become naturally curly and sara ray was not to be afraid of peg bowen any more  it was to make felicity as clever as the story girl and it was to make the story girl as good a cook as felicity  what peter had bought magic seed for remained a secret longer than any of the others finallyit was the night before what we expected would be the judgment dayhe confessed to me that he had taken it to make felicity fond of him  skilfully indeed had that astute billy played on our respective weaknesses  the keenest edge to our humiliation was given by the discovery that the magic seed was nothing more or less than caraway which grew in abundance at billy robinsons uncles in markdale  peg bowen had had nothing to do with it  well we had all been badly hoaxed  but we did not trumpet our wrongs abroad  we did not even call billy to account  we thought that least said was soonest mended in such a matter  we went very softly indeed lest the grownups especially that terrible uncle roger should hear of it  we should have known better than to trust billy robinson said felicity summing up the case one evening when all had been made known  after all what could you expect from a pig but a grunt  we were not surprised to find that billy robinsons contribution to the library fund was the largest handed in by any of the scholars  cecily said she didnt envy him his conscience  but i am afraid she measured his conscience by her own  i doubt very much if billys troubled him at all    chapter x a daughter of eve  i hate the thought of growing up said the story girl reflectively because i can never go barefooted then and nobody will ever see what beautiful feet i have  she was sitting the july sunlight on the ledge of the open hayloft window in uncle rogers big barn and the bare feet below her print skirt were beautiful  they were slender and shapely and satin smooth with arched insteps the daintiest of toes and nails like pink shells  we were all the hayloft  the story girl had been telling us a tale      of old unhappy faroff things     and battles long ago  felicity and cecily were curled up in a corner and we boys sprawled idly on the fragrant sunwarm heaps  we had stowed the hay in the loft that morning for uncle roger so we felt that we had earned the right to loll on our sweetsmelling couch haylofts are delicious places with just enough of shadow and soft uncertain noises to give an agreeable tang of mystery  the swallows flew in and out of their nest above our heads and whenever a sunbeam fell through a chink the air swarmed with golden dust  outside of the loft was a vast sunshiny gulf of blue sky and mellow air wherein floated argosies of fluffy cloud and airy tops of maple and spruce  pat was with us of course prowling about stealthily or making frantic bootless leaps at the swallows  a cat in a hayloft is a beautiful example of the eternal fitness of things  we had not heard of this fitness then but we all felt that paddy was in his own place in a hayloft  i think it is very vain to talk about anything you have yourself being beautiful said felicity  i am not a bit vain said the story girl with entire truthfulness  it is not vanity to know your own good points it would just be stupidity if you didnt  its only vanity when you get puffed up about them  i am not a bit pretty  my only good points are my hair and eyes and feet  so i think its real mean that one of them has to be covered up the most of the time im always glad when it gets warm enough to go barefooted  but when i grow up theyll have to covered all the time  it is mean  youll have to put your shoes and stockings on when you go to the magic lantern show tonight said felicity in a tone of satisfaction  i dont know that  im thinking of going barefooted  oh you wouldnt  sara stanley youre not in earnest exclaimed felicity her blue eyes filling with horror  the story girl winked with the side of her face next to felix and me but the side next the girls changed not a muscle  she dearly loved to take a rise out of felicity now and then  indeed i would if i just made up my mind to  why not  why not bare feetif theyre cleanas well as bare hands and face  oh you wouldnt  it would be such a disgrace said poor felicity in real distress  we went to school barefooted all june argued that wicked story girl  what is the difference between going to the schoolhouse barefooted in the daytime and going in the evening  oh theres every difference  i cant just explain itbut every one knows there is a difference  you know it yourself oh please dont do such a thing sara  well i wont just to oblige you said the story girl who would have died the death before she would have gone to a public meeting barefooted  we were all rather excited over the magic lantern show which an itinerant lecturer was to give in the schoolhouse that evening even felix and i who had seen such shows galore were interested and the rest were quite wild  there had never been such a thing in carlisle before  we were all going peter included  peter went everywhere with us now  he was a regular attendant at church and sunday school where his behaviour was as irreproachable as if he had been raised in the caste of vere de vere  it was feather in the story girls cap for she took all the credit of having started peter on the right road  felicity was resigned although the fatal patch on peters best trousers was still an eyesore to her  she declared she never got any good of the singing because peter stood up then and every one could see the patch  mrs james clark whose pew was behind ours never took her eye off itor so felicity averred  but peters stockings were always darned  aunt olivia had seen to that ever since she heard of peters singular device regarding them on his first sunday  she had also given peter a bible of which he was so proud that he hated to use it lest he should soil it  i think ill wrap it up and keep it in my box he said  ive an old bible of aunt janes at home that i can use  i spose its just the same even if it is old isnt it  oh yes cecily had assured him  the bible is always the same  i thought maybe theyd got some new improvements on it since aunt janes day said peter relieved  sara ray is coming along the lane and shes crying announced dan who was peering out of a knothole on the opposite side of the loft  sara ray is crying half her time said cecily impatiently im sure she cries a quartful of tears a month  there are times when you cant help crying  but i hide then  sara just goes and cries in public  the lachrymose sara presently joined us and we discovered the cause of her tears to be the doleful fact that her mother had forbidden her to go to the magic lantern show that night  we all showed the sympathy we felt  she said yesterday you could go said the story girl indignantly  why has she changed her mind  because of the measles in markdale sobbed sara  she says markdale is full of them and therell be sure to be some of the markdale people at the show  so im not to go  and ive never seen a magic lanternive never seen anything  i dont believe theres any danger of catching measles said felicity  if there was we wouldnt be allowed to go  i wish i could get the measles said sara defiantly  maybe id be of some importance to ma then  suppose cecily goes down with you and coaxes your mother suggested the story girl  perhaps shed let you go then  she likes cecily  she doesnt like either felicity or me so it would only make matters worse for us to try  mas gone to townpa and her went this afternoonand theyre not coming back till tomorrow  theres nobody home but judy pineau and me  then said the story girl why dont you just go to the show anyhow  your mother wont ever know if you coax judy to hold her tongue  oh but thats wrong said felicity  you shouldnt put sara up to disobeying her mother  now felicity for once was undoubtedly right  the story girls suggestion was wrong and if it had been cecily who protested the story girl would probably have listened to her and proceeded no further in the matter  but felicity was one of those unfortunate people whose protests against wrongdoing serve only to drive the wrongdoer further on her sinful way  the story girl resented felicitys superior tone and proceeded to tempt sara in right good earnest  the rest of us held our tongues  it was we told ourselves saras own lookout  i have a good mind to do it said sara  but i cant get my good clothes theyre in the spare room and ma locked the door for fear somebody would get at the fruit cake  i havent a single thing to wear except my school gingham  well thats new and pretty said the story girl  well lend you some things  you can have my lace collar  thatll make the gingham quite elegant  and cecily will lend you her second best hat  but ive no shoes or stockings  theyre locked up too  you can have a pair of mine said felicity who probably thought that since sara was certain to yield to temptation she might as well be garbed decently for her transgression  sara did yield  when the story girls voice entreated it was not easy to resist its temptation even if you wanted to  that evening when we started for the schoolhouse sara ray was among us decked out in borrowed plumes  suppose she does catch the measles felicity said aside  i dont believe therell be anybody there from markdale  the lecturer is going to markdale next week  theyll wait for that said the story girl airily  it was a cool dewy evening and we walked down the long red hill in the highest of spirits  over a valley filled with beech and spruce was a sunset afterglowcreamy yellow and a hue that was not so much red as the dream of red with a young moon swung low in it  the air was sweet with the breath of mown hayfields where swaths of clover had been steeping in the sun  wild roses grew pinkly along the fences and the roadsides were stardusted with buttercups  those of us who had nothing the matter with our consciences enjoyed our walk to the little whitewashed schoolhouse in the valley  felicity and cecily were void of offence towards all men  the story girl walked uprightly like an incarnate flame in her crimson silk  her pretty feet were hidden in the tancoloured buttoned paris boots which were the secret envy of every school girl in carlisle  but sara ray was not happy  her face was so melancholy that the story girl lost patience with her  the story girl herself was not altogether at ease  probably her own conscience was troubling her  but admit it she would not  now sara she said you just take my advice and go into this with all your heart if you go at all  never mind if it is bad theres no use being naughty if you spoil your fun by wishing all the time you were good  you can repent afterwards but there is no use in mixing the two things together  im not repenting protested sara  im only scared of ma finding it out  oh  the story girls voice expressed her scorn  for remorse she had understanding and sympathy but fear of her fellow creatures was something unknown to her  didnt judy pineau promise you solemnly she wouldnt tell  yes but maybe some one who sees me there will mention it to ma  well if youre so scared youd better not go  it isnt too late  heres your own gate said cecily  but sara could not give up the delights of the show  so she walked on a small miserable testimony that the way of the transgressor is never easy even when said transgressor is only a damsel of eleven  the magic lantern show was a splendid one  the views were good and the lecturer witty  we repeated his jokes to each other all the way home  sara who had not enjoyed the exhibition at all seemed to feel more cheerful when it was over and she was going home  the story girl on the contrary was gloomy  there were markdale people there she confided to me and the williamsons live next door to the cowans who have measles  i wish id never egged sara on to goingbut dont tell felicity i said so  if sara ray had really enjoyed the show i wouldnt mind  but she didnt  i could see that  so ive done wrong and made her do wrongand theres nothing to show for it  the night was scented and mysterious  the wind was playing an eerie fleshless melody in the reeds of the brook hollow  the sky was dark and starry and across it the milky way flung its shimmering misty ribbons  theres four hundred million stars in the milky way quoth peter who frequently astonished us by knowing more than any hired boy could be expected to  he had a retentive memory and never forgot anything he heard or read  the few books left to him by his oftreferredto aunt jane had stocked his mind with a miscellaneous information which sometimes made felix and me doubt if we knew as much as peter after all  felicity was so impressed by his knowledge of astronomy that she dropped back from the other girls and walked beside him  she had not done so before because he was barefooted  it was permissible for hired boys to go to public meetingswhen not held in the churchwith bare feet and no particular disgrace attached to it  but felicity would not walk with a barefooted companion  it was dark now so nobody would notice his feet  i know a story about the milky way said the story girl brightening up  i read it in a book of aunt louisas in town and i learned it off by heart  once there were two archangels in heaven named zerah and zulamith  have angels namessame as people interrupted peter  yes of course  they must have  theyd be all mixed up if they hadnt  and when im an angelif i ever get to be onewill my name still be peter  no  youll have a new name up there said cecily gently  it says so in the bible  well im glad of that  peter would be such a funny name for an angel  and what is the difference between angels and archangels  oh archangels are angels that have been angels so long that theyve had time to grow better and brighter and more beautiful than newer angels said the story girl who probably made that explanation up on the spur of the moment just to pacify peter  how long does it take for an angel to grow into an archangel pursued peter  oh i dont know  millions of years likely  and even then i dont suppose all the angels do  a good many of them must just stay plain angels i expect  i shall be satisfied just to be a plain angel said felicity modestly  oh see here if youre going to interrupt and argue over everything well never get the story told said felix  dry up all of you and let the story girl go on  we dried up and the story girl went on  zerah and zulamith loved each other just as mortals love and this is forbidden by the laws of the almighty  and because zerah and zulamith had so broken gods law they were banished from his presence to the uttermost bounds of the universe  if they had been banished together it would have been no punishment so zerah was exiled to a star on one side of the universe and zulamith was sent to a star on the other side of the universe and between them was a fathomless abyss which thought itself could not cross only one thing could cross itand that was love  zulamith yearned for zerah with such fidelity and longing that he began to build up a bridge of light from his star and zerah not knowing this but loving and longing for him began to build a similar bridge of light from her star  for a thousand thousand years they both built the bridge of light and at last they met and sprang into each others arms  their toil and loneliness and suffering were all over and forgotten and the bridge they had built spanned the gulf between their stars of exile  now when the other archangels saw what had been done they flew in fear and anger to gods white throne and cried to him  see what these rebellious ones have done  they have built them a bridge of light across the universe and set thy decree of separation at naught  do thou then stretch forth thine arm and destroy their impious work  they ceasedand all heaven was hushed  through the silence sounded the voice of the almighty  nay he said whatsoever in my universe true love hath builded not even the almighty can destroy  the bridge must stand forever  and concluded the story girl her face upturned to the sky and her big eyes filled with starlight it stands still  that bridge is the milky way  what a lovely story sighed sara ray who had been wooed to a temporary forgetfulness of her woes by its charm  the rest of us came back to earth feeling that we had been wandering among the hosts of heaven  we were not old enough to appreciate fully the wonderful meaning of the legend but we felt its beauty and its appeal  to us forevermore the milky way would be not peters overwhelming garland of suns but the lucent bridge lovecreated on which the banished archangels crossed from star to star  we had to go up sara rays lane with her to her very door for she was afraid peg bowen would catch her if she went alone  then the story girl and i walked up the hill together  peter and felicity lagged behind  cecily and dan and felix were walking before us hand in hand singing a hymn  cecily had a very sweet voice and i listened in delight  but the story girl sighed  what if sara does take the measles she asked miserably  everyone has to have the measles sometime i said comfortingly and the younger you are the better    chapter xi the story girl does penance  ten days later aunt olivia and uncle roger went to town one evening to remain over night and the next day  peter and the story girl were to stay at uncle alecs during their absence  we were in the orchard at sunset listening to the story of king cophetua and the beggar maidall of us except peter who was hoeing turnips and felicity who had gone down the hill on an errand to mrs ray  the story girl impersonated the beggar maid so vividly and with such an illusion of beauty that we did not wonder in the least at the kings love for her  i had read the story before and it had been my opinion that it was rot  no king i felt certain would ever marry a beggar maid when he had princesses galore from whom to choose  but now i understood it all  when felicity returned we concluded from her expression that she had news  and she had  sara is real sick she said with regret and something that was not regret mingled in her voice  she has a cold and sore throat and she is feverish  mrs ray says if she isnt better by the morning shes going to send for the doctor  and she is afraid its the measles  felicity flung the last sentence at the story girl who turned very pale  oh do you suppose she caught them at the magic lantern show she said miserably  where else could she have caught them said felicity mercilessly  i didnt see her of coursemrs ray met me at the door and told me not to come in  but mrs ray says the measles always go awful hard with the raysif they dont die completely of them it leaves them deaf or half blind or something like that  of course added felicity her heart melting at sight of the misery in the story girls piteous eyes mrs ray always looks on the dark side and it may not be the measles sara has after all  but felicity had done her work too thoroughly  the story girl was not to be comforted  id give anything if id never put sara up to going to that show she said  its all my faultbut the punishment falls on sara and that isnt fair  id go this minute and confess the whole thing to mrs ray but if i did it might get sara into more trouble and i mustnt do that  i shant sleep a wink tonight  i dont think she did  she looked very pale and woebegone when she came down to breakfast  but for all that there was a certain exhilaration about her  im going to do penance all day for coaxing sara to disobey her mother she announced with chastened triumph  penance we murmured in bewilderment  yes  im going to deny myself everything i like and do everything i can think of that i dont like just to punish myself for being so wicked  and if any of you think of anything i dont just mention it to me  i thought it out last night maybe sara wont be so very sick if god sees im truly sorry  he can see it anyhow without youre doing anything said cecily  well my conscience will feel better  i dont believe presbyterians ever do penance said felicity dubiously  i never heard of one doing it  but the rest of us rather looked with favour on the story girls idea  we felt sure that she would do penance as picturesquely and thoroughly as she did everything else  you might put peas in your shoes you know suggested peter  the very thing  i never thought of that  ill get some after breakfast  im not going to eat a single thing all day except bread and waterand not much of that  this we felt was a heroic measure indeed  to sit down to one of aunt janets meals in ordinary health and appetite and eat nothing but bread and waterthat would be penance with a vengeance  we felt we could never do it  but the story girl did it  we admired and pitied her  but now i do not think that she either needed our pity or deserved our admiration  her ascetic fare was really sweeter to her than honey of hymettus  she was though quite unconsciously acting a part and tasting all the subtle joy of the artist which is so much more exquisite than any material pleasure  aunt janet of course noticed the story girls abstinence and asked if she was sick  no  i am just doing penance aunt janet for a sin i committed i cant confess it because that would bring trouble on another person  so im going to do penance all day  you dont mind do you  aunt janet was in a very good humour that morning so she merely laughed  not if you dont go too far with your nonsense she said tolerantly  thank you  and will you give me a handful of hard peas after breakfast aunt janet  i want to put them in my shoes  there isnt any i used the last in the soup yesterday  oh  the story girl was much disappointed  then i suppose ill have to do without  the new peas wouldnt hurt enough theyre so soft theyd just squash flat  ill tell you said peter ill pick up a lot of those little round pebbles on mr kings front walk  theyll be just as good as peas  youll do nothing of the sort said aunt janet  sara must not do penance in that way  she would wear holes in her stockings and might seriously bruise her feet  what would you say if i took a whip and whipped my bare shoulders till the blood came demanded the story girl aggrieved  i wouldnt say anything retorted aunt janet  id simply turn you over my knee and give you a sound solid spanking miss sara youd find that penance enough  the story girl was crimson with indignation  to have such a remark made to youwhen you were fourteen and a halfand before the boys too  really aunt janet could be very dreadful  it was vacation and there was not much to do that day we were soon free to seek the orchard  but the story girl would not come  she had seated herself in the darkest hottest corner of the kitchen with a piece of old cotton in her hand  i am not going to play today she said and im not going to tell a single story  aunt janet wont let me put pebbles in my shoes but ive put a thistle next my skin on my back and it sticks into me if i lean back the least bit  and im going to work buttonholes all over this cotton  i hate working buttonholes worse than anything in the world so im going to work them all day  whats the good of working buttonholes on an old rag asked felicity  it isnt any good  the beauty of penance is that it makes you feel uncomfortable  so it doesnt matter what you do whether its useful or not so long as its nasty  oh i wonder how sara is this morning  mothers going down this afternoon said felicity  she says none of us must go near the place till we know whether it is the measles or not  ive thought of a great penance said cecily eagerly  dont go to the missionary meeting tonight  the story girl looked piteous  i thought of that myselfbut i cant stay home cecily  it would be more than flesh and blood could endure  i must hear that missionary speak  they say he was all but eaten by cannibals once  just think how many new stories id have to tell after id heard him  no i must go but ill tell you what ill do  ill wear my school dress and hat  that will be penance felicity when you set the table for dinner put the brokenhandled knife for me  i hate it so  and im going to take a dose of mexican tea every two hours  its such dreadful tasting stuffbut its a good blood purifier so aunt janet cant object to it  the story girl carried out her selfimposed penance fully  all day she sat in the kitchen and worked buttonholes subsisting on bread and water and mexican tea  felicity did a mean thing  she went to work and made little raisin pies right there in the kitchen before the story girl the smell of raisin pies is something to tempt an anchorite and the story girl was exceedingly fond of them  felicity ate two in her very presence and then brought the rest out to us in the orchard  the story girl could see us through the window carousing without stint on raisin pies and uncle edwards cherries  but she worked on at her buttonholes  she would not look at the exciting serial in the new magazine dan brought home from the postoffice neither would she open a letter from her father  pat came over but his most seductive purrs won no notice from his mistress who refused herself the pleasure of even patting him  aunt janet could not go down the hill in the afternoon to find out how sara was because company came to teathe millwards from markdale  mr millward was a doctor and mrs millward was a ba  aunt janet was very desirous that everything should be as nice as possible and we were all sent to our rooms before tea to wash and dress up  the story girl slipped over home and when she came back we gasped  she had combed her hair out straight and braided it in a tight kinky pudgy braid and she wore an old dress of faded print with holes in the elbows and ragged flounces which was much too short for her  sara stanley have you taken leave of your senses demanded aunt janet  what do you mean by putting on such a rig  dont you know i have company to tea  yes and that is just why i put it on aunt janet  i want to mortify the flesh  ill mortify you if i catch you showing yourself to the millwards like that my girl  go right home and dress yourself decentlyor eat your supper in the kitchen  the story girl chose the latter alternative  she was highly indignant  i verily believe that to sit at the diningroom table in that shabby outgrown dress conscious of looking her ugliest and eating only bread and water before the critical millwards would have been positive bliss to her  when we went to the missionary meeting that evening the story girl wore her school dress and hat while felicity and cecily were in their pretty muslins  and she had tied her hair with a snuffbrown ribbon which was very unbecoming to her  the first person we saw in the church porch was mrs ray  she told us that sara had nothing worse than a feverish cold  the missionary had at least seven happy listeners that night  we were all glad that sara did not have measles and the story girl was radiant  now you see all your penance was wasted said felicity as we walked home keeping close together because of the rumour that peg bowen was abroad  oh i dont know  i feel better since i punished myself  but im going to make up for it tomorrow said the story girl energetically  in fact ill begin tonight  im going to the pantry as soon as i get home and ill read fathers letter before i go to bed  wasnt the missionary splendid  that cannibal story was simply grand  i tried to remember every word so that i can tell it just as he told it  missionaries are such noble people  id like to be a missionary and have adventures like that said felix  it would be all right if you could be sure the cannibals would be interrupted in the nick of time as his were said dan  but sposen they werent  nothing would prevent cannibals from eating felix if they once caught him giggled felicity  hes so nice and fat  i am sure felix felt very unlike a missionary at that precise moment  im going to put two cents more a week in my missionary box than ive been doing said cecily determinedly  two cents more a week out of cecilys egg money meant something of a sacrifice  it inspired the rest of us  we all decided to increase our weekly contribution by a cent or so  and peter who had had no missionary box at all up to this time determined to start one  i dont seem to be able to feel as intrested in missionaries as you folks do he said but maybe if i begin to give something ill get intrested  ill want to know how my moneys being spent  i wont be able to give much  when your fathers run away and your mother goes out washing and youre only old enough to get fifty cents a week you cant give much to the heathen  but ill do the best i can  my aunt jane was fond of missions  are there any methodist heathen  i spose i ought to give my box to them rather than to presbyterian heathen  no its only after theyre converted that theyre anything in particular said felicity  before that theyre just plain heathen  but if you want your money to go to a methodist missionary you can give it to the methodist minister at markdale i guess the presbyterians can get along without it and look after their own heathen  just smell mrs sampsons flowers said cecily as we passed a trim white paling close to the road over which blew odours sweeter than the perfume of arabys shore  her roses are all out and that bed of sweet william is a sight by daylight  sweet william is a dreadful name for a flower said the story girl  william is a mans name and men are never sweet  they are a great many nice things but they are not sweet and shouldnt be  that is for women  oh look at the moonshine on the road in that gap between the spruces  id like a dress of moonshine with stars for buttons  it wouldnt do said felicity decidedly  you could see through it  which seemed to settle the question of moonshine dresses effectually    chapter xii the blue chest of rachel ward  its utterly out of the question said aunt janet seriously when aunt janet said seriously that anything was out of the question it meant that she was thinking about it and would probably end up by doing it  if a thing really was out of the question she merely laughed and refused to discuss it at all  the particular matter in or out of the question that opening day of august was a project which uncle edward had recently mooted uncle edwards youngest daughter was to be married and uncle edward had written over urging uncle alec aunt janet and aunt olivia to go down to halifax for the wedding and spend a week there  uncle alec and aunt olivia were eager to go but aunt janet at first declared it was impossible  how could we go away and leave the place to the mercy of all those young ones she demanded  wed come home and find them all sick and the house burned down  not a bit of fear of it scoffed uncle roger  felicity is as good a housekeeper as you are and i shall be here to look after them all and keep them from burning the house down  youve been promising edward for years to visit him and youll never have a better chance  the haying is over and harvest isnt on and alec needs a change  he isnt looking well at all  i think it was uncle rogers last argument which convinced aunt janet  in the end she decided to go  uncle rogers house was to be closed and he and peter and the story girl were to take up their abode with us  we were all delighted  felicity in especial seemed to be in seventh heaven  to be left in sole charge of a big house with three meals a day to plan and prepare with poultry and cows and dairy and garden to superintend apparently furnished forth felicitys conception of paradise  of course we were all to help but felicity was to run things and she gloried in it  the story girl was pleased too  felicity is going to give me cooking lessons she confided to me as we walked in the orchard  isnt that fine  it will be easier when there are no grownups around to make me nervous and laugh if i make mistakes  uncle alec and aunts left on monday morning  poor aunt janet was full of dismal forebodings and gave us so many charges and warnings that we did not try to remember any of them uncle alec merely told us to be good and mind what uncle roger said  aunt olivia laughed at us out of her pansyblue eyes and told us she knew exactly what we felt like and hoped wed have a gorgeous time  mind they go to bed at a decent hour aunt janet called back to uncle roger as she drove out of the gate  and if anything dreadful happens telegraph us  then they were really gone and we were all left to keep house  uncle roger and peter went away to their work  felicity at once set the preparations for dinner agoing and allotted to each of us his portion of service  the story girl was to prepare the potatoes felix and dan were to pick and shell the peas cecily was to attend the fire i was to peel the turnips  felicity made our mouths water by announcing that she was going to make a rolypoly jam pudding for dinner  i peeled my turnips on the back porch put them in their pot and set them on the stove  then i was at liberty to watch the others who had longer jobs  the kitchen was a scene of happy activity  the story girl peeled her potatoes somewhat slowly and awkwardlyfor she was not deft at household tasks dan and felix shelled peas and tormented pat by attaching pods to his ears and tail felicity flushed and serious measured and stirred skilfully  i am sitting on a tragedy said the story girl suddenly  felix and i stared  we were not quite sure what a tragedy was but we did not think it was an old blue wooden chest such as the story girl was undoubtedly sitting on if eyesight counted for anything  the old chest filled up the corner between the table and the wall  neither felix nor i had ever thought about it particularly  it was very large and heavy and felicity generally said hard things of it when she swept the kitchen  this old blue chest holds a tragedy explained the story girl i know a story about it  cousin rachel wards wedding things are all in that old chest said felicity  who was cousin rachel ward  and why were her wedding things shut up in an old blue chest in uncle alecs kitchen  we demanded the tale instantly  the story girl told it to us as she peeled her potatoes  perhaps the potatoes sufferedfelicity declared the eyes were not properly done at allbut the story did not  it is a sad story said the story girl and it happened fifty years ago when grandfather and grandmother king were quite young  grandmothers cousin rachel ward came to spend a winter with them  she belonged to montreal and she was an orphan too just like the family ghost  i have never heard what she looked like but she must have been beautiful of course  mother says she was awful sentimental and romantic interjected felicity  well anyway she met will montague that winter  he was handsomeeverybody says so  and an awful flirt said felicity  felicity i wish you wouldnt interrupt  it spoils the effect what would you feel like if i went and kept stirring things that didnt belong to it into that pudding  i feel just the same way well will montague fell in love with rachel ward and she with him and it was all arranged that they were to be married from here in the spring  poor rachel was so happy that winter she made all her wedding things with her own hands  girls did then you know for there was no such thing as a sewingmachine  well at last in april the wedding day came and all the guests were here and rachel was dressed in her wedding robes waiting for her bridegroom  andthe story girl laid down her knife and potato and clasped her wet handswill montague never came  we felt as much of a shock as if we had been one of the expectant guests ourselves  what happened to him  was he killed too asked felix  the story girl sighed and resumed her work  no indeed  i wish he had been  that would have been suitable and romantic  no it was just something horrid  he had to run away for debt  fancy  he acted mean right through aunt janet says  he never sent even a word to rachel and she never heard from him again  pig said felix forcibly  she was brokenhearted of course  when she found out what had happened she took all her wedding things and her supply of linen and some presents that had been given her and packed them all away in this old blue chest  then she went away back to montreal and took the key with her  she never came back to the island againi suppose she couldnt bear to  and she has lived in montreal ever since and never married  she is an old woman nownearly seventyfive  and this chest has never been opened since  mother wrote to cousin rachel ten years ago said cecily and asked her if she might open the chest to see if the moths had got into it  theres a crack in the back as big as your finger cousin rachel wrote back that if it wasnt for one thing that was in the trunk she would ask mother to open the chest and dispose of the things as she liked  but she could not bear that any one but herself should see or touch that one thing  so she wanted it left as it was  ma said she washed her hands of it moths or no moths  she said if cousin rachel had to move that chest every time the floor had to be scrubbed it would cure her of her sentimental nonsense  but i think concluded cecily that i would feel just like cousin rachel in her place  what was the thing she couldnt bear any one to see i asked  ma thinks it was her wedding dress  but father says he believes it was will montagues picture said felicity  he saw her put it in  father knows some of the things that are in the chest he was ten years old and he saw her pack it  theres a white muslin wedding dress and a veilandandaafelicity dropped her eyes and blushed painfully  a petticoat embroidered by hand from hem to belt said the story girl calmly  and a china fruit basket with an apple on the handle went on felicity much relieved  and a tea set and a blue candlestick  id dearly love to see all the things that are in it said the story girl  pa says it must never be opened without cousin rachels permission said cecily  felix and i looked at the chest reverently  it had taken on a new significance in our eyes and seemed like a tomb wherein lay buried some dead romance of the vanished years  what happened to will montague i asked  nothing said the story girl viciously  he just went on living and flourishing  he patched up matters with his creditors after awhile and came back to the island and in the end he married a real nice girl with money and was very happy  did you ever hear of anything so unjust  beverley king suddenly cried felicity who had been peering into a pot youve gone and put the turnips on to boil whole just like potatoes  wasnt that right i cried in an agony of shame  right but felicity had already whisked the turnips out and was slicing them while all the others were laughing at me  i had added a tradition on my own account to the family archives  uncle roger roared when he heard it and he roared again at night over peters account of felix attempting to milk a cow  felix had previously acquired the knack of extracting milk from the udder  but he had never before tried to milk a whole cow  he did not get on well the cow tramped on his foot and finally upset the bucket  what are you to do when a cow wont stand straight spluttered felix angrily  thats the question said uncle roger shaking his head gravely  uncle rogers laughter was hard to bear but his gravity was harder  meanwhile in the pantry the story girl apronenshrouded was being initiated into the mysteries of breadmaking  under felicitys eyes she set the bread and on the morrow she was to bake it  the first thing you must do in the morning is knead it well said felicity and the earlier its done the betterbecause its such a warm night  with that we went to bed and slept as soundly as if tragedies of blue chests and turnips and crooked cows had no place in the scheme of things at all    chapter xiii an old proverb with a new meaning  it was halfpast five when we boys got up the next morning  we were joined on the stairs by felicity yawning and rosy  oh dear me i overslept myself  uncle roger wanted breakfast at six  well i suppose the fire is on anyhow for the story girl is up  i guess she got up early to knead the bread  she couldnt sleep all night for worrying over it  the fire was on and a flushed and triumphant story girl was taking a loaf of bread from the oven  just look she said proudly  i have every bit of the bread baked  i got up at three and it was lovely and light so i just gave it a right good kneading and popped it into the oven  and its all done and out of the way  but the loaves dont seem quite as big as they should be she added doubtfully  sara stanley  felicity flew across the kitchen  do you mean that you put the bread right into the oven after you kneaded it without leaving it to rise a second time  the story girl turned quite pale  yes i did she faltered  oh felicity wasnt it right  youve ruined the bread said felicity flatly  its as heavy as a stone  i declare sara stanley id rather have a little common sense than be a great story teller  bitter indeed was the poor story girls mortification  dont tell uncle roger she implored humbly  oh i wont tell him promised felicity amiably  its lucky theres enough old bread to do today  this will go to the hens but its an awful waste of good flour  the story girl crept out with felix and me to the morning orchard while dan and peter went to do the barn work  it isnt any use for me to try to learn to cook she said  never mind i said consolingly  you can tell splendid stories  but what good would that do a hungry boy wailed the story girl  boys aint always hungry said felix gravely  theres times when they aint  i dont believe it said the story girl drearily  besides added felix in the tone of one who says while there is life there is yet hope you may learn to cook yet if you keep on trying  but aunt olivia wont let me waste the stuff  my only hope was to learn this week  but i suppose felicity is so disgusted with me now that she wont give me any more lessons  i dont care said felix  i like you better than felicity even if you cant cook  theres lots of folks can make bread but there isnt many who can tell a story like you  but its better to be useful than just interesting sighed the story girl bitterly  and felicity who was useful would in her secret soul have given anything to be interesting  which is the way of human nature  company descended on us that afternoon  first came aunt janets sister mrs patterson with a daughter of sixteen years and a son of two  they were followed by a buggyload of markdale people and finally mrs elder frewen and her sister from vancouver with two small daughters of the latter arrived  it never rains but it pours said uncle roger as he went out to take their horse  but felicitys foot was on her native heath  she had been baking all the afternoon and with a pantry well stocked with biscuits cookies cakes and pies she cared not if all carlisle came to tea  cecily set the table and the story girl waited on it and washed all the dishes afterwards but all the blushing honours fell to felicity who received so many compliments that her airs were quite unbearable for the rest of the week  she presided at the head of the table with as much grace and dignity as if she had been five times twelve years old and seemed to know by instinct just who took sugar and who took it not  she was flushed with excitement and pleasure and was so pretty that i could hardly eat for looking at herwhich is the highest compliment in a boys power to pay  the story girl on the contrary was under eclipse  she was pale and lustreless from her disturbed night and early rising and no opportunity offered to tell a melting tale  nobody took any notice of her  it was felicitys day  after tea mrs frewen and her sister wished to visit their fathers grave in the carlisle churchyard  it appeared that everybody wanted to go with them but it was evident that somebody must stay home with jimmy patterson who had just fallen sound asleep on the kitchen sofa  dan finally volunteered to look after him  he had a new henty book which he wanted to finish and that he said was better fun than a walk to the graveyard  i think well be back before he wakes said mrs patterson and anyhow he is very good and wont be any trouble  dont let him go outside though  he has a cold now  we went away leaving dan sitting on the doorsill reading his book and jimmy p snoozing blissfully on the sofa  when we returnedfelix and the girls and i were ahead of the othersdan was still sitting in precisely the same place and attitude but there was no jimmy in sight  dan wheres the baby cried felicity  dan looked around  his jaw fell in blank amazement  i never say any one look as foolish as dan at that moment  good gracious i dont know he said helplessly  youve been so deep in that wretched book that hes got out and dear knows where he is cried felicity distractedly  i wasnt cried dan  he must be in the house  ive been sitting right across the door ever since you left and he couldnt have got out unless he crawled right over me  he must be in the house  he isnt in the kitchen said felicity rushing about wildly and he couldnt get into the other part of the house for i shut the hall door tight and no baby could open itand its shut tight yet  so are all the windows  he must have gone out of that door dan king and its your fault  he didnt go out of this door reiterated dan stubbornly  i know that  well where is he then  he isnt here  did he melt into air demanded felicity  oh come and look for him all of you dont stand round like ninnies  we must find him before his mother gets here  dan king youre an idiot  dan was too frightened to resent this at the time  however and wherever jimmy had gone he was gone so much was certain  we tore about the house and yard like maniacs we looked into every likely and unlikely place  but jimmy we could not find anymore than if he had indeed melted into air  mrs patterson came and we had not found him  things were getting serious  uncle roger and peter were summoned from the field  mrs patterson became hysterical and was taken into the spare room with such remedies as could be suggested  everybody blamed poor dan  cecily asked him what he would feel like if jimmy was never never found  the story girl had a gruesome recollection of some baby at markdale who had wandered away like that  and they never found him till the next spring and all they found washis skeleton with the grass growing through it she whispered  this beats me said uncle roger when a fruitless hour had elapsed  i do hope that baby hasnt wandered down to the swamp it seems impossible he could walk so far but i must go and see felicity hand me my high boots out from under the sofa theres a girl  felicity pale and tearful dropped on her knees and lifted the cretonne frill of the sofa  there his head pillowed hardly on uncle rogers boots lay jimmy patterson still sound asleep  well ill bejiggered said uncle roger  i knew he never went out of the door cried dan triumphantly  when the last buggy had driven away felicity set a batch of bread and the rest of us sat around the back porch steps in the cats light and ate cherries shooting the stones at each other cecily was in quest of information  what does it never rains but it pours mean  oh it means if anything happens something else is sure to happen said the story girl  ill illustrate  theres mrs murphy  she never had a proposal in her life till she was forty and then she had three in the one week and she was so flustered she took the wrong one and has been sorry ever since  do you see what it means now  yes i guess so said cecily somewhat doubtfully  later on we heard her imparting her newly acquired knowledge to felicity in the pantry  it never rains but it pours means that nobody wants to marry you for ever so long and then lots of people do    chapter xiv forbidden fruit  we were all with the exception of uncle roger more or less grumpy in the household of king next day  perhaps our nerves had been upset by the excitement attendant on jimmy pattersons disappearance  but it is more likely that our crankiness was the result of the supper we had eaten the previous night  even children cannot devour mince pie and cold fried pork ham and fruit cake before going to bed with entire impunity  aunt janet had forgotten to warn uncle roger to keep an eye on our bedtime snacks and we ate what seemed good unto us  some of us had frightful dreams and all of us carried chips on our shoulders at breakfast  felicity and dan began a bickering which they kept up the entire day  felicity had a natural aptitude for what we called bossing and in her mothers absence she deemed that she had a right to rule supreme  she knew better than to make any attempt to assert authority over the story girl and felix and i were allowed some length of tether but cecily dan and peter were expected to submit dutifully to her decrees  in the main they did but on this particular morning dan was plainly inclined to rebel  he had had time to grow sore over the things that felicity had said to him when jimmy patterson was thought lost and he began the day with a flatly expressed determination that he was not going to let felicity rule the roost  it was not a pleasant day and to make matters worse it rained until late in the afternoon  the story girl had not recovered from the mortifications of the previous day she would not talk and she would not tell a single story she sat on rachel wards chest and ate her breakfast with the air of a martyr  after breakfast she washed the dishes and did the bedroom work in grim silence then with a book under one arm and pat under the other she betook herself to the windowseat in the upstairs hall and would not be lured from that retreat charmed we never so wisely she stroked the purring paddy and read steadily on with maddening indifference to all our pleadings  even cecily the meek and mild was snappish and complained of headache  peter had gone home to see his mother and uncle roger had gone to markdale on business  sara ray came up but was so snubbed by felicity that she went home crying  felicity got the dinner by herself disdaining to ask or command assistance  she banged things about and rattled the stove covers until even cecily protested from her sofa  dan sat on the floor and whittled his sole aim and object being to make a mess and annoy felicity in which noble ambition he succeeded perfectly  i wish aunt janet and uncle alec were home said felix  its not half so much fun having the grownups away as i thought it would be  i wish i was back in toronto i said sulkily  the mince pie was to blame for that wish  i wish you were im sure said felicity riddling the fire noisily  any one who lives with you felicity king will always be wishing he was somewhere else said dan  i wasnt talking to you dan king retorted felicity speak when youre spoken to come when youre called  oh oh oh wailed cecily on the sofa  i wish it would stop raining  i wish my head would stop aching  i wish ma had never gone away  i wish youd leave felicity alone dan  i wish girls had some sense said danwhich brought the orgy of wishing to an end for the time  a wishing fairy might have had the time of her life in the king kitchen that morningparticularly if she were a cynically inclined fairy  but even the effects of unholy snacks wear away at length  by teatime things had brightened up  the rain had ceased and the old lowraftered room was full of sunshine which danced on the shining dishes of the dresser made mosaics on the floor and flickered over the table whereon a delicious meal was spread felicity had put on her blue muslin and looked so beautiful in it that her good humour was quite restored  cecilys headache was better and the story girl refreshed by an afternoon siesta came down with smiles and sparkling eyes  dan alone continued to nurse his grievances and would not even laugh when the story girl told us a tale brought to mind by some of the rev  mr scotts plums which were on the table  the rev mr scott was the man who thought the pulpit door must be made for speerits you know she said  i heard uncle edward telling ever so many stories about him  he was called to this congregation and he laboured here long and faithfully and was much beloved though he was very eccentric  what does that mean asked peter  hush  it just means queer said cecily nudging him with her elbow  a common man would be queer but when its a minister its eccentric  when he gets very old continued the story girl the presbytery thought it was time he was retired  he didnt think so but the presbytery had their way because there were so many of them to one of him  he was retired and a young man was called to carlisle  mr scott went to live in town but he came out to carlisle very often and visited all the people regularly just the same as when he was their minister  the young minister was a very good young man and tried to do his duty but he was dreadfully afraid of meeting old mr scott because he had been told that the old minister was very angry at being set aside and would likely give him a sound drubbing if he ever met him  one day the young minister was visiting the crawfords in markdale when they suddenly heard old mr scotts voice in the kitchen the young minister turned pale as the dead and implored mrs crawford to hid him  but she couldnt get him out of the room and all she could do was to hide him in the china closet  the young minister slipped into the china closet and old mr scott came into the room  he talked very nicely and read and prayed they made very long prayers in those days you know and at the end of his prayer he said oh lord bless the poor young man hiding in the closet  give him courage not to fear the face of man  make him a burning and a shining light to this sadly abused congregation  just imagine the feelings of the young minister in the china closet  but he came right out like a man though his face was very red as soon as mr scott had done praying and mr scott was lovely to him and shook hands and never mentioned the china closet  and they were the best of friends ever afterwards  how did old mr scott find out the young minister was in the closet asked felix  nobody ever knew  they supposed he had seen him through the window before he came into the house and guessed he must be in the closetbecause there was no way for him to get out of the room  mr scott planted the yellow plum tree in grandfathers time said cecily peeling one of the plums and when he did it he said it was as christian an act as he ever did  i wonder what he meant  i dont see anything very christian about planting a tree  i do said the story girl sagely  when next we assembled ourselves together it was after milking and the cares of the day were done with  we foregathered in the balsamfragrant aisles of the fir wood and ate early august apples to such an extent that the story girl said we made her think of the irishmans pig  an irishman who lived at markdale had a little pig she said and he gave it a pailful of mush  the pig at the whole pailful and then the irishman put the pig in the pail and it didnt fill more than half the pail  now how was that when it held a whole pailful of mush  this seemed to be a rather unanswerable kind of conundrum  we discussed the problem as we roamed the wood and dan and peter almost quarrelled over it dan maintaining that the thing was impossible and peter being of the opinion that the mush was somehow made thicker in the process of being eaten and so took up less room  during the discussion we came out to the fence of the hill pasture where grew the bad berry bushes  just what these bad berries were i cannot tell  we never knew their real name  they were small redclustered berries of a glossy seductive appearance and we were forbidden to eat them because it was thought they might be poisonous  dan picked a cluster and held it up  dan king dont you dare eat those berries said felicity in her bossiest tone  theyre poison  drop them right away  now dan had not had the slightest intention of eating the berries  but at felicitys prohibition the rebellion which had smouldered in him all day broke into sudden flame  he would show her  ill eat them if i please felicity king he said in a fury i dont believe theyre poison  look here  dan crammed the whole bunch into his capacious mouth and chewed it up  they taste great he said smacking and he ate two more clusters regardless of our horrorstricken protestations and felicitys pleadings  we feared that dan would drop dead on the spot  but nothing occurred immediately  when an hour had passed we concluded that the bad berries were not poison after all and we looked upon dan as quite a hero for daring to eat them  i knew they wouldnt hurt me he said loftily  felicitys so fond of making a fuss over everything  nevertheless when it grew dark and we returned to the house i noticed that dan was rather pale and quiet  he lay down on the kitchen sofa  dont you feel all right dan i whispered anxiously  shut up he said  i shut up  felicity and cecily were setting out a lunch in the pantry when we were all startled by a loud groan from the sofa  oh im sickim awful sick said dan abjectly all the defiance and bravado gone out of him  we all went to pieces except cecily who alone retained her presence of mind  have you got a pain in your stomach she demanded  ive got an awful pain here if thats where my stomach is moaned dan putting his hand on a portion of his anatomy considerably below his stomach  ohohoh  go for uncle roger commanded cecily pale but composed felicity put on the kettle  dan im going to give you mustard and warm water  the mustard and warm water produced its proper effect promptly but gave dan no relief  he continued to writhe and groan  uncle roger who had been summoned from his own place went at once for the doctor telling peter to go down the hill for mrs ray peter went but returned accompanied by sara only  mrs ray and judy pineau were both away  sara might better have stayed home she was of no use and could only add to the general confusion wandering aimlessly about crying and asking if dan was going to die  cecily took charge of things  felicity might charm the palate and the story girl bind captive the soul but when pain and sickness wrung the brow it was cecily who was the ministering angel  she made the writhing dan go to bed  she made him swallow every available antidote which was recommended in the doctors book and she applied hot cloths to him until her faithful little hands were half scalded off  there was no doubt dan was suffering intense pain  he moaned and writhed and cried for his mother  oh isnt it dreadful said felicity wringing her hands as she walked the kitchen floor  oh why doesnt the doctor come  i told dan the bad berries were poison  but surely they cant kill people altogether  pas cousin died of eating something forty years ago sobbed sara ray  hold your tongue said peter in a fierce whisper  you oughter have more sense than to say such things to the girls  they dont want to be any worse scared than they are  but pas cousin did die reiterated sara  my aunt jane used to rub whisky on for a pain suggested peter  we havent any whisky said felicity disapprovingly  this is a temperance house  but rubbing whisky on the outside isnt any harm argued peter its only when you take it inside it is bad for you  well we havent any anyhow said felicity  i suppose blueberry wine wouldnt do in its place  peter did not think blueberry wine would be any good  it was ten oclock before dan began to get better but from that time he improved rapidly  when the doctor who had been away from home when uncle roger reached markdale came at half past ten he found his patient very weak and white but free from pain  dr grier patted cecily on the head told her she was a little brick and had done just the right thing examined some of the fatal berries and gave it as his opinion that they were probably poisonous administered some powders to dan and advised him not to tamper with forbidden fruit in future and went away  mrs ray now appeared looking for sara and said she would stay all night with us  ill be much obliged to you if you will said uncle roger  i feel a bit shook  i urged janet and alec to go to halifax and took the responsibility of the children while they were away but i didnt know what i was letting myself in for  if anything had happened i could never have forgiven myselfthough i believe its beyond the power of mortal man to keep watch over the things children will eat  now you young fry get straight off to your beds  dan is out of danger and you cant do any more good  not that any of you have done much except cecily  shes got a head of her shoulders  its been a horrid day all through said felicity drearily as we climbed the stairs  i suppose we made it horrid ourselves said the story girl candidly  but itll be a good story to tell sometime she added  im awful tired and thankful sighed cecily  we all felt that way    chapter xv a disobedient brother  dan was his own man again in the morning though rather pale and weak he wanted to get up but cecily ordered him to stay in bed fortunately felicity forgot to repeat the command so dan did stay in bed  cecily carried his meals to him and read a henty book to him all her spare time  the story girl went up and told him wondrous tales and sara ray brought him a pudding she had made herself  saras intentions were good but the pudding well dan fed most of it to paddy who had curled himself up at the foot of the bed giving the world assurance of a cat by his mellifluous purring  aint he just a great old fellow said dan  he knows im kind of sick just as well as a human  he never pays no attention to me when im well  felix and peter and i were required to help uncle roger in some carpentering work that day and felicity indulged in one of the housecleaning orgies so dear to her soul so that it was evening before we were all free to meet in the orchard and loll on the grasses of uncle stephens walk  in august it was a place of shady sweetness fragrant with the odour of ripening apples full of dear delicate shadows  through its openings we looked afar to the blue rims of the hills and over green old tranquil fields lying the sunset glow  overhead the lacing leaves made a green murmurous roof  there was no such thing as hurry in the world while we lingered there and talked of cabbages and kings  a tale of the story girls wherein princes were thicker than blackberries and queens as common as buttercups led to our discussion of kings  we wondered what it would be like to be a king  peter thought it would be fine only kind of inconvenient wearing a crown all the time  oh but they dont said the story girl  maybe they used to once but now they wear hats  the crowns are just for special occasions  they look very much like other people if you can go by their photographs  i dont believe it would be much fun as a steady thing said cecily  id like to see a queen though  that is one thing i have against the islandyou never have a chance to see things like that here  the prince of wales was in charlottetown once said peter  my aunt jane saw him quite close by  that was before we were born and such a thing wont happen again until after were dead said cecily with very unusual pessimism  i think queens and kings were thicker long ago said the story girl  they do seem dreadfully scarce now  there isnt one in this country anywhere  perhaps ill get a glimpse of some when i go to europe  well the story girl was destined to stand before kings herself and she was to be one whom they delighted to honour  but we did not know that as we sat in the old orchard  we thought it quite sufficiently marvellous that she should expect to have the chance of just seeing them  can a queen do exactly as she pleases sara ray wanted to know  not nowadays explained the story girl  then i dont see any use in being one sara decided  a king cant do as he pleases now either said felix  if he tries to and if it isnt what pleases other people the parliament or something squelches him  isnt squelch a lovely word said the story girl irrelevantly  its so expressive  squuelch  certainly it was a lovely word as the story girl said it  even a king would not have minded being squelched if it were done to music like that  uncle roger says that martin forbes wife has squelched him said felicity  he says martin cant call his soul his own since he was married  im glad of it said cecily vindictively  we all stared  this was so very unlike cecily  martin forbes is the brother of a horrid man in summerside who called me johnny thats why she explained  he was visiting here with his wife two years ago and he called me johnny every time he spoke to me  just you fancy  ill never forgive him  that isnt a christian spirit said felicity rebukingly  i dont care  would you forgive james forbes if he had called you johnny demanded cecily  i know a story about martin forbes grandfather said the story girl  long ago they didnt have any choir in the carlisle churchjust a precentor you know  but at last they got a choir and andrew mcpherson was to sing bass in it  old mr forbes hadnt gone to church for years because he was so rheumatic but he went the first sunday the choir sang because he had never heard any one sing bass and wanted to hear what it was like grandfather king asked him what he thought of the choir  mr forbes said it was verra guid but as for andrews bass there was nae bass aboot itit was just a burrrr the hale time  if you could have heard the story girls burrrr not old mr forbes himself could have invested it with more of doric scorn we rolled over in the cool grass and screamed with laughter  poor dan said cecily compassionately  hes up there all alone in his room missing all the fun  i suppose its mean of us to be having such a good time here when he has to stay in bed  if dan hadnt done wrong eating the bad berries when he was told not to he wouldnt be sick said felicity  youre bound to catch it when you do wrong  it was just a providence he didnt die  that makes me think of another story about old mr scott said the story girl  you know i told you he was very angry because the presbytery made him retire  there were two ministers in particular he blamed for being at the bottom of it  one time a friend of his was trying to console him and said to him  you should be resigned to the will of providence  providence had nothing to do with it said old mr scott twas the mccloskeys and the devil  you shouldnt speak of thethedevil said felicity rather shocked  well thats just what mr scott said  oh its all right for a minister to speak of him  but it isnt nice for little girls  if you have to speak ofofhimyou might say the old scratch  that is what mother calls him  twas the mccloskeys and the old scratch said the story girl reflectively as if she were trying to see which version was the more effective  it wouldnt do she decided  i dont think its any harm to mention thethethat person when youre telling a story said cecily  its only in plain talking it doesnt do  it sounds too much like swearing then  i know another story about mr scott said the story girl not long after he was married his wife wasnt quite ready for church one morning when it was time to go  so just to teach her a lesson he drove off alone and left her to walk all the wayit was nearly two milesin the heat and dust  she took it very quietly  its the best way i guess when youre married to a man like old mr scott  but just a few sundays after wasnt he late himself  i suppose mrs scott thought that what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander for she slipped out and drove off to church as he had done  old mr scott finally arrived at the church pretty hot and dusty and in none too good a temper  he went into the pulpit leaned over it and looked at his wife sitting calmly in her pew at the side  it was cleverly done he said right out loud but dinna try it again  in the midst of our laughter pat came down the walk his stately tail waving over the grasses  he proved to be the precursor of dan clothed and in his right mind  do you think you should have got up dan said cecily anxiously  i had to said dan  the window was open and it was moren i could stand to hear you fellows laughing down here and me missing it all sides im all right again  i feel fine  i guess this will be a lesson to you dan king said felicity in her most maddening tone  i guess you wont forget it in a hurry  you wont go eating the bad berries another time when youre told not to  dan had picked out a soft spot in the grass for himself and was in the act of sitting down when felicitys tactful speech arrested him midway  he straightened up and turned a wrathful face on his provoking sister  then red with indignation but without a word he stalked up the walk  now hes gone off mad said cecily reproachfully  oh felicity why couldnt you have held your tongue  why what did i say to make him mad asked felicity in honest perplexity  i think its awful for brothers and sisters to be always quarrelling sighed cecily  the cowans fight all the time and you and dan will soon be as bad  oh talk sense said felicity  dans got so touchy it isnt safe to speak to him  i should think hed be sorry for all the trouble he made last night  but you just back him up in everything cecily  i dont  you do  and youve no business to specially when mothers away  she left me in charge  you didnt take much charge last night when dan got sick said felix maliciously  felicity had told him at tea that night he was getting fatter than ever  this was his titfortat  you were pretty glad to leave it all to cecily then  whos talking to you said felicity  now look here said the story girl the first thing we know well all be quarrelling and then some of us will sulk all day tomorrow  its dreadful to spoil a whole day  just lets all sit still and count a hundred before we say another word  we sat still and counted the hundred  when cecily finished she got up and went in search of dan resolved to soothe his wounded feelings  felicity called after her to tell dan there was a jam turnover she had put away in the pantry specially for him  felix held out to felicity a remarkably fine apple which he had been saving for his own consumption and the story girl began a tale of an enchanted maiden in a castle by the sea but we never heard the end of it  for just as the evening star was looking whitely through the rosy window of the west cecily came flying through the orchard wringing her hands  oh come come quick she gasped  dans eating the bad berries againhes et a whole bunch of themhe says hell show felicity  i cant stop him  come you and try  we rose in a body and rushed towards the house  in the yard we encountered dan emerging from the fir wood and champing the fatal berries with unrepentant relish  dan king do you want to commit suicide demanded the story girl  look here dan i expostulated  you shouldnt do this  think how sick you were last night and all the trouble you made for everybody  dont eat any more theres a good chap  all right said dan  ive et all i want  they taste fine  i dont believe it was them made me sick  but now that his anger was over he looked a little frightened felicity was not there  we found her in the kitchen lighting up the fire  bev fill the kettle with water and put it on to heat she said in a resigned tone  if dans going to be sick again weve got to be ready for it  i wish mother was home thats all  i hope shell never go away again  dan king you just wait till i tell her of the way youve acted  fudge  i aint going to be sick said dan  and if you begin telling tales felicity king ill tell some too  i know how many eggs mother said you could use while she was awayand i know how many you have used  i counted  so youd better mind your own business miss  a nice way to talk to your sister when you may be dead in an hours time retorted felicity in tears between her anger and her real alarm about dan  but in an hours time dan was still in good health and announced his intention of going to bed  he went and was soon sleeping as peacefully as if he had nothing on either conscience or stomach but felicity declared she meant to keep the water hot until all danger was past and we sat up to keep her company  we were sitting there when uncle roger walked in at eleven oclock  what on earth are you young fry doing up at this time of night he asked angrily  you should have been in your beds two hours ago  and with a roaring fire on a night thats hot enough to melt a brass monkey  have you taken leave of your senses  its because of dan explained felicity wearily  he went and et more of the bad berriesa whole lot of themand we were sure hed be sick again  but he hasnt been yet and now hes asleep  is that boy stark staring mad said uncle roger  it was felicitys fault cried cecily who always took dans part through evil report and good report  she told him she guessed hed learned a lesson and wouldnt do what shed told him not to again  so he went and et them because she vexed him so  felicity king if you dont watch out youll grow up into the sort of woman who drives her husband to drink said uncle roger gravely  how could i tell dan would act so like a mule cried felicity  get off to bed every one of you  its a thankful man ill be when your father and mother come home  the wretched bachelor who undertakes to look after a houseful of children like you is to be pitied  nobody will ever catch me doing it again  felicity is there anything fit to eat in the pantry  that last question was the most unkindest cut of all  felicity could have forgiven uncle roger anything but that  it really was unpardonable  she confided to me as we climbed the stairs that she hated uncle roger  her red lips quivered and the tears of wounded pride brimmed over in her beautiful blue eyes  in the dim candlelight she looked unbelievably pretty and appealing  i put my arm about her and gave her a cousinly salute  never you mind him felicity i said  hes only a grownup    chapter xvi the ghostly bell  friday was a comfortable day in the household of king  everybody was in good humour  the story girl sparkled through several tales that ranged from the afrites and jinns of eastern myth through the piping days of chivalry down to the homely anecdotes of carlisle workaday folks  she was in turn an oriental princess behind a silken veil the bride who followed her bridegroom to the wars of palestine disguised as a page the gallant lady who ransomed her diamond necklace by dancing a coranto with a highwayman on a moonlit heath and buskirks girl who joined the sons and daughters of temperance just to see what was into it and in each impersonation she was so thoroughly the thing impersonated that it was a matter of surprise to us when she emerged from each our own familiar story girl again  cecily and sara ray found a sweet new knitted lace pattern in an old magazine and spent a happy afternoon learning it and talking secrets  chancingaccidentally i vowto overhear certain of these secrets i learned that sara ray had named an apple for johnny priceand cecily trues you live there was eight seeds in it and you know eight means they both love while cecily admitted that willy fraser had written on his slate and showed it to her      if you love me as i love you     no knife can cut our love in two  but sara ray never you breathe this to a living soul  felix also averred that he heard sara ask cecily very seriously  cecily how old must we be before we can have a real beau  but sara always denied it so i am inclined to believe felix simply made it up himself  paddy distinguished himself by catching a rat and being intolerably conceited about ituntil sara ray cured him by calling him a dear sweet cat and kissing him between the ears  then pat sneaked abjectly off his tail drooping  he resented being called a sweet cat  he had a sense of humour had pat  very few cats have and most of them have such an inordinate appetite for flattery that they will swallow any amount of it and thrive thereon  paddy had a finer taste  the story girl and i were the only ones who could pay him compliments to his liking  the story girl would box his ears with her fist and say bless your gray heart paddy youre a good sort of old rascal and pat would purr his satisfaction i used to take a handful of the skin on his back shake him gently and say pat youve forgotten more than any human being ever knew and i vow paddy would lick his chops with delight  but to be called a sweet cat  oh sara sara  felicity triedand had the most gratifying luck witha new and complicated cake recipea gorgeous compound of a plumminess to make your mouth water  the number of eggs she used in it would have shocked aunt janets thrifty soul but that cake like beauty was its own excuse  uncle roger ate three slices of it at teatime and told felicity she was an artist  the poor man meant it as a compliment but felicity who knew uncle blair was an artist and had a poor opinion of such fry looked indignant and retorted indeed she wasnt  peter says theres any amount of raspberries back in the maple clearing said dan  sposen we all go after tea and pick some  id like to sighed felicity but wed come home tired and with all the milking to do  you boys better go alone  peter and i will attend to the milking for one evening said uncle roger  you can all go  i have an idea that a raspberry pie for tomorrow night when the folks come home would hit the right spot  accordingly after tea we all set off armed with jugs and cups felicity thoughtful creature also took a small basketful of jelly cookies along with her  we had to go back through the maple woods to the extreme end of uncle rogers farma pretty walk through a world of green whispering boughs and spicesweet ferns and shifting patches of sunlight  the raspberries were plentiful and we were not long in filling our receptacles  then we foregathered around a tiny wood spring cold and pellucid under its young maples and ate the jelly cookies and the story girl told us a tale of a haunted spring in a mountain glen where a fair white lady dwelt who pledged all comers in a golden cup with jewels bright  and if you drank of the cup with her said the story girl her eyes glowing through the emerald dusk about us you were never seen in the world again you were whisked straightway to fairyland and lived there with a fairy bride  and you never wanted to come back to earth because when you drank of the magic cup you forgot all your past life except for one day in every year when you were allowed to remember it  i wish there was such a place as fairylandand a way to get to it said cecily  i think there is such a placein spite of uncle edward said the story girl dreamily and i think there is a way of getting there too if we could only find it  well the story girl was right  there is such a place as fairylandbut only children can find the way to it  and they do not know that it is fairyland until they have grown so old that they forget the way  one bitter day when they seek it and cannot find it they realize what they have lost and that is the tragedy of life  on that day the gates of eden are shut behind them and the age of gold is over  henceforth they must dwell in the common light of common day  only a few who remain children at heart can ever find that fair lost path again and blessed are they above mortals  they and only they can bring us tidings from that dear country where we once sojourned and from which we must evermore be exiles  the world calls them its singers and poets and artists and storytellers but they are just people who have never forgotten the way to fairyland  as we sat there the awkward man passed by with his gun over his shoulder and his dog at his side  he did not look like an awkward man there in the heart of the maple woods  he strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed  the story girl kissed her fingertips to him with the delightful audacity which was a part of her and the awkward man plucked off his hat and swept her a stately and graceful bow  i dont understand why they call him the awkward man said cecily when he was out of earshot  youd understand why if you ever saw him at a party or a picnic said felicity trying to pass plates and dropping them whenever a woman looked at him  they say its pitiful to see him  i must get well acquainted with that man next summer said the story girl  if i put it off any longer it will be too late im growing so fast aunt olivia says ill have to wear ankle skirts next summer  if i begin to look grownup hell get frightened of me and then ill never find out the golden milestone mystery  do you think hell ever tell you who alice is i asked  i have a notion who alice is already said the mysterious creature  but she would tell us nothing more  when the jelly cookies were all eaten it was high time to be moving homeward for when the dark comes down there are more comfortable places than a rustling maple wood and the precincts of a possibly enchanted spring  when we reached the foot of the orchard and entered it through a gap in the hedge it was the magical mystical time of between lights  off to the west was a daffodil glow hanging over the valley of lost sunsets and grandfather kings huge willow rose up against it like a rounded mountain of foliage  in the east above the maple woods was a silvery sheen that hinted the moonrise  but the orchard was a place of shadows and mysterious sounds  midway up the open space in its heart we met peter and if ever a boy was given over to sheer terror that boy was peter  his face was as white as a sunburned face could be and his eyes were brimmed with panic  peter what is the matter cried cecily  theressomethingin the house ringing a bell  said peter in a shaking voice  not the story girl herself could have invested that something with more of creepy horror  we all drew close together  i felt a crinkly feeling along my back which i had never known before  if peter had not been so manifestly frightened we might have thought he was trying to pass a joke on us  but such abject terror as his could not be counterfeited  nonsense said felicity but her voice shook  there isnt a bell in the house to ring  you must have imagined it peter  or else uncle roger is trying to fool us  your uncle roger went to markdale right after milking said peter  he locked up the house and gave me the key  there wasnt a soul in it then that im sure of  i druv the cows to the pasture and i got back about fifteen minutes ago  i set down on the front door steps for a moment and all at once i heard a bell ring in the house eight times  i tell you i was skeered  i made a bolt for the orchardand you wont catch me going near that house till your uncle roger comes home  you wouldnt catch any of us doing it  we were almost as badly scared as peter  there we stood in a huddled demoralized group oh what an eerie place that orchard was  what shadows  what noises  what spooky swooping of bats  you couldnt look every way at once and goodness only knew what might be behind you  there cant be anybody in the house said felicity  well heres the keygo and see for yourself said peter  felicity had no intention of going and seeing  i think you boys ought to go she said retreating behind the defence of sex  you ought to be braver than girls  but we aint said felix candidly  i wouldnt be much scared of anything real  but a haunted house is a different thing  i always thought something had to be done in a place before it could be haunted said cecily  somebody killed or something like that you know  nothing like that ever happened in our family  the kings have always been respectable  perhaps it is emily kings ghost whispered felix  she never appeared anywhere but in the orchard said the story girl  oh oh children isnt there something under uncle alecs tree  we peered fearfully through the gloom  there was somethingsomething that wavered and flutteredadvancedretreated  thats only my old apron said felicity  i hung it there today when i was looking for the white hens nest  oh what shall we do  uncle roger may not be back for hours  i cant believe theres anything in the house  maybe its only peg bowen suggested dan  there was not a great deal of comfort in this  we were almost as much afraid of peg bowen as we would be of any spectral visitant  peter scoffed at the idea  peg bowen wasnt in the house before your uncle roger locked it up and how could she get in afterwards he said  no it isnt peg bowen  its something that walks  i know a story about a ghost said the story girl the ruling passion strong even in extremity  it is about a ghost with eyeholes but no eyes  dont cried cecily hysterically  dont you go on  dont you say another word i cant bear it  dont you  the story girl didnt  but she had said enough  there was something in the quality of a ghost with eyeholes but no eyes that froze our young blood  there never were in all the world six more badly scared children than those who huddled in the old king orchard that august night  all at oncesomethingleaped from the bough of a tree and alighted before us  we split the air with a simultaneous shriek we would have run one and all if there had been anywhere to run to  but there wasntall around us were only those shadowy arcades  then we saw with shame that it was only our paddy  pat pat i said picking him up feeling a certain comfort in his soft solid body  stay with us old fellow  but pat would none of us  he struggled out of my clasp and disappeared over the long grasses with soundless leaps  he was no longer our tame domestic well acquainted paddy  he was a strange furtive animala questing beast  presently the moon rose but this only made matters worse  the shadows had been still before now they moved and danced as the night wind tossed the boughs  the old house with its dreadful secret was white and clear against the dark background of spruces  we were woefully tired but we could not sit down because the grass was reeking with dew  the family ghost only appears in daylight said the story girl i wouldnt mind seeing a ghost in daylight  but after dark is another thing  theres no such thing as a ghost i said contemptuously  oh how i wished i could believe it  then what rung that bell said peter  bells dont ring of themselves i spose specially when there aint any in the house to ring  oh will uncle roger never come home sobbed felicity  i know hell laugh at us awful but its better to be laughed at than scared like this  uncle roger did not come until nearly ten  never was there a more welcome sound than the rumble of his wheels in the lane  we ran to the orchard gate and swarmed across the yard just as uncle roger alighted at the front door  he stared at us in the moonlight  have you tormented any one into eating more bad berries felicity he demanded  oh uncle roger dont go in implored felicity seriously theres something dreadful in theresomething that rings a bell  peter heard it  dont go in  theres no use asking the meaning of this i suppose said uncle roger with the calm of despair  ive gave up trying to fathom you young ones  peter wheres the key  what yarn have you been telling  i did hear a bell ring said peter stubbornly  uncle roger unlocked and flung open the front door  as he did so clear and sweet rang out ten belllike chimes  thats what i heard cried peter  theres the bell  we had to wait until uncle roger stopped laughing before we heard the explanation  we thought he never would stop  thats grandfather kings old clock striking he said as soon as he was able to speak  sammy prott came along after tea when you were away to the forge peter and i gave him permission to clean the old clock  he had it going merrily in no time  and now it has almost frightened you poor little monkeys to death  we heard uncle roger chuckling all the way to the barn  uncle roger can laugh said cecily with a quiver in her voice but its no laughing matter to be so scared  i just feel sick i was so frightened  i wouldnt mind if hed laugh once and have it done with it said felicity bitterly  but hell laugh at us for a year and tell the story to every soul that comes to the place  you cant blame him for that said the story girl  i shall tell it too  i dont care if the joke is as much on myself as any one  a story is a story no matter who its on  but it is hateful to be laughed atand grownups always do it  i never will when im grown up  ill remember better  its all peters fault said felicity  i do think he might have had more sense than to take a clock striking for a bell ringing  i never heard that kind of a strike before protested peter it dont sound a bit like other clocks  and the door was shut and the sound kind o muffled  its all very fine to say you would have known what it was but i dont believe you would  i wouldnt have said the story girl honestly  i thought it was a bell when i heard it and the door open too  let us be fair felicity  im dreadful tired sighed cecily  we were all dreadful tired for this was the third night of late hours and nerve racking strain  but it was over two hours since we had eaten the cookies and felicity suggested that a saucerful apiece of raspberries and cream would not be hard to take  it was not for any one but cecily who couldnt swallow a mouthful  im glad father and mother will be back tomorrow night she said  its too exciting when theyre away  thats my opinion    chapter xvii the proof of the pudding  felicity was cumbered with many cares the next morning  for one thing the whole house must be put in apple pie order and for another an elaborate supper must be prepared for the expected return of the travellers that night  felicity devoted her whole attention to this and left the secondary preparation of the regular meals to cecily and the story girl  it was agreed that the latter was to make a cornmeal pudding for dinner  in spite of her disaster with the bread the story girl had been taking cooking lessons from felicity all the week and getting on tolerably well although mindful of her former mistake she never ventured on anything without felicitys approval  but felicity had no time to oversee her this morning  you must attend to the pudding yourself she said  the recipes so plain and simple even you cant go astray and if theres anything you dont understand you can ask me  but dont bother me if you can help it  the story girl did not bother her once  the pudding was concocted and baked as the story girl proudly informed us when we came to the dinnertable all on her own hook  she was very proud of it and certainly as far as appearance went it justified her triumph  the slices were smooth and golden and smothered in the luscious maple sugar sauce which cecily had compounded were very fair to view  nevertheless although none of us not even uncle roger or felicity said a word at the time for fear of hurting the story girls feelings the pudding did not taste exactly as it should  it was toughdecidedly toughand lacked the richness of flavour which was customary in aunt janets cornmeal puddings  if it had not been for the abundant supply of sauce it would have been very dry eating indeed  eaten it was however to the last crumb  if it were not just what a cornmeal pudding might be the rest of the bill of fare had been extra good and our appetites matched it  i wish i was twins sos i could eat more said dan when he simply had to stop  what good would being twins do you asked peter  people who squint cant eat any more than people who dont squint can they  we could not see any connection between peters two questions  what has squinting got to do with twins asked dan  why twins are just people that squint arent they said peter  we thought he was trying to be funny until we found out that he was quite in earnest  then we laughed until peter got sulky  i dont care he said  hows a fellow to know  tommy and adam cowan over at markdale are twins and theyre both crosseyed  so i sposed that was what being twins meant  its all very fine for you fellows to laugh  i never went to school half as much as you did and you was brought up in toronto too if youd worked out ever since you was seven and just got to school in the winter thered be lots of things you wouldnt know either  never mind peter said cecily  you know lots of things they dont  but peter was not to be conciliated and took himself off in high dudgeon  to be laughed at before felicityto be laughed at by felicitywas something he could not endure  let cecily and the story girl cackle all they wanted to and let those stuckup toronto boys grin like chessycats but when felicity laughed at him the iron entered into peters soul  if the story girl laughed at peter the mills of the gods ground out his revenge for him in midafternoon  felicity having used up all the available cooking materials in the house had to stop perforce and she now determined to stuff two new pincushions she had been making for her room  we heard her rummaging in the pantry as we sat on the cool spruceshadowed cellar door outside where uncle roger was showing us how to make elderberry popguns  presently she came out frowning  cecily do you know where mother put the sawdust she emptied out of that old beaded pincushion of grandmother kings after she had sifted the needles out of it  i thought it was in the tin box  so it is said cecily  it isnt  there isnt a speck of sawdust in that box  the story girls face wore a quite indescribable expression compound of horror and shame  she need not have confessed  if she had but held her tongue the mystery of the sawdusts disappearance might have forever remained a mystery  she would have held her tongue as she afterwards confided to me if it had not been for a horrible fear which flashed into her mind that possibly sawdust puddings were not healthy for people to eatespecially if there might be needles in themand that if any mischief had been done in that direction it was her duty to undo it if possible at any cost of ridicule to herself  oh felicity she said her voice expressing a very anguish of humiliation iithought that stuff in the box was cornmeal and used it to make the pudding  felicity and cecily stared blankly at the story girl  we boys began to laugh but were checked midway by uncle roger  he was rocking himself back and forth with his hand pressed against his stomach  oh he groaned ive been wondering what these sharp pains ive been feeling ever since dinner meant  i know now  i must have swallowed a needleseveral needles perhaps  im done for  the poor story girl went very white  oh uncle roger could it be possible  you couldnt have swallowed a needle without knowing it  it would have stuck in your tongue or teeth  i didnt chew the pudding groaned uncle roger  it was too toughi just swallowed the chunks whole  he groaned and twisted and doubled himself up  but he overdid it  he was not as good an actor as the story girl  felicity looked scornfully at him  uncle roger you are not one bit sick she said deliberately you are just putting on  felicity if i die from the effects of eating sawdust pudding flavoured with needles youll be sorry you ever said such a thing to your poor old uncle said uncle roger reproachfully even if there were no needles in it sixtyyearold sawdust cant be good for my tummy  i daresay it wasnt even clean  well you know every one has to eat a peck of dirt in his life giggled felicity  but nobody has to eat it all at once retorted uncle roger with another groan  oh sara stanley its a thankful man i am that your aunt olivia is to be home tonight  youd have me kilt entirely by another day  i believe you did it on purpose to have a story to tell  uncle roger hobbled off to the barn still holding on to his stomach  do you think he really feels sick asked the story girl anxiously  no i dont said felicity  you neednt worry over him theres nothing the matter with him  i dont believe there were any needles in that sawdust  mother sifted it very carefully  i know a story about a man whose son swallowed a mouse said the story girl who would probably have known a story and tried to tell it if she were being led to the stake  and he ran and wakened up a very tired doctor just as he had got to sleep  oh doctor my son has swallowed a mouse he cried  what shall i do  tell him to swallow a cat roared the poor doctor and slammed his door  now if uncle roger has swallowed any needles maybe it would make it all right if he swallowed a pincushion  we all laughed  but felicity soon grew sober  it seems awful to think of eating a sawdust pudding  how on earth did you make such a mistake  it looked just like cornmeal said the story girl going from white to red in her shame  well im going to give up trying to cook and stick to things i can do  and if ever one of you mentions sawdust pudding to me ill never tell you another story as long as i live  the threat was effectual  never did we mention that unholy pudding  but the story girl could not so impose silence on the grownups especially uncle roger  he tormented her for the rest of the summer  never a breakfast did he sit down to without gravely inquiring if they were sure there was no sawdust in the porridge  not a tweak of rheumatism did he feel but he vowed it was due to a needle travelling about his body  and aunt olivia was warned to label all the pincushions in the house  contents sawdust not intended for puddings    chapter xviii how kissing was discovered  an august evening calm golden dewless can be very lovely  at sunset felicity cecily and sara ray dan felix and i were in the orchard sitting on the cool grasses at the base of the pulpit stone  in the west was a field of crocus sky over which pale cloud blossoms were scattered  uncle roger had gone to the station to meet the travellers and the diningroom table was spread with a feast of fat things  its been a jolly week take it all round said felix but im glad the grownups are coming back tonight especially uncle alec  i wonder if theyll bring us anything said dan  im thinking long to hear all about the wedding said felicity who was braiding timothy stalks into a collar for pat  you girls are always thinking about weddings and getting married said dan contemptuously  we aint said felicity indignantly  i am never going to get married  i think it is just horrid so there  i guess you think it would be a good deal horrider not to be said dan  it depends on who youre married to said cecily gravely seeing that felicity disdained reply  if you got a man like father it would be all right  but sposen you got one like andrew ward  hes so mean and cross to his wife that she tells him every day she wishes shed never set eyes on him  perhaps thats why hes mean and cross said felix  i tell you it isnt always the mans fault said dan darkly when i get married ill be good to my wife but i mean to be boss  when i open my mouth my word will be law  if your word is as big as your mouth i guess it will be said felicity cruelly  i pity the man who gets you felicity king thats all retorted dan  now dont fight implored cecily  whos fighting demanded dan  felicity thinks she can say anything she likes to me but ill show her different  probably in spite of cecilys efforts a bitter spat would have resulted between dan and felicity had not a diversion been effected at that moment by the story girl who came slowly down uncle stephens walk  just look how the story girl has got herself up said felicity why shes no more than decent  the story girl was barefooted and barearmed having rolled the sleeves of her pink gingham up to her shoulders  around her waist was twisted a girdle of the bloodred roses that bloomed in aunt olivias garden on her sleek curls she wore a chaplet of them and her hands were full of them  she paused under the outmost tree in a goldengreen gloom and laughed at us over a big branch  her wild subtle nameless charm clothed her as with a garment  we always remembered the picture she made there and in later days when we read tennysons poems at a college desk we knew exactly how an oread peering through the green leaves on some haunted knoll of many fountained ida must look  felicity said the story girl reproachfully what have you been doing to peter  hes up there sulking in the granary and he wont come down and he says its your fault  you must have hurt his feelings dreadfully  i dont know about his feelings said felicity with an angry toss of her shining head but i guess i made his ears tingle all right  i boxed them both good and hard  oh felicity  what for  well he tried to kiss me thats what for said felicity turning very red  as if i would let a hired boy kiss me  i guess master peter wont try anything like that again in a hurry  the story girl came out of her shadows and sat down beside us on the grass  well in that case she said gravely i think you did right to slap his earsnot because he is a hired boy but because it would be impertinent in any boy  but talking of kissing makes me think of a story i found in aunt olivias scrapbook the other day  wouldnt you like to hear it  it is called how kissing was discovered  wasnt kissing always discovered asked dan  not according to this story  it was just discovered accidentally  well lets hear about it said felix although i think kissings awful silly and it wouldnt have mattered much if it hadnt ever been discovered  the story girl scattered her roses around her on the grass and clasped her slim hands over her knees  gazing dreamily afar at the tinted sky between the apple trees as if she were looking back to the merry days of the worlds gay youth she began her voice giving to the words and fancies of the old tale the delicacy of hoar frost and the crystal sparkle of dew  it happened long long ago in greecewhere so many other beautiful things happened  before that nobody had ever heard of kissing  and then it was just discovered in the twinkling of an eye  and a man wrote it down and the account has been preserved ever since  there was a young shepherd named glaucona very handsome young shepherdwho lived in a little village called thebes  it became a very great and famous city afterwards but at this time it was only a little village very quiet and simple  too quiet for glaucons liking  he grew tired of it and he thought he would like to go away from home and see something of the world  so he took his knapsack and his shepherds crook and wandered away until he came to thessaly  that is the land of the gods hill you know  the name of the hill was olympus  but it has nothing to do with this story  this happened on another mountainmount pelion  glaucon hired himself to a wealthy man who had a great many sheep  and every day glaucon had to lead the sheep up to pasture on mount pelion and watch them while they ate  there was nothing else to do and he would have found the time very long if he had not been able to play on a flute  so he played very often and very beautifully as he sat under the trees and watched the wonderful blue sea afar off and thought about aglaia  aglaia was his masters daughter  she was so sweet and beautiful that glaucon fell in love with her the very moment he first saw her and when he was not playing his flute on the mountain he was thinking about aglaia and dreaming that some day he might have flocks of his own and a dear little cottage down in the valley where he and aglaia might live  aglaia had fallen in love with glaucon just as he had with her but she never let him suspect it for ever so long  he did not know how often she would steal up the mountain and hide behind the rocks near where the sheep pastured to listen to glaucons beautiful music  it was very lovely music because he was always thinking of aglaia while he played though he little dreamed how near him she often was  but after awhile glaucon found out that aglaia loved him and everything was well  nowadays i suppose a wealthy man like aglaias father wouldnt be willing to let his daughter marry a hired man but this was in the golden age you know when nothing like that mattered at all  after that almost every day aglaia would go up the mountain and sit beside glaucon as he watched the flocks and played on his flute  but he did not play as much as he used to because he liked better to talk with aglaia  and in the evening they would lead the sheep home together  one day aglaia went up the mountain by a new way and she came to a little brook  something was sparkling very brightly among its pebbles  aglaia picked it up and it was the most beautiful little stone that she had ever seen  it was only as large as a pea but it glittered and flashed in the sunlight with every colour of the rainbow  aglaia was so delighted with it that she resolved to take it as a present to glaucon  but all at once she heard a stamping of hoofs behind her and when she turned she almost died from fright  for there was the great god pan and he was a very terrible object looking quite as much like a goat as a man  the gods were not all beautiful you know  and beautiful or not nobody ever wanted to meet them face to face  give that stone to me said pan holding out his hand  but aglaia though she was frightened would not give him the stone  i want it for glaucon she said  i want it for one of my wood nymphs said pan and i must have it  he advanced threateningly but aglaia ran as hard as she could up the mountain  if she could only reach glaucon he would protect her  pan followed her clattering and bellowing terribly but in a few minutes she rushed into glaucons arms  the dreadful sight of pan and the still more dreadful noise he made so frightened the sheep that they fled in all directions but glaucon was not afraid at all because pan was the god of shepherds and was bound to grant any prayer a good shepherd who always did his duty might make  if glaucon had not been a good shepherd dear knows what would have happened to him and aglaia but he was and when he begged pan to go away and not frighten aglaia any more pan had to go grumbling a good dealand pans grumblings had a very ugly sound  but still he went and that was the main thing  now dearest what is all this trouble about asked glaucon and aglaia told him the story  but where is the beautiful stone he asked when she had finished  didst thou drop it in thy alarm  no indeed  aglaia had done nothing of the sort  when she began to run she had popped it into her mouth and there it was still quite safe  now she poked it out between her red lips where it glittered in the sunlight  take it she whispered  the question washow was he to take it  both of aglaias arms were held fast to her sides by glaucons arms and if he loosened his clasp ever so little he was afraid she would fall so weak and trembling was she from her dreadful fright  then glaucon had a brilliant idea  he would take the beautiful stone from aglaias lips with his own lips  he bent over until his lips touched hersand then he forgot all about the beautiful pebble and so did aglaia  kissing was discovered  what a yarn said dan drawing a long breath when we had come to ourselves and discovered that we were really sitting in a dewy prince edward island orchard instead of watching two lovers on a mountain in thessaly in the golden age  i dont believe a word of it  of course we know it wasnt really true said felicity  well i dont know said the story girl thoughtfully  i think there are two kinds of true thingstrue things that are and true things that are not but might be  i dont believe theres any but the one kind of trueness said felicity  and anyway this story couldnt be true  you know there was no such thing as a god pan  how do you know what there might have been in the golden age asked the story girl  which was indeed an unanswerable question for felicity  i wonder what became of the beautiful stone said cecily  likely aglaia swallowed it said felix practically  did glaucon and aglaia ever get married asked sara ray  the story doesnt say  it stops just there said the story girl  but of course they did  i will tell you what i think  i dont think aglaia swallowed the stone  i think it just fell to the ground and after awhile they found it and it turned out to be of such value that glaucon could buy all the flocks and herds in the valley and the sweetest cottage and he and aglaia were married right away  but you only think that said sara ray  id like to be really sure that was what happened  oh bother none of it happened said dan  i believed it while the story girl was telling it but i dont now  isnt that wheels  wheels it was  two wagons were driving up the lane  we rushed to the houseand there were uncle alec and aunt janet and aunt olivia  the excitement was quite tremendous  every body talked and laughed at once and it was not until we were all seated around the supper table that conversation grew coherent  what laughter and questioning and telling of tales followed what smiles and bright eyes and glad voices  and through it all the blissful purrs of paddy who sat on the window sill behind the story girl resounded through the din like andrew mcphersons bassjust a burrrr the hale time  well im thankful to be home again said aunt janet beaming on us  we had a real nice time and edwards folks were as kind as could be  but give me home for a steady thing  how has everything gone  how did the children behave roger  like models said uncle roger  they were as good as gold most of the days  there were times when one couldnt help liking uncle roger    chapter xix a dread prophecy  ive got to go and begin stumping out the elderberry pasture this afternoon said peter dolefully  i tell you its a tough job  mr roger might wait for cool weather before he sets people to stumping out elderberries and thats a fact  why dont you tell him so asked dan  it aint my business to tell him things retorted peter  im hired to do what im told and i do it  but i can have my own opinion all the same  its going to be a broiling hot day  we were all in the orchard except felix who had gone to the postoffice  it was the forenoon of an august saturday  cecily and sara ray who had come up to spend the day with usher mother having gone to townwere eating timothy roots  bertha lawrence a charlottetown girl who had visited kitty marr in june and had gone to school one day with her had eaten timothy roots affecting to consider them great delicacies  the fad was at once taken up by the carlisle schoolgirls  timothy roots quite ousted sours and young raspberry sprouts both of which had the real merit of being quite toothsome while timothy roots were tough and tasteless  but timothy roots were fashionable therefore timothy roots must be eaten  pecks of them must have been devoured in carlisle that summer  pat was there also padding about from one to the other on his black paws giving us friendly pokes and rubs  we all made much of him except felicity who would not take any notice of him because he was the story girls cat  we boys were sprawling on the grass  our morning chores were done and the day was before us  we should have been feeling very comfortable and happy but as a matter of fact we were not particularly so  the story girl was sitting on the mint beside the wellhouse weaving herself a wreath of buttercups  felicity was sipping from the cup of clouded blue with an overdone air of unconcern each was acutely and miserably conscious of the others presence and each was desirous of convincing the rest of us that the other was less than nothing to her  felicity could not succeed  the story girl managed it better  if it had not been for the fact that in all our foregatherings she was careful to sit as far from felicity as possible we might have been deceived  we had not passed a very pleasant week  felicity and the story girl had not been speaking to each other and consequently there had been something rotten in the state of denmark  an air of restraint was over all our games and conversations  on the preceding monday felicity and the story girl had quarrelled over something  what the cause of the quarrel was i cannot tell because i never knew  it remained a dead secret between the parties of the first and second part forever  but it was more bitter than the general run of their tiffs and the consequences were apparent to all  they had not spoken to each other since  this was not because the rancour of either lasted so long  on the contrary it passed speedily away not even one low descending sun going down on their wrath  but dignity remained to be considered  neither would speak first and each obstinately declared that she would not speak first no not in a hundred years  neither argument entreaty nor expostulation had any effect on those two stubborn girls nor yet the tears of sweet cecily who cried every night about it and mingled in her pure little prayers fervent petitions that felicity and the story girl might make up  i dont know where you expect to go when you die felicity she said tearfully if you dont forgive people  i have forgiven her was felicitys answer but i am not going to speak first for all that  its very wrong and more than that its so uncomfortable complained cecily  it spoils everything  were they ever like this before i asked cecily as we talked the matter over privately in uncle stephens walk  never for so long said cecily  they had a spell like this last summer and one the summer before but they only lasted a couple of days  and who spoke first  oh the story girl  she got excited about something and spoke to felicity before she thought and then it was all right  but im afraid it isnt going to be like that this time  dont you notice how careful the story girl is not to get excited  that is such a bad sign  weve just got to think up something that will excite her thats all i said  imim praying about it said cecily in a low voice her tearwet lashes trembling against her pale round cheeks  do you suppose it will do any good bev  very likely i assured her  remember sara ray and the money that came from praying  im glad you think so said cecily tremulously  dan said it was no use for me to bother praying about it  he said if they couldnt speak god might do something but when they just wouldnt it wasnt likely he would interfere  dan does say such queer things  im so afraid hes going to grow up just like uncle robert ward who never goes to church and doesnt believe more than half the bible is true  which half does he believe is true i inquired with unholy curiosity  oh just the nice parts  he says theres a heaven all right but nonohell  i dont want dan to grow up like that  it isnt respectable  and you wouldnt want all kinds of people crowding heaven now would you  well no i suppose not i agreed thinking of billy robinson  of course i cant help feeling sorry for those who have to go to the other place said cecily compassionately  but i suppose they wouldnt be very comfortable in heaven either  they wouldnt feel at home  andrew marr said a simply dreadful thing about the other place one night last fall when felicity and i were down to see kitty and they were burning the potato stalks he said he believed the other place must be lots more interesting than heaven because fires were such jolly things  now did you ever hear the like  i guess it depends a good deal on whether youre inside or outside the fires i said  oh andrew didnt really mean it of course  he just said it to sound smart and make us stare  the marrs are all like that  but anyhow im going to keep on praying that something will happen to excite the story girl  i dont believe there is any use in praying that felicity will speak first because i am sure she wont  but dont you suppose god could make her i said feeling that it wasnt quite fair that the story girl should always have to speak first  if she had spoken first the other times it was surely felicitys turn this time  well i believe it would puzzle him said cecily out of the depths of her experience with felicity  peter as was to be expected took felicitys part and said the story girl ought to speak first because she was the oldest that he said had always been his aunt janes rule  sara ray thought felicity should speak first because the story girl was half an orphan  felix tried to make peace between them and met the usual fate of all peacemakers  the story girl loftily told him that he was too young to understand and felicity said that fat boys should mind their own business  after that felix declared it would serve felicity right if the story girl never spoke to her again  dan had no patience with either of the girls especially felicity  what they both want is a right good spanking he said  if only a spanking would mend the matter it was not likely it would ever be mended  both felicity and the story girl were rather too old to be spanked and if they had not been none of the grownups would have thought it worth while to administer so desperate a remedy for what they considered so insignificant a trouble  with the usual levity of grownups they regarded the coldness between the girls as a subject of mirth and jest and recked not that it was freezing the genial current of our youthful souls and blighting hours that should have been fair pages in our book of days  the story girl finished her wreath and put it on  the buttercups drooped over her high white brow and played peep with her glowing eyes  a dreamy smile hovered around her poppyred moutha significant smile which to those of us skilled in its interpretation betokened the sentence which soon came  i know a story about a man who always had his own opinion  the story girl got no further  we never heard the story of the man who always had his own opinion  felix came tearing up the lane with a newspaper in his hand  when a boy as fat as felix runs at full speed on a broiling august forenoon he has something to run foras felicity remarked  he must have got some bad news at the office said sara ray  oh i hope nothing has happened to father i exclaimed springing anxiously to my feet a sick horrible feeling of fear running over me like a cool rippling wave  its just as likely to be good news he is running for as bad said the story girl who was no believer in meeting trouble half way  he wouldnt be running so fast for good news said dan cynically  we were not left long in doubt  the orchard gate flew open and felix was among us  one glimpse of his face told us that he was no bearer of glad tidings  he had been running hard and should have been rubicund  instead he was as pale as are the dead i could not have asked him what was the matter had my life depended on it  it was felicity who demanded impatiently of my shaking voiceless brother  felix king what has scared you  felix held out the newspaperit was the charlottetown daily enterprise  its there he gasped  lookreadoh do youthink itstrue  theend ofthe worldis coming tomorrowat twooclockin the afternoon  crash  felicity had dropped the cup of clouded blue which had passed unscathed through so many changing years and now at last lay shattered on the stone of the well curb  at any other time we should all have been aghast over such a catastrophe but it passed unnoticed now  what mattered it that all the cups in the world be broken today if the crack o doom must sound tomorrow  oh sara stanley do you believe it  do you gasped felicity clutching the story girls hand  cecilys prayer had been answered  excitement had come with a vengeance and under its stress felicity had spoken first  but this like the breaking of the cup had no significance for us at the moment  the story girl snatched the paper and read the announcement to a group on which sudden tense silence had fallen  under a sensational headline the last trump will sound at two oclock tomorrow was a paragraph to the effect that the leader of a certain noted sect in the united states had predicted that august twelfth would be the judgment day and that all his numerous followers were preparing for the dread event by prayer fasting and the making of appropriate white garments for ascension robes  i laugh at the remembrance nowuntil i recall the real horror of fear that enwrapped us in that sunny orchard that august morning of long ago and then i laugh no more  we were only children be it remembered with a very firm and simple faith that grown people knew much more than we did and a rooted conviction that whatever you read in a newspaper must be true  if the daily enterprise said that august twelfth was to be the judgment day how were you going to get around it  do you believe it sara stanley persisted felicity  do you  nono i dont believe a word of it said the story girl  but for once her voice failed to carry convictionor rather it carried conviction of the very opposite kind  it was borne in upon our miserable minds that if the story girl did not altogether believe it was true she believed it might be true and the possibility was almost as dreadful as the certainty  it cant be true said sara ray seeking refuge as usual in tears  why everything looks just the same  things couldnt look the same if the judgment day was going to be tomorrow  but thats just the way its to come i said uncomfortably it tells you in the bible  its to come just like a thief in the night  but it tells you another thing in the bible too said cecily eagerly  it says nobody knows when the judgment day is to comenot even the angels in heaven  now if the angels in heaven dont know it do you suppose the editor of the enterprise can know itand him a grit too  i guess he knows as much about it as a tory would retorted the story girl  uncle roger was a liberal and uncle alec a conservative and the girls held fast to the political traditions of their respective households  but it isnt really the enterprise editor at all who is saying itits a man in the states who claims to be a prophet  if he is a prophet perhaps he has found out somehow  and its in the paper too and thats printed as well as the bible said dan  well im going to depend on the bible said cecily  i dont believe its the judgment day tomorrowbut im scared for all that she added piteously  that was exactly the position of us all  as in the case of the bellringing ghost we did not believe but we trembled  nobody might have known when the bible was written said dan but maybe somebody knows now  why the bible was written thousands of years ago and that paper was printed this very morning  theres been time to find out ever so much more  i want to do so many things said the story girl plucking off her crown of buttercup gold with a tragic gesture but if its the judgment day tomorrow i wont have time to do any of them  it cant be much worse than dying i spose said felix grasping at any straw of comfort  im awful glad ive got into the habit of going to church and sunday school this summer said peter very soberly  i wish id made up my mind before this whether to be a presbyterian or a methodist  do you spose its too late now  oh that doesnt matter said cecily earnestly  ifif youre a christian peter that is all thats necessary  but its too late for that said peter miserably  i cant turn into a christian between this and two oclock tomorrow ill just have to be satisfied with making up my mind to be a presbyterian or a methodist  i wanted to wait till i got old enough to make out what was the difference between them but ill have to chance it now  i guess ill be a presbyterian cause i want to be like the rest of you  yes ill be a presbyterian  i know a story about judy pineau and the word presbyterian said the story girl but i cant tell it now  if tomorrow isnt the judgment day ill tell it monday  if i had known that tomorrow might be the judgment day i wouldnt have quarrelled with you last monday sara stanley or been so horrid and sulky all the week  indeed i wouldnt said felicity with very unusual humility  ah felicity  we were all in the depths of our pitiful little souls reviewing the innumerable things we would or would not have done if we had known  what a black and endless list they madethose sins of omission and commission that rushed accusingly across our young memories  for us the leaves of the book of judgment were already opened and we stood at the bar of our own consciences than which for youth or eld there can be no more dread tribunal  i thought of all the evil deeds of my short lifeof pinching felix to make him cry out at family prayers of playing truant from sunday school and going fishing one day of a certain fibno no away from this awful hour with all such euphonious evasionsof a lie i had once told of many a selfish and unkind word and thought and action  and tomorrow might be the great and terrible day of the last accounting  oh if i had only been a better boy  the quarrel was as much my fault as yours felicity said the story girl putting her arm around felicity  we cant undo it now  but if tomorrow isnt the judgment day we must be careful never to quarrel again  oh i wish father was here  he will be said cecily  if its the judgment day for prince edward island it will be for europe too  i wish we could just know whether what the paper says is true or not said felix desperately  it seems to me i could brace up if i just knew  but to whom could we appeal  uncle alec was away and would not be back until late that night  neither aunt janet nor uncle roger were people to whom we cared to apply in such a crisis  we were afraid of the judgment day but we were almost equally afraid of being laughed at  how about aunt olivia  no aunt olivia has gone to bed with a sick headache and mustnt be disturbed said the story girl  she said i must get dinner ready because there was plenty of cold meat and nothing to do but boil the potatoes and peas and set the table  i dont know how i can put my thoughts into it when the judgment day may be tomorrow  besides what is the good of asking the grownups they dont know anything more about this than we do  but if theyd just say they didnt believe it it would be a sort of comfort said cecily  i suppose the minister would know but hes away on his vacation said felicity  anyhow ill go and ask mother what she thinks of it  felicity picked up the enterprise and betook herself to the house  we awaited her return in dire suspense  well what does she say asked cecily tremulously  she said run away and dont bother me  i havent any time for your nonsense responded felicity in an injured tone  and i said but ma the paper says tomorrow is the judgment day and ma just said judgment fiddlesticks  well thats kind of comforting said peter  she cant put any faith in it or shed be more worked up  if it only wasnt printed said dan gloomily  lets all go over and ask uncle roger said felix desperately  that we should make uncle roger a court of last resort indicated all too clearly the state of our minds  but we went  uncle roger was in his barnyard hitching his black mare into the buggy  his copy of the enterprise was sticking out of his pocket  he looked as we saw with sinking hearts unusually grave and preoccupied  there was not a glimmer of a smile about his face  you ask him said felicity nudging the story girl  uncle roger said the story girl the golden notes of her voice threaded with fear and appeal  the enterprise says that tomorrow is the judgment day  is it  do you think it is  im afraid so said uncle roger gravely  the enterprise is always very careful to print only reliable news  but mother doesnt believe it cried felicity  uncle roger shook his head  that is just the trouble he said  people wont believe it till its too late  im going straight to markdale to pay a man there some money i owe him and after dinner im going to summerside to buy me a new suit  my old one is too shabby for the judgment day  he got into his buggy and drove away leaving eight distracted mortals behind him  well i suppose that settles it said peter in despairing tone  is there anything we can do to prepare asked cecily  i wish i had a white dress like you girls sobbed sara ray but i havent and its too late to get one  oh i wish i had minded what ma said better  i wouldnt have disobeyed her so often if id thought the judgment day was so near  when i go home im going to tell her about going to the magic lantern show  im not sure that uncle roger meant what he said remarked the story girl  i couldnt get a look into his eyes  if he was trying to hoax us there would have been a twinkle in them  he can never help that  you know he would think it a great joke to frighten us like this  its really dreadful to have no grownups you can depend on  we could depend on father if he was here said dan stoutly hed tell us the truth  he would tell us what he thought was true dan but he couldnt know  hes not such a welleducated man as the editor of the enterprise  no theres nothing to do but wait and see  let us go into the house and read just what the bible does say about it suggested cecily  we crept in carefully lest we disturb aunt olivia and cecily found and read the significant portion of holy writ  there was little comfort for us in that vivid and terrible picture  well said the story girl finally  i must go and get the potatoes ready  i suppose they must be boiled even if it is the judgment day tomorrow  but i dont believe it is  and ive got to go and stump elderberries said peter  i dont see how i can do itgo away back there alone  ill feel scared to death the whole time  tell uncle roger that and say if tomorrow is the end of the world that there is no good in stumping any more fields i suggested  yes and if he lets you off then well know he was in earnest chimed in cecily  but if he still says you must go thatll be a sign he doesnt believe it  leaving the story girl and peter to peel their potatoes the rest of us went home where aunt janet who had gone to the well and found the fragments of the old blue cup gave poor felicity a bitter scolding about it  but felicity bore it very patientlynay more she seemed to delight in it  ma cant believe tomorrow is the last day or she wouldnt scold like that she told us and this comforted us until after dinner when the story girl and peter came over and told us that uncle roger had really gone to summerside  then we plunged down into fear and wretchedness again  but he said i must go and stump elderberries just the same said peter  he said it might not be the judgment day tomorrow though he believed it was and it would keep me out of mischief but i just cant stand it back there alone  some of you fellows must come with me  i dont want you to work but just for company  it was finally decided that dan and felix should go  i wanted to go also but the girls protested  you must stay and keep us cheered up implored felicity  i just dont know how im ever going to put in the afternoon  i promised kitty marr that id go down and spend it with her but i cant now  and i cant knit any at my lace  id just keep thinking what is the use  perhaps itll all be burned up tomorrow  so i stayed with the girls and a miserable afternoon we had of it  the story girl again and again declared that she didnt believe it but when we asked her to tell a story she evaded it with a flimsy excuse  cecily pestered at aunt janets life out asking repeatedly ma will you be washing monday ma will you be going to prayer meeting tuesday night ma will you be preserving raspberries next week and various similar questions it was a huge comfort to her that aunt janet always said yes or of course as if there could be no question about it  sara ray cried until i wondered how one small head could contain all the tears she shed  but i do not believe she was half as much frightened as disappointed that she had no white dress  in midafternoon cecily came downstairs with her forgetmenot jug in her handa dainty bit of china wreathed with dark blue forgetmenots which cecily prized highly and in which she always kept her toothbrush  sara i am going to give you this jug she said solemnly  now sara had always coveted this particular jug  she stopped crying long enough to clutch it delightedly  oh cecily thank you  but are you sure you wont want it back if tomorrow isnt the judgment day  no its yours for good said cecily with the high remote air of one to whom forgetmenot jugs and all such pomps and vanities of the world were as a tale that is told  are you going to give any one your cherry vase asked felicity trying to speak indifferently  felicity had never admired the forgetmenot jug but she had always hankered after the cherry vasean affair of white glass with a cluster of red glass cherries and goldengreen glass leaves on its side which aunt olivia had given cecily one christmas  no im not answered cecily with a change of tone  oh well i dont care said felicity quickly  only if tomorrow is the last day the cherry vase wont be much use to you  i guess it will be as much use to me as to any one else said cecily indignantly  she had sacrificed her dear forgetmenot jug to satisfy some pang of conscience or propitiate some threatening fate but surrender her precious cherry vase she could not and would not  felicity neednt be giving any hints  with the gathering shades of night our plight became pitiful  in the daylight surrounded by homely familiar sights and sounds it was not so difficult to fortify our souls with a cheering incredulity  but now in this time of shadows dread belief clutched us and wrung us with terror  if there had been one wise older friend to tell us in serious fashion that we need not be afraid that the enterprise paragraph was naught save the idle report of a deluded fanatic it would have been well for us  but there was not  our grownups instead considered our terror an exquisite jest  at that very moment aunt olivia who had recovered from her headache and aunt janet were laughing in the kitchen over the state the children were in because they were afraid the end of the world was close at hand  aunt janets throaty gurgle and aunt olivias trilling mirth floated out through the open window  perhaps theyll laugh on the other side of their faces tomorrow said dan with gloomy satisfaction  we were sitting on the cellar hatch watching what might be our last sunset oer the dark hills of time  peter was with us  it was his last sunday to go home but he had elected to remain  if tomorrow is the judgment day i want to be with you fellows he said  sara ray had also yearned to stay but could not because her mother had told her she must be home before dark  never mind sara comforted cecily  its not to be till two oclock tomorrow so youll have plenty of time to get up here before anything happens  but there might be a mistake sobbed sara  it might be two oclock tonight instead of tomorrow  it might indeed  this was a new horror which had not occurred to us  im sure i wont sleep a wink tonight said felix  the paper says two oclock tomorrow said dan  you neednt worry sara  but sara departed weeping  she did not however forget to carry the forgetmenot jug with her  all things considered her departure was a relief  such a constantly tearful damsel was not a pleasant companion  cecily and felicity and the story girl did not cry  they were made of finer firmer stuff  dryeyed with such courage as they might they faced whatever might be in store for them  i wonder where well all be this time tomorrow night said felix mournfully as we watched the sunset between the dark fir boughs  it was an ominous sunset  the sun dropped down amid dark livid clouds that turned sullen shades of purple and fiery red behind him  i hope well be all together wherever we are said cecily gently  nothing can be so very bad then  im going to read the bible all tomorrow forenoon said peter  when aunt olivia came out to go home the story girl asked her permission to stay all night with felicity and cecily  aunt olivia assented lightly swinging her hat on her arm and including us all in a friendly smile  she looked very pretty with her big blue eyes and warmhued golden hair  we loved aunt olivia but just now we resented her having laughed at us with aunt janet and we refused to smile back  what a sulky sulky lot of little people said aunt olivia going away across the yard holding her pretty dress up from the dewy grass  peter resolved to stay all night with us too not troubling himself about anybodys permission  when we went to bed it was settling down for a stormy night and the rain was streaming wetly on the roof as if the world like sara ray were weeping because its end was so near  nobody forgot or hurried over his prayers that night  we would dearly have loved to leave the candle burning but aunt janets decree regarding this was as inexorable as any of mede and persia  out the candle must go and we lay there quaking with the wild rain streaming down on the roof above us and the voices of the storm wailing through the writhing spruce trees    chapter xx the judgment sunday  sunday morning broke dull and gray  the rain had ceased but the clouds hung dark and brooding above a world which in its windless calm following the spent stormthroe seemed to us to be waiting till judgment spoke the doom of fate  we were all up early  none of us it appeared had slept well and some of us not at all  the story girl had been among the latter and she looked very pale and wan with black shadows under her deepset eyes  peter however had slept soundly enough after twelve oclock  when youve been stumping out elderberries all the afternoon itll take more than the judgment day to keep you awake all night he said  but when i woke up this morning it was just awful  id forgot it for a moment and then it all came back with a rush and i was worse scared than before  cecily was pale but brave  for the first time in years she had not put her hair up in curlers on saturday night  it was brushed and braided with puritan simplicity  if its the judgment day i dont care whether my hair is curly or not she said  well said aunt janet when we all descended to the kitchen this is the first time you young ones have ever all got up without being called and thats a fact  at breakfast our appetites were poor  how could the grownups eat as they did  after breakfast and the necessary chores there was the forenoon to be lived through  peter true to his word got out his bible and began to read from the first chapter in genesis  i wont have time to read it all through i spose he said but ill get along as far as i can  there was no preaching in carlisle that day and sunday school was not till the evening  cecily got out her lesson slip and studied the lesson conscientiously  the rest of us did not see how she could do it  we could not that was very certain  if it isnt the judgment day i want to have the lesson learned she said and if it is ill feel ive done what was right  but i never found it so hard to remember the golden text before  the long dragging hours were hard to endure  we roamed restlessly about and went to and froall save peter who still steadily read away at his bible  he was through genesis by eleven and beginning on exodus  theres a good deal of it i dont understand he said but i read every word and thats the main thing  that story about joseph and his brother was so intresting i almost forgot about the judgment day  but the long drawn out dread was beginning to get on dans nerves  if it is the judgment day he growled as we went in to dinner i wish itd hurry up and have it over  oh dan cried felicity and cecily together in a chorus of horror  but the story girl looked as if she rather sympathized with dan  if we had eaten little at breakfast we could eat still less at dinner  after dinner the clouds rolled away and the sun came joyously and gloriously out  this we thought was a good omen felicity opined that it wouldnt have cleared up if it was the judgment day  nevertheless we dressed ourselves carefully and the girls put on their white dresses  sara ray came up still crying of course  she increased our uneasiness by saying that her mother believed the enterprise paragraph and was afraid that the end of the world was really at hand  thats why she let me come up she sobbed  if she hadnt been afraid i dont believe she would have let me come up  but id have died if i couldnt have come  and she wasnt a bit cross when i told her i had gone to the magic lantern show  thats an awful bad sign  i hadnt a white dress but i put on my white muslin apron with the frills  that seems kind of queer said felicity doubtfully  you wouldnt put on an apron to go to church and so it doesnt seems as if it was proper to put it on for judgment day either  well its the best i could do said sara disconsolately  i wanted to have something white on  its just like a dress only it hasnt sleeves  lets go into the orchard and wait said the story girl  its one oclock now so in another hour well know the worst  well leave the front door open and well hear the big clock when it strikes two  no better plan being suggested we betook ourselves to the orchard and sat on the boughs of uncle alecs tree because the grass was wet  the world was beautiful and peaceful and green overhead was a dazzling blue sky spotted with heaps of white cloud  pshaw i dont believe theres any fear of it being the last day said dan beginning a whistle out of sheer bravado  well dont whistle on sunday anyhow said felicity severely  i dont see a thing about methodists or presbyterians as far as ive gone and im most through exodus said peter suddenly when does it begin to tell about them  theres nothing about methodists or presbyterians in the bible said felicity scornfully  peter looked amazed  well how did they happen then he asked  when did they begin to be  ive often thought it such a strange thing that there isnt a word about either of them in the bible said cecily especially when it mentions baptistsor at least one baptist  well anyhow said peter even if it isnt the judgment day im going to keep on reading the bible until ive got clean through  i never thought it was such an intresting book  it sounds simply dreadful to hear you call the bible an interesting book said felicity with a shudder at the sacrilege  why you might be talking about any common book  i didnt mean any harm said peter crestfallen  the bible is an interesting book said the story girl coming to peters rescue  and there are magnificent stories in ityes felicity magnificent  if the world doesnt come to an end ill tell you the story of ruth next sundayor look here ill tell it anyhow  thats a promise  wherever we are next sunday ill tell you about ruth  why you wouldnt tell stories in heaven said cecily in a very timid voice  why not said the story girl with a flash of her eyes indeed i shall  ill tell stories as long as ive a tongue to talk with or any one to listen  ay doubtless  that dauntless spirit would soar triumphantly above the wreck of matter and the crash of worlds taking with it all its own wild sweetness and daring  even the youngeyed cherubim choiring on meadows of asphodel might cease their harping for a time to listen to a tale of the vanished earth told by that golden tongue  some vague thought of this was in our minds as we looked at her and somehow it comforted us  not even the judgment was so greatly to be feared if after it we were the same our own precious little identities unchanged  it must be getting handy two said cecily  it seems as if wed been waiting here for ever so much longer than an hour  conversation languished  we watched and waited nervously  the moments dragged by each seeming an hour  would two oclock never come and end the suspense  we all became very tense  even peter had to stop reading  any unaccustomed sound or sight in the world about us struck on our taut senses like the trump of doom  a cloud passed over the sun and as the sudden shadow swept across the orchard we turned pale and trembled  a wagon rumbling over a plank bridge in the hollow made sara ray start up with a shriek  the slamming of a barn door over at uncle rogers caused the cold perspiration to break out on our faces  i dont believe its the judgment day said felix and i never have believed it  but oh i wish that clock would strike two  cant you tell us a story to pass the time i entreated the story girl  she shook her head  no it would be no use to try  but if this isnt the judgment day ill have a great one to tell of us being so scared  pat presently came galloping up the orchard carrying in his mouth a big field mouse which sitting down before us he proceeded to devour body and bones afterwards licking his chops with great satisfaction  it cant be the judgment day said sara ray brightening up paddy would never be eating mice if it was  if that clock doesnt soon strike two i shall go out of my seven senses declared cecily with unusual vehemence  time always seems long when youre waiting said the story girl  but it does seem as if we had been here more than an hour  maybe the clock struck and we didnt hear it suggested dan somebodyd better go and see  ill go said cecily  i suppose even if anything happens ill have time to get back to you  we watched her whiteclad figure pass through the gate and enter the front door  a few minutes passedor a few yearswe could not have told which  then cecily came running at full speed back to us  but when she reached us she trembled so much that at first she could not speak  what is it  is it past two implored the story girl  itsits four said cecily with a gasp  the old clock isnt going  mother forgot to wind it up last night and it stopped but its four by the kitchen clockso it isnt the judgment dayand tea is readyand mother says to come in  we looked at each other realizing what our dread had been now that it was lifted  it was not the judgment day  the world and life were still before us with all their potent lure of years unknown  ill never believe anything i read in the papers again said dan rushing to the opposite extreme  i told you the bible was more to be depended on than the newspapers said cecily triumphantly  sara ray and peter and the story girl went home and we went in to tea with royal appetites  afterwards as we dressed for sunday school upstairs our spirits carried us away to such an extent that aunt janet had to come twice to the foot of the stairs and inquire severely children have you forgotten what day this is  isnt it nice that were going to live a spell longer in this nice world said felix as we walked down the hill  yes and felicity and the story girl are speaking again said cecily happily  and felicity did speak first i said  yes but it took the judgment day to make her  i wish added cecily with a sigh that i hadnt been in quite such a hurry giving away my forgetmenot jug  and i wish i hadnt been in such a hurry deciding id be a presbyterian said peter  well its not too late for that said dan  you can change your mind now  no sir said peter with a flash of spirit i aint one of the kind that says theyll be something just because theyre scared and when the scare is over go back on it  i said id be presbyterian and i mean to stick to it  you said you knew a story that had something to do with presbyterians i said to the story girl  tell us it now  oh no it isnt the right kind of story to tell on sunday she replied  but ill tell it tomorrow morning  accordingly we heard it the next morning in the orchard  long ago when judy pineau was young said the story girl she was hired with mrs elder frewenthe first mrs elder frewen mrs frewen had been a schoolteacher and she was very particular as to how people talked and the grammar they used and she didnt like anything but refined words  one very hot day she heard judy pineau say she was all in a sweat  mrs frewen was greatly shocked and said judy you shouldnt say that its horses that sweat  you should say you are in a perspiration well judy promised shed remember because she liked mrs frewen and was anxious to please her  not long afterwards judy was scrubbing the kitchen floor one morning and when mrs frewen came in judy looked up and said quite proud over using the right word oh mees frewen aint it awful hot i declare im all in a presbyterian    chapter xxi dreamers of dreams  august went out and september came in  harvest was ended and though summer was not yet gone her face was turned westering the asters lettered her retreating footsteps in a purple script and over the hills and valleys hung a faint blue smoke as if nature were worshipping at her woodland altar  the apples began to burn red on the bending boughs crickets sang day and night squirrels chattered secrets of polichinelle in the spruces the sunshine was as thick and yellow as molten gold school opened and we small denizens of the hill farms lived happy days of harmless work and necessary play closing in nights of peaceful undisturbed slumber under a roof watched over by autumnal stars  at least our slumbers were peaceful and undisturbed until our orgy of dreaming began  i would really like to know what especial kind of deviltry you young fry are up to this time said uncle roger one evening as he passed through the orchard with his gun on his shoulder bound for the swamp  we were sitting in a circle before the pulpit stone each writing diligently in an exercise book and eating the rev  mr scotts plums which always reached their prime of juicy goldengreen flesh and bloomy blue skin in september  the rev  mr scott was dead and gone but those plums certainly kept his memory green as his forgotten sermons could never have done  oh said felicity in a shocked tone when uncle roger had passed by uncle roger swore  oh no he didnt said the story girl quickly  deviltry isnt swearing at all  it only means extra bad mischief  well its not a very nice word anyhow said felicity  no it isnt agreed the story girl with a regretful sigh its very expressive but it isnt nice  that is the way with so many words  theyre expressive but theyre not nice and so a girl cant use them  the story girl sighed again  she loved expressive words and treasured them as some girls might have treasured jewels  to her they were as lustrous pearls threaded on the crimson cord of a vivid fancy  when she met with a new one she uttered it over and over to herself in solitude weighing it caressing it infusing it with the radiance of her voice making it her own in all its possibilities for ever  well anyhow it isnt a suitable word in this case insisted felicity  we are not up to any devany extra bad mischief writing down ones dreams isnt mischief at all  certainly it wasnt  surely not even the straitest sect of the grownups could call it so  if writing down your dreams with agonizing care as to composition and spellingfor who knew that the eyes of generations unborn might not read the recordwere not a harmless amusement could anything be called so  i trow not  we had been at it for a fortnight and during that time we only lived to have dreams and write them down  the story girl had originated the idea one evening in the rustling rainwet ways of the spruce wood where we were picking gum after a day of showers  when we had picked enough we sat down on the mossgrown stones at the end of a long arcade where it opened out on the harvestgolden valley below us our jaws exercising themselves vigorously on the spoil of our climbings  we were never allowed to chew gum in school or in company but in wood and field orchard and hayloft such rules were in abeyance  my aunt jane used to say it wasnt polite to chew gum anywhere said peter rather ruefully  i dont suppose your aunt jane knew all the rules of etiquette said felicity designing to crush peter with a big word borrowed from the family guide  but peter was not to be so crushed  he had in him a certain toughness of fibre that would have been proof against a whole dictionary  she did too he retorted  my aunt jane was a real lady even if she was only a craig  she knew all those rules and she kept them when there was nobody round to see her just the same as when any one was  and she was smart  if father had had half her gitupandgit i wouldnt be a hired boy today  have you any idea where your father is asked dan  no said peter indifferently  the last we heard of him he was in the maine lumber woods  but that was three years ago  i dont know where he is now and added peter deliberately taking his gum from his mouth to make his statement more impressive i dont care  oh peter that sounds dreadful said cecily  your own father  well said peter defiantly if your own father had run away when you was a baby and left your mother to earn her living by washing and working out i guess you wouldnt care much about him either  perhaps your father may come home some of these days with a huge fortune suggested the story girl  perhaps pigs may whistle but theyve poor mouths for it was all the answer peter deigned to this charming suggestion  there goes mr campbell down the road said dan  thats his new mare  isnt she a dandy  shes got a skin like black satin he calls her betty sherman  i dont think its very nice to call a horse after your own grandmother said felicity  betty sherman would have thought it a compliment said the story girl  maybe she would  she couldnt have been very nice herself or she would never have gone and asked a man to marry her said felicity  why not  goodness me it was dreadful  would you do such a thing yourself  well i dont know said the story girl her eyes gleaming with impish laughter  if i wanted him dreadfully and he wouldnt do the asking perhaps i would  id rather die an old maid forty times over exclaimed felicity  nobody as pretty as you will ever be an old maid felicity said peter who never put too fine an edge on his compliments  felicity tossed her golden tressed head and tried to look angry but made a dismal failure of it  it wouldnt be ladylike to ask any one to marry you you know argued cecily  i dont suppose the family guide would think so agreed the story girl lazily with some sarcasm in her voice  the story girl never held the family guide in such reverence as did felicity and cecily  they pored over the etiquette column every week and could have told you on demand just exactly what kind of gloves should be worn at a wedding what you should say when introducing or being introduced and how you ought to look when your best young man came to see you  they say mrs richard cook asked her husband to marry her said dan  uncle roger says she didnt exactly ask him but she helped the lame dog over the stile so slick that richard was engaged to her before he knew what had happened to him said the story girl i know a story about mrs richard cooks grandmother  she was one of those women who are always saying i told you so  take notice felicity said dan aside  and she was very stubborn  soon after she was married she and her husband quarrelled about an apple tree they had planted in their orchard  the label was lost  he said it was a fameuse and she declared it was a yellow transparent  they fought over it till the neighbours came out to listen  finally he got so angry that he told her to shut up  they didnt have any family guide in those days so he didnt know it wasnt polite to say shut up to your wife  i suppose she thought she would teach him manners for would you believe it  that woman did shut up and never spoke one single word to her husband for five years  and then in five years time the tree bore apples and they were yellow transparents  and then she spoke at last  she said i told you so  and did she talk to him after that as usual asked sara ray  oh yes she was just the same as she used to be said the story girl wearily  but that doesnt belong to the story  it stops when she spoke at last  youre never satisfied to leave a story where it should stop sara ray  well i always like to know what happens afterwards said sara ray  uncle roger says he wouldnt want a wife he could never quarrel with remarked dan  he says it would be too tame a life for him  i wonder if uncle roger will always stay a bachelor said cecily  he seems real happy observed peter  ma says that its all right as long as he is a bachelor because he wont take any one said felicity but if he wakes up some day and finds he is an old bachelor because he cant get any one itll have a very different flavour  if your aunt olivia was to up and get married what would your uncle roger do for a housekeeper asked peter  oh but aunt olivia will never be married now said felicity why shell be twentynine next january  well o course thats pretty old admitted peter but she might find some one who wouldnt mind that seeing shes so pretty  it would be awful splendid and exciting to have a wedding in the family wouldnt it said cecily  ive never seen any one married and id just love to  ive been to four funerals but not to one single wedding  ive never even got to a funeral said sara ray gloomily  theres the wedding veil of the proud princess said cecily pointing to a long drift of filmy vapour in the southwestern sky  and look at that sweet pink cloud below it added felicity  maybe that little pink cloud is a dream getting all ready to float down into somebodys sleep suggested the story girl  i had a perfectly awful dream last night said cecily with a shudder of remembrance  i dreamed i was on a desert island inhabited by tigers and natives with two heads  oh the story girl looked at cecily half reproachfully  why couldnt you tell it better than that  if i had such a dream i could tell it so that everybody else would feel as if they had dreamed it too  well im not you countered cecily and i wouldnt want to frighten any one as i was frightened  it was an awful dreambut it was kind of interesting too  ive had some real intresting dreams said peter but i cant remember them long  i wish i could  why dont you write them down suggested the story girl oh she turned upon us a face illuminated with a sudden inspiration  ive an idea  let us each get an exercise book and write down all our dreams just as we dream them  well see wholl have the most interesting collection  and well have them to read and laugh over when were old and gray  instantly we all saw ourselves and each other by inner vision old and grayall but the story girl  we could not picture her as old  always as long as she lived so it seemed to us must she have sleek brown curls a voice like the sound of a harpstring in the wind and eyes that were stars of eternal youth    chapter xxii the dream books  the next day the story girl coaxed uncle roger to take her to markdale and there she bought our dream books  they were ten cents apiece with ruled pages and mottled green covers  my own lies open beside me as i write its yellowed pages inscribed with the visions that haunted my childish slumbers on those nights of long ago  on the cover is pasted a ladys visiting card on which is written the dream book of beverley king  cecily had a packet of visiting cards which she was hoarding against the day when she would be grown up and could put the calling etiquette of the family guide into practice but she generously gave us all one apiece for the covers of our dream books  as i turn the pages and glance over the naiumlve records each one beginning last night i dreamed the past comes very vividly back to me  i see that bowery orchard shining in memory with a soft glow of beautythe light that never was on land or seawhere we sat on those september evenings and wrote down our dreams when the cares of the day were over and there was nothing to interfere with the pleasing throes of composition peterdanfelixcecilyfelicitysara raythe story girlthey are all around me once more in the sweetscented fading grasses each with open dream books and pencil in hand now writing busily now staring fixedly into space in search of some elusive word or phrase which might best describe the indescribable  i hear their laughing voices i see their bright unclouded eyes  in this little old book filled with cramped boyish writing there is a spell of white magic that sets the years at naught  beverley king is a boy once more writing down his dreams in the old king orchard on the homestead hill blown over by musky winds  opposite to him sits the story girl with her scarlet rosetted head her beautiful bare feet crossed before her one slender hand propping her high white brow on either side of which fall her glossy curls  there to the right is sweet cecily of the dear brown eyes with a little bloated dictionary beside herfor you dream of so many things you cant spell or be expected to spell when you are only eleven  next to her sits felicity beautiful and conscious that she is beautiful with hair of spun sunshine and seablue eyes and all the roses of that vanished summer abloom in her cheeks  peter is beside her of course sprawled flat on his stomach among the grasses one hand clutching his black curls with his dream book on a small round stone before himfor only so can peter compose at all and even then he finds it hard work  he can handle a hoe more deftly than a pencil and his spelling even with all his frequent appeals to cecily is a fearful and wonderful thing  as for punctuation he never attempts it beyond an occasion period jotted down whenever he happens to think of it whether in the right place or not  the story girl goes over his dreams after he has written them out and puts in the commas and semicolons and straightens out the sentences  felix sits on the right of the story girl fat and stodgy grimly in earnest even over dreams  he writes with his knees stuck up to form a writingdesk and he always frowns fiercely the whole time  dan like peter writes lying down flat but with his back towards us and he has a dismal habit of groaning aloud writhing his whole body and digging his toes into the grass when he cannot turn a sentence to suit him  sara ray is at his left  there is seldom anything to be said of sara except to tell where she is  like tennysons maud in one respect at least sara is splendidly null  well there we sit and write in our dream books and uncle roger passes by and accuses us of being up to devto very bad mischief  each of us was very anxious to possess the most exciting record but we were an honourable little crew and i do not think anything was ever written down in those dream books which had not really been dreamed  we had expected that the story girl would eclipse us all in the matter of dreams but at least in the beginning her dreams were no more remarkable than those of the rest of us  in dreamland we were all equal  cecily indeed seemed to have the most decided talent for dramatic dreams  that meekest and mildest of girls was in the habit of dreaming truly terrible things  almost every night battle murder or sudden death played some part in her visions  on the other hand dan who was a somewhat truculent fellow addicted to the perusal of lurid dime novels which he borrowed from the other boys in school dreamed dreams of such a peaceful and pastoral character that he was quite disgusted with the resulting tame pages of his dream book  but if the story girl could not dream anything more wonderful than the rest of us she scored when it came to the telling  to hear her tell a dream was as goodor as badas dreaming it yourself  as far as writing them down was concerned i believe that i beverley king carried off the palm  i was considered to possess a pretty knack of composition  but the story girl went me one better even there because having inherited something of her fathers talent for drawing she illustrated her dreams with sketches that certainly caught the spirit of them whatever might be said of their technical excellence  she had an especial knack for drawing monstrosities and i vividly recall the picture of an enormous and hideous lizard looking like a reptile of the pterodactyl period which she had dreamed of seeing crawl across the roof of the house  on another occasion she had a frightful dreamat least it seemed frightful while she told us and described the dreadful feeling it had given herof being chased around the parlour by the ottoman which made faces at her  she drew a picture of the grimacing ottoman on the margin of her dream book which so scared sara ray when she beheld it that she cried all the way home and insisted on sleeping that night with judy pineau lest the furniture take to pursuing her also  sara rays own dreams never amounted to much  she was always in trouble of some sortcouldnt get her hair braided or her shoes on the right feet  consequently her dream book was very monotonous  the only thing worth mentioning in the way of dreams that sara ray ever achieved was when she dreamed that she went up in a balloon and fell out  i expected to come down with an awful thud she said shuddering but i lit as light as a feather and woke right up  if you hadnt woke up youd have died said peter with a dark significance  if you dream of falling and dont wake you do land with a thud and it kills you  thats what happens to people who die in their sleep  how do you know asked dan skeptically  nobody who died in his sleep could ever tell it  my aunt jane told me so said peter  i suppose that settles it said felicity disagreeably  you always say something nasty when i mention my aunt jane said peter reproachfully  what did i say that was nasty cried felicity  i didnt say a single thing  well it sounded nasty said peter who knew that it is the tone that makes the music  what did your aunt jane look like asked cecily sympathetically  was she pretty  no conceded peter reluctantly she wasnt prettybut she looked like the woman in that picture the story girls father sent her last weekthe one with the shiny ring round her head and the baby in her lap  ive seen aunt jane look at me just like that woman looks at her baby  ma never looks so  poor ma is too busy washing  i wish i could dream of my aunt jane  i never do  dream of the dead youll hear of the living quoted felix oracularly  i dreamed last night that i threw a lighted match into that keg of gunpowder in mr cooks store at markdale said peter  it blew upand everything blew upand they fished me out of the messbut i woke up before id time to find out if i was killed or not  one is so apt to wake up just as things get interesting remarked the story girl discontentedly  i dreamed last night that i had really truly curly hair said cecily mournfully  and oh i was so happy  it was dreadful to wake up and find it as straight as ever  felix that sober solid fellow dreamed constantly of flying through the air  his descriptions of his aerial flights over the treetops of dreamland always filled us with envy  none of the rest of us could ever compass such a dream not even the story girl who might have been expected to dream of flying if anybody did  felix had a knack of dreaming anyhow and his dream book while suffering somewhat in comparison of literary style was about the best of the lot when it came to subject matter cecilys might be more dramatic but felixs was more amusing the dream which we all counted his masterpiece was the one in which a menagerie had camped in the orchard and the rhinoceros chased aunt janet around and around the pulpit stone but turned into an inoffensive pig when it was on the point of catching her  felix had a sick spell soon after we began our dream books and aunt janet essayed to cure him by administering a dose of liver pills which elder frewen had assured her were a cureall for every disease the flesh is heir to  but felix flatly refused to take liver pills mexican tea he would drink but liver pills he would not take in spite of his own suffering and aunt janets commands and entreaties  i could not understand his antipathy to the insignificant little white pellets which were so easy to swallow but he explained the matter to us in the orchard when he had recovered his usual health and spirits  i was afraid to take the liver pills for fear theyd prevent me from dreaming he said  dont you remember old miss baxter in toronto bev  and how she told mrs mclaren that she was subject to terrible dreams and finally she took two liver pills and never had any more dreams after that  id rather have died than risk it concluded felix solemnly  id an exciting dream last night for once said dan triumphantly  i dreamt old peg bowen chased me  i thought i was up to her house and she took after me  you bet i scooted and she caught meyes sir  i felt her skinny hand reach out and clutch my shoulder  i let out a screechand woke up  i should think you did screech said felicity  we heard you clean over into our room  i hate to dream of being chased because i can never run said sara ray with a shiver  i just stand rooted to the groundand see it comingand cant stir  it dont sound much written out but its awful to go through  im sure i hope ill never dream peg bowen chases me  ill die if i do  i wonder what peg bowen would really do to a fellow if she caught him speculated dan  peg bowen doesnt need to catch you to do things to you said peter ominously  she can put illluck on you just by looking at youand she will if you offend her  i dont believe that said the story girl airily  dont you  all right then  last summer she called at lem hills in markdale and he told her to clear out or hed set the dog on her  peg cleared out and she went across his pasture muttering to herself and throwing her arms round  and next day his very best cow took sick and died  how do you account for that  it might have happened anyhow said the story girlsomewhat less assuredly though  it might  but id just as soon peg bowen didnt look at my cows said peter  as if you had any cows giggled felicity  im going to have cows some day said peter flushing  i dont mean to be a hired boy all my life  ill have a farm of my own and cows and everything  youll see if i wont  i dreamed last night that we opened the blue chest said the story girl and all the things were therethe blue china candlestickonly it was brass in the dreamand the fruit basket with the apple on it and the wedding dress and the embroidered petticoat  and we were laughing and trying the things on and having such fun  and rachel ward herself came and looked at usso sad and reproachfuland we all felt ashamed and i began to cry and woke up crying  i dreamed last night that felix was thin said peter laughing he did look so queer  his clothes just hung loose and he was going round trying to hold them on  everybody thought this was funny except felix  he would not speak to peter for two days because of it  felicity also got into trouble because of her dreams  one night she woke up having just had a very exciting dream but she went to sleep again and in the morning she could not remember the dream at all  felicity determined she would never let another dream get away from her in such a fashion and the next time she wakened in the nighthaving dreamed that she was dead and buriedshe promptly arose lighted a candle and proceeded to write the dream down then and there  while so employed she contrived to upset the candle and set fire to her nightgowna brandnew one trimmed with any quantity of crocheted lace  a huge hole was burned in it and when aunt janet discovered it she lifted up her voice with no uncertain sound  felicity had never received a sharper scolding  but she took it very philosophically  she was used to her mothers bitter tongue and she was not unduly sensitive  anyhow i saved my dream she said placidly  and that of course was all that really mattered  grown people were so strangely oblivious to the truly important things of life  material for new garments of night or day could be bought in any shop for a trifling sum and made up out of hand but if a dream escape you in what marketplace the wide world over can you hope to regain it  what coin of earthly minting will ever buy back for you that lost and lovely vision    chapter xxiii such stuff as dreams are made on  peter took dan and me aside one evening as we were on our way to the orchard with our dream books saying significantly that he wanted our advice  accordingly we went round to the spruce wood where the girls would not see us to the rousing of their curiosity and then peter told us of his dilemma  last night i dreamed i was in church he said  i thought it was full of people and i walked up the aisle to your pew and set down as unconcerned as a pig on ice  and then i found that i hadnt a stitch of clothes onnot one blessed stitch  now peter dropped his voicewhat is bothering me is thiswould it be proper to tell a dream like that before the girls  i was of the opinion that it would be rather questionable but dan vowed he didnt see why  hed tell it quick as any other dream  there was nothing bad in it  but theyre your own relations said peter  theyre no relation to me and that makes a difference  besides theyre all such ladylike girls  i guess id better not risk it  im pretty sure aunt jane wouldnt think it was proper to tell such a dream  and i dont want to offend felany of them  so peter never told that dream nor did he write it down instead i remember seeing in his dream book under the date of september fifteenth an entry to this effect  last nite i dremed a drem  it wasent a polit drem so i wont rite it down  the girls saw this entry but to their credit be it told they never tried to find out what the drem was  as peter said they were ladies in the best and truest sense of that much abused appellation  full of fun and frolic and mischief they were with all the defects of their qualities and all the wayward faults of youth  but no indelicate thought or vulgar word could have been shaped or uttered in their presence  had any of us boys ever been guilty of such cecilys pale face would have coloured with the blush of outraged purity felicitys golden head would have lifted itself in the haughty indignation of insulted womanhood and the story girls splendid eyes would have flashed with such anger and scorn as would have shrivelled the very soul of the wretched culprit  dan was once guilty of swearing  uncle alec whipped him for itthe only time he ever so punished any of his children  but it was because cecily cried all night that dan was filled with saving remorse and repentance  he vowed next day to cecily that he would never swear again and he kept his word  all at once the story girl and peter began to forge ahead in the matter of dreaming  their dreams suddenly became so lurid and dreadful and picturesque that it was hard for the rest of us to believe that they were not painting the lily rather freely in their accounts of them  but the story girl was the soul of honour and peter early in life had had his feet set in the path of truthfulness by his aunt jane and had never been known to stray from it  when they assured us solemnly that their dreams all happened exactly as they described them we were compelled to believe them  but there was something up we felt sure of that peter and the story girl certainly had a secret between them which they kept for a whole fortnight  there was no finding it out from the story girl  she had a knack of keeping secrets anyhow and moreover all that fortnight she was strangely cranky and petulant and we found it was not wise to tease her she was not well so aunt olivia told aunt janet  i dont know what is the matter with the child said the former anxiously  she hasnt seemed like herself the past two weeks she complains of headache and she has no appetite and she is a dreadful colour  ill have to see a doctor about her if she doesnt get better soon  give her a good dose of mexican tea and try that first said aunt janet  ive saved many a doctors bill in my family by using mexican tea  the mexican tea was duly administered but produced no improvement in the condition of the story girl who however went on dreaming after a fashion which soon made her dream book a veritable curiosity of literature  if we cant soon find out what makes peter and the story girl dream like that the rest of us might as well give up trying to write dream books said felix discontentedly  finally we did find out  felicity wormed the secret out of peter by the employment of delilah wiles such as have been the undoing of many a miserable male creature since samsons day she first threatened that she would never speak to him again if he didnt tell her and then she promised him that if he did she would let him walk beside her to and from sunday school all the rest of the summer and carry her books for her  peter was not proof against this double attack  he yielded and told the secret  i expected the story girl would overwhelm him with scorn and indignation  but she took it very coolly  i knew felicity would get it out of him sometime she said  i think he has done well to hold out this long  peter and the story girl so it appeared had wooed wild dreams to their pillows by the simple device of eating rich indigestible things before they went to bed  aunt olivia knew nothing about it of course  she permitted them only a plain wholesome lunch at bedtime  but during the day the story girl would smuggle upstairs various tidbits from the pantry putting half in peters room and half in her own and the result was these visions which had been our despair  last night i ate a piece of mince pie she said and a lot of pickles and two grape jelly tarts  but i guess i overdid it because i got real sick and couldnt sleep at all so of course i didnt have any dreams  i should have stopped with the pie and pickles and left the tarts alone  peter did and he had an elegant dream that peg bowen caught him and put him on to boil alive in that big black pot that hangs outside her door  he woke up before the water got hot though  well miss felicity youre pretty smart  but how will you like to walk to sunday school with a boy who wears patched trousers  i wont have to said felicity triumphantly  peter is having a new suit made  its to be ready by saturday  i knew that before i promised  having discovered how to produce exciting dreams we all promptly followed the example of peter and the story girl  there is no chance for me to have any horrid dreams lamented sara ray because ma wont let me having anything at all to eat before i go to bed  i dont think its fair  cant you hide something away through the day as we do asked felicity  no  sara shook her fawncoloured head mournfully  ma always keeps the pantry locked for fear judy pineau will treat her friends  for a week we ate unlawful lunches and dreamed dreams after our own heartsand i regret to say bickered and squabbled incessantly throughout the daytime for our digestions went out of order and our tempers followed suit  even the story girl and i had a fightsomething that had never happened before  peter was the only one who kept his normal poise  nothing could upset that boys stomach  one night cecily came into the pantry with a large cucumber and proceeded to devour the greater part of it  the grownups were away that evening attending a lecture at markdale so we ate our snacks openly without any recourse to ways that were dark  i remember i supped that night off a solid hunk of fat pork topped off with a slab of cold plum pudding  i thought you didnt like cucumber cecily dan remarked  neither i do said cecily with a grimace  but peter says theyre splendid for dreaming  he et one that night he had the dream about being caught by cannibals  id eat three cucumbers if i could have a dream like that  cecily finished her cucumber and then drank a glass of milk just as we heard the wheels of uncle alecs buggy rambling over the bridge in the hollow  felicity quickly restored pork and pudding to their own places and by the time aunt janet came in we were all in our respective beds  soon the house was dark and silent  i was just dropping into an uneasy slumber when i heard a commotion in the girls room across the hall  their door opened and through our own open door i saw felicitys whiteclad figure flit down the stairs to aunt janets room from the room she had left came moans and cries  cecilys sick said dan springing out of bed  that cucumber must have disagreed with her  in a few minutes the whole house was astir  cecily was sickvery very sick there was no doubt of that  she was even worse than dan had been when he had eaten the bad berries  uncle alec tired as he was from his hard days work and evening outing was despatched for the doctor  aunt janet and felicity administered all the homely remedies they could think of but to no effect  felicity told aunt janet of the cucumber but aunt janet did not think the cucumber alone could be responsible for cecilys alarming condition  cucumbers are indigestible but i never knew of them making any one as sick as this she said anxiously  what made the child eat a cucumber before going to bed  i didnt think she liked them  it was that wretched peter sobbed felicity indignantly  he told her it would make her dream something extra  what on earth did she want to dream for demanded aunt janet in bewilderment  oh to have something worth while to write in her dream book ma  we all have dream books you know and every one wants their own to be the most excitingand weve been eating rich things to make us dreamand it doesbut if cecilyoh ill never forgive myself said felicity incoherently letting all kinds of cats out of the bag in her excitement and alarm  well i wonder what on earth you young ones will do next said aunt janet in the helpless tone of a woman who gives it up  cecily was no better when the doctor came  like aunt janet he declared that cucumbers alone would not have made her so ill but when he found out that she had drunk a glass of milk also the mystery was solved  why milk and cucumbers together make a rank poison he said no wonder the child is sick  therethere now seeing the alarmed faces around him dont be frightened  as old mrs fraser says its no deidly  it wont kill her but shell probably be a pretty miserable girl for two or three days  she was  and we were all miserable in company  aunt janet investigated the whole affair and the matter of our dream books was aired in family conclave  i do not know which hurt our feelings mostthe scolding we got from aunt janet or the ridicule which the other grownups especially uncle roger showered on us  peter received an extra setting down which he considered rank injustice  i didnt tell cecily to drink the milk and the cucumber alone wouldnt have hurt her  he grumbled  cecily was able to be out with us again that day so peter felt that he might venture on a grumble  sides she coaxed me to tell her what would be good for dreams  i just told her as a favour  and now your aunt janet blames me for the whole trouble  and aunt janet says we are never to have anything to eat before we go to bed after this except plain bread and milk said felix sadly  theyd like to stop us from dreaming altogether if they could said the story girl wrathfully  well anyway they cant prevent us from growing up consoled dan  we neednt worry about the bread and milk rule added felicity ma made a rule like that once before and kept it for a week and then we just slipped back to the old way  that will be what will happen this time too  but of course we wont be able to get any more rich things for supper and our dreams will be pretty flat after this  well lets go down to the pulpit stone and ill tell you a story i know said the story girl  we wentand straightway drank of the waters of forgetfulness in a brief space we were laughing right merrily no longer remembering our wrongs at the hands of those cruel grownups our laughter echoed back from the barns and the spruce grove as if elfin denizens of upper air were sharing in our mirth  presently also the laughter of the grownups mingled with ours aunt olivia and uncle roger aunt janet and uncle alec came strolling through the orchard and joined our circle as they sometimes did when the toil of the day was over and the magic time twixt light and dark brought truce of care and labour twas then we liked our grownups best for then they seemed half children again  uncle roger and uncle alec lolled in the grass like boys aunt olivia looking more like a pansy than ever in the prettiest dress of pale purple print with a knot of yellow ribbon at her throat sat with her arm about cecily and smiled on us all and aunt janets motherly face lost its everyday look of anxious care  the story girl was in great fettle that night  never had her tales sparkled with such wit and archness  sara stanley said aunt olivia shaking her finger at her after a sidesplitting yarn if you dont watch out youll be famous some day  these funny stories are all right said uncle roger but for real enjoyment give me something with a creep in it  sara tell us that story of the serpent woman i heard you tell one day last summer  the story girl began it glibly  but before she had gone far with it i who was sitting beside her felt an unaccountable repulsion creeping over me  for the first time since i had known her i wanted to draw away from the story girl  looking around on the faces of the group i saw that they all shared my feeling cecily had put her hands over her eyes  peter was staring at the story girl with a fascinated horrorstrickened gaze  aunt olivia was pale and troubled  all looked as if they were held prisoners in the bonds of a fearsome spell which they would gladly break but could not  it was not our story girl who sat there telling that weird tale in a sibilant curdling voice  she had put on a new personality like a garment and that personality was a venomous evil loathly thing  i would rather have died than have touched the slim brown wrist on which she supported herself  the light in her narrowed orbs was the cold merciless gleam of the serpents eye  i felt frightened of this unholy creature who had suddenly come in our dear story girls place  when the tale ended there was a brief silence  then aunt janet said severely but with a sigh of relief  little girls shouldnt tell such horrible stories  this truly aunt janetian remark broke the spell  the grownups laughed rather shakily and the story girlour own dear story girl once more and no serpent womansaid protestingly  well uncle roger asked me to tell it  i dont like telling such stories either  they make me feel dreadful  do you know for just a little while i felt exactly like a snake  you looked like one said uncle roger  how on earth do you do it  i cant explain how i do it said the story girl perplexedly it just does itself  genius can never explain how it does it  it would not be genius if it could  and the story girl had genius  as we left the orchard i walked along behind uncle roger and aunt olivia  that was an uncanny exhibition for a girl of fourteen you know roger said aunt olivia musingly  what is in store for that child  fame said uncle roger  if she ever has a chance that is and i suppose her father will see to that  at least i hope he will  you and i olivia never had our chance  i hope sara will have hers  this was my first inkling of what i was to understand more fully in later years  uncle roger and aunt olivia had both cherished certain dreams and ambitions in youth but circumstances had denied them their chance and those dreams had never been fulfilled  some day olivia went on uncle roger you and i may find ourselves the aunt and uncle of the foremost actress of her day if a girl of fourteen can make a couple of practical farmers and a pair of matteroffact housewives half believe for ten minutes that she really is a snake what wont she be able to do when she is thirty  here you added uncle roger perceiving me cut along and get off to your bed  and mind you dont eat cucumbers and milk before you go    chapter xxiv the bewitchment of pat  we were all in the doleful dumpsat least all we young fry were and even the grownups were sorry and condescended to take an interest in our troubles  pat our own dear frolicsome paddy was sick againvery very sick  on friday he moped and refused his saucer of new milk at milking time  the next morning he stretched himself down on the platform by uncle rogers back door laid his head on his black paws and refused to take any notice of anything or anybody  in vain we stroked and entreated and brought him tidbits  only when the story girl caressed him did he give one plaintive little mew as if to ask piteously why she could not do something for him  at that cecily and felicity and sara ray all began crying and we boys felt choky  indeed i caught peter behind aunt olivias dairy later in the day and if ever a boy had been crying i vow that boy was peter  nor did he deny it when i taxed him with it but he would not give in that he was crying about paddy nonsense  what were you crying for then i said  im crying becausebecause my aunt jane is dead said peter defiantly  but your aunt jane died two years ago i said skeptically  well aint that all the more reason for crying retorted peter  ive had to do without her for two years and thats worse than if it had just been a few days  i believe you were crying because pat is so sick i said firmly  as if id cry about a cat scoffed peter  and he marched off whistling  of course we had tried the lard and powder treatment again smearing pats paws and sides liberally  but to our dismay pat made no effort to lick it off  i tell you hes a mighty sick cat said peter darkly  when a cat dont care what he looks like hes pretty far gone  if we only knew what was the matter with him we might do something sobbed the story girl stroking her poor pets unresponsive head  i could tell you whats the matter with him but youd only laugh at me said peter  we all looked at him  peter craig what do you mean asked felicity  zackly what i say  then if you know what is the matter with paddy tell us commanded the story girl standing up  she said it quietly but peter obeyed  i think he would have obeyed if she in that tone and with those eyes had ordered him to cast himself into the depths of the sea  i know i should  hes bewitchedthats whats the matter with him said peter half defiantly half shamefacedly  bewitched  nonsense  there now what did i tell you complained peter  the story girl looked at peter at the rest of us and then at poor pat  how could he be bewitched she asked irresolutely and who could bewitch him  i dont know how he was bewitched said peter  id have to be a witch myself to know that  but peg bowen bewitched him  nonsense said the story girl again  all right said peter  you dont have to believe me  if peg bowen could bewitch anythingand i dont believe she couldwhy should she bewitch pat asked the story girl everybody here and at uncle alecs is always kind to her  ill tell you why said peter  thursday afternoon when you fellows were all in school peg bowen came here  your aunt olivia gave her a luncha good one  you may laugh at the notion of peg being a witch but i notice your folks are always awful good to her when she comes and awful careful never to offend her  aunt olivia would be good to any poor creature and so would mother said felicity  and of course nobody wants to offend peg because she is spiteful and she once set fire to a mans barn in markdale when he offended her  but she isnt a witchthats ridiculous  all right  but wait till i tell you  when peg bowen was leaving pat stretched out on the steps  she tramped on his tail you know pat doesnt like to have his tail meddled with  he slewed himself round and clawed her bare foot  if youd just seen the look she gave him youd know whether she was a witch or not  and she went off down the lane muttering and throwing her hands round just like she did in lem hills cow pasture  she put a spell on pat thats what she did  he was sick the next morning  we looked at each other in miserable perplexed silence  we were only childrenand we believed that there had been such things as witches once upon a timeand peg bowen was an eerie creature  if thats sothough i cant believe itwe cant do anything said the story girl drearily  pat must die  cecily began to weep afresh  id do anything to save pats life she said  id believe anything  theres nothing we can do said felicity impatiently  i suppose sobbed cecily we might go to peg bowen and ask her to forgive pat and take the spell off him  she might if we apologized real humble  at first we were appalled by the suggestion  we didnt believe that peg bowen was a witch  but to go to herto seek her out in that mysterious woodland retreat of hers which was invested with all the terrors of the unknown  and that this suggestion should come from timid cecily of all people  but then there was poor pat  would it do any good said the story girl desperately  even if she did make pat sick i suppose it would only make her crosser if we went and accused her of bewitching him  besides she didnt do anything of the sort  but there was some uncertainty in the story girls voice  it wouldnt do any harm to try said cecily  if she didnt make him sick it wont matter if she is cross  it wont matter to pat but it might to the one who goes to her said felicity  she isnt a witch but shes a spiteful old woman and goodness knows what shed do to us if she caught us  im scared of peg bowen and i dont care who knows it ever since i can mind mas been saying if youre not good peg bowen will catch you  if i thought she really made pat sick and could make him better id try to pacify her somehow said the story girl decidedly im frightened of her toobut just look at poor darling paddy  we looked at paddy who continued to stare fixedly before him with unwinking eyes  uncle roger came out and looked at him also with what seemed to us positively brutal unconcern  im afraid its all up with pat he said  uncle roger said cecily imploringly peter says peg bowen has bewitched pat for scratching her  do you think it can be so  did pat scratch peg asked uncle roger with a horrorstricken face  dear me  dear me  that mystery is solved  poor pat  uncle roger nodded his head as if resigning himself and pat to the worst  do you really think peg bowen is a witch uncle roger demanded the story girl incredulously  do i think peg bowen is a witch  my dear sara what do you think of a woman who can turn herself into a black cat whenever she likes  is she a witch  or is she not  i leave it to you  can peg bowen turn herself into a black cat asked felix staring  its my belief that that is the least of peg bowens accomplishments answered uncle roger  its the easiest thing in the world for a witch to turn herself into any animal you choose to mention  yes pat is bewitchedno doubt of thatnot the least in the world  what are you telling those children such stuff for asked aunt olivia passing on her way to the well  its an irresistible temptation answered uncle roger strolling over to carry her pail  you can see your uncle roger believes peg is a witch said peter  and you can see aunt olivia doesnt i said and i dont either  see here said the story girl resolutely i dont believe it but there may be something in it  suppose there is  the question is what can we do  ill tell you what id do said peter  id take a present for peg and ask her to make pat well  i wouldnt let on i thought shed made him sick  then she couldnt be offendedand maybe shed take the spell off  i think wed better all give her something said felicity im willing to do that  but whos going to take the presents to her  we must all go together said the story girl  i wont cried sara ray in terror  i wouldnt go near peg bowens house for the world no matter who was with me  ive thought of a plan said the story girl  lets all give her something as felicity says  and let us all go up to her place this evening and if we see her outside well just go quietly and set the things down before her with the letter and say nothing but come respectfully away  if shell let us said dan significantly  can peg read a letter i asked  oh yes  aunt olivia says she is a good scholar  she went to school and was a smart girl until she became crazy  well write it very plain  what if we dont see her asked felicity  well put the things on her doorstep then and leave them  she may be miles away over the country by this time sighed cecily and never find them until its too late for pat  but its the only thing to do  what can we give her  we mustnt offer her any money said the story girl  shes very indignant when any one does that  she says she isnt a beggar  but shell take anything else  i shall give her my string of blue beads  shes fond of finery  ill give her that sponge cake i made this morning said felicity  i guess she doesnt get sponge cake very often  ive nothing but the rheumatism ring i got as a premium for selling needles last winter said peter  ill give her that even if she hasnt got rheumatism its a real handsome ring  it looks like solid gold  ill give her a roll of peppermint candy said felix  ill give one of those little jars of cherry preserve i made said cecily  i wont go near her quavered sara ray but i want to do something for pat and ill send that piece of apple leaf lace i knit last week  i decided to give the redoubtable peg some apples from my birthday tree and dan declared he would give her a plug of tobacco  oh wont she be insulted exclaimed felix rather horrified  naw grinned dan  peg chews tobacco like a man  shed rather have it than your rubbishy peppermints i can tell you  ill run down to old mrs sampsons and get a plug  now we must write the letter and take it and the presents to her right away before it gets dark said the story girl  we adjourned to the granary to indite the important document which the story girl was to compose  how shall i begin it she asked in perplexity  it would never do to say dear peg and dear miss bowen sounds too ridiculous  besides nobody knows whether she is miss bowen or not said felicity  she went to boston when she grew up and some say she was married there and her husband deserted her and thats why she went crazy  if shes married she wont like being called miss  well how am i to address her asked the story girl in despair  peter again came to the rescue with a practical suggestion  begin it respected madam he said  ma has a letter a school trustee once writ to my aunt jane and thats how it begins  respected madam wrote the story girl  we want to ask a very great favour of you and we hope you will kindly grant it if you can  our favourite cat paddy is very sick and we are afraid he is going to die  do you think you could cure him  and will you please try  we are all so fond of him and he is such a good cat and has no bad habits  of course if any of us tramps on his tail he will scratch us but you know a cat cant bear to have his tail tramped on  its a very tender part of him and its his only way of preventing it and he doesnt mean any harm if you can cure paddy for us we will always be very very grateful to you  the accompanying small offerings are a testimonial of our respect and gratitude and we entreat you to honour us by accepting them                                         very respectfully yours                                                  sara stanley  i tell you that last sentence has a fine sound said peter admiringly  i didnt make that up admitted the story girl honestly  i read it somewhere and remembered it  i think its too fine criticized felicity  peg bowen wont know the meaning of such big words  but it was decided to leave them in and we all signed the letter  then we got our testimonials and started on our reluctant journey to the domains of the witch  sara ray would not go of course but she volunteered to stay with pat while we were away we did not think it necessary to inform the grownups of our errand or its nature  grownups had such peculiar views  they might forbid our going at alland they would certainly laugh at us  peg bowens house was nearly a mile away even by the short cut past the swamp and up the wooded hill  we went down through the brook field and over the little plank bridge in the hollow half lost in its surrounding sea of farewell summers  when we reached the green gloom of the woods beyond we began to feel frightened but nobody would admit it  we walked very closely together and we did not talk  when you are near the retreat of witches and folk of that ilk the less you say the better for their feelings are so notoriously touchy  of course peg wasnt a witch but it was best to be on the safe side  finally we came to the lane which led directly to her abode  we were all very pale now and our hearts were beating  the red september sun hung low between the tall spruces to the west  it did not look to me just right for a sun  in fact everything looked uncanny  i wished our errand were well over  a sudden bend in the lane brought us out to the little clearing where pegs house was before we were half ready to see it  in spite of my fear i looked at it with some curiosity  it was a small shaky building with a sagging roof set amid a perfect jungle of weeds  to our eyes the odd thing about it was that there was no entrance on the ground floor as there should be in any respectable house  the only door was in the upper story and was reached by a flight of rickety steps  there was no sign of life about the place exceptsight of ill omena large black cat sitting on the topmost step  we thought of uncle rogers gruesome hints  could that black cat be peg  nonsense  but stillit didnt look like an ordinary cat  it was so largeand had such green malicious eyes  plainly there was something out of the common about the beastie  in a tense breathless silence the story girl placed our parcels on the lowest step and laid her letter on the top of the pile her brown fingers trembled and her face was very pale  suddenly the door above us opened and peg bowen herself appeared on the threshold  she was a tall sinewy old woman wearing a short ragged drugget skirt which reached scantly below her knees a scarlet print blouse and a mans hat  her feet arms and neck were bare and she had a battered old clay pipe in her mouth  her brown face was seamed with a hundred wrinkles and her tangled grizzled hair fell unkemptly over her shoulders she was scowling and her flashing black eyes held no friendly light  we had borne up bravely enough hitherto in spite of our inward unconfessed quakings  but now our strained nerves gave way and sheer panic seized us  peter gave a little yelp of pure terror we turned and fled across the clearing and into the woods  down the long hill we tore like mad hunted creatures firmly convinced that peg bowen was after us  wild was that scamper as nightmarelike as any recorded in our dream books  the story girl was in front of me and i can recall the tremendous leaps she made over fallen logs and little spruce bushes with her long brown curls streaming out behind her from their scarlet fillet cecily behind me kept gasping out the contradictory sentences oh bev wait for me and oh bev hurry hurry more by blind instinct than anything else we kept together and found our way out of the woods  presently we were in the field beyond the brook  over us was a dainty sky of shell pink placid cows were pasturing around us the farewell summers nodded to us in the friendly breezes  we halted with a glad realization that we were back in our own haunts and that peg bowen had not caught us  oh wasnt that an awful experience gasped cecily shuddering i wouldnt go through it againi couldnt not even for pat  it come on a fellow so suddent said peter shamefacedly  i think i could astood my ground if id known she was going to come out  but when she popped out like that i thought i was done for  we shouldnt have run said felicity gloomily  it showed we were afraid of her and that always makes her awful cross  she wont do a thing for pat now  i dont believe she could do anything anyway said the story girl  i think weve just been a lot of geese  we were all except peter more or less inclined to agree with her  and the conviction of our folly deepened when we reached the granary and found that pat watched over by the faithful sara ray was no better  the story girl announced that she would take him into the kitchen and sit up all night with him  he shant die alone anyway she said miserably gathering his limp body up in her arms  we did not think aunt olivia would give her permission to stay up but aunt olivia did  aunt olivia really was a duck  we wanted to stay with her also but aunt janet wouldnt hear of such a thing  she ordered us off to bed saying that it was positively sinful in us to be so worked up over a cat  five heartbroken children who knew that there are many worse friends than dumb furry folk climbed uncle alecs stairs to bed that night  theres nothing we can do now except pray god to make pat better said cecily  i must candidly say that her tone savoured strongly of a last resort but this was owing more to early training than to any lack of faith on cecilys part  she knew and we knew that prayer was a solemn rite not to be lightly held nor degraded to common uses  felicity voiced this conviction when she said  i dont believe it would be right to pray about a cat  id like to know why not retorted cecily god made paddy just as much as he made you felicity king though perhaps he didnt go to so much trouble  and im sure hes abler to help him than peg bowen  anyhow im going to pray for pat with all my might and main and id like to see you try to stop me  of course i wont mix it up with more important things  ill just tack it on after ive finished asking the blessings but before i say amen  more petitions than cecilys were offered up that night on behalf of paddy  i distinctly heard felixwho always said his prayers in a loud whisper owing to some lasting conviction of early life that god could not hear him if he did not pray audiblymutter pleadingly after the important part of his devotions was over oh god please make pat better by the morning  please do  and i even in these late years of irreverence for the dreams of youth am not in the least ashamed to confess that when i knelt down to say my boyish prayer i thought of our little furry comrade in his extremity and prayed as reverently as i knew how for his healing  then i went to sleep comforted by the simple hope that the great father would after important things were all attended to remember poor pat  as soon as we were up the next morning we rushed off to uncle rogers  but we met peter and the story girl in the lane and their faces were as the faces of those who bring glad tidings upon the mountains  pats better cried the story girl blithe triumphant  last night just at twelve he began to lick his paws  then he licked himself all over and went to sleep too on the sofa  when i woke pat was washing his face and he has taken a whole saucerful of milk  oh isnt it splendid  you see peg bowen did put a spell on him said peter and then she took it off  i guess cecilys prayer had more to do with pats getting better than peg bowen said felicity  she prayed for pat over and over again  that is why hes better  oh all right said peter but id advise pat not to scratch peg bowen again thats all  i wish i knew whether it was the praying or peg bowen that cured pat said felix in perplexity  i dont believe it was either of them said dan  pat just got sick and got better again of his own accord  im going to believe that it was the praying said cecily decidedly  its so much nicer to believe that god cured pat than that peg bowen did  but you oughtnt to believe a thing just cause it would be more comfortable objected peter  mind you i aint saying god couldnt cure pat  but nothing and nobody cant ever make me believe that peg bowen wasnt at the bottom of it all  thus faith superstition and incredulity strove together amongst us as in all history    chapter xxv a cup of failure  one warm sunday evening in the moon of goldenrod we all grownups and children were sitting in the orchard by the pulpit stone singing sweet old gospel hymns  we could all sing more or less except poor sara ray who had once despairingly confided to me that she didnt know what shed ever do when she went to heaven because she couldnt sing a note  that whole scene comes out clearly for me in memorythe arc of primrose sky over the trees behind the old house the fruitladen boughs of the orchard the bank of goldenrod like a wave of sunshine behind the pulpit stone the nameless colour seen on a fir wood in a ruddy sunset  i can see uncle alecs tired brilliant blue eyes aunt janets wholesome matronly face uncle rogers sweeping blond beard and red cheeks and aunt olivias fullblown beauty  two voices ring out for me above all others in the music that echoes through the halls of recollection  cecilys sweet and silvery and uncle alecs fine tenor  if youre a king you sing was a carlisle proverb in those days  aunt julia had been the flower of the flock in that respect and had become a noted concert singer  the world had never heard of the rest  their music echoed only along the hidden ways of life and served but to lighten the cares of the trivial round and common task  that evening after they tired of singing our grownups began talking of their youthful days and doings  this was always a keen delight to us small fry  we listened avidly to the tales of our uncles and aunts in the days when they toohard fact to realizehad been children  good and proper as they were now once so it seemed they had gotten into mischief and even had their quarrels and disagreements  on this particular evening uncle roger told many stories of uncle edward and one in which the said edward had preached sermons at the mature age of ten from the pulpit stone fired as the sequel will show the story girls imagination  cant i just see him at it now said uncle roger leaning over that old boulder his cheeks red and his eyes burning with excitement banging the top of it as he had seen the ministers do in church  it wasnt cushioned however and he always bruised his hands in his selfforgetful earnestness  we thought him a regular wonder  we loved to hear him preach but we didnt like to hear him pray because he always insisted on praying for each of us by name and it made us feel wretchedly uncomfortable somehow  alec do you remember how furious julia was because edward prayed one day that she might be preserved from vanity and conceit over her singing  i should think i do laughed uncle alec  she was sitting right there where cecily is now and she got up at once and marched right out of the orchard but at the gate she turned to call back indignantly i guess youd better wait till youve prayed the conceit out of yourself before you begin on me ned king  i never heard such stuckup sermons as you preach  ned went on praying and never let on he heard her but at the end of his prayer he wound up with oh god i pray you to keep an eye on us all but i pray you to pay particular attention to my sister julia for i think she needs it even more than the rest of us world without end amen  our uncles roared with laughter over the recollection  we all laughed indeed especially over another tale in which uncle edward leaning too far over the pulpit in his earnestness lost his balance altogether and tumbled ingloriously into the grass below  he lit on a big scotch thistle said uncle roger chuckling and besides that he skinned his forehead on a stone  but he was determined to finish his sermon and finish it he did  he climbed back into the pulpit with the tears rolling over his cheeks and preached for ten minutes longer with sobs in his voice and drops of blood on his forehead  he was a plucky little beggar  no wonder he succeeded in life  and his sermons and prayers were always just about as outspoken as those julia objected to said uncle alec  well were all getting on in life and edward is gray but when i think of him i always see him a little rosy curlyheaded chap laying down the law to us from the pulpit stone  it seems like the other day that we were all here together just as these children are and now we are scattered everywhere  julia in california edward in halifax alan in south america felix and felicity and stephen gone to the land that is very far off  there was a little space of silence and then uncle alec began in a low impressive voice to repeat the wonderful verses of the ninetieth psalmverses which were thenceforth bound up for us with the beauty of that night and the memories of our kindred very reverently we all listened to the majestic words  lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art god  for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night  for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years as a tale that is told  the days of our years are threescore and ten and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength labour and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away  so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom  oh satisfy us early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be glad all our days  and let the beauty of the lord our god be upon us and establish thou the work of our hands upon us yea the work of our hands establish thou it  the dusk crept into the orchard like a dim bewitching personality  you could see herfeel herhear her  she tiptoed softly from tree to tree ever drawing nearer  presently her filmy wings hovered over us and through them gleamed the early stars of the autumn night  the grownups rose reluctantly and strolled away but we children lingered for a moment to talk over an idea the story girl broacheda good idea we thought enthusiastically and one that promised to add considerable spice to life  we were on the lookout for some new amusement  dream books had begun to pall  we no longer wrote in them very regularly and our dreams were not what they used to be before the mischance of the cucumber  so the story girls suggestion came pat to the psychological moment  ive thought of a splendid plan she said  it just flashed into my mind when the uncles were talking about uncle edward and the beauty of it is we can play it on sundays and you know there are so few things it is proper to play on sundays  but this is a christian game so it will be all right  it isnt like the religious fruit basket game is it asked cecily anxiously  we had good reason to hope that it wasnt  one desperate sunday afternoon when we had nothing to read and the time seemed endless felix had suggested that we have a game of fruitbasket only instead of taking the names of fruits we were to take the names of bible characters  this he argued would make it quite lawful and proper to play on sunday  we too desirous of being convinced also thought so and for a merry hour lazarus and martha and moses and aaron and sundry other worthies of holy writ had a lively time of it in the king orchard  peter having a scriptural name of his own did not want to take another but we would not allow this because it would give him an unfair advantage over the rest of us  it would be so much easier to call out your own name than fit your tongue to an unfamiliar one so peter retaliated by choosing nebuchadnezzar which no one could ever utter three times before peter shrieked it out once  in the midst of our hilarity however uncle alec and aunt janet came down upon us  it is best to draw a veil over what followed suffice it to say that the recollection gave point to cecilys question  no it isnt that sort of game at all said the story girl it is this each of you boys must preach a sermon as uncle edward used to do  one of you next sunday and another the next and so on  and whoever preaches the best sermon is to get a prize  dan promptly declared he wouldnt try to preach a sermon but peter felix and i thought the suggestion a very good one secretly i believed i could cut quite a fine figure preaching a sermon  wholl give the prize asked felix  i will said the story girl  ill give that picture father sent me last week  as the said picture was an excellent copy of one of landseers stags felix and i were well pleased but peter averred that he would rather have the madonna that looked like his aunt jane and the story girl agreed that if his sermon was the best she would give him that  but whos to be the judge i said and what kind of a sermon would you call the best  the one that makes the most impression answered the story girl promptly  and we girls must be the judges because theres nobody else  now who is to preach next sunday  it was decided that i should lead off and i lay awake for an extra hour that night thinking what text i should take for the following sunday  the next day i bought two sheets of foolscap from the schoolmaster and after tea i betook myself to the granary barred the door and fell to writing my sermon  i did not find it as easy a task as i had anticipated but i pegged grimly away at it and by dint of severe labour for two evenings i eventually got my four pages of foolscap filled although i had to pad the subjectmatter not a little with verses of quotable hymns  i had decided to preach on missions as being a topic more within my grasp than abstruse theological doctrines or evangelical discourses and mindful of the need of making an impression i drew a harrowing picture of the miserable plight of the heathen who in their darkness bowed down to wood and stone then i urged our responsibility concerning them and meant to wind up by reciting in a very solemn and earnest voice the verse beginning can we whose souls are lighted  when i had completed my sermon i went over it very carefully again and wrote with red inkcecily made it for me out of an aniline dyethe word thump wherever i deemed it advisable to chastise the pulpit  i have that sermon still all its red thumps unfaded lying beside my dream book but i am not going to inflict it on my readers  i am not so proud of it as i once was  i was really puffed up with earthly vanity over it at that time  felix i thought would be hard put to it to beat it  as for peter i did not consider him a rival to be feared  it was unsupposable that a hired boy with little education and less experience of churchgoing should be able to preach better than could i in whose family there was a real minister  the sermon written the next thing was to learn it off by heart and then practise it thumps included until i was letter and gesture perfect  i preached it over several times in the granary with only paddy sitting immovably on a puncheon for audience paddy stood the test fairly well  at least he made an adorable listener save at such times as imaginary rats distracted his attention  mr marwood had at least three absorbed listeners the next sunday morning  felix peter and i were all among the chiels who were taking mental notes on the art of preaching a sermon  not a motion or glance or intonation escaped us  to be sure none of us could remember the text when we got home but we knew just how you should throw back your head and clutch the edge of the pulpit with both hands when you announced it  in the afternoon we all repaired to the orchard bibles and hymn books in hand  we did not think it necessary to inform the grownups of what was in the wind  you could never tell what kink a grownup would take  they might not think it proper to play any sort of a game on sunday not even a christian game least said was soonest mended where grownups were concerned  i mounted the pulpit steps feeling rather nervous and my audience sat gravely down on the grass before me  our opening exercises consisted solely of singing and reading  we had agreed to omit prayer  neither felix peter nor i felt equal to praying in public  but we took up a collection  the proceeds were to go to missions  dan passed the platefelicitys rosebud plate looking as preternaturally solemn as elder frewen himself  every one put a cent on it  well i preached my sermon  and it fell horribly flat  i realized that before i was half way through it  i think i preached it very well and never a thump did i forget or misplace  but my audience was plainly bored  when i stepped down from the pulpit after demanding passionately if we whose souls were lighted and so forth i felt with secret humiliation that my sermon was a failure  it had made no impression at all felix would be sure to get the prize  that was a very good sermon for a first attempt said the story girl graciously  it sounded just like real sermons i have heard  for a moment the charm of her voice made me feel that i had not done so badly after all but the other girls thinking it their duty to pay me some sort of a compliment also quickly dispelled that pleasing delusion  every word of it was true said cecily her tone unconsciously implying that this was its sole merit  i often feel said felicity primly that we dont think enough about the heathens  we ought to think a great deal more  sara ray put the finishing touch to my mortification  it was so nice and short she said  what was the matter with my sermon i asked dan that night since he was neither judge nor competitor i could discuss the matter with him  it was too much like a reglar sermon to be interesting said dan frankly  i should think the more like a regular sermon it was the better i said  not if you want to make an impression said dan seriously you must have something sort of different for that  peter now hell have something different  oh peter  i dont believe he can preach a sermon i said  maybe not but youll see hell make an impression said dan  dan was neither the prophet nor the son of a prophet but he had the second sight for once peter did make an impression    chapter xxvi peter makes an impression  peters turn came next  he did not write his sermon out  that he averred was too hard work  nor did he mean to take a text  why who ever heard of a sermon without a text asked felix blankly  i am going to take a subject instead of a text said peter loftily  i aint going to tie myself down to a text  and im going to have heads in itthree heads  you hadnt a single head in yours he added to me  uncle alec says that uncle edward says that heads are beginning to go out of fashion i said defiantlyall the more defiantly that i felt i should have had heads in my sermon  it would doubtless have made a much deeper impression  but the truth was i had forgotten all about such things  well im going to have them and i dont care if they are unfashionable said peter  theyre good things  aunt jane used to say if a man didnt have heads and stick to them hed go wandering all over the bible and never get anywhere in particular  what are you going to preach on asked felix  youll find out next sunday said peter significantly  the next sunday was in october and a lovely day it was warm and bland as june  there was something in the fine elusive air that recalled beautiful forgotten things and suggested delicate future hopes  the woods had wrapped finewoven gossamers about them and the westering hill was crimson and gold  we sat around the pulpit stone and waited for peter and sara ray it was the formers sunday off and he had gone home the night before but he assured us he would be back in time to preach his sermon  presently he arrived and mounted the granite boulder as if to the manor born  he was dressed in his new suit and i perceiving this felt that he had the advantage of me  when i preached i had to wear my second best suit for it was one of aunt janets laws that we should take our good suits off when we came home from church  there were i saw compensations for being a hired boy  peter made quite a handsome little minister in his navy blue coat white collar and neatly bowed tie  his black eyes shone and his black curls were brushed up in quite a ministerial pompadour but threatened to tumble over at the top in graceless ringlets  it was decided that there was no use in waiting for sara ray who might or might not come according to the humour in which her mother was  therefore peter proceeded with the service  he read the chapter and gave out the hymn with as much sang froid as if he had been doing it all his life  mr marwood himself could not have bettered the way in which peter said  we will sing the whole hymn omitting the fourth stanza  that was a fine touch which i had not thought of  i began to think that after all peter might be a foeman worthy of my steel  when peter was ready to begin he thrust his hands into his pocketsa totally unorthodox thing  then he plunged in without further ado speaking in his ordinary conversational toneanother unorthodox thing  there was no shorthand reporter present to take that sermon down but if necessary i could preach it over verbatim and so i doubt not could everyone that heard it  it was not a forgettable kind of sermon  dearly beloved said peter my sermon is about the bad placein short about hell  an electric shock seemed to run through the audience  everybody looked suddenly alert  peter had in one sentence done what my whole sermon had failed to do  he had made an impression  i shall divide my sermon into three heads pursued peter  the first head is what you must not do if you dont want to go to the bad place  the second head is what the bad place is likesensation in the audienceand the third head is how to escape going there  now theres a great many things you must not do and its very important to know what they are  you ought not to lose no time in finding out  in the first place you mustnt ever forget to mind what grownup people tell youthat is good grownup people  but how are you going to tell who are the good grownup people asked felix suddenly forgetting that he was in church  oh that is easy said peter  you can always just feel who is good and who isnt  and you mustnt tell lies and you mustnt murder any one  you must be specially careful not to murder any one  you might be forgiven for telling lies if you was real sorry for them but if you murdered any one it would be pretty hard to get forgiven so youd better be on the safe side  and you mustnt commit suicide because if you did that you wouldnt have any chance of repenting it and you mustnt forget to say your prayers and you mustnt quarrel with your sister  at this point felicity gave dan a significant poke with her elbow and dan was up in arms at once  dont you be preaching at me peter craig he cried out  i wont stand it  i dont quarrel with my sister any oftener than she quarrels with me  you can just leave me alone  whos touching you demanded peter  i didnt mention no names  a minister can say anything he likes in the pulpit as long as he doesnt mention any names and nobody can answer back  all right but just you wait till tomorrow growled dan subsiding reluctantly into silence under the reproachful looks of the girls  you must not play any games on sunday went on peter that is any weekday gamesor whisper in church or laugh in churchi did that once but i was awful sorryand you mustnt take any notice of paddyi mean of the family cat at family prayers not even if he climbs up on your back  and you mustnt call names or make faces  amen cried felix who had suffered many things because felicity so often made faces at him  peter stopped and glared at him over the edge of the pulpit stone  you havent any business to call out a thing like that right in the middle of a sermon he said  they do it in the methodist church at markdale protested felix somewhat abashed  i heard them  i know they do  thats the methodist way and it is all right for them  i havent a word to say against methodists  my aunt jane was one and i might have been one myself if i hadnt been so scared of the judgment day  but you aint a methodist youre a presbyterian aint you  yes of course  i was born that way  very well then youve got to do things the presbyterian way dont let me hear any more of your amens or ill amen you  oh dont anybody interrupt again implored the story girl it isnt fair  how can any one preach a good sermon if he is always being interrupted  nobody interrupted beverley  bev didnt get up there and pitch into us like that muttered dan  you mustnt fight resumed peter undauntedly  that is you mustnt fight for the fun of fighting nor out of bad temper you must not say bad words or swear  you mustnt get drunkalthough of course you wouldnt be likely to do that before you grow up and the girls never  theres probly a good many other things you mustnt do but these ive named are the most important  of course im not saying youll go to the bad place for sure if you do them  i only say youre running a risk the devil is looking out for the people who do these things and hell be more likely to get after them than to waste time over the people who dont do them  and thats all about the first head of my sermon  at this point sara ray arrived somewhat out of breath  peter looked at her reproachfully  youve missed my whole first head sara he said  that isnt fair when youre to be one of the judges  i think i ought to preach it over again for you  that was really done once  i know a story about it said the story girl  whos interrupting now aid dan slyly  never mind tell us the story said the preacher himself eagerly leaning over the pulpit  it was mr scott who did it said the story girl  he was preaching somewhere in nova scotia and when he was more than half way through his sermonand you know sermons were very long in those daysa man walked in  mr scott stopped until he had taken his seat  then he said my friend you are very late for this service  i hope you wont be late for heaven  the congregation will excuse me if i recapitulate the sermon for our friends benefit  and then he just preached the sermon over again from the beginning  it is said that that particular man was never known to be late for church again  it served him right said dan but it was pretty hard lines on the rest of the congregation  now lets be quiet so peter can go on with his sermon said cecily  peter squared his shoulders and took hold of the edge of the pulpit  never a thump had he thumped but i realized that his way of leaning forward and fixing this one or that one of his hearers with his eye was much more effective  ive come now to the second head of my sermonwhat the bad place is like  he proceeded to describe the bad place  later on we discovered that he had found his material in an illustrated translation of dantes inferno which had once been given to his aunt jane as a school prize  but at the time we supposed he must be drawing from biblical sources  peter had been reading the bible steadily ever since what we always referred to as the judgment sunday and he was by now almost through it  none of the rest of us had ever read the bible completely through and we thought peter must have found his description of the world of the lost in some portion with which we were not acquainted  therefore his utterances carried all the weight of inspiration and we sat appalled before his lurid phrases  he used his own words to clothe the ideas he had found and the result was a force and simplicity that struck home to our imaginations  suddenly sara ray sprang to her feet with a screama scream that changed into strange laughter  we all preacher included looked at her aghast  cecily and felicity sprang up and caught hold of her  sara ray was really in a bad fit of hysterics but we knew nothing of such a thing in our experience and we thought she had gone mad  she shrieked cried laughed and flung herself about  shes gone clean crazy said peter coming down out of his pulpit with a very pale face  youve frightened her crazy with your dreadful sermon said felicity indignantly  she and cecily each took sara by an arm and half leading half carrying got her out of the orchard and up to the house  the rest of us looked at each other in terrified questioning  youve made rather too much of an impression peter said the story girl miserably  she neednt have got so scared  if shed only waited for the third head id have showed her how easy it was to get clear of going to the bad place and go to heaven instead  but you girls are always in such a hurry said peter bitterly  do you spose theyll have to take her to the asylum said dan in a whisper  hush heres your father said felix  uncle alec came striding down the orchard we had never before seen uncle alec angry  but there was no doubt that he was very angry  his blue eyes fairly blazed at us as he said  what have you been doing to frighten sara ray into such a condition  wewe were just having a sermon contest explained the story girl tremulously  and peter preached about the bad place and it frightened sara  that is all uncle alec  all  i dont know what the result will be to that nervous delicate child  she is shrieking in there and nothing will quiet her  what do you mean by playing such a game on sunday and making a jest of sacred things  no not a word for the story girl had attempted to speak  you and peter march off home  and the next time i find you up to such doings on sunday or any other day ill give you cause to remember it to your latest hour  the story girl and peter went humbly home and we went with them  i cant understand grownup people said felix despairingly when uncle edward preached sermons it was all right but when we do it it is making a jest of sacred things  and i heard uncle alec tell a story once about being nearly frightened to death when he was a little boy by a minister preaching on the end of the world and he said that was something like a sermon  you dont hear such sermons nowadays  but when peter preaches just such a sermon its a very different story  its no wonder we cant understand the grownups said the story girl indignantly because weve never been grownup ourselves  but they have been children and i dont see why they cant understand us  of course perhaps we shouldnt have had the contest on sundays  but all the same i think its mean of uncle alec to be so cross  oh i do hope poor sara wont have to be taken to the asylum  poor sara did not have to be  she was eventually quieted down and was as well as usual the next day and she humbly begged peters pardon for spoiling his sermon  peter granted it rather grumpily and i fear that he never really quite forgave sara for her untimely outburst  felix too felt resentment against her because he had lost the chance of preaching his sermon  of course i know i wouldnt have got the prize for i couldnt have made such an impression as peter he said to us mournfully but id like to have had a chance to show what i could do thats what comes of having those crybaby girls mixed up in things  cecily was just as scared as sara ray but shed more sense than to show it like that  well sara couldnt help it said the story girl charitably but it does seem as if wed had dreadful luck in everything weve tried lately  i thought of a new game this morning but im almost afraid to mention it for i suppose something dreadful will come of it too  oh tell us what is it everybody entreated  well its a trial by ordeal and were to see which of us can pass it  the ordeal is to eat one of the bitter apples in big mouthfuls without making a single face  dan made a face to begin with  i dont believe any of us can do that he said  you cant if you take bites big enough to fill your mouth giggled felicity with cruelty and without provocation  well maybe you could retorted dan sarcastically  youd be so afraid of spoiling your looks that youd rather die than make a face i spose no matter what you et  felicity makes enough faces when theres nothing to make faces at said felix who had been grimaced at over the breakfast table that morning and hadnt liked it  i think the bitter apples would be real good for felix said felicity  they say sour things make people thin  lets go and get the bitter apples said cecily hastily seeing that felix felicity and dan were on the verge of a quarrel more bitter than the apples  we went to the seedling tree and got an apple apiece  the game was that every one must take a bite in turn chew it up and swallow it without making a face  peter again distinguished himself  he and he alone passed the ordeal munching those dreadful mouthfuls without so much as a change of expression on his countenance while the facial contortions the rest of us went through baffled description  in every subsequent trial it was the same  peter never made a face and no one else could help making them  it sent him up fifty per cent in felicitys estimation  peter is a real smart boy she said to me  its such a pity he is a hired boy  but if we could not pass the ordeal we got any amount of fun out of it at least  evening after evening the orchard reechoed to our peals of laughter  bless the children said uncle alec as he carried the milk pails across the yard  nothing can quench their spirits for long    chapter xxvii the ordeal of bitter apples  i could never understand why felix took peters success in the ordeal of bitter apples so much to heart  he had not felt very keenly over the matter of the sermons and certainly the mere fact that peter could eat sour apples without making faces did not cast any reflection on the honour or ability of the other competitors  but to felix everything suddenly became flat stale and unprofitable because peter continued to hold the championship of bitter apples  it haunted his waking hours and obsessed his nights  i heard him talking in his sleep about it if anything could have made him thin the way he worried over this matter would have done it  for myself i cared not a groat  i had wished to be successful in the sermon contest and felt sore whenever i thought of my failure  but i had no burning desire to eat sour apples without grimacing and i did not sympathize over and above with my brother  when however he took to praying about it i realized how deeply he felt on the subject and hoped he would be successful  felix prayed earnestly that he might be enabled to eat a bitter apple without making a face  and when he had prayed three nights after this manner he contrived to eat a bitter apple without a grimace until he came to the last bite which proved too much for him  but felix was vastly encouraged  another prayer or two and ill be able to eat a whole one he said jubilantly  but this devoutly desired consummation did not come to pass  in spite of prayers and heroic attempts felix could never get beyond that last bite  not even faith and works in combination could avail  for a time he could not understand this  but he thought the mystery was solved when cecily came to him one day and told him that peter was praying against him  hes praying that youll never be able to eat a bitter apple without making a face she said  he told felicity and felicity told me  she said she thought it was real cute of him  i think that is a dreadful way to talk about praying and i told her so she wanted me to promise not to tell you but i wouldnt promise because i think its fair for you to know what is going on  felix was very indignantand aggrieved as well  i dont see why god should answer peters prayers instead of mine he said bitterly  ive gone to church and sunday school all my life and peter never went till this summer  it isnt fair  oh felix dont talk like that said cecily shocked  god must be fair  ill tell you what i believe is the reason  peter prays three times a day regularin the morning and at dinner time and at nightand besides that any time through the day when he happens to think of it he just prays standing up  did you ever hear of such goingson  well hes got to stop praying against me anyhow said felix resolutely  i wont put up with it and ill go and tell him so right off  felix marched over to uncle rogers and we trailed after scenting a scene  we found peter shelling beans in the granary and whistling cheerily as with a conscience void of offence towards all men  look here peter said felix ominously they tell me that youve been praying right along that i couldnt eat a bitter apple  now i tell you  i never did exclaimed peter indignantly  i never mentioned your name  i never prayed that you couldnt eat a bitter apple i just prayed that id be the only one that could  well thats the same thing cried felix  youve just been praying for the opposite to me out of spite  and youve got to stop it peter craig  well i just guess i wont said peter angrily  ive just as good a right to pray for what i want as you felix king even if you was brought up in toronto  i spose you think a hired boy hasnt any business to pray for particular things but ill show you  ill just pray for what i please and id like to see you try and stop me  youll have to fight me if you keep on praying against me said felix  the girls gasped but dan and i were jubilant snuffing battle afar off  all right  i can fight as well as pray  oh dont fight implored cecily  i think it would be dreadful  surely you can arrange it some other way  lets all give up the ordeal anyway  there isnt much fun in it  and then neither of you need pray about it  i dont want to give up the ordeal said felix and i wont  oh well surely you can settle it some way without fighting persisted cecily  im not wanting to fight said peter  its felix  if he dont interfere with my prayers theres no need of fighting  but if he does theres no other way to settle it  but how will that settle it asked cecily  oh whoevers licked will have to give in about the praying said peter  thats fair enough  if im licked i wont pray for that particular thing any more  its dreadful to fight about anything so religious as praying sighed poor cecily  why they were always fighting about religion in old times said felix  the more religious anything was the more fighting there was about it  a fellows got a right to pray as he pleases said peter and if anybody tries to stop him hes bound to fight  thats my way of looking at it  what would miss marwood say if she knew you were going to fight asked felicity  miss marwood was felix sunday school teacher and he was very fond of her  but by this time felix was quite reckless  i dont care what she would say he retorted  felicity tried another tack  youll be sure to get whipped if you fight with peter she said  youre too fat to fight  after that no moral force on earth could have prevented felix from fighting  he would have faced an army with banners  you might settle it by drawing lots said cecily desperately  drawing lots is wickeder that fighting said dan  its a kind of gambling  what would aunt jane say if she knew you were going to fight cecily demanded of peter  dont you drag my aunt jane into this affair said peter darkly  you said you were going to be a presbyterian persisted cecily good presbyterians dont fight  oh dont they  i heard your uncle roger say that presbyterians were the best for fighting in the worldor the worst i forget which he said but it means the same thing  cecily had but one more shot in her locker  i thought you said in your sermon master peter that people shouldnt fight  i said they oughtnt to fight for fun or for bad temper retorted peter  this is different  i know what im fighting for but i cant think of the word  i guess you mean principle i suggested  yes thats it agreed peter  its all right to fight for principle  its kind of praying with your fists  oh cant you do something to prevent them from fighting sara pleaded cecily turning to the story girl who was sitting on a bin swinging her shapely bare feet to and fro  it doesnt do to meddle in an affair of this kind between boys said the story girl sagely  i may be mistaken but i do not believe the story girl wanted that fight stopped  and i am far from being sure that felicity did either  it was ultimately arranged that the combat should take place in the fir wood behind uncle rogers granary  it was a nice remote bosky place where no prowling grownup would be likely to intrude  and thither we all resorted at sunset  i hope felix will beat said the story girl to me not only for the family honour but because that was a mean mean prayer of peters do you think he will  i dont know i confessed dubiously  felix is too fat  hell get out of breath in no time  and peter is such a cool customer and hes a year older than felix  but then felix has had some practice  he has fought boys in toronto  and this is peters first fight  did you ever fight asked the story girl  once i said briefly dreading the next question which promptly came  who beat  it is sometimes a bitter thing to tell the truth especially to a young lady for whom you have a great admiration  i had a struggle with temptation in which i frankly confess i might have been worsted had it not been for a saving and timely remembrance of a certain resolution made on the day preceding judgment sunday  the other fellow i said with reluctant honesty  well said the story girl i think it doesnt matter whether you get whipped or not so long as you fight a good square fight  her potent voice made me feel that i was quite a hero after all and the sting went out of my recollection of that old fight  when we arrived behind the granary the others were all there cecily was very pale and felix and peter were taking off their coats  there was a pure yellow sunset that evening and the aisles of the fir wood were flooded with its radiance  a cool autumnal wind was whistling among the dark boughs and scattering blood red leaves from the maple at the end of the granary  now said dan ill count and when i say three you pitch in and hammer each other until one of you has had enough  cecily keep quiet  now onetwothree  peter and felix pitched in with more zeal than discretion on both sides  as a result peter got what later developed into a black eye and felixs nose began to bleed  cecily gave a shriek and ran out of the wood  we thought she had fled because she could not endure the sight of blood and we were not sorry for her manifest disapproval and anxiety were damping the excitement of the occasion  felix and peter drew apart after that first onset and circled about one another warily  then just as they had come to grips again uncle alec walked around the corner of the granary with cecily behind him  he was not angry  there was a quizzical look in his eyes  but he took the combatants by their shirt collars and dragged them apart  this stops right here boys he said  you know i dont allow fighting  oh but uncle alec it was this way began felix eagerly peter  no i dont want to hear about it said uncle alec sternly  i dont care what you were fighting about but you must settle your quarrels in a different fashion  remember my commands felix peter roger is looking for you to wash his buggy  be off  peter went off rather sullenly and felix also sullenly sat down and began to nurse his nose  he turned his back on cecily  cecily caught it after uncle alec had gone  dan called her a telltale and a baby and sneered at her until cecily began to cry  i couldnt stand by and watch felix and peter pound each other all to pieces she sobbed  theyve been such friends and it was dreadful to see them fighting  uncle roger would have let them fight it out said the story girl discontentedly  uncle roger believes in boys fighting  he says its as harmless a way as any of working off their original sin  peter and felix wouldnt have been any worse friends after it  theyd have been better friends because the praying question would have been settled  and now it cant beunless felicity can coax peter to give up praying against felix  for once in her life the story girl was not as tactful as her wont  oris it possible that she said it out of malice prepense  at all events felicity resented the imputation that she had more influence with peter than any one else  i dont meddle with hired boys prayers she said haughtily  it was all nonsense fighting about such prayers anyhow said dan who probably thought that since all chance of a fight was over he might as well avow his real sentiments as to its folly just as much nonsense as praying about the bitter apples in the first place  oh dan dont you believe there is some good in praying said cecily reproachfully  yes i believe theres some good in some kinds of praying but not in that kind said dan sturdily  i dont believe god cares whether anybody can eat an apple without making a face or not  i dont believe its right to talk of god as if you were well acquainted with him said felicity who felt that it was a good chance to snub dan  theres something wrong somewhere said cecily perplexedly we ought to pray for what we want of that im sureand peter wanted to be the only one who could pass the ordeal  it seems as if he must be rightand yet it doesnt seem so  i wish i could understand it  peters prayer was wrong because it was a selfish prayer i guess said the story girl thoughtfully  felixs prayer was all right because it wouldnt have hurt any one else but it was selfish of peter to want to be the only one we mustnt pray selfish prayers  oh i see through it now said cecily joyfully  yes but said dan triumphantly if you believe god answers prayers about particular things it was peters prayer he answered  what do you make of that  oh the story girl shook her head impatiently  theres no use trying to make such things out  we only get more mixed up all the time  lets leave it alone and ill tell you a story  aunt olivia had a letter today from a friend in nova scotia who lives in shubenacadie  when i said i thought it a funny name she told me to go and look in her scrap book and i would find a story about the origin of the name  and i did  dont you want to hear it  of course we did  we all sat down at the roots of the firs felix having finally squared matters with his nose turned around and listened also  he would not look at cecily but every one else had forgiven her  the story girl leaned that brown head of hers against the fir trunk behind her and looked up at the applegreen sky through the dark boughs above us  she wore i remember a dress of warm crimson and she had wound around her head a string of waxberries that looked like a fillet of pearls  her cheeks were still flushed with the excitement of the evening  in the dim light she was beautiful with a wild mystic loveliness a compelling charm that would not be denied  many many moons ago an indian tribe lived on the banks of a river in nova scotia  one of the young braves was named accadee he was the tallest and bravest and handsomest young man in the tribe  why is it theyre always so handsome in stories asked dan why are there never no stories about ugly people  perhaps ugly people never have stories happen to them suggested felicity  i think theyre just as interesting as the handsome people retorted dan  well maybe they are in real life said cecily but in stories its just as easy to make them handsome as not  i like them best that way  i just love to read a story where the heroine is beautiful as a dream  pretty people are always conceited said felix who was getting tired of holding his tongue  the heroes in stories are always nice said felicity with apparent irrelevance  theyre always so tall and slender wouldnt it be awful funny if any one wrote a story about a fat heroor about one with too big a mouth  it doesnt matter what a man looks like i said feeling that felix and dan were catching it rather too hotly  he must be a good sort of chap and do heaps of things  thats all thats necessary  do any of you happen to want to hear the rest of my story asked the story girl in an ominously polite voice that recalled us to a sense of our bad manners  we apologized and promised to behave better she went on appeased  accadee was all these things that i have mentioned and he was the best hunter in the tribe besides  never an arrow of his that did not go straight to the mark  many and many a snow white moose he shot and gave the beautiful skin to his sweetheart her name was shuben and she was as lovely as the moon when it rises from the sea and as pleasant as a summer twilight  her eyes were dark and soft her foot was as light as a breeze and her voice sounded like a brook in the woods or the wind that comes over the hills at night  she and accadee were very much in love with each other and often they hunted together for shuben was almost as skilful with her bow and arrow as accadee himself they had loved each other ever since they were small pappooses and they had vowed to love each other as long as the river ran  one twilight when accadee was out hunting in the woods he shot a snow white moose and he took off its skin and wrapped it around him  then he went on through the woods in the starlight and he felt so happy and light of heart that he sometimes frisked and capered about just as a real moose would do  and he was doing this when shuben who was also out hunting saw him from afar and thought he was a real moose  she stole cautiously through the woods until she came to the brink of a little valley below her stood the snow white moose  she drew her arrow to her eyealas she knew the art only too welland took careful aim the next moment accadee fell dead with her arrow in his heart  the story girl pauseda dramatic pause  it was quite dark in the fir wood  we could see her face and eyes but dimly through the gloom  a silvery moon was looking down on us over the granary  the stars twinkled through the softly waving boughs beyond the wood we caught a glimpse of a moonlit world lying in the sharp frost of the october evening  the sky above it was chill and ethereal and mystical  but all about us were shadows and the weird little tale told in a voice fraught with mystery and pathos had peopled them for us with furtive folk in belt and wampum and darktressed indian maidens  what did shuben do when she found out she had killed accadee asked felicity  she died of a broken heart before the spring and she and accadee were buried side by side on the bank of the river which has ever since borne their namesthe river shubenacadie said the story girl  the sharp wind blew around the granary and cecily shivered  we heard aunt janets voice calling children children  shaking off the spell of firs and moonlight and romantic tale we scrambled to our feet and went homeward  i kind of wish id been born an injun said dan  it must have been a jolly lifenothing to do but hunt and fight  it wouldnt be so nice if they caught you and tortured you at the stake said felicity  no said dan reluctantly  i suppose thered be some drawback to everything even being an injun  isnt it cold said cecily shivering again  it will soon be winter  i wish summer could last forever  felicity likes the winter and so does the story girl but i dont  it always seems so long till spring  never mind weve had a splendid summer i said slipping my arm about her to comfort some childish sorrow that breathed in her plaintive voice  truly we had had a delectable summer and having had it it was ours forever  the gods themselves cannot recall their gifts they may rob us of our future and embitter our present but our past they may not touch  with all its laughter and delight and glamour it is our eternal possession  nevertheless we all felt a little of the sadness of the waning year  there was a distinct weight on our spirits until felicity took us into the pantry and stayed us with apple tarts and comforted us with cream  then we brightened up  it was really a very decent world after all    chapter xxviii the tale of the rainbow bridge  felix so far as my remembrance goes never attained to success in the ordeal of bitter apples  he gave up trying after awhile and he also gave up praying about it saying in bitterness of spirit that there was no use in praying when other fellows prayed against you out of spite  he and peter remained on bad terms for some time however  we were all of us too tired those nights to do any special praying  sometimes i fear our regular prayers were slurred over or mumbled in anything but reverent haste  october was a busy month on the hill farms  the apples had to be picked and this work fell mainly to us children  we stayed home from school to do it  it was pleasant work and there was a great deal of fun in it but it was hard too and our arms and backs ached roundly at night  in the mornings it was very delightful in the afternoons tolerable but in the evenings we lagged and the laughter and zest of fresher hours were lacking  some of the apples had to be picked very carefully  but with others it did not matter we boys would climb the trees and shake the apples down until the girls shrieked for mercy  the days were crisp and mellow with warm sunshine and a tang of frost in the air mingled with the woodsy odours of the withering grasses the hens and turkeys prowled about pecking at windfalls and pat made mad rushes at them amid the fallen leaves  the world beyond the orchard was in a royal magnificence of colouring under the vivid blue autumn sky  the big willow by the gate was a splendid golden dome and the maples that were scattered through the spruce grove waved bloodred banners over the sombre conebearers  the story girl generally had her head garlanded with their leaves  they became her vastly  neither felicity nor cecily could have worn them  those two girls were of a domestic type that assorted ill with the wildfire in natures veins  but when the story girl wreathed her nut brown tresses with crimson leaves it seemed as peter said that they grew on heras if the gold and flame of her spirit had broken out in a coronal as much a part of her as the pale halo seems a part of the madonna it encircles  what tales she told us on those faraway autumn days peopling the russet arcades with folk of an elder world  many a princess rode by us on her palfrey many a swaggering gallant ruffled it bravely in velvet and plume adown uncle stephens walk many a stately lady silken clad walked in that opulent orchard  when we had filled our baskets they had to be carried to the granary loft and the contents stored in bins or spread on the floor to ripen further  we ate a good many of course feeling that the labourer was worthy of his hire  the apples from our own birthday trees were stored in separate barrels inscribed with our names  we might dispose of them as we willed  felicity sold hers to uncle alecs hired manand was badly cheated to boot for he levanted shortly afterwards taking the apples with him having paid her only half her rightful due  felicity has not gotten over that to this day  cecily dear heart sent most of hers to the hospital in town and no doubt gathered in therefrom dividends of gratitude and satisfaction of soul such as can never be purchased by any mere process of bargain and sale  the rest of us ate our apples or carried them to school where we bartered them for such treasures as our schoolmates possessed and we coveted  there was a dusky little pearshaped applefrom one of uncle stephens treeswhich was our favourite and next to it a delicious juicy yellow apple from aunt louisas tree  we were also fond of the big sweet apples we used to throw them up in the air and let them fall on the ground until they were bruised and battered to the bursting point  then we sucked on the juice sweeter was it than the nectar drunk by blissful gods on the thessalian hill  sometimes we worked until the cold yellow sunsets faded out over the darkening distances and the hunters moon looked down on us through the sparkling air  the constellations of autumn scintillated above us  peter and the story girl knew all about them and imparted their knowledge to us generously  i recall peter standing on the pulpit stone one night ere moonrise and pointing them out to us occasionally having a difference of opinion with the story girl over the name of some particular star  jobs coffin and the northern cross were to the west of us south of us flamed fomalhaut  the great square of pegasus was over our heads  cassiopeia sat enthroned in her beautiful chair in the northeast and north of us the dippers swung untiringly around the pole star  cecily and felix were the only ones who could distinguish the double star in the handle of the big dipper and greatly did they plume themselves thereon  the story girl told us the myths and legends woven around these immemorial clusters her very voice taking on a clear remote starry sound as she talked of them  when she ceased we came back to earth feeling as if we had been millions of miles away in the blue ether and that all our old familiar surroundings were momentarily forgotten and strange  that night when he pointed out the stars to us from the pulpit stone was the last time for several weeks that peter shared our toil and pastime  the next day he complained of headache and sore throat and seemed to prefer lying on aunt olivias kitchen sofa to doing any work  as it was not in peter to be a malingerer he was left in peace while we picked apples  felix alone must unjustly and spitefully declared that peter was simply shirking  hes just lazy thats whats the matter with him he said  why dont you talk sense if you must talk said felicity theres no sense in calling peter lazy  you might as well say i had black hair  of course peter being a craig has his faults but hes a smart boy  his father was lazy but his mother hasnt a lazy bone in her body and peter takes after her  uncle roger says peters father wasnt exactly lazy said the story girl  the trouble was there were so many other things he liked better than work  i wonder if hell ever come back to his family said cecily just think how dreadful it would be if our father had left us like that  our father is a king said felicity loftily and peters father was only a craig  a member of our family couldnt behave like that  they say there must be a black sheep in every family said the story girl  there isnt any in ours said cecily loyally  why do white sheep eat more than black asked felix  is that a conundrum asked cecily cautiously  if it is i wont try to guess the reason  i never can guess conundrums  it isnt a conundrum said felix  its a fact  they doand theres a good reason for it  we stopped picking apples sat down on the grass and tried to reason it outwith the exception of dan who declared that he knew there was a catch somewhere and he wasnt going to be caught  the rest of us could not see where any catch could exist since felix solemnly vowed cross his heart white sheep did eat more than black  we argued over it seriously but finally had to give it up  well what is the reason asked felicity  because theres more of them said felix grinning  i forget what we did to felix  a shower came up in the evening and we had to stop picking after the shower there was a magnificent double rainbow  we watched it from the granary window and the story girl told us an old legend culled from one of aunt olivias many scrapbooks  long long ago in the golden age when the gods used to visit the earth so often that it was nothing uncommon to see them odin made a pilgrimage over the world  odin was the great god of the northland you know  and wherever he went among men he taught them love and brotherhood and skilful arts and great cities sprang up where he had trodden and every land through which he passed was blessed because one of the gods had come down to men but many men and women followed odin himself giving up all their worldly possessions and ambitions and to these he promised the gift of eternal life  all these people were good and noble and unselfish and kind but the best and noblest of them all was a youth named ving and this youth was beloved by odin above all others for his beauty and strength and goodness  always he walked on odins right hand and always the first light of odins smile fell on him  tall and straight was he as a young pine and his long hair was the colour of ripe wheat in the sun and his blue eyes were like the northland heavens on a starry night  in odins band was a beautiful maiden named alin  she was as fair and delicate as a young birch tree in spring among the dark old pines and firs and ving loved her with all his heart  his soul thrilled with rapture at the thought that he and she together should drink from the fountain of immortality as odin had promised and be one thereafter in eternal youth  at last they came to the very place where the rainbow touched the earth  and the rainbow was a great bridge built of living colours so dazzling and wonderful that beyond it the eye could see nothing only far away a great blinding sparkling glory where the fountain of life sprang up in a shower of diamond fire but under the rainbow bridge rolled a terrible flood deep and wide and violent full of rocks and rapids and whirlpools  there was a warder of the bridge a god dark and stern and sorrowful  and to him odin gave command that he should open the gate and allow his followers to cross the rainbow bridge that they might drink of the fountain of life beyond  and the warder set open the gate  pass on and drink of the fountain he said  to all who taste of it shall immortality be given  but only to that one who shall drink of it first shall be permitted to walk at odins right hand forever  then the company passed through in great haste all fired with a desire to be the first to drink of the fountain and win so marvellous a boon  last of all came ving  he had lingered behind to pluck a thorn from the foot of a beggar child he had met on the highway and he had not heard the warders words  but when eager joyous radiant he set his foot on the rainbow the stern sorrowful warder took him by the arm and drew him back  ving strong noble and valiant he said rainbow bridge is not for thee  very dark grew vings face  hot rebellion rose in his heart and rushed over his pale lips  why dost thou keep back the draught of immortality from me he demanded passionately  the warder pointed to the dark flood that rolled under the bridge  the path of the rainbow is not for thee he said but yonder way is open  ford that flood  on the furthest bank is the fountain of life  thou mockest me muttered ving sullenly  no mortal could cross that flood  oh master he prayed turning beseechingly to odin thou didst promise to me eternal life as to the others wilt thou not keep that promise  command the warder to let me pass  he must obey thee  but odin stood silent with his face turned from his beloved and vings heart was filled with unspeakable bitterness and despair  thou mayest return to earth if thou fearest to essay the flood said the warder  nay said ving wildly earthly life without alin is more dreadful than the death which awaits me in yon dark river  and he plunged fiercely in  he swam and struggled he buffetted the turmoil  the waves went over his head again and again the whirlpools caught him and flung him on the cruel rocks  the wild cold spray beat on his eyes and blinded him so that he could see nothing and the roar of the river deafened him so that he could hear nothing but he felt keenly the wounds and bruises of the cruel rocks and many a time he would have given up the struggle had not the thought of sweet alins loving eyes brought him the strength and desire to struggle as long as it was possible  long long long to him seemed that bitter and perilous passage but at last he won through to the furthest side  breathless and reeling his vesture torn his great wounds bleeding he found himself on the shore where the fountain of immortality sprang up  he staggered to its brink and drank of its clear stream  then all pain and weariness fell away from him and he rose up a god beautiful with immortality  and as he did there came rushing over the rainbow bridge a great companythe band of fellow travellers  but all were too late to win the double boon  ving had won to it through the danger and suffering of the dark river  the rainbow had faded out and the darkness of the october dusk was falling  i wonder said dan meditatively as we went away from that redolent spot what it would be like to live for ever in this world  i expect wed get tired of it after awhile said the story girl  but she added i think it would be a goodly while before i would    chapter xxix the shadow feared of man  we were all up early the next morning dressing by candlelight but early as it was we found the story girl in the kitchen when we went down sitting on rachel wards blue chest and looking important  what do you think she exclaimed  peter has the measles  he was dreadfully sick all night and uncle roger had to go for the doctor  he was quite lightheaded and didnt know any one  of course hes far too sick to be taken home so his mother has come up to wait on him and im to live over here until he is better  this was mingled bitter and sweet  we were sorry to hear that peter had the measles but it would be jolly to have the story girl living with us all the time  what orgies of story telling we should have  i suppose well all have the measles now grumbled felicity and october is such an inconvenient time for measlestheres so much to do  i dont believe any time is very convenient to have the measles cecily said  oh perhaps we wont have them said the story girl cheerfully peter caught them at markdale the last time he was home his mother says  i dont want to catch the measles from peter said felicity decidedly  fancy catching them from a hired boy  oh felicity dont call peter a hired boy when hes sick protested cecily  during the next two days we were very busytoo busy to tell tales or listen to them  only in the frosty dusk did we have time to wander afar in realms of gold with the story girl  she had recently been digging into a couple of old volumes of classic myths and northland folklore which she had found in aunt olivias attic and for us god and goddess laughing nymph and mocking satyr norn and valkyrie elf and troll and green folk generally were real creatures once again inhabiting the orchards and woods and meadows around us until it seemed as if the golden age had returned to earth  then on the third day the story girl came to us with a very white face  she had been over to uncle rogers yard to hear the latest bulletin from the sick room  hitherto they had been of a noncommittal nature but now it was only too evident that she had bad news  peter is very very sick she said miserably  he has caught cold somewayand the measles have struck inandand the story girl wrung her brown hands togetherthe doctor is afraid hehewont get better  we all stood around stricken incredulous  do you mean said felix finding voice at length that peter is going to die  the story girl nodded miserably  theyre afraid so  cecily sat down by her half filled basket and began to cry felicity said violently that she didnt believe it  i cant pick another apple today and i aint going to try said dan  none of us could  we went to the grownups and told them so and the grownups with unaccustomed understanding and sympathy told us that we need not  then we roamed about in our wretchedness and tried to comfort one another  we avoided the orchard it was for us too full of happy memories to accord with our bitterness of soul  instead we resorted to the spruce wood where the hush and the sombre shadows and the soft melancholy sighing of the wind in the branches over us did not jar harshly on our new sorrow  we could not really believe that peter was going to dieto die old people died  grownup people died  even children of whom we had heard died  but that one of usof our merry little band should die was unbelievable  we could not believe it  and yet the possibility struck us in the face like a blow  we sat on the mossy stones under the dark old evergreens and gave ourselves up to wretchedness  we all even dan cried except the story girl  i dont see how you can be so unfeeling sara stanley said felicity reproachfully  youve always been such friends with peterand made out you thought so much of himand now you aint shedding a tear for him  i looked at the story girls dry piteous eyes and suddenly remembered that i had never seen her cry  when she told us sad tales in a voice laden with all the tears that had ever been shed she had never shed one of her own  i cant cry she said drearily  i wish i could  ive a dreadful feeling here she touched her slender throatand if i could cry i think it would make it better  but i cant  maybe peter will get better after all said dan swallowing a sob  ive heard of lots of people who went and got better after the doctor said they were going to die  while theres life theres hope you know said felix  we shouldnt cross bridges till we come to them  those are only proverbs said the story girl bitterly proverbs are all very fine when theres nothing to worry you but when youre in real trouble theyre not a bit of help  oh i wish id never said peter wasnt fit to associate with moaned felicity  if he ever gets better ill never say such a thing againill never think it  hes just a lovely boy and twice as smart as lots that arent hired out  he was always so polite and goodnatured and obliging sighed cecily  he was just a real gentleman said the story girl  there aint many fellows as fair and square as peter said dan  and such a worker said felix  uncle roger says he never had a boy he could depend on like peter i said  its too late to be saying all these nice things about him now said the story girl  he wont ever know how much we thought of him  its too late  if he gets better ill tell him said cecily resolutely  i wish i hadnt boxed his ears that day he tried to kiss me went on felicity who was evidently raking her conscience for past offences in regard to peter  of course i couldnt be expected to let a hirto let a boy kiss me  but i neednt have been so cross about it  i might have been more dignified  and i told him i just hated him  that wasnt true but i spose hell die thinking it is  oh dear me what makes people say things theyve got to be so sorry for afterwards  i suppose if peter dddies hell go to heaven anyhow sobbed cecily  hes been real good all this summer but he isnt a church member  hes a presbyterian you know said felicity reassuringly  her tone expressed her conviction that that would carry peter through if anything would  were none of us church members  but of course peter couldnt be sent to the bad place  that would be ridiculous  what would they do with him there when hes so good and polite and honest and kind  oh i think hell be all right too sighed cecily but you know he never did go to church and sunday school before this summer  well his father run away and his mother was too busy earning a living to bring him up right argued felicity  dont you suppose that anybody even god would make allowances for that  of course peter will go to heaven said the story girl  hes not grown up enough to go anywhere else  children always go to heaven  but i dont want him to go there or anywhere else  i want him to stay right here  i know heaven must be a splendid place but im sure peter would rather be here having fun with us  sara stanley rebuked felicity  i should think you wouldnt say such things at such a solemn time  youre such a queer girl  wouldnt you rather be here yourself than in heaven said the story girl bluntly  wouldnt you now felicity king  tell the truth cross your heart  but felicity took refuge from this inconvenient question in tears  if we could only do something to help peter i said desperately  it seems dreadful not to be able to do a single thing  theres one thing we can do said cecily gently  we can pray for him  so we can i agreed  im going to pray like sixty said felix energetically  well have to be awful good you know warned cecily  theres no use praying if youre not good  that will be easy sighed felicity  i dont feel a bit like being bad  if anything happens to peter i feel sure ill never be naughty again  i wont have the heart  we did indeed pray most sincerely for peters recovery  we did not as in the case of paddy tack it on after more important things but put it in the very forefront of our petitions  even skeptical dan prayed his skepticism falling away from him like a discarded garment in this valley of the shadow which sifts out hearts and tries souls until we all grownup or children realize our weakness and finding that our own puny strength is as a reed shaken in the wind creep back humbly to the god we have vainly dreamed we could do without  peter was no better the next day  aunt olivia reported that his mother was brokenhearted  we did not again ask to be released from work  instead we went at it with feverish zeal  if we worked hard there was less time for grief and grievious thoughts we picked apples and dragged them to the granary doggedly  in the afternoon aunt janet brought us a lunch of apple turnovers but we could not eat them  peter as felicity reminded us with a burst of tears had been so fond of apple turnovers  and oh how good we were  how angelically and unnaturally good never was there such a band of kind sweettempered unselfish children in any orchard  even felicity and dan for once in their lives got through the day without any exchange of lefthanded compliments  cecily confided to me that she never meant to put her hair up in curlers on saturday nights again because it was pretending  she was so anxious to repent of something sweet girl and this was all she could think of  during the afternoon judy pineau brought up a tearblotted note from sara ray  sara had not been allowed to visit the hill farm since peter had developed measles  she was an unhappy little exile and could only relieve her anguish of soul by daily letters to cecily which the faithful and obliging judy pineau brought up for her  these epistles were as gushingly underlined as if sara had been a correspondent of early victorian days  cecily did not write back because mrs ray had decreed that no letters must be taken down from the hill farm lest they carry infection  cecily had offered to bake every epistle thoroughly in the oven before sending it but mrs ray was inexorable and cecily had to content herself by sending long verbal messages with judy pineau  my own dearest cecily ran saras letter  i have just heard the sad news about poor dear peter  i cant describe my feelings  they are dreadful  i have been crying all the afternoon  i wish i could fly to you but ma will not let me she is afraid i will catch the measles but i would rather have the measles a dozen times over than be sepparated from you all like this  but i have felt ever since the judgment sunday that i must obey ma better than i used to do  if anything happens to peter and you are let see him before it happens give him my love and tell him how sorry i am and that i hope we will all meet in a better world everything in school is about the same  the master is awful cross by spells  jimmy frewen walked home with nellie bowan last night from prayermeeting and her only fourteen  dont you think it horrid beginning so young  you and me would never do anything like that till we were grown up would we  willy fraser looks so lonesome in school these days  i must stop for ma says i waste far too much time writing letters  tell judy all the news for me                             your own true friend                                                  sara ray  ps  oh i do hope peter will get better  ma is going to get me a new brown dress for the winter                                                          s r  when evening came we went to our seats under the whispering sighing fir trees  it was a beautiful nightclear windless frosty  some one galloped down the road on horseback lustily singing a comic song  how dared he  we felt that it was an insult to our wretchedness  if peter were going togoing towell if anything happened to peter we felt so miserably sure that the music of life would be stilled for us for ever how could any one in the world be happy when we were so unhappy  presently aunt olivia came down the long twilight arcade  her bright hair was uncovered and she looked slim and queenlike in her light dress  we thought aunt olivia very pretty then looking back from a mature standpoint i realize that she must have been an unusually beautiful woman and she looked her prettiest as she stood under the swaying boughs in the last faint light of the autumn dusk and smiled down at our woebegone faces  dear sorrowful little people i bring you glad tidings of great joy she said  the doctor has just been here and he finds peter much better and thinks he will pull through after all  we gazed up at her in silence for a few moments  when we had heard the news of paddys recovery we had been noisy and jubilant but we were very quiet now  we had been too near something dark and terrible and menacing and though it was thus suddenly removed the chill and shadow of it were about us still presently the story girl who had been standing up leaning against a tall fir slipped down to the ground in a huddled fashion and broke into a very passion of weeping  i had never heard any one cry so with dreadful rending sobs  i was used to hearing girls cry  it was as much sara rays normal state as any other and even felicity and cecily availed themselves occasionally of the privilege of sex  but i had never heard any girl cry like this  it gave me the same unpleasant sensation which i had felt one time when i had seen my father cry  oh dont sara dont i said gently patting her convulsed shoulder  you are a queer girl said felicitymore tolerantly than usual howeveryou never cried a speck when you thought peter was going to dieand now when he is going to get better you cry like that  sara child come with me said aunt olivia bending over her the story girl got up and went away with aunt olivias arms around her  the sound of her crying died away under the firs and with it seemed to go the dread and grief that had been our portion for hours  in the reaction our spirits rose with a bound  oh aint it great that peters going to be all right said dan springing up  i never was so glad of anything in my whole life declared felicity in shameless rapture  cant we send word somehow to sara ray tonight asked cecily the everthoughtful  shes feeling so badand shell have to feel that way till tomorrow if we cant  lets all go down to the ray gate and holler to judy pineau till she comes out suggested felix  accordingly we went and hollered with a right good will  we were much taken aback to find that mrs ray came to the gate instead of judy and rather sourly demanded what we were yelling about  when she heard our news however she had the decency to say she was glad and to promise she would convey the good tidings to sarawho is already in bed where all children of her age should be added mrs ray severely  we had no intention of going to bed for a good two hours yet instead after devoutly thanking goodness that our grownups in spite of some imperfections were not of the mrs ray type we betook ourselves to the granary lighted a huge lantern which dan had made out of a turnip and proceeded to devour all the apples we might have eaten through the day but had not  we were a blithe little crew sitting there in the light of our goblin lantern  we had in very truth been given beauty for ashes and the oil of joy for mourning  life was as a red rose once more  im going to make a big batch of pattypans first thing in the morning said felicity jubilantly  isnt it queer  last night i felt just like praying and tonight i feel just like cooking  we mustnt forget to thank god for making peter better said cecily as we finally went to the house  do you spose peter wouldnt have got better anyway said dan  oh dan what makes you ask such questions exclaimed cecily in real distress  i dunno said dan  they just kind of come into my head like but of course i mean to thank god when i say my prayers tonight thats only decent    chapter xxx a compound letter  once peter was out of danger he recovered rapidly but he found his convalescence rather tedious and aunt olivia suggested to us one day that we write a compound letter to amuse him until he could come to the window and talk to us from a safe distance the idea appealed to us and the day being saturday and the apples all picked we betook ourselves to the orchard to compose our epistles cecily having first sent word by a convenient caller to sara ray that she too might have a letter ready later i having at that time a mania for preserving all documents relating to our life in carlisle copied those letters in the blank pages at the back of my dream book  hence i can reproduce them verbatim with the bouquet they have retained through all the long years since they were penned in that autumnal orchard on the hill with its fading leaves and frosted grasses and the mild delightsome melancholy of the late october day enfolding  cecilys letter  dear peteri am so very glad and thankful that you are going to get better  we were so afraid you would not last tuesday and we felt dreadful even felicity  we all prayed for you  i think the others have stopped now but i keep it up every night still for fear you might have a relaps  i dont know if that is spelled right  i havent the dixonary handy and if i ask the others felicity will laugh at me though she cannot spell lots of words herself  i am saving some of the honourable mr whalens pears for you  ive got them hid where nobody can find them theres only a dozen because dan et all the rest but i guess you will like them  we have got all the apples picked and are all ready to take the measles now if we have to but i hope we wont  if we have to though id rather catch them from you than from any one else because we are acquainted with you  if i do take the measles and anything happens to me felicity is to have my cherry vase  id rather give it to the story girl but dan says it ought to be kept in the family even if felicity is a crank  i havent anything else valuable since i gave sara ray my forgetmenot jug but if you would like anything ive got let me know and ill leave instructions for you to have it  the story girl has told us some splendid stories lately  i wish i was clever like her  ma says it doesnt matter if youre not clever as long as you are good but i am not even very good  i think this is all my news except that i want to tell you how much we all think of you peter  when we heard you were sick we all said nice things about you but we were afraid it was too late and i said if you got better id tell you  it is easier to write it than to tell it out to your face  we think you are smart and polite and obliging and a great worker and a gentleman                           your true friend                                            cecily king  ps if you answer my letter dont say anything about the pears because i dont want dan to find out theres any left     c k  felicitys letter  dear peteraunt olivia says for us all to write a compound letter to cheer you up  we are all awful glad you are getting better  it gave us an awful scare when we heard you were going to die  but you will soon be all right and able to get out again  be careful you dont catch cold  i am going to bake some nice things for you and send them over now that the doctor says you can eat them  and ill send you my rosebud plate to eat off of  im only lending it you know not giving it  i let very few people use it because it is my greatest treasure  mind you dont break it  aunt olivia must always wash it not your mother  i do hope the rest of us wont catch the measles  it must look horrid to have red spots all over your face  we all feel pretty well yet  the story girl says as many queer things as ever felix thinks he is getting thin but he is fatter than ever and no wonder with all the apples he eats  he has give up trying to eat the bitter apples at last  beverley has grown half an inch since july by the mark on the hall door and he is awful pleased about it  i told him i guessed the magic seed was taking effect at last and he got mad  he never gets mad at anything the story girl says and yet she is so sarkastic by times  dan is pretty hard to get along with as usul but i try to bear pashently with him  cecily is well and says she isnt going to curl her hair any more  she is so conscienshus  i am glad my hair curls of itself aint you  we havent seen sara ray since you got sick  she is awful lonesome and judy says she cries nearly all the time but that is nothing new  im awful sorry for sara but im glad im not her she is going to write you a letter too  youll let me see what she puts in it wont you  youd better take some mexican tea now  its a great blood purifyer  i am going to get a lovely dark blue dress for the winter  it is ever so much prettier than sara rays brown one  sara rays mother has no taste  the story girls father is sending her a new red dress and a red velvet cap from paris  she is so fond of red  i cant bear it it looks so common  mother says i can get a velvet hood too  cecily says she doesnt believe its right to wear velvet when its so expensive and the heathen are crying for the gospel  she got that idea from a sunday school paper but i am going to get my hood all the same  well peter i have no more news so i will close for this time  hoping you will soon be quite well i remain                                    yours sincerely                                          felicity king  ps the story girl peeked over my shoulder and says i ought to have signed it yours affeckshunately but i know better because the family guide has told lots of times how you should sign yourself when you are writing to a young man who is only a friend                                                  f k  felix letter  dear peteri am awful glad you are getting better  we all felt bad when we thought you wouldnt but i felt worse than the others because we hadnt been on very good terms lately and i had said mean things about you  im sorry and peter you can pray for anything you like and i wont ever object again  im glad uncle alec interfered and stopped the fight  if i had licked you and you had died of the measles it would have been a dreadful thing  we have all the apples in and havent much to do just now and we are having lots of fun but we wish you were here to join in  im a lot thinner than i was  i guess working so hard picking apples is a good thing to make you thin  the girls are all well felicity puts on as many airs as ever but she makes great things to eat  i have had some splendid dreams since we gave up writing them down  that is always the way  we aint going to school till were sure we are not going to have the measles  this is all i can think of so i will draw to a close  remember you can pray for anything you like                          felix king  sara rays letter  dear peteri never wrote to a boy before so please excuse all mistakes  i am so glad you are getting better  we were so afraid you were going to die  i cried all night about it  but now that you are out of danger will you tell me what it really feels like to think you are going to die  does it feel queer were you very badly frightened  ma wont let me go up the hill at all now  i would die if it was not for judy pinno  the french names are so hard to spell judy is very obliging and i feel that she simpathises with me in my lonely hours i read my dream book and cecilys old letters and they are such a comfort to me  i have been reading one of the school library books too  i is pretty good but i wish they had got more love stories because they are so exciting  but the master would not let them  if you had died peter and your father had heard it wouldnt he have felt dreadful  we are having beautiful weather and the seenary is fine since the leaves turned  i think there is nothing so pretty as nature after all  i hope all danger from the measles will soon be over and we can all meet again at the home on the hill  till then farewell                          your true friend                                            sara ray  p s dont let felicity see this letter                 s r  dans letter  dear old peteawful glad you cheated the doctor  i thought you werent the kind to turn up your toes so easy  you should of heard the girls crying  theyre all getting their winter finery now and the talk about it would make you sick  the story girl is getting hers from paris and felicity is awful jealous though she pretends she isnt  i can see through her  kitt mar was up here thursday to see the girls  shes had the measles so she isnt scared  shes a great girl to laugh  i like a girl that laughs dont you  we had a call from peg bowen yesterday  you should of seen the story girl hustling pat out of the way for all she says she dont believe he was bewitched  peg had your rheumatism ring on and the story girls blue beads and sara rays lace soed across the front of her dress  she wanted some tobacco and some pickles  ma gave her some pickles but said we didnt have no tobacco and peg went off mad but i guess she wouldnt bewitch anything on account of the pickles  i aint any hand to write letters so i guess ill stop  hope youll be out soon                                        dan  the story girls letter  dear peteroh how glad i am that you are getting better those days when we thought you wouldnt were the hardest of my whole life  it seemed too dreadful to be true that perhaps you would die  and then when we heard you were going to get better that seemed too good to be true  oh peter hurry up and get well for we are having such good times and we miss you so much i have coaxed uncle alec not to burn his potato stalks till you are well because i remember how you always liked to see the potato stalks burn  uncle alec consented though aunt janet said it was high time they were burned  uncle roger burned his last night and it was such fun  pat is splendid  he has never had a sick spell since that bad one  i would send him over to be company for you but aunt janet says no because he might carry the measles back  i dont see how he could but we must obey aunt janet  she is very good to us all but i know she does not approve of me  she says im my fathers own child  i know that doesnt mean anything complimentary because she looked so queer when she saw that i had heard her but i dont care  im glad im like father  i had a splendid letter from him this week with the darlingest pictures in it  he is painting a new picture which is going to make him famous  i wonder what aunt janet will say then  do you know peter yesterday i thought i saw the family ghost at last  i was coming through the gap in the hedge and i saw somebody in blue standing under uncle alecs tree  how my heart beat  my hair should have stood up on end with terror but it didnt  i felt to see and it was lying down quite flat  but it was only a visitor after all  i dont know whether i was glad or disappointed  i dont think it would be a pleasant experience to see the ghost  but after i had seen it think what a heroine i would be  oh peter what do you think  i have got acquainted with the awkward man at last  i never thought it would be so easy yesterday aunt olivia wanted some ferns so i went back to the maple woods to get them for her and i found some lovely ones by the spring  and while i was sitting there looking into the spring who should come along but the awkward man himself  he sat right down beside me and began to talk  i never was so surprised in my life  we had a very interesting talk and i told him two of my best stories and a great many of my secrets into the bargain  they may say what they like but he was not one bit shy or awkward and he has beautiful eyes  he did not tell me any of his secrets but i believe he will some day  of course i never said a word about his aliceroom  but i gave him a hint about his little brown book  i said i loved poetry and often felt like writing it and then i said do you ever feel like that mr dale  he said yes he sometimes felt that way but he did not mention the brown book  i thought he might have  but after all i dont like people who tell you everything the first time you meet them like sara ray  when he went away he said i hope i shall have the pleasure of meeting you again just as seriously and politely as if i was a grownup young lady  i am sure he could never have said it if i had been really grown up  i told him it was likely he would and that he wasnt to mind if i had a longer skirt on next time because id be just the same person  i told the children a beautiful new fairy story today  i made them go to the spruce wood to hear it  a spruce wood is the proper place to tell fairy stories in  felicity says she cant see that it makes any difference where you tell them but oh it does  i wish you had been there to hear it too but when you are well i will tell it over again for you  i am going to call the southernwood appleringie after this beverley says that is what they call it in scotland and i think it sounds so much more poetical than southernwood  felicity says the right name is boys love but i think that sounds silly  oh peter shadows are such pretty things  the orchard is full of them this very minute  sometimes they are so still you would think them asleep  then they go laughing and skipping  outside in the oat field they are always chasing each other  they are the wild shadows  the shadows in the orchard are the tame shadows  everything seems to be rather tired growing except the spruces and chrysanthemums in aunt olivias garden  the sunshine is so thick and yellow and lazy and the crickets sing all day long the birds are nearly all gone and most of the maple leaves have fallen  just to make you laugh ill write you a little story i heard uncle alec telling last night  it was about elder frewens grandfather taking a pair of rope reins to lead a piano home everybody laughed except aunt janet  old mr frewen was her grandfather too and she wouldnt laugh  one day when old mr frewen was a young man of eighteen his father came home and said sandy i bought a piano at simon wards sale today  youre to go tomorrow and bring it home  so next day sandy started off on horseback with a pair of rope reins to lead the piano home he thought it was some kind of livestock  and then uncle roger told about old mark ward who got up to make a speech at a church missionary social when he was drunk  of course he didnt get drunk at the social  he went there that way  and this was his speech  ladies and gentlemen mr chairman i cant express my thoughts on this grand subject of missions  its in this poor human critterpatting himself on the breastbut he cant git it out  ill tell you these stories when you get well  i can tell them ever so much better than i can write them  i know felicity is wondering why im writing such a long letter so perhaps id better stop  if your mother reads it to you there is a good deal of it she may not understand but i think your aunt jane would       i remain               your very affectionate friend                                        sara stanley  i did not keep a copy of my own letter and i have forgotten everything that was in it except the first sentence in which i told peter i was awful glad he was getting better  peters delight on receiving our letters knew no bounds  he insisted on answering them and his letter painstakingly disinfected was duly delivered to us  aunt olivia had written it at his dictation which was a gain as far as spelling and punctuation went  but peters individuality seemed merged and lost in aunt olivias big dashing script  not until the story girl read the letter to us in the granary by jackolantern light in a mimicry of peters very voice did we savour the real bouquet of it  peters letter  dear everybody but especially felicityi was awful glad to get your letters  it makes you real important to be sick but the time seems awful long when youre getting better  your letters were all great but i liked felicitys best and next to hers the story girls  felicity it will be awful good of you to send me things to eat and the rosebud plate  ill be awful careful of it  i hope you wont catch the measles for they are not nice especially when they strike in but you would look all right even if you did have red spots on your face  i would like to try the mexican tea because you want me to but mother says no she doesnt believe in it and burtons bitters are a great deal healthier  if i was you i would get the velvet hood all right  the heathen live in warm countries so they dont want hoods  im glad you are still praying for me cecily for you cant trust the measles  and im glad youre keeping you know what for me  i dont believe anything will happen to you if you do take the measles but if anything does id like that little red book of yours the safe compass just to remember you by  its such a good book to read on sundays  it is interesting and religious too  so is the bible  i hadnt quite finished the bible before i took the measles but ma is reading the last chapters to me theres an awful lot in that book  i cant understand the whole of it since im only a hired boy but some parts are real easy  im awful glad you have such a good opinion of me  i dont deserve it but after this ill try to  i cant tell you how i feel about all your kindness  im like the fellow the story girl wrote about who couldnt get it out  i have the picture the story girl gave me for my sermon on the wall at the foot of my bed  i like to look at it it looks so much like aunt jane  felix ive given up praying that id be the only one to eat the bitter apples and ill never pray for anything like that again it was a horrid mean prayer  i didnt know it then but after the measles struck in i found out it was  aunt jane wouldnt have liked it  after this im going to pray prayers i neednt be ashamed of  sara ray i dont know what it feels like to be going to die because i didnt know i was going to die till i got better mother says i was luny most of the time after they struck in  it was just because they struck in i was luny  i aint luny naturally felicity  i will do what you asked in your postscript sara although it will be hard  im glad peg bowen didnt catch you dan  maybe she bewitched me that night we were at her place and that is why the measles struck in  im awful glad mr king is going to leave the potato stalks until i get well and im obliged to the story girl for coaxing him  i guess she will find out about alice yet  there were some parts of her letter i couldnt see through but when the measles strike in they leave you stupid for a spell anyhow it was a fine letter and they were all fine and im awful glad i have so many nice friends even if i am only a hired boy  perhaps id never have found it out if the measles hadnt struck in  so im glad they did but i hope they never will again              your obedient servant                                  peter craig    chapter xxxi on the edge of light and dark  we celebrated the november day when peter was permitted to rejoin us by a picnic in the orchard  sara ray was also allowed to come under protest and her joy over being among us once more was almost pathetic  she and cecily cried in one anothers arms as if they had been parted for years  we had a beautiful day for our picnic  november dreamed that it was may  the air was soft and mellow with pale aerial mists in the valleys and over the leafless beeches on the western hill the sere stubble fields brooded in glamour and the sky was pearly blue  the leaves were still thick on the apple trees though they were russet hued and the aftergrowth of grass was richly green unharmed as yet by the nipping frosts of previous nights  the wind made a sweet drowsy murmur in the boughs as of bees among apple blossoms  its just like spring isnt it asked felicity  the story girl shook her head  no not quite  it looks like spring but it isnt spring  its as if everything was restinggetting ready to sleep  in spring theyre getting ready to grow  cant you feel the difference  i think its just like spring insisted felicity  in the sunsweet place before the pulpit stone we boys had put up a board table  aunt janet allowed us to cover it with an old tablecloth the worn places in which the girls artfully concealed with frostwhitened ferns  we had the kitchen dishes and the table was gaily decorated with cecilys three scarlet geraniums and maple leaves in the cherry vase  as for the viands they were fit for the gods on high olympus  felicity had spent the whole previous day and the forenoon of the picnic day in concocting them  her crowning achievement was a rich little plum cake on the white frosting of which the words welcome back were lettered in pink candies  this was put before peters place and almost overcame him  to think that youd go to so much trouble for me he said with a glance of adoring gratitude at felicity  felicity got all the gratitude although the story girl had originated the idea and seeded the raisins and beaten the eggs while cecily had trudged all the way to mrs jamesons little shop below the church to buy the pink candies  but that is the way of the world  we ought to have grace said felicity as we sat down at the festal board  will any one say it  she looked at me but i blushed to the roots of my hair and shook my head sheepishly  an awkward pause ensued it looked as if we would have to proceed without grace when felix suddenly shut his eyes bent his head and said a very good grace without any appearance of embarrassment  we looked at him when it was over with an increase of respect  where on earth did you learn that felix i asked  its the grace uncle alec says at every meal answered felix  we felt rather ashamed of ourselves  was it possible that we had paid so little attention to uncle alecs grace that we did not recognize it when we heard it on other lips  now said felicity jubilantly lets eat everything up  in truth it was a merry little feast  we had gone without our dinners in order to save our appetites and we did ample justice to felicitys good things  paddy sat on the pulpit stone and watched us with great yellow eyes knowing that tidbits would come his way later on  many witty things were saidor at least we thought them wittyand uproarious was the laughter  never had the old king orchard known a blither merrymaking or lighter hearts  the picnic over we played games until the early falling dusk and then we went with uncle alec to the back field to burn the potato stalksthe crowning delight of the day  the stalks were in heaps all over the field and we were allowed the privilege of setting fire to them  twas glorious  in a few minutes the field was alight with blazing bonfires over which rolled great pungent clouds of smoke  from pile to pile we ran shrieking with delight to poke each up with a long stick and watch the gush of rosered sparks stream off into the night  in what a whirl of smoke and firelight and wild fantastic hurtling shadows we were  when we grew tired of our sport we went to the windward side of the field and perched ourselves on the high pole fence that skirted a dark spruce wood full of strange furtive sounds over us was a great dark sky blossoming with silver stars and all around lay dusky mysterious reaches of meadow and wood in the soft empurpled night  away to the east a shimmering silveryness beneath a palace of aerial cloud foretokened moonrise  but directly before us the potato field with its wreathing smoke and sullen flames the gigantic shadow of uncle alec crossing and recrossing it reminded us of peters famous description of the bad place and probably suggested the story girls remark  i know a story she said infusing just the right shade of weirdness into her voice about a man who saw the devil  now whats the matter felicity  i can never get used to the way you mention thethethat name complained felicity  to hear you speak of the old scratch any one would think he was just a common person  never mind  tell us the story i said curiously  it is about mrs john martins uncle at markdale said the story girl  i heard uncle roger telling it the other night  he didnt know i was sitting on the cellar hatch outside the window or i dont suppose he would have told it  mrs martins uncles name was william cowan and he has been dead for twenty years but sixty years ago he was a young man and a very wild wicked young man  he did everything bad he could think of and never went to church and he laughed at everything religious even the devil  he didnt believe there was a devil at all  one beautiful summer sunday evening his mother pleaded with him to go to church with her but he would not  he told her that he was going fishing instead and when church time came he swaggered past the church with his fishing rod over his shoulder singing a godless song  half way between the church and the harbour there was a thick spruce wood and the path ran through it  when william cowan was half way through it something came out of the wood and walked beside him  i have never heard anything more horribly suggestive than that innocent word something as enunciated by the story girl  i felt cecilys hand icy cold clutching mine  whatwhatwas it like whispered felix curiosity getting the better of his terror  it was tall and black and hairy said the story girl her eyes glowing with uncanny intensity in the red glare of the fires and it lifted one great hairy hand with claws on the end of it and clapped william cowan first on one shoulder and then on the other and said good sport to you brother william cowan gave a horrible scream and fell on his face right there in the wood  some of the men around the church door heard the scream and they rushed down to the wood  they saw nothing but william cowan lying like a dead man on the path  they took him up and carried him home and when they undressed him to put him to bed there on each shoulder was the mark of a big hand burned into the flesh  it was weeks before the burns healed and the scars never went away  always as long as william cowan lived he carried on his shoulders the prints of the devils hand  i really do not know how we should ever have got home had we been left to our own devices  we were cold with fright  how could we turn our backs on the eerie spruce wood out of which something might pop at any moment  how cross those long shadowy fields between us and our rooftree  how venture through the darkly mysterious bracken hollow  fortunately uncle alec came along at this crisis and said he thought wed better come home now since the fires were nearly out  we slid down from the fence and started taking care to keep close together and in front of uncle alec  i dont believe a word of that yarn said dan trying to speak with his usual incredulity  i dont see how you can help believing it said cecily  it isnt as if it was something wed read of or that happened far away  it happened just down at markdale and ive seen that very spruce wood myself  oh i suppose william cowan got a fright of some kind conceded dan but i dont believe he saw the devil  old mr morrison at lower markdale was one of the men who undressed him and he remembers seeing the marks said the story girl triumphantly  how did william cowan behave afterwards i asked  he was a changed man said the story girl solemnly  too much changed  he never was known to laugh again or even smile  he became a very religious man which was a good thing but he was dreadfully gloomy and thought everything pleasant sinful  he wouldnt even eat any more than was actually necessary to keep him alive  uncle roger says that if he had been a roman catholic he would have become a monk but as he was a presbyterian all he could do was to turn into a crank  yes but your uncle roger was never clapped on the shoulder and called brother by the devil said peter  if he had he mightnt have been so precious jolly afterwards himself  i do wish to goodness said felicity in exasperation that youd stop talking of thetheof such subjects in the dark im so scared now that i keep thinking fathers steps behind us are somethings  just think my own father  the story girl slipped her arm through felicitys  never mind she said soothingly  ill tell you another storysuch a beautiful story that youll forget all about the devil  she told us one of hans andersens most exquisite tales and the magic of her voice charmed away all our fear so that when we reached the bracken hollow a lake of shadow surrounded by the silver shore of moonlit fields we all went through it without a thought of his satanic majesty at all  and beyond us on the hill the homelight was glowing from the farmhouse window like a beacon of old loves    chapter xxxii the opening of the blue chest  november wakened from her dream of may in a bad temper  the day after the picnic a cold autumn rain set in and we got up to find our world a drenched windwrithen place with sodden fields and dour skies  the rain was weeping on the roof as if it were shedding the tears of old sorrows the willow by the gate tossed its gaunt branches wildly as if it were some passionate spectral thing wringing its fleshless hands in agony the orchard was haggard and uncomely nothing seemed the same except the staunch trusty old spruces  it was friday but we were not to begin going to school again until monday so we spent the day in the granary sorting apples and hearing tales  in the evening the rain ceased the wind came around to the northwest freezing suddenly and a chilly yellow sunset beyond the dark hills seemed to herald a brighter morrow  felicity and the story girl and i walked down to the postoffice for the mail along a road where fallen leaves went eddying fitfully up and down before us in weird uncanny dances of their own  the evening was full of eerie soundsthe creaking of fir boughs the whistle of the wind in the treetops the vibrations of strips of dried bark on the rail fences  but we carried summer and sunshine in our hearts and the bleak unloveliness of the outer world only intensified our inner radiance  felicity wore her new velvet hood with a coquettish little collar of white fur about her neck  her golden curls framed her lovely face and the wind stung the pink of her cheeks to crimson  on my left hand walked the story girl her red cap on her jaunty brown head  she scattered her words along the path like the pearls and diamonds of the old fairy tale  i remember that i strutted along quite insufferably for we met several of the carlisle boys and i felt that i was an exceptionally lucky fellow to have such beauty on one side and such charm on the other  there was one of fathers thin letters for felix a fat foreign letter for the story girl addressed in her fathers minute handwriting a drop letter for cecily from some school friend with in haste written across the corner and a letter for aunt janet postmarked montreal  i cant think who that is from said felicity  nobody in montreal ever writes to mother  cecilys letter is from em frewen  she always puts in haste on her letters no matter what is in them  when we reached home aunt janet opened and read her montreal letter  then she laid it down and looked about her in astonishment  well did ever any mortal she said  what in the world is the matter said uncle alec  this letter is from james wards wife in montreal said aunt janet solemnly  rachel ward is dead  and she told james wife to write to me and tell me to open the old blue chest  hurrah shouted dan  donald king said his mother severely rachel ward was your relation and she is dead  what do you mean by such behaviour  i never was acquainted with her said dan sulkily  and i wasnt hurrahing because she is dead  i hurrahed because that blue chest is to be opened at last  so poor rachel is gone said uncle alec  she must have been an old womanseventyfive i suppose  i remember her as a fine blooming young woman  well well and so the old chest is to be opened at last  what is to be done with its contents  rachel left instructions about them answered aunt janet referring to the letter  the wedding dress and veil and letters are to be burned  there are two jugs in it which are to be sent to james wife  the rest of the things are to be given around among the connection  each members is to have one to remember her by  oh cant we open it right away this very night said felicity eagerly  no indeed aunt janet folded up the letter decidedly  that chest has been locked up for fifty years and itll stand being locked up one more night  you children wouldnt sleep a wink tonight if we opened it now  youd go wild with excitement  im sure i wont sleep anyhow said felicity  well at least youll open it the first thing in the morning wont you ma  no ill do nothing of the sort was aunt janets pitiless decree  i want to get the work out of the way firstand roger and olivia will want to be here too  well say ten oclock tomorrow forenoon  thats sixteen whole hours yet sighed felicity  im going right over to tell the story girl said cecily wont she be excited  we were all excited  we spent the evening speculating on the possible contents of the chest and cecily dreamed miserably that night that the moths had eaten everything in it  the morning dawned on a beautiful world  a very slight fall of snow had come in the nightjust enough to look like a filmy veil of lace flung over the dark evergreens and the hard frozen ground  a new blossom time seemed to have revisited the orchard the spruce wood behind the house appeared to be woven out of enchantment  there is nothing more beautiful than a thickly growing wood of firs lightly powdered with newfallen snow  as the sun remained hidden by gray clouds this fairybeauty lasted all day  the story girl came over early in the morning and sara ray to whom faithful cecily had sent word was also on hand  felicity did not approve of this  sara ray isnt any relation to our family she scolded to cecily and she has no right to be present  shes a particular friend of mine said cecily with dignity we have her in everything and it would hurt her feelings dreadfully to be left out of this  peter is no relation either but he is going to be here when we open it so why shouldnt sara  peter aint a member of the family yet but maybe he will be some day  hey felicity said dan  youre awful smart arent you dan king said felicity reddening  perhaps youd like to send for kitty marr toothough she does laugh at your big mouth  it seems as if ten oclock would never come sighed the story girl  the work is all done and aunt olivia and uncle roger are here and the chest might just as well be opened right away  mother said ten oclock and shell stick to it said felicity crossly  its only nine now  let us put the clock on half an hour said the story girl the clock in the hall isnt going so no one will know the difference  we all looked at each other  i wouldnt dare said felicity irresolutely  oh if thats all ill do it said the story girl  when ten oclock struck aunt janet came into the kitchen remarking innocently that it hadnt seemed anytime since nine we must have looked horribly guilty but none of the grownups suspected anything  uncle alec brought in the axe and pried off the cover of the old blue chest while everybody stood around in silence  then came the unpacking  it was certainly an interesting performance  aunt janet and aunt olivia took everything out and laid it on the kitchen table  we children were forbidden to touch anything but fortunately we were not forbidden the use of our eyes and tongues  there are the pink and gold vases grandmother king gave her said felicity as aunt olivia unwrapped from their tissue paper swathings a pair of slender oldfashioned twisted vases of pink glass over which little gold leaves were scattered  arent they handsome  and oh exclaimed cecily in delight theres the china fruit basket with the apple on the handle  doesnt it look real  ive thought so much about it  oh mother please let me hold it for a minute  ill be as careful as careful  there comes the china set grandfather king gave her said the story girl wistfully  oh it makes me feel sad  think of all the hopes that rachel ward must have put away in this chest with all her pretty things  following these came a quaint little candlestick of blue china and the two jugs which were to be sent to james wife  they are handsome said aunt janet rather enviously  they must be a hundred years old  aunt sara ward gave them to rachel and she had them for at least fifty years  i should have thought one would have been enough for james wife  but of course we must do just as rachel wished  i declare heres a dozen tin patty pans  tin patty pans arent very romantic said the story girl discontentedly  i notice that you are as fond as any one of what is baked in them said aunt janet  ive heard of those patty pans  an old servant grandmother king had gave them to rachel  now we are coming to the linen  that was uncle edward wards present  how yellow it has grown  we children were not greatly interested in the sheets and tablecloths and pillowcases which now came out of the capacious depths of the old blue chest  but aunt olivia was quite enraptured over them  what sewing she said  look janet youd almost need a magnifying glass to see the stitches  and the dear oldfashioned pillowslips with buttons on them  here are a dozen handkerchiefs said aunt janet  look at the initial in the corner of each  rachel learned that stitch from a nun in montreal  it looks as if it was woven into the material  here are her quilts said aunt olivia  yes there is the blue and white counterpane grandmother ward gave herand the rising sun quilt her aunt nancy made for herand the braided rug  the colours are not faded one bit  i want that rug janet  underneath the linen were rachel wards wedding clothes  the excitement of the girls waxed red hot over these  there was a paisley shawl in the wrappings in which it had come from the store and a wide scarf of some yellowed lace  there was the embroidered petticoat which had cost felicity such painful blushes and a dozen beautifully worked sets of the fine muslin undersleeves which had been the fashion in rachel wards youth  this was to have been her appearing out dress said aunt olivia lifting out a shot green silk  it is all cut to piecesbut what a pretty soft shade it was  look at the skirt janet  how many yards must it measure around  hoopskirts were in then said aunt janet  i dont see her wedding hat here  i was always told that she packed it away too  so was i  but she couldnt have  it certainly isnt here  i have heard that the white plume on it cost a small fortune  here is her black silk mantle  it seems like sacrilege to meddle with these clothes  dont be foolish olivia  they must be unpacked at least  and they must all be burned since they have cut so badly  this purple cloth dress is quite good however  it can be made over nicely and it would become you very well olivia  no thank you said aunt olivia with a little shudder  i should feel like a ghost  make it over for yourself janet  well i will if you dont want it  i am not troubled with fancies  that seems to be all except this box  i suppose the wedding dress is in it  oh breathed the girls crowding about aunt olivia as she lifted out the box and cut the cord around it  inside was lying a dress of soft silk that had once been white but was now yellowed with age and enfolding it like a mist a long white bridal veil redolent with some strange oldtime perfume that had kept its sweetness through all the years  poor rachel ward said aunt olivia softly  here is her point lace handkerchief  she made it herself  it is like a spiders web  here are the letters will montague wrote her  and here she added taking up a crimson velvet case with a tarnished gilt clasp are their photographshis and hers  we looked eagerly at the daguerreotypes in the old case  why rachel ward wasnt a bit pretty exclaimed the story girl in poignant disappointment  no rachel ward was not pretty that had to be admitted  the picture showed a fresh young face with strongly marked irregular features large black eyes and black curls hanging around the shoulders in oldtime style  rachel wasnt pretty said uncle alec but she had a lovely colour and a beautiful smile  she looks far too sober in that picture  she has a beautiful neck and bust said aunt olivia critically  anyhow will montague was really handsome said the story girl  a handsome rogue growled uncle alec  i never liked him  i was only a little chap of ten but i saw through him  rachel ward was far too good for him  we would dearly have liked to get a peep into the letters too but aunt olivia would not allow that  they must be burned unread she declared  she took the wedding dress and veil the picture case and the letters away with her  the rest of the things were put back into the chest pending their ultimate distribution  aunt janet gave each of us boys a handkerchief the story girl got the blue candlestick and felicity and cecily each got a pink and gold vase  even sara ray was made happy by the gift of a little china plate with a loudly coloured picture of moses and aaron before pharaoh in the middle of it  moses wore a scarlet cloak while aaron disported himself in bright blue  pharaoh was arrayed in yellow  the plate had a scalloped border with a wreath of green leaves around it  i shall never use it to eat off said sara rapturously  ill put it up on the parlour mantelpiece  i dont see much use in having a plate just for ornament said felicity  its nice to have something interesting to look at retorted sara who felt that the soul must have food as well as the body  im going to get a candle for my candlestick and use it every night to go to bed with said the story girl  and ill never light it without thinking of poor rachel ward  but i do wish she had been pretty  well said felicity with a glance at the clock its all over and it has been very interesting  but that clock has got to be put back to the right time some time through the day  i dont want bedtime coming a whole halfhour before it ought to  in the afternoon when aunt janet was over at uncle rogers seeing him and aunt olivia off to town the clock was righted the story girl and peter came over to stay all night with us and we made taffy in the kitchen which the grownups kindly gave over to us for that purpose  of course it was very interesting to see the old chest unpacked said the story girl as she stirred the contents of a saucepan vigorously  but now that it is over i believe i am sorry that it is opened  it isnt mysterious any longer  we know all about it now and we can never imagine what things are in it any more  its better to know than to imagine said felicity  oh no it isnt said the story girl quickly  when you know things you have to go by facts  but when you just dream about things theres nothing to hold you down  youre letting the taffy scorch and thats a fact youd better go by said felicity sniffing  havent you got a nose  when we went to bed that wonderful white enchantress the moon was making an elfland of the snowmisted world outside  from where i lay i could see the sharp tops of the spruces against the silvery sky  the frost was abroad and the winds were still and the land lay in glamour  across the hall the story girl was telling felicity and cecily the old old tale of argive helen and evilhearted paris  but thats a bad story said felicity when the tale was ended she left her husband and run away with another man  i suppose it was bad four thousand years ago admitted the story girl  but by this time the bad must have all gone out of it  its only the good that could last so long   our summer was over  it had been a beautiful one  we had known the sweetness of common joys the delight of dawns the dream and glamour of noontides the long purple peace of carefree nights we had had the pleasure of bird song of silver rain on greening fields of storm among the trees of blossoming meadows and of the converse of whispering leaves  we had had brotherhood with wind and star with books and tales and hearth fires of autumn ours had been the little loving tasks of every day blithe companionship shared thoughts and adventuring  rich were we in the memory of those opulent months that had gone from usricher than we then knew or suspected  and before us was the dream of spring  it is always safe to dream of spring  for it is sure to come and if it be not just as we have pictured it it will be infinitely sweeter  the end
