8590191	the variation of  animals and plants  under domestication  by  charles darwin ma frs etc  in two volumes  volume i     preface to the second edition  during the seven years which have elapsed since the publication in 1868 of the first edition of this work i have continued to attend to the same subjects as far as lay in my power and i have thus accumulated a large body of additional facts chiefly through the kindness of many correspondents of these facts i have been able here to use only those which seemed to me the more important i have omitted some statements and corrected some errors the discovery of which i owe to my reviewers many additional references have been given the eleventh chapter and that on pangenesis are those which have been most altered parts having been re modelled but i will give a list of the more important alterations for the sake of those who may possess the first edition of this book    contents   introduction   chapter 1i  domestic dogs and cats

remodelled but the essential principles remain the same    the variation of animals and plants under domestication   introduction  the object of this work is not to describe all the many races of animals which have been domesticated by man and of the plants which have been cultivated by him even if i possessed the requisite knowledge so gigantic an undertaking would be here superfluous it is my intention to give under the head of each species only such facts as i have been able to collect or observe showing the amount and nature of the changes which animals and plants have undergone whilst under mans dominion or which bear on the general principles of variation in one case alone namely in that of the domestic pigeon i will describe fully all the chief races their history the amount and nature of their differences and the probable steps by which they have been formed i have selected this case because as we shall hereafter see the materials are better than in any other and one case fully described will in fact illustrate all others but i shall also describe domesticated rabbits fowls and ducks with considerable fulness  the subjects discussed in this volume are so connected that it is not a little difficult to decide how they can be best arranged i have determined in the first part to give under the heads of the various animals and plants a large body of facts some of which may at first appear but little related to our subject and to devote the latter part to general discussions whenever i have found it necessary to give numerous details in support of any proposition or conclusion small type has been used here shown with  the reader will i think find this plan a convenience for if he does not doubt the conclusion or care about the details he can easily pass them over yet i may be permitted to say that some of the discussions thus printed deserve attention at least from the professed naturalist  it may be useful to those who have read nothing about natural selection if i here give a brief sketch of the whole subject and of its bearing on the origin of species introduction1 to any one who has attentively read my origin of species this introduction will be superfluous as i stated in that work that i should soon publish the facts on which the conclusions given in it were founded i here beg permission to remark that the great delay in publishing this first work has been caused by continued ill health this is the more desirable as it is impossible in the present work to avoid many allusions to questions which will be fully discussed in future volumes  from a remote period in all parts of the world man has subjected many animals and plants to domestication or culture man has no power of altering the absolute conditions of life he cannot change the climate of any country he adds no new element to the soil but he can remove an animal or plant from one climate or soil to another and give it food on which it did not subsist in its natural state it is an error to speak of man tampering with nature and causing variability if a man drops a piece of iron into sulphuric acid it cannot be said strictly that he makes the sulphate of iron he only allows their elective affinities to come into play if organic beings had not possessed an inherent tendency to vary man could have done nothing introduction2 m pouchet has recently plurality of races english translation 1864 page 83 etc insisted that variation under domestication throws no light on the natural modification of species i cannot perceive the force of his arguments or to speak more accurately of his assertions to this effect he unintentionally exposes his animals and plants to various conditions of life and variability supervenes which he cannot even prevent or check consider the simple case of a plant which has been cultivated during a long time in its native country and which consequently has not been subjected to any change of climate it has been protected to a certain extent from the competing roots of plants of other kinds it has generally been grown in manured soil but probably not richer than that of many an alluvial flat and lastly it has been exposed to changes in its conditions being grown sometimes in one district and sometimes in another in different soils under such circumstances scarcely a plant can be named though cultivated in the rudest manner which has not given birth to several varieties it can hardly be maintained that during the many changes which this earth has undergone and during the natural migrations of plants from one land or island to another tenanted by different species that such plants will not often have been subjected to changes in their conditions analogous to those which almost inevitably cause cultivated plants to vary no doubt man selects varying individuals sows their seeds and again selects their varying offspring but the initial variation on which man works and without which he can do nothing is caused by slight changes in the conditions of life which must often have occurred under nature man therefore may be said to have been trying an experiment on a gigantic scale and it is an experiment which nature during the long lapse of time has incessantly tried hence it follows that the principles of domestication are important for us the main result is that organic beings thus treated have varied largely and the variations have been inherited this has apparently been one chief cause of the belief long held by some few naturalists that species in a state of nature undergo change  i shall in this volume treat as fully as my materials permit the whole subject of variation under domestication we may thus hope to obtain some light little though it be on the causes of variabilityon the laws which govern it such as the direct action of climate and food the effects of use and disuse and of correlation of growthand on the amount of change to which domesticated organisms are liable we shall learn something of the laws of inheritance of the effects of crossing different breeds and on that sterility which often supervenes when organic beings are removed from their natural conditions of life and likewise when they are too closely interbred during this investigation we shall see that the principle of selection is highly important although man does not cause variability and cannot even prevent it he can select preserve and accumulate the variations given to him by the hand of nature almost in any way which he chooses and thus he can certainly produce a great result selection may be followed either methodically and intentionally or unconsciously and unintentionally man may select and preserve each successive variation with the distinct intention of improving and altering a breed in accordance with a preconceived idea and by thus adding up variations often so slight as to be imperceptible by an uneducated eye he has effected wonderful changes and improvements it can also be clearly shown that man without any intention or thought of improving the breed by preserving in each successive generation the individuals which he prizes most and by destroying the worthless individuals slowly though surely induces great changes as the will of man thus comes into play we can understand how it is that domesticated breeds show adaptation to his wants and pleasures we can further understand how it is that domestic races of animals and cultivated races of plants often exhibit an abnormal character as compared with natural species for they have been modified not for their own benefit but for that of man  in another work i shall discuss if time and health permit the variability of organic beings in a state of nature namely the individual differences presented by animals and plants and those slightly greater and generally inherited differences which are ranked by naturalists as varieties or geographical races we shall see how difficult or rather how impossible it often is to distinguish between races and subspecies as the less well marked forms have sometimes been denominated and again between subspecies and true species i shall further attempt to show that it is the common and widely ranging or as they may be called the dominant species which most frequently vary and that it is the large and flourishing genera which include the greatest number of varying species varieties as we shall see may justly be called incipient species  but it may be urged granting that organic beings in a state of nature present some varietiesthat their organisation is in some slight degree plastic granting that many animals and plants have varied greatly under domestication and that man by his power of selection has gone on accumulating such variations until he has made strongly marked and firmly inherited races granting all this how it may be asked have species arisen in a state of nature the differences between natural varieties are slight whereas the differences are considerable between the species of the same genus and great between the species of distinct genera how do these lesser differences become augmented into the greater difference how do varieties or as i have called them incipient species become converted into true and welldefined species how has each new species been adapted to the surrounding physical conditions and to the other forms of life on which it in any way depends we see on every side of us innumerable adaptations and contrivances which have justly excited the highest admiration of every observer there is for instance a fly cecidomyia introduction3 leon dufour in annales des science nat 3rd series zoolog tome 5 page 6 which deposits its eggs within the stamens of a scrophularia and secretes a poison which produces a gall on which the larva feeds but there is another insect misocampus which deposits its eggs within the body of the larva within the gall and is thus nourished by its living prey so that here a hymenopterous insect depends on a dipterous insect and this depends on its power of producing a monstrous growth in a particular organ of a particular plant so it is in a more or less plainly marked manner in thousands and tens of thousands of cases with the lowest as well as with the highest productions of nature  this problem of the conversion of varieties into speciesthat is the augmentation of the slight differences characteristic of varieties into the greater differences characteristic of species and genera including the admirable adaptations of each being to its complex organic and inorganic conditions of lifehas been briefly treated in my origin of species it was there shown that all organic beings without exception tend to increase at so high a ratio that no district no station not even the whole surface of the land or the whole ocean would hold the progeny of a single pair after a certain number of generations the inevitable result is an everrecurrent struggle for existence it has truly been said that all nature is at war the strongest ultimately prevail the weakest fail and we well know that myriads of forms have disappeared from the face of the earth if then organic beings in a state of nature vary even in a slight degree owing to changes in the surrounding conditions of which we have abundant geological evidence or from any other cause if in the long course of ages inheritable variations ever arise in any way advantageous to any being under its excessively complex and changing relations of life and it would be a strange fact if beneficial variations did never arise seeing how many have arisen which man has taken advantage of for his own profit or pleasure if then these contingencies ever occur and i do not see how the probability of their occurrence can be doubted then the severe and oftenrecurrent struggle for existence will determine that those variations however slight which are favourable shall be preserved or selected and those which are unfavourable shall be destroyed  this preservation during the battle for life of varieties which possess any advantage in structure constitution or instinct i have called natural selection and mr herbert spencer has well expressed the same idea by the survival of the fittest the term natural selection is in some respects a bad one as it seems to imply conscious choice but this will be disregarded after a little familiarity no one objects to chemists speaking of elective affinity and certainly an acid has no more choice in combining with a base than the conditions of life have in determining whether or not a new form be selected or preserved the term is so far a good one as it brings into connection the production of domestic races by mans power of selection and the natural preservation of varieties and species in a state of nature for brevity sake i sometimes speak of natural selection as an intelligent powerin the same way as astronomers speak of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets or as agriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of selection in the one case as in the other selection does nothing without variability and this depends in some manner on the action of the surrounding circumstances on the organism i have also often personified the word nature for i have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity but i mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural lawsand by laws only the ascertained sequence of events  it has been shown from many facts that the largest amount of life can be supported on each area by great diversification or divergence in the structure and constitution of its inhabitants we have also seen that the continued production of new forms through natural selection which implies that each new variety has some advantage over others inevitably leads to the extermination of the older and less improved forms these latter are almost necessarily intermediate in structure as well as in descent between the lastproduced forms and their original parentspecies now if we suppose a species to produce two or more varieties and these in the course of time to produce other varieties the principal of good being derived from diversification of structure will generally lead to the preservation of the most divergent varieties thus the lesser differences characteristic of varieties come to be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species and by the extermination of the older intermediate forms new species end by being distinctly defined objects thus also we shall see how it is that organic beings can be classed by what is called a natural method in distinct groupsspecies under genera and genera under families  as all the inhabitants of each country may be said owing to their high rate of reproduction to be striving to increase in numbers as each form comes into competition with many other forms in the struggle for lifefor destroy any one and its place will be seized by others as every part of the organisation occasionally varies in some slight degree and as natural selection acts exclusively by the preservation of variations which are advantageous under the excessively complex conditions to which each being is exposed no limit exists to the number singularity and perfection of the contrivances and coadaptations which may thus be produced an animal or a plant may thus slowly become related in its structure and habits in the most intricate manner to many other animals and plants and to the physical conditions of its home variations in the organisation will in some cases be aided by habit or by the use and disuse of parts and they will be governed by the direct action of the surrounding physical conditions and by correlation of growth  on the principles here briefly sketched out there is no innate or necessary tendency in each being to its own advancement in the scale of organisation we are almost compelled to look at the specialisation or differentiation of parts or organs for different functions as the best or even sole standard of advancement for by such division of labour each function of body and mind is better performed and as natural selection acts exclusively through the preservation of profitable modifications of structure and as the conditions of life in each area generally become more and more complex from the increasing number of different forms which inhabit it and from most of these forms acquiring a more and more perfect structure we may confidently believe that on the whole organisation advances nevertheless a very simple form fitted for very simple conditions of life might remain for indefinite ages unaltered or unimproved for what would it profit an infusorial animalcule for instance or an intestinal worm to become highly organised members of a high group might even become and this apparently has often occurred fitted for simpler conditions of life and in this case natural selection would tend to simplify or degrade the organisation for complicated mechanism for simple actions would be useless or even disadvantageous  the arguments opposed to the theory of natural selection have been discussed in my origin of species as far as the size of that work permitted under the following heads the difficulty in understanding how very simple organs have been converted by small and graduated steps into highly perfect and complex organs the marvellous facts of instinct the whole question of hybridity and lastly the absence in our known geological formations of innumerable links connecting all allied species although some of these difficulties are of great weight we shall see that many of them are explicable on the theory of natural selection and are otherwise inexplicable  in scientific investigations it is permitted to invent any hypothesis and if it explains various large and independent classes of facts it rises to the rank of a wellgrounded theory the undulations of the ether and even its existence are hypothetical yet every one now admits the undulatory theory of light the principle of natural selection may be looked at as a mere hypothesis but rendered in some degree probable by what we positively know of the variability of organic beings in a state of natureby what we positively know of the struggle for existence and the consequent almost inevitable preservation of favourable variationsand from the analogical formation of domestic races now this hypothesis may be testedand this seems to me the only fair and legitimate manner of considering the whole questionby trying whether it explains several large and independent classes of facts such as the geological succession of organic beings their distribution in past and present times and their mutual affinities and homologies if the principle of natural selection does explain these and other large bodies of facts it ought to be received on the ordinary view of each species having been independently created we gain no scientific explanation of any one of these facts we can only say that it has so pleased the creator to command that the past and present inhabitants of the world should appear in a certain order and in certain areas that he has impressed on them the most extraordinary resemblances and has classed them in groups subordinate to groups but by such statements we gain no new knowledge we do not connect together facts and laws we explain nothing  it was the consideration of such large groups of facts as these which first led me to take up the present subject when i visited during the voyage of hms beagle the galapagos archipelago situated in the pacific ocean about 500 miles from south america i found myself surrounded by peculiar species of birds reptiles and plants existing nowhere else in the world yet they nearly all bore an american stamp in the song of the mocking thrush in the harsh cry of the carrionhawk in the great candlesticklike opuntias i clearly perceived the neighbourhood of america though the islands were separated by so many miles of ocean from the mainland and differed much in their geological constitution and climate still more surprising was the fact that most of the inhabitants of each separate island in this small archipelago were specifically different though most closely related to each other the archipelago with its innumerable craters and bare streams of lava appeared to be of recent origin and thus i fancied myself brought near to the very act of creation i often asked myself how these many peculiar animals and plants had been produced the simplest answer seemed to be that the inhabitants of the several islands had descended from each other undergoing modification in the course of their descent and that all the inhabitants of the archipelago were descended from those of the nearest land namely america whence colonists would naturally have been derived but it long remained to me an inexplicable problem how the necessary degree of modification could have been effected and it would have thus remained for ever had i not studied domestic productions and thus acquired a just idea of the power of selection as soon as i had fully realised this idea i saw on reading malthus on population that natural selection was the inevitable result of the rapid increase of all organic beings for i was prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence by having long studied the habits of animals  before visiting the galapagos i had collected many animals whilst travelling from north to south on both sides of america and everywhere under conditions of life as different as it is possible to conceive american forms were met withspecies replacing species of the same peculiar genera thus it was when the cordilleras were ascended or the thick tropical forests penetrated or the fresh waters of america searched subsequently i visited other countries which in all their conditions of life were incomparably more like parts of south america than the different parts of that continent are to each other yet in these countries as in australia or southern africa the traveller cannot fail to be struck with the entire difference of their productions again the reflection was forced on me that community of descent from the early inhabitants of south america would alone explain the wide prevalence of american types throughout that immense area  to exhume with ones own hands the bones of extinct and gigantic quadrupeds brings the whole question of the succession of species vividly before ones mind and i found in south america great pieces of tesselated armour exactly like but on a magnificent scale that covering the pigmy armadillo i had found great teeth like those of the living sloth and bones like those of the cavy an analogous succession of allied forms had been previously observed in australia here then we see the prevalence as if by descent in time as in space of the same types in the same areas and in neither the case does the similarity of the conditions by any means seem sufficient to account for the similarity of the forms of life it is notorious that the fossil remains of closely consecutive formations are closely allied in structure and we can at once understand the fact if they are closely allied by descent the succession of the many distinct species of the same genus throughout the long series of geological formations seems to have been unbroken or continuous new species come in gradually one by one ancient and extinct forms of life are often intermediate in character like the words of a dead language with respect to its several offshoots or living tongues all these facts seemed to me to point to descent with modification as the means of production of new species  the innumerable past and present inhabitants of the world are connected together by the most singular and complex affinities and can be classed in groups under groups in the same manner as varieties can be classed under species and subvarieties under varieties but with much higher grades of difference these complex affinities and the rules for classification receive a rational explanation on the theory of descent combined with the principle of natural selection which entails divergence of character and the extinction of intermediate forms how inexplicable is the similar pattern of the hand of a man the foot of a dog the wing of a bat the flipper of a seal on the doctrine of independent acts of creation how simply explained on the principle of the natural selection of successive slight variations in the diverging descendants from a single progenitor so it is with certain parts or organs in the same individual animal or plant for instance the jaws and legs of a crab or the petals stamens and pistils of a flower during the many changes to which in the course of time organic beings have been subjected certain organs or parts have occasionally become at first of little use and ultimately superfluous and the retention of such parts in a rudimentary and useless condition is intelligible on the theory of descent it can be shown that modifications of structure are generally inherited by the offspring at the same age at which each successive variation appeared in the parents it can further be shown that variations do not commonly supervene at a very early period of embryonic growth and on these two principles we can understand that most wonderful fact in the whole circuit of natural history namely the close similarity of the embryos within the same great classfor instance those of mammals birds reptiles and fish  it is the consideration and explanation of such facts as these which has convinced me that the theory of descent with modification by means of natural selection is in the main true these facts have as yet received no explanation on the theory of independent creation they cannot be grouped together under one point of view but each has to be considered as an ultimate fact as the first origin of life on this earth as well as the continued life of each individual is at present quite beyond the scope of science i do not wish to lay much stress on the greater simplicity of the view of a few forms or of only one form having been originally created instead of innumerable miraculous creations having been necessary at innumerable periods though this more simple view accords well with maupertuiss philosophical axiom of least action  in considering how far the theory of natural selection may be extended that is in determining from how many progenitors the inhabitants of the world have descendedwe may conclude that at least all the members of the same class have descended from a single ancestor a number of organic beings are included in the same class because they present independently of their habits of life the same fundamental type of structure and because they graduate into each other moreover members of the same class can in most cases be shown to be closely alike at an early embryonic age these facts can be explained on the belief of their descent from a common form therefore it may be safely admitted that all the members of the same class are descended from one progenitor but as the members of quite distinct classes have something in common in structure and much in common in constitution analogy would lead us one step further and to infer as probable that all living creatures are descended from a single prototype  i hope that the reader will pause before coming to any final and hostile conclusion on the theory of natural selection the reader may consult my origin of species for a general sketch of the whole subject but in that work he has to take many statements on trust in considering the theory of natural selection he will assuredly meet with weighty difficulties but these difficulties relate chiefly to subjectssuch as the degree of perfection of the geological record the means of distribution the possibility of transitions in organs etcon which we are confessedly ignorant nor do we know how ignorant we are if we are much more ignorant than is generally supposed most of these difficulties wholly disappear let the reader reflect on the difficulty of looking at whole classes of facts from a new point of view let him observe how slowly but surely the noble views of lyell on the gradual changes now in progress on the earths surface have been accepted as sufficient to account for all that we see in its past history the present action of natural selection may seem more or less probable but i believe in the truth of the theory because it collects under one point of view and gives a rational explanation of many apparently independent classes of facts introduction4 in treating the several subjects included in the present and my other works i have continually been led to ask for information from many zoologists botanists geologists breeders of animals and horticulturists and i have invariably received from them the most generous assistance without such aid i could have effected little i have repeatedly applied for information and specimens to foreigners and to british merchants and officers of the government residing in distant lands and with the rarest exceptions i have received prompt openhanded and valuable assistance i cannot express too strongly my obligations to the many persons who have assisted me and who i am convinced would be equally willing to assist others in any scientific investigation    chapter 1i  domestic dogs and cats  ancient varieties of the dog resemblance of domestic dogs in various

of life feral cats individual variability  the first and chief point of interest in this chapter is whether the numerous domesticated varieties of the dog have descended from a single wild species or from several some authors believe that all have descended from the wolf or from the jackal or from an unknown and extinct species others again believe and this of late has been the favourite tenet that they have descended from several species extinct and recent more or less commingled together we shall probably never be able to ascertain their origin with certainty palaeontology 11 owen british fossil mammals pages 123 to 133 pictet traite de pal 1853 tome 1 page 202 de blainville in his osteographie canidae page 142 has largely discussed the whole subject and concludes that the extinct parent of all domesticated dogs came nearest to the wolf in organisation and to the jackal in habits see also boyd dawkins cave hunting 1874 page 131 etc and his other publications jeitteles has discussed in great detail the character of the breeds of prehistoric dogs die vorgeschichtlichen alterthumer der stadt olmutz ii theil 1872 page 44 to end does not throw much light on the question owing on the one hand to the close similarity of the skulls of extinct as well as living wolves and jackals and owing on the other hand to the great dissimilarity of the skulls of the several breeds of the domestic dogs it seems however that remains have been found in the later tertiary deposits more like those of a large dog than of a wolf which favours the belief of de blainville that our dogs are the descendants of a single extinct species on the other hand some authors go so far as to assert that every chief domestic breed must have had its wild prototype this latter view is extremely improbable it allows nothing for variation it passes over the almost monstrous character of some of the breeds and it almost necessarily assumes that a large number of species have become extinct since man domesticated the dog whereas we plainly see that wild members of the dogfamily are extirpated by human agency with much difficulty even so recently as 1710 the wolf existed in so small an island as ireland  the reasons which have led various authors to infer that our dogs have descended from more than one wild species are as follows 12 pallas i believe originated this doctrine in act acad st petersburgh 1780 part 2 ehrenberg has advocated it as may be seen in de blainvilles osteographie page 79 it has been carried to an extreme extent by col hamilton smith in the naturalist library volumes 9 and 10 mr wc martin adopts it in his excellent history of the dog 1845 as does dr morton as well as nott and gliddon in the united states prof low in his domesticated animals 1845 page 666 comes to this same conclusion no one has argued on this side with more clearness and force than the late james wilson of edinburgh in various papers read before the highland agricultural and wernerian societies isidore geoffroy sainthilaire hist nat gen 1860 tome 3 page 107 though he believes that most dogs have descended from the jackal yet inclines to the belief that some are descended from the wolf prof gervais hist nat mamm 1855 tome 2 page 69 referring to the view that all the domestic races are the modified descendants of a single species after a long discussion says cette opinion est suivant nous du moins la moins probable firstly the great difference between the several breeds but this will appear of comparatively little weight after we shall have seen how great are the differences between the several races of various domesticated animals which certainly have descended from a single parentform secondly the more important fact that at the most anciently known historical periods several breeds of the dog existed very unlike each other and closely resembling or identical with breeds still alive  we will briefly run back through the historical records the materials are remarkably deficient between the fourteenth century and the roman classical period 13 berjeau the varieties of the dog in old sculptures and pictures 1863 der hund von dr fl walther giessen 1817 s 48 this author seems carefully to have studied all classical works on the subject see also volz beitrage zur kulturgeschichte leipzig 1852 s 115 youatt on the dog 1845 page 6 a very full history is given by de blainville in his osteographie canidae at this latter period various breeds namely hounds housedogs lapdogs etc existed but as dr walther has remarked it is impossible to recognise the greater number with any certainty youatt however gives a drawing of a beautiful sculpture of two greyhound puppies from the villa of antoninus on an assyrian monument about 640 bcan enormous mastiff 14 i have seen drawings of this dog from the tomb of the son of esar haddon and clay models in the british museum nott and gliddon in their types of mankind 1854 page 393 give a copy of these drawings this dog has been called a thibetan mastiff but mr ha oldfield who is familiar with the socalled thibet mastiff and has examined the drawings in the british museum informs me that he considers them different is figured and according to sir h rawlinson as i was informed at the british museum similar dogs are still imported into this same country i have looked through the magnificent works of lepsius and rosellini and on the egyptian monuments from the fourth to the twelfth dynasties ie from about 3400 bc to 2100 bc several varieties of the dog are represented most of them are allied to greyhounds at the later of these periods a dog resembling a hound is figured with drooping ears but with a longer back and more pointed head than in our hounds there is also a turnspit with short and crooked legs closely resembling the existing variety but this kind of monstrosity is so common with various animals as with the ancon sheep and even according to rengger with jaguars in paraguay that it would be rash to look at the monumental animal as the parent of all our turnspits colonel sykes 15 proc zoolog soc july 12 1831 also has described an indian pariah dog as presenting the same monstrous character the most ancient dog represented on the egyptian monuments is one of the most singular it resembles a greyhound but has long pointed ears and a short curled tail a closely allied variety still exists in northern africa for mr e vernon harcourt 16 sporting in algeria page 51 states that the arab boarhound is an eccentric hieroglyphic animal such as cheops once hunted with somewhat resembling the rough scotch deerhound their tails are curled tight round on their backs and their ears stick out at right angles with this most ancient variety a pariahlike dog coexisted  we thus see that at a period between four and five thousand years ago various breeds viz pariah dogs greyhounds common hounds mastiffs housedogs lapdogs and turnspits existed more or less closely resembling our present breeds but there is not sufficient evidence that any of these ancient dogs belonged to the same identical subvarieties with our present dogs 17 berjeau gives facsimiles of the egyptian drawings mr cl martin in his history of the dog 1845 copies several figures from the egyptian monuments and speaks with much confidence with respect to their identity with still living dogs messrs nott and gliddon types of mankind 1854 page 388 give still more numerous figures mr gliddon asserts that a curltailed greyhound like that represented on the most ancient monuments is common in borneo but the rajah sir j brooke informs me that no such dog exists there as long as man was believed to have existed on this earth only about 6000 years this fact of the great diversity of the breeds at so early a period was an argument of much weight that they had proceeded from several wild sources for there would not have been sufficient time for their divergence and modification but now that we know from the discovery of flint tools embedded with the remains of extinct animals in districts which have since undergone great geographical changes that man has existed for an incomparably longer period and bearing in mind that the most barbarous nations possess domestic dogs the argument from insufficient time falls away greatly in value  long before the period of any historical record the dog was domesticated in europe in the danish middens of the neolithic or newer stone period bones of a canine animal are embedded and steenstrup ingeniously argues that these belonged to a domestic dog for a very large proportion of the bones of birds preserved in the refuse consists of long bones which it was found on trial dogs cannot devour 18 these and the following facts on the danish remains are taken from m morlots most interesting memoir in soc vaudoise des sc nat tome 6 1860 pages 281 299 320 this ancient dog was succeeded in denmark during the bronze period by a larger kind presenting certain differences and this again during the iron period by a still larger kind in switzerland we hear from prof rutimeyer 19 die fauna der pfahlbauten 1861 s 117 162 that during the neolithic period a domesticated dog of middle size existed which in its skull was about equally remote from the wolf and jackal and partook of the characters of our hounds and setters or spaniels jagdhund und wachtelhund rutimeyer insists strongly on the constancy of form during a very long period of time of this the most ancient known dog during the bronze period a larger dog appeared and this closely resembled in its jaw a dog of the same age in denmark remains of two notably distinct varieties of the dog were found by schmerling in a cave 110 de blainville osteographie canidae but their age cannot be positively determined  the existence of a single race remarkably constant in form during the whole neolithic period is an interesting fact in contrast with what we see of the changes which the races underwent during the period of the successive egyptian monuments and in contrast with our existing dogs the character of this animal during the neolithic period as given by rutimeyer supports de blainvilles view that our varieties have descended from an unknown and extinct form but we should not forget that we know nothing with respect to the antiquity of man in the warmer parts of the world the succession of the different kinds of dogs in switzerland and denmark is thought to be due to the immigration of conquering tribes bringing with them their dogs and this view accords with the belief that different wild canine animals were domesticated in different regions independently of the immigration of new races of man we know from the widespread presence of bronze composed of an alloy of tin how much commerce there must have been throughout europe at an extremely remote period and dogs would then probably have been bartered at the present time amongst the savages of the interior of guiana the taruma indians are considered the best trainers of dogs and possess a large breed which they barter at a high price with other tribes 111 sir r schomburgk has given me information on this head see also journal of r geographical soc volume 13 1843 page 65  the main argument in favour of the several breeds of the dog being the descendants of distinct wild stocks is their resemblance in various countries to distinct species still existing there it must however be admitted that the comparison between the wild and domesticated animal has been made but in few cases with sufficient exactness before entering on details it will be well to show that there is no a priori difficulty in the belief that several canine species have been domesticated members of the dog family inhabit nearly the whole world and several species agree pretty closely in habits and structure with our several domesticated dogs mr galton has shown 112 domestication of animals ethnological soc december 22 1863 how fond savages are of keeping and taming animals of all kinds social animals are the most easily subjugated by man and several species of canidae hunt in packs it deserves notice as bearing on other animals as well as on the dog that at an extremely ancient period when man first entered any country the animals living there would have felt no instinctive or inherited fear of him and would consequently have been tamed far more easily than at present for instance when the falkland islands were first visited by man the large wolflike dog canis antarcticus fearlessly came to meet byrons sailors who mistaking this ignorant curiosity for ferocity ran into the water to avoid them even recently a man by holding a piece of meat in one hand and a knife in the other could sometimes stick them at night on a island in the sea of aral when first discovered by butakoff the saigak antelopes which are generally very timid and watchful did not fly from us but on the contrary looked at us with a sort of curiosity so again on the shores of the mauritius the manatee was not at first in the least afraid of man and thus it has been in several quarters of the world with seals and the morse i have elsewhere shown 113 journal of researches etc 1845 page 393 with respect to canis antarcticus see page 193 for the case of the antelope see journal royal geographical soc volume 23 page 94 how slowly the native birds of several islands have acquired and inherited a salutary dread of man at the galapagos archipelago i pushed with the muzzle of my gun hawks from a branch and held out a pitcher of water for other birds to alight on and drink quadrupeds and birds which have seldom been disturbed by man dread him no more than do our english birds the cows or horses grazing in the fields  it is a more important consideration that several canine species evince as will be shown in a future chapter no strong repugnance or inability to breed under confinement and the incapacity to breed under confinement is one of the commonest bars to domestication lastly savages set the highest value as we shall see in the chapter on selection on dogs even half tamed animals are highly useful to them the indians of north america cross their halfwild dogs with wolves and thus render them even wilder than before but bolder the savages of guiana catch and partially tame and use the whelps of two wild species of canis as do the savages of australia those of the wild dingo mr philip king informs me that he once trained a wild dingo puppy to drive cattle and found it very useful from these several considerations we see that there is no difficulty in believing that man might have domesticated various canine species in different countries it would indeed have been a strange fact if one species alone had been domesticated throughout the world  we will now enter into details the accurate and sagacious richardson says the resemblance between the northern american wolves canis lupus var occidentalis and the domestic dogs of the indians is so great that the size and strength of the wolf seems to be the only difference i have more than once mistaken a band of wolves for the dogs of a party of indians and the howl of the animals of both species is prolonged so exactly in the same key that even the practised ear of the indian fails at times to discriminate them he adds that the more northern esquimaux dogs are not only extremely like the grey wolves of the arctic circle in form and colour but also nearly equal them in size dr kane has often seen in his teams of sledgedogs the oblique eye a character on which some naturalists lay great stress the drooping tail and scared look of the wolf in disposition the esquimaux dogs differ little from wolves and according to dr hayes they are capable of no attachment to man and are so savage that when hungry they will attack even their masters according to kane they readily become feral their affinity is so close with wolves that they frequently cross with them and the indians take the whelps of wolves to improve the breed of their dogs the halfbred wolves sometimes lamare picquot cannot be tamed though this case is rare but they do not become thoroughly well broken in till the second or third generation these facts show that there can be but little if any sterility between the esquimaux dog and the wolf for otherwise they would not be used to improve the breed as dr hayes says of these dogs reclaimed wolves they doubtless are 114 the authorities for the foregoing statements are as followrichardson in fauna borealiamericana 1829 pages 64 75 dr kane arctic explorations 1856 volume 1 pages 398 455 dr hayes arctic boat journey 1860 page 167 franklins narrative volume 1 page 269 gives the case of three whelps of a black wolf being carried away by the indians parry richardson and others give accounts of wolves and dogs naturally crossing in the eastern parts of north america seeman in his voyage of hms herald 1853 volume 2 page 26 says the wolf is often caught by the esquimaux for the purpose of crossing with their dogs and thus adding to their size and strength m lamarepicquot in bull de la soc dacclimat tome 7 1860 page 148 gives a good account of the half bred esquimaux dogs  north america is inhabited by a second kind of wolf the prairiewolf canis latrans which is now looked at by all naturalists as specifically distinct from the common wolf and is according to mr jk lord in some respects intermediate in habits between a wolf and a fox sir j richardson after describing the hare indian dog which differs in many respects from the esquimaux dog says it bears the same relation to the prairiewolf that the esquimaux dog does to the great grey wolf he could in fact detect no marked difference between them and messrs nott and gliddon give additional details showing their close resemblance the dogs derived from the above two aboriginal sources cross together and with the wild wolves at least with the c occidentalis and with european dogs in florida according to bartram the black wolfdog of the indians differs in nothing from the wolves of that country except in barking 115 fauna borealiamericana 1829 pages 73 78 80 nott and gliddon types of mankind page 383 the naturalist and traveller bartram is quoted by hamilton smith in naturalist lib volume 10 page 156 a mexican domestic dog seems also to resemble a wild dog of the same country but this may be the prairiewolf another capable judge mr jk lord the naturalist in vancouver island 1866 volume 2 page 218 says that the indian dog of the spokans near the rocky mountains is beyond all question nothing more than a tamed cayote or prairiewolf or canis latrans  turning to the southern parts of the new world columbus found two kinds of dogs in the west indies and fernandez 116 i quote this from mr r hills excellent account of the alco or domestic dog of mexico in gosses naturalists sojourn in jamaica 1851 page 329 describes three in mexico some of these native dogs were dumbthat is did not bark in guiana it has been known since the time of buffon that the natives cross their dogs with an aboriginal species apparently the canis cancrivorus sir r schomburgk who has so carefully explored these regions writes to me i have been repeatedly told by the arawaak indians who reside near the coast that they cross their dogs with a wild species to improve the breed and individual dogs have been shown to me which certainly resembled the c cancrivorus much more than the common breed it is but seldom that the indians keep the c cancrivorus for domestic purposes nor is the ai another species of wild dog and which i consider to be identical with the dusicyon silvestris of h smith now much used by the arecunas for the purpose of hunting the dogs of the taruma indians are quite distinct and resemble buffons st domingo greyhound it thus appears that the natives of guiana have partially domesticated two aboriginal species and still cross their dogs with them these two species belong to a quite different type from the north american and european wolves a careful observer rengger 117 naturgeschichte der saugethiere von paraguay 1830 s 151 gives reasons for believing that a hairless dog was domesticated when america was first visited by europeans some of these dogs in paraguay are still dumb and tschudi 118 quoted in humboldt aspects of nature english translation volume 1 page 108 states that they suffer from cold in the cordillera this naked dog is however quite distinct from that found preserved in the ancient peruvian burialplaces and described by tschudi under the name of canis ingae as withstanding cold well and as barking it is not known whether these two distinct kinds of dog are the descendants of native species and it might be argued that when man first migrated into america he brought with him from the asiatic continent dogs which had not learned to bark but this view does not seem probable as the natives along the line of their march from the north reclaimed as we have seen at least two n american species of canidae  turning to the old world some european dogs closely resemble the wolf thus the shepherd dog of the plains of hungary is white or reddishbrown has a sharp nose short erect ears shaggy coat and bushy tail and so much resembles a wolf that mr paget who gives this description says he has known a hungarian mistake a wolf for one of his own dogs jeitteles also remarks on the close similarity of the hungarian dog and wolf shepherd dogs in italy must anciently have closely resembled wolves for columella vii 12 advises that white dogs be kept adding pastor album probat ne pro lupo canem feriat several accounts have been given of dogs and wolves crossing naturally and pliny asserts that the gauls tied their female dogs in the woods that they might cross with wolves 119 paget travels in hungary and transylvania

the european wolf differs slightly from that of north america and has been ranked by many naturalists as a distinct species the common wolf of india is also by some esteemed as a third species and here again we find a marked resemblance between the pariah dogs of certain districts of india and the indian wolf 120 i give this on excellent authority namely mr blyth under the signature of zoophilus in the indian sporting review october 1856 page 134 mr blyth states that he was struck with the resemblance between a brushtailed race of pariahdogs northwest of cawnpore and the indian wolf

resemblance of dogs and jackals see isid geoffroy sthilaire hist nat gen 1860 tome 3 page 101 see also hist nat des mammiferes par prof gervais 1855 tome 2 page 60 says that not one constant difference can be pointed out between their structure and that of the smaller races of dogs they agree closely in habits jackals when tamed and called by their master wag their tails lick his hands crouch and throw themselves on their backs they smell at the tails of other dogs and void their urine sideways they roll on carrion or on animals which they have killed and lastly when in high spirits they run round in circles or in a figure of eight with their tails between their legs 122 also guldenstadt nov comment acad petrop tome 20 pro anno 1775 page 449 also salvin in land and water october 1869 a number of excellent naturalists from the time of guldenstadt to that of ehrenberg hemprich and cretzschmar have expressed themselves in the strongest terms with respect to the resemblance of the halfdomestic dogs of asia and egypt to jackals m nordmann for instance says les chiens dawhasie ressemblent etonnamment a des chacals ehrenberg 123 quoted by de blainville in his osteographie canidae pages 79 98 asserts that the domestic dogs of lower egypt and certain mummied dogs have for their wild type a species of wolf c lupaster of the country whereas the domestic dogs of nubia and certain other mummied dogs have the closest relation to a wild species of the same country viz c sabbar which is only a form of the common jackal pallas asserts that jackals and dogs sometimes naturally cross in the east and a case is on record in algeria 124 see pallas in act acad st petersburgh 1780 part 2 page 91 for algeria see isid geoffroy sthilaire hist nat gen tome 3 page 177 in both countries it is the male jackal which pairs with female domestic dogs the greater number of naturalists divide the jackals of asia and africa into several species but some few rank them all as one  i may add that the domestic dogs on the coast of guinea are foxlike animals and are dumb 125 john barbut description of the coast of guinea in 1746 on the east coast of africa between latitude 4 deg and 6 deg south and about ten days journey in the interior a semidomestic dog as the rev s erhardt informs me is kept which the natives assert is derived from a similar wild animal lichtenstein 126 travels in south africa volume 2 page 272 says that the dogs of the bosjemans present a striking resemblance even in colour excepting the black stripe down the back with the c mesomelas of south africa mr e layard informs me that he has seen a caffre dog which closely resembled an esquimaux dog in australia the dingo is both domesticated and wild though this animal may have been introduced aboriginally by man yet it must be considered as almost an endemic form for its remains have been found in a similar state of preservation and associated with extinct mammals so that its introduction must have been ancient 127 selwyn geology of victoria journal of geolog soc volume 14 1858 page 536 and volume 16 1860 page 148 and prof mcoy in annals and mag of nat hist 3rd series volume 9 1862

resemblance of the halfdomesticated dogs in several countries to the wild species still living therefrom the facility with which they can often be crossed togetherfrom even halftamed animals being so much valued by savagesand from the other circumstances previously remarked on which favour their domestication it is highly probable that the domestic dogs of the world are descended from two welldefined species of wolf viz c lupus and c latrans and from two or three other doubtful species namely the european indian and north african wolves from at least one or two south american canine species from several races or species of jackal and perhaps from one or more extinct species although it is possible or even probable that domesticated dogs introduced into any country and bred there for many generations might acquire some of the characters proper to the aboriginal canidae of the country we can hardly thus account for introduced dogs having given rise to two breeds in the same country resembling two of its aboriginal species as in the above given cases of guiana and of north america 128 these latter remarks afford i think a sufficient answer to some criticisms by mr wallace on the multiple origin of dogs given in lyells principles of geology 1872 volume 2 page 295  it cannot be objected to the view of several canine species having been anciently domesticated that these animals are tamed with difficulty facts have been already given on this head but i may add that the young of the canis primaevus of india were tamed by mr hodgson 129 proceedings zoological soc 1833

and shall further see in habits between the domestic dogs of the north american indians and the wolves of that country or between the eastern pariah dogs and jackals or between the dogs which have run wild in various countries and the several natural species of the family the habit of barking however which is almost universal with domesticated dogs forms an exception as it does not characterise a single natural species of the family though i am assured that the canis latrans of north america utters a noise which closely approaches a bark but this habit is soon lost by dogs when they become feral and is soon reacquired when they are again domesticated the case of the wild dogs on the island of juan fernandez having become dumb has often been quoted and there is reason to believe 130 roulin in mem present par divers savans tome 6 page 341 that the dumbness ensued in the course of thirtythree years on the other hand dogs taken from this island by ulloa slowly reacquired the habit

as showing how colouring follows laws even in so anciently and thoroughly domesticated an animal as the dog black dogs with tancoloured feet whatever breed they may belong to almost invariably have a tan coloured spot on the upper and inner corners of each eye and their lips are generally thus coloured i have seen only two exceptions to this rule namely in a spaniel and terrier dogs of a lightbrown colour often have a lighter yellowishbrown spot over the eyes sometimes the spot is white and in a mongrel terrier the spot was black mr waring kindly examined for me a stud of fifteen greyhounds in suffolk eleven of them were black or black and white or brindled and these had no eyespots but three were red and one slatyblue and these four had darkcoloured spots over their eyes although the spots thus sometimes differ in colour they strongly tend to be tancoloured this is proved by my having seen four spaniels a setter two yorkshire shepherd dogs a large mongrel and some foxhounds coloured black and white with not a trace of tancolour excepting the spots over the eyes and sometimes a little on the feet these latter cases and many others show plainly that the colour of the feet and the eyespots are in some way correlated i have noticed in various breeds every gradation from the whole face being tancoloured to a complete ring round the eyes to a minute spot over the inner and upper corners the spots occur in various subbreeds of terriers and spaniels in setters in hounds of various kinds including the turnspitlike german badgerhound in shepherd dogs in a mongrel of which neither parent had the spots in one pure bulldog though the spots were in this case almost white and in greyhoundsbut true blackandtan greyhounds are excessively rare nevertheless i have been assured by mr warwick that one ran at the caledonian champion meeting of april 1860 and was marked precisely like a blackandtan terrier this dog or another exactly the same colour ran at the scottish national club on the 21st of march 1865 and i hear from mr cm browne that there was no reason either on the sire or dam side for the appearance of this unusual colour mr swinhoe at my request looked at the dogs in china at amoy and he soon noticed a brown dog with yellow spots over the eyes colonel h smith 140 the naturalist library dogs volume 10 pages 4 19 figures the magnificent black mastiff of thibet with a tancoloured stripe over the eyes feet and chaps and what is more singular he figures the alco or native domestic dog of mexico as black and white with narrow tancoloured rings round the eyes at the exhibition of dogs in london may 1863 a socalled forest dog from northwest mexico was shown which had pale tancoloured spots over the eyes the occurrence of these tancoloured spots in dogs of such extremely different breeds living in various parts of the world makes the fact highly remarkable  we shall hereafter see especially in the chapter on pigeons that coloured marks are strongly inherited and that they often aid us in discovering the primitive forms of our domestic races hence if any wild canine species had distinctly exhibited the tancoloured spots over the eyes it might have been argued that this was the parentform of nearly all our domestic races but after looking at many coloured plates and through the whole collection of skins in the british museum i can find no species thus marked it is no doubt possible that some extinct species was thus coloured on the other hand in looking at the various species there seems to be a tolerably plain correlation between tancoloured legs and face and less frequently between black legs and a black face and this general rule of colouring explains to a certain extent the abovegiven cases of correlation between the eyespots and the colour of the feet moreover some jackals and foxes have a trace of a white ring round their eyes as in c mesomelas c aureus and judging from colonel h smiths drawing in c alopex and c thaleb other species have a trace of a black line over the corners of the eyes as in c variegatus cinereovariegatus and fulvus and the wild dingo hence i am inclined to conclude that a tendency for tancoloured spots to appear over the eyes in the various breeds of dogs is analogous to the case observed by desmarest namely that when any white appears on a dog the tip of the tail is always white de maniere a rappeler la tache terminale de meme couleur qui caracterise la plupart des canides sauvages 141 quoted by prof gervais hist nat mamm tome 2 page 66 this rule however as i am assured by mr jesse does not invariably hold good  it has been objected that our domestic dogs cannot be descended from wolves or jackals because their periods of gestation are different the supposed difference rests on statements made by buffon gilibert bechstein and others but these are now known to be erroneous and the period is found to agree in the wolf jackal and dog as closely as could be expected for it is often in some degree variable 142 j hunter shows that the long period of seventythree days given by buffon is easily explained by the bitch having received the dog many times during a period of sixteen days phil transact 1787 page 353 hunter found that the gestation of a mongrel from wolf and dog phil transact 1789 page 160 apparently was sixtythree days for she received the dog more than once the period of a mongrel dog and jackal was fiftynine days fred cuvier found the period of gestation of the wolf to be dict class dhist nat tome 4 page 8 two months and a few days which agrees with the dog isid g sthilaire who has discussed the whole subject and from whom i quote bellingeri states hist nat gen tome 3 page 112 that in the jardin des plantes the period of the jackal has been found to be from sixty to sixtythree days exactly as with the dog tessier who has closely attended to this subject allows a difference of four days in the gestation of the dog the rev wd fox has given me three carefully recorded cases of retrievers in which the bitch was put only once to the dog and not counting this day but counting that of parturition the periods were fiftynine sixtytwo and sixtyseven days the average period is sixtythree days but bellingeri states that this applies only to large dogs and that for small races it is from sixty to sixtythree days mr eyton of eyton who has had much experience with dogs also informs me that the time is apt to be longer with large than with small dogs  f cuvier has objected that the jackal would not have been domesticated on account of its offensive smell but savages are not sensitive in this respect the degree of odour also differs in the different kinds of jackal 143 see isid geoffroy sthilaire hist nat gen tome 3 page 112 on the odour of jackals col ham smith in nat lib volume 10 page 289 and colonel h smith makes a sectional division of the group with one character dependent on not being offensive on the other hand dogs for instance rough and smooth terriersdiffer much in this respect and m godron states that the hairless socalled turkish dog is more odoriferous than other dogs isidore geoffroy 144 quoted by quatrefages in bull soc dacclimat may 11 1863 gave to a dog the same odour as that from a jackal by feeding it on raw flesh  the belief that our dogs are descended from wolves jackals south american canidae and other species suggests a far more important difficulty these animals in their undomesticated state judging from a widelyspread analogy would have been in some degree sterile if intercrossed and such sterility will be admitted as almost certain by all those who believe that the lessened fertility of crossed forms is an infallible criterion of specific distinctness anyhow these animals keep distinct in the countries which they inhabit in common on the other hand all domestic dogs which are here supposed to be descended from several distinct species are as far as is known mutually fertile together but as broca has well remarked 145 journal de la physiologie tome 2 page 385 the fertility of successive generations of mongrel dogs has never been scrutinised with that care which is thought indispensable when species are crossed the few facts leading to the conclusion that the sexual feelings and reproductive powers differ in the several races of the dog when crossed are passing over mere size as rendering propagation difficult as follows the mexican alco 146 see mr r hills excellent account of this breed in gosses jamaica page 338 rengger saugethiere von

do with each other the spitz dog in germany is said to receive the fox more readily than do other breeds and dr hodgkin states that a female dingo in england attracted the male wild foxes if these latter statements can be trusted they prove some degree of sexual difference in the breeds of the dog but the fact remains that our domestic dogs differing so widely as they do in external structure are far more fertile together than we have reason to believe their supposed wild parents would have been pallas assumes 147 acta acad st petersburgh 1780 part 2 pages 84 100 that a long course of domestication eliminates that sterility which the parentspecies would have exhibited if only lately captured no distinct facts are recorded in support of this hypothesis but the evidence seems to me so strong independently of the evidence derived from other domesticated animals in favour of our domestic dogs having descended from several wild stocks that i am inclined to admit the truth of this hypothesis  there is another and closely allied difficulty consequent on the doctrine of the descent of our domestic dogs from several wild species namely that they do not seem to be perfectly fertile with their supposed parents but the experiment has not been quite fairly tried the hungarian dog for instance which in external appearance so closely resembles the european wolf ought to be crossed with this wolf and the pariah dogs of india with indian wolves and jackals and so in other cases that the sterility is very slight between certain dogs and wolves and other canidae is shown by savages taking the trouble to cross them buffon got four successive generations from the wolf and dog and the mongrels were perfectly fertile together 148 m broca has shown journal de physiologie tome 2 page 353 that buffons experiments have been often misrepresented broca has collected pages 390395 many facts on the fertility of crossed dogs wolves and jackals but more lately m flourens states positively as the result of his numerous experiments that hybrids from the wolf and dog crossed inter se become sterile at the third generation and those from the jackal and dog at the fourth generation 149 de la longevite humaine par m flourens 1855 page 143 mr blyth says indian sporting review volume 2 page 137 that he has seen in india several hybrids from the pariahdog and jackal and between one of these hybrids and a terrier the experiments of hunter on the jackal are wellknown see also isid geoffroy sthilaire hist nat gen tome 3 page 217 who speaks of the hybrid offspring of the jackal as perfectly fertile for three generations but these animals were closely confined and many wild animals as we shall see in a future chapter are rendered by confinement in some degree or even utterly sterile the dingo which breeds freely in australia with our imported dogs would not breed though repeatedly crossed in the jardin des plantes 150 on authority of f cuvier quoted in bronns geschichte der natur b 2 s 164 some hounds from central africa brought home by major denham never bred in the town of london 151 wcl martin history of the dog 1845 page 203 mr philip p king after ample opportunities of observation informs me that the dingo and european dogs often cross in australia and a similar tendency to sterility might be transmitted to the hybrid offspring of a wild animal moreover it appears that in m flourens experiments the hybrids were closely bred in and in for three or four generations and this circumstance would most certainly increase the tendency to sterility several years ago i saw confined in the zoological gardens of london a female hybrid from an english dog and jackal which even in this the first generation was so sterile that as i was assured by her keeper she did not fully exhibit her proper periods but this case was certainly exceptional as numerous instances have occurred of fertile hybrids from these two animals in almost all experiments on the crossing of animals there are so many causes of doubt that it is extremely difficult to come to any positive conclusion it would however appear that those who believe that our dogs are descended from several species will have not only to admit that their offspring after a long course of domestication generally lose all tendency to sterility when crossed together but that between certain breeds of dogs and some of their supposed aboriginal parents a certain degree of sterility has been retained or possibly even acquired  notwithstanding the difficulties in regard to fertility given in the last two paragraphs when we reflect on the inherent improbability of man having domesticated throughout the world one single species alone of so widely distributed so easily tamed and so useful a group as the canidae when we reflect on the extreme antiquity of the different breeds and especially when we reflect on the close similarity both in external structure and habits between the domestic dogs of various countries and the wild species still inhabiting these same countries the balance of evidence is strongly in favour of the multiple origin of our dogs  differences between the several breeds of the dog  if the several breeds have descended from several wild stocks their difference can obviously in part be explained by that of their parent species for instance the form of the greyhound may be partly accounted for by descent from some such animal as the slim abyssinian canis simensis 152 ruppel neue wirbelthiere von abyssinien 183540 mammif s 39 pl 14 there is a specimen of this fine animal in the british museum with its elongated muzzle that of the larger dogs from the larger wolves and the smaller and slighter dogs from the jackals and thus perhaps we may account for certain constitutional and climatal differences but it would be a great error to suppose that there has not been in addition 153 even pallas admits this see act acad st petersburgh 1780 page 93 a large amount of variation the intercrossing of the several aboriginal wild stocks and of the subsequently formed races has probably increased the total number of breeds and as we shall presently see has greatly modified some of them but we cannot explain by crossing the origin of such extreme forms as thoroughbred greyhounds bloodhounds bulldogs blenheim spaniels terriers pugs etc unless we believe that forms equally or more strongly characterised in these different respects once existed in nature but hardly any one has been bold enough to suppose that such unnatural forms ever did or could exist in a wild state when compared with all known members of the family of canidae they betray a distinct and abnormal origin no instance is on record of such dogs as bloodhounds spaniels true greyhounds having been kept by savages they are the product of longcontinued civilisation  the number of breeds and subbreeds of the dog is great youatt for instance describes twelve kinds of greyhounds i will not attempt to enumerate or describe the varieties for we cannot discriminate how much of their difference is due to variation and how much to descent from different aboriginal stocks but it may be worth while briefly to mention some points commencing with the skull cuvier has admitted 154 quoted by i geoffroy hist nat gen tome 3 page 453 that in form the differences are plus fortes que celles daucunes especes sauvages dun meme genre naturel the proportions of the different bones the curvature of the lower jaw the position of the condyles with respect to the plane of the teeth on which f cuvier founded his classification and in mastiffs the shape of its posterior branch the shape of the zygomatic arch and of the temporal fossae the position of the occiputall vary considerably 155 f cuvier in annales du museum tome 18 page 337 godron de lespece tome 1 page 342 and col h smith in nat library volume 9 page 101 see also some observations on the degeneracy of the skull in certain breeds by prof bianconi la theorie darwinienne 1874 page 279 the difference in size between the brains of dogs belonging to large and small breeds is something prodigious some dogs brains are high and rounded while others are low long and narrow in front in the latter the olfactory lobes are visible for about half their extent when the brain is seen from above but they are wholly concealed by the hemispheres in other breeds 156 dr burt wilder american assoc advancement of science 1873 pages 236 239 the dog has properly six pairs of molar teeth in the upper jaw and seven in the lower but several naturalists have seen not rarely an additional pair in the upper jaw 157 isid geoffroy sainthilaire hist des anomalies 1832 tome 1 page 660 gervais hist nat des mammiferes tome 2 1855 page 66 de blainville osteographie canidae page 137 has also seen an extra molar on both sides and professor gervais says that there are dogs qui ont sept paires de dents superieures et huit inferieures de blainville 158 osteographie canidae page 137 has given full particulars on the frequency of these deviations in the number of the teeth and has shown that it is not always the same tooth which is supernumerary in short muzzled races according to h muller 159 wurzburger medecin zeitschrift 1860 b 1 s 265 the molar teeth stand obliquely whilst in longmuzzled races they are placed longitudinally with open spaces between them the naked socalled egyptian or turkish dog is extremely deficient in its teeth 160 mr yarrell in proc zoological soc october 8 1833 mr waterhouse showed me a skull of one of these dogs which had only a single molar on each side and some imperfect incisorssometimes having none except one molar on each side but this though characteristic of the breed must be considered as a monstrosity m girard 161 quoted in the veterinary london volume 8 page 415 who seems to have attended closely to the subject says that the period of the appearance of the permanent teeth differs in different dogs being earlier in large dogs thus the mastiff assumes its adult teeth in four or five months whilst in the spaniel the period is sometimes more than seven or eight months on the other hand small dogs are mature and the females have arrived at the best age for breeding when one year old whereas large dogs are still in their puppyhood at this time and take fully twice as long to develop their proportions 162 this is quoted from stonehenge a great authority the dog 1867 page 187  with respect to minor differences little need be said isidore geoffroy has shown 163 hist nat general tome 3 page 448 that in size some dogs are six times as long the tail being excluded as others and that the height relatively to the length of the body varies from between one to two and one to nearly four in the scotch deerhound there is a striking and remarkable difference in the size of the male and female 164 w scrope art of deerstalking page 354 every one knows how the ears vary in size in different breeds and with their great development their muscles become atrophied certain breeds of dogs are described as having a deep furrow between the nostrils and lips the caudal vertebrae according to f cuvier on whose authority the two last statements rest vary in number and the tail in english cattle and some shepherd dogs is almost absent the mammae vary from seven to ten in number daubenton having examined twenty one dogs found eight with five mammae on each side eight with four on each side and the others with an unequal number on the two sides 165 quoted by col ham smith in nat lib volume 10 page 79 dogs have properly five toes in front and four behind but a fifth toe is often added and f cuvier states that when a fifth toe is present a fourth cuneiform bone is developed and in this case sometimes the great cuneiform bone is raised and gives on its inner side a large articular surface to the astragalus so that even the relative connection of the bones the most constant of all characters varies these modifications however in the feet of dogs are not important because they ought to be ranked as de blainville has shown 166 de blainville osteographie canidae page 134 f cuvier annales du museum tome 18 page 342 in regard to mastiffs see col h smith nat lib volume 10 page 218 for the thibet mastiff see mr hodgson in journal of as soc of bengal volume 1 1832 page 342 as monstrosities nevertheless they are interesting from being correlated with the size of the body for they occur much more frequently with mastiffs and other large breeds than with small dogs closely allied varieties however sometimes differ in this respect thus mr hodgson states that the blackandtan lassa variety of the thibet mastiff has the fifth digit whilst the mustang subvariety is not thus characterised the extent to which the skin is developed between the toes varies much but we shall return to this point the degree to which the various breeds differ in the perfection of their senses dispositions and inherited habits is notorious to every one the breeds present some constitutional differences the pulse says youatt 167 the dog 1845 page 186 with respect to diseases youatt asserts page 167 that the italian greyhound is strongly subject to polypi in the matrix or vagina the spaniel and pug page 182 are most liable to bronchocele the liability to distemper page 232 is extremely different in different breeds on the distemper see also col hutchinson on dog breaking 1850 page 279 varies materially according to the breed as well as to the size of the animal different breeds of dogs are subject in different degrees to various diseases they certainly become adapted to different climates under which they have long existed it is notorious that most of our best european breeds deteriorate in india 168 see youatt on the dog page 15 the veterinary london volume 11 page 235 the rev r everest 169 journal of as soc of bengal volume 3 page 19 believes that no one has succeeded in keeping the newfoundland dog long alive in india so it is according to lichtenstein 170 travels volume 2 page 15 even at the cape of good hope the thibet mastiff degenerates on the plains of india and can live only on the mountains 171 hodgson in journal of as soc of bengal volume 1 page 342 lloyd 172 field sports of the north of europe volume 2 page 165 asserts that our bloodhounds and bulldogs have been tried and cannot withstand the cold of the northern european forests  seeing in how many characters the races of the dog differ from each other and remembering cuviers admission that their skulls differ more than do those of the species of any natural genus and bearing in mind how closely the bones of wolves jackals foxes and other canidae agree it is remarkable that we meet with the statement repeated over and over again that the races of the dog differ in no important characters a highly competent judge prof gervais 173 hist nat des mammif 1855 tome 2 pages 66 67 admits si lon prenait sans controle les alterations dont chacun de ces organes est susceptible on pourrait croire quil y a entre les chiens domestiques des differences plus grandes que celles qui separent ailleurs les especes quelquefois meme les genres some of the differences above enumerated are in one respect of comparatively little value for they are not characteristic of distinct breeds no one pretends that such is the case with the additional molar teeth or with the number of mammae the additional digit is generally present with mastiffs and some of the more important differences in the skull and lower jaw are more or less characteristic of various breeds but we must not forget that the predominant power of selection has not been applied in any of these cases we have variability in important parts but the differences have not been fixed by selection man cares for the form and fleetness of his greyhounds for the size of his mastiffs and formerly for the strength of the jaw in his bulldogs etc but he cares nothing about the number of their molar teeth or mammae or digits nor do we know that differences in these organs are correlated with or owe their development to differences in other parts of the body about which man does care those who have attended to the subject of selection will admit that nature having given variability man if he so chose could fix five toes to the hinder feet of certain breeds of dogs as certainly as to the feet of his dorking fowls he could probably fix but with much more difficulty an additional pair of molar teeth in either jaw in the same way as he has given additional horns to certain breeds of sheep if he wished to produce a toothless breed of dogs having the socalled turkish dog with its imperfect teeth to work on he could probably do so for he has succeeded in making hornless breeds of cattle and sheep  with respect to the precise causes and steps by which the several races of dogs have come to differ so greatly from each other we are as in most other cases profoundly ignorant we may attribute part of the difference in external form and constitution to inheritance from distinct wild stocks that is to changes effected under nature before domestication we must attribute something to the crossing of the several domestic and natural races i shall however soon recur to the crossing of races we have already seen how often savages cross their dogs with wild native species and pennant gives a curious account 174 history of quadrupeds 1793 volume 1 page 238 of the manner in which fochabers in scotland was stocked with a multitude of curs of a most wolfish aspect from a single hybridwolf brought into that district  it would appear that climate to a certain extent directly modifies the forms of dogs we have lately seen that several of our english breeds cannot live in india and it is positively asserted that when bred there for a few generations they degenerate not only in their mental faculties but in form captain williamson 175 oriental field sports quoted by youatt the dog page 15 who carefully attended to this subject states that hounds are the most rapid in their decline greyhounds and pointers also rapidly decline but spaniels after eight or nine generations and without a cross from europe are as good as their ancestors dr falconer informs me that bulldogs which have been known when first brought into the country to pin down even an elephant by its trunk not only fall off after two or three generations in pluck and ferocity but lose the underhung character of their lower jaws their muzzles become finer and their bodies lighter english dogs imported into india are so valuable that probably due care has been taken to prevent their crossing with native dogs so that the deterioration cannot be thus accounted for the rev r everest informs me that he obtained a pair of setters born in india which perfectly resembled their scotch parents he raised several litters from them in delhi taking the most stringent precautions to prevent a cross but he never succeeded though this was only the second generation in india in obtaining a single young dog like its parents in size or make their nostrils were more contracted their noses more pointed their size inferior and their limbs more slender so again on the coast of guinea dogs according to bosman alter strangely their ears grow long and stiff like those of foxes to which colour they also incline so that in three or four years they degenerate into very ugly creatures and in three or four broods their barking turns into a howl 176 a murray gives this passage in his geographical distribution of mammals 4to 1866 page 8 this remarkable tendency to rapid deterioration in european dogs subjected to the climate of india and africa may be largely accounted for by reversion to a primordial condition which many animals exhibit as we shall hereafter see when their constitutions are in any way disturbed  some of the peculiarities characteristic of the several breeds of the dog have probably arisen suddenly and though strictly inherited may be called monstrosities for instance the shape of the legs and body in the turnspit of europe and india the shape of the head and the underhanging jaw in the bulland pugdog so alike in this one respect and so unlike in all others a peculiarity suddenly arising and therefore in one sense deserving to be called a monstrosity may however be increased and fixed by mans selection we can hardly doubt that longcontinued training as with the greyhound in coursing hares as with waterdogs in swimmingand the want of exercise in the case of lapdogsmust have produced some direct effect on their structure and instincts but we shall immediately see that the most potent cause of change has probably been the selection both methodical and unconscious of slight individual differencesthe latter kind of selection resulting from the occasional preservation during hundreds of generations of those individual dogs which were the most useful to man for certain purposes and under certain conditions of life in a future chapter on selection i shall show that even barbarians attend closely to the qualities of their dogs this unconscious selection by man would be aided by a kind of natural selection for the dogs of savages have partly to gain their own subsistence for instance in australia as we hear from mr nind 177 quoted by mr galton domestication of animals page 13 the dogs are sometimes compelled by want to leave their masters and provide for themselves but in a few days they generally return and we may infer that dogs of different shapes sizes and habits would have the best chance of surviving under different circumstanceson open sterile plains where they have to run down their own preyon rocky coasts where they have to feed on crabs and fish left in the tidal pools as in the case of new guinea and tierra del fuego in this latter country as i am informed by mr bridges the catechist to the mission the dogs turn over the stones on the shore to catch the crustaceans which lie beneath and they are clever enough to knock off the shellfish at a first blow for if this be not done shellfish are wellknown to have an almost invincible power of adhesion  it has already been remarked that dogs differ in the degree to which their feet are webbed in dogs of the newfoundland breed which are eminently aquatic in their habits the skin according to isidore geoffroy 178 hist nat gen tome 3 page 450 extends to the third phalanges whilst in ordinary dogs it extends only to the second in two newfoundland dogs which i examined when the toes were stretched apart and viewed on the under side the skin extended in a nearly straight line between the outer margins of the balls of the toes whereas in two terriers of distinct sub breeds the skin viewed in the same manner was deeply scooped out in canada there is a dog which is peculiar to the country and common there and this has halfwebbed feet and is fond of the water 179 mr greenhow on the canadian dog in loudons mag of nat hist volume 6 1833 page 511 english otterhounds are said to have webbed feet a friend examined for me the feet of two in comparison with the feet of some harriers and bloodhounds he found the skin variable in extent in all but more developed in the otterhounds than in the others 180 see mr co groomnapier on the webbing of the hind feet of otterhounds in land and water october 13 1866 page 270 as aquatic animals which belong to quite different orders have webbed feet there can be no doubt that this structure would be serviceable to dogs that frequent the water we may confidently infer that no man ever selected his waterdogs by the extent to which the skin was developed between their toes but what he does is to preserve and breed from those individuals which hunt best in the water or best retrieve wounded game and thus he unconsciously selects dogs with feet slightly better webbed the effects of use from the frequent stretching apart of the toes will likewise aid in the result man thus closely imitates natural selection we have an excellent illustration of this same process in north america where according to sir j richardson 181 fauna borealiamericana 1829 page 62 all the wolves foxes and aboriginal domestic dogs have their feet broader than in the corresponding species of the old world and well calculated for running on the snow now in these arctic regions the life or death of every animal will often depend on its success in hunting over the snow when soft and this will in part depend on the feet being broad yet they must not be so broad as to interfere with the activity of the animal when the ground is sticky or with its power of burrowing holes or with other necessary habits of life  as changes in domestic breeds which take place so slowly are not to be noticed at any one period whether due to the selection of individual variations or of differences resulting from crosses are most important in understanding the origin of our domestic productions and likewise in throwing indirect light on the changes effected under nature i will give in detail such cases as i have been able to collect lawrence 182 the horse in all his varieties etc 1829 pages 230 234 who paid particular attention to the history of the foxhound writing in 1829 says that between eighty and ninety years before an entirely new foxhound was raised through the breeders art the ears of the old southern hound being reduced the bone and bulk lightened the waist increased in length and the stature somewhat added to it is believed that this was effected by a cross with a greyhound with respect to this latter dog youatt 183 the dog 1845 pages 31 35 with respect to king charles spaniel page 45 for the setter page 90 who is generally cautious in his statements says that the greyhound within the last fifty years that is before the commencement of the present century assumed a somewhat different character from that which he once possessed he is now distinguished by a beautiful symmetry of form of which he could not once boast and he has even superior speed to that which he formerly exhibited he is no longer used to struggle with deer but contends with his fellows over a shorter and speedier course an able writer 184 in the encyclop of rural sports page 557 believes that our english greyhounds are the descendants progressively improved of the large rough greyhounds which existed in scotland so early as the third century a cross at some former period with the italian greyhound has been suspected but this seems hardly probable considering the feebleness of this latter breed lord orford as is wellknown crossed his famous greyhounds which failed in courage with a bulldogthis breed being chosen from being erroneously supposed to be deficient in the power of scent after the sixth or seventh generation says youatt there was not a vestige left of the form of the bulldog but his courage and indomitable perseverance remained  youatt infers from a comparison of an old picture of king charless spaniels with the living dog that the breed of the present day is materially altered for the worse the muzzle has become shorter the forehead more prominent and the eyes larger the changes in this case have probably been due to simple selection the setter as this author remarks in another place is evidently the large spaniel improved to his present peculiar size and beauty and taught another way of marking his game if the form of the dog were not sufficiently satisfactory on this point we might have recourse to history he then refers to a document dated 1685 bearing on this subject and adds that the pure irish setter shows no signs of a cross with the pointer which some authors suspect has been the case with the english setter the bulldog is an english breed and as i hear from mr gr jesse 185 author of researches into the history of the british dog seems to have originated from the mastiff since the time of shakspeare but certainly existed in 1631 as shown by prestwick eatons letters there can be no doubt that the fancy bulldogs of the present day now that they are not used for bullbaiting have become greatly reduced in size without any express intention on the part of the breeder our pointers are certainly descended from a spanish breed as even their present names don ponto carlos etc show it is said that they were not known in england before the revolution in 1688 186 see col hamilton smith on the antiquity of the pointer in nat lib volume 10 page 196 but the breed since its introduction has been much modified for mr borrow who is a sportsman and knows spain intimately well informs me that he has not seen in that country any breed corresponding in figure with the english pointer but there are genuine pointers near xeres which have been imported by english gentlemen a nearly parallel case is offered by the newfoundland dog which was certainly brought into england from that country but which has since been so much modified that as several writers have observed it does not now closely resemble any existing native dog in newfoundland 187 the newfoundland dog is believed to have originated from a cross between the esquimaux dog and a large french hound see dr hodgkin british assoc 1844 bechstein naturgesch deutschland b 1 s 574 nat lib volume 10 page 132 also mr jukes excursion in and about newfoundland  these several cases of slow and gradual changes in our english dogs possess some interest for though the changes have generally but not invariably been caused by one or two crosses with a distinct breed yet we may feel sure from the wellknown extreme variability of crossed breeds that rigorous and longcontinued selection must have been practised in order to improve them in a definite manner as soon as any strain or family became slightly improved or better adapted to alter circumstances it would tend to supplant the older and less improved strains for instance as soon as the old foxhound was improved by a cross with the greyhound or by simple selection and assumed its present characterand the change was probably desired owing to the increased fleetness of our huntersit rapidly spread throughout the country and is now everywhere nearly uniform but the process of improvement is still going on for every one tries to improve his strain by occasionally procuring dogs from the best kennels through this process of gradual substitution the old english hound has been lost and so it has been with the irish wolfdog the old english bulldog and several other breeds such as the alaunt as i am informed by mr jesse but the extinction of former breeds is apparently aided by another cause for whenever a breed is kept in scanty numbers as at present with the bloodhound it is reared with some difficulty apparently from the evil effects of longcontinued close interbreeding as several breeds of the dog have been slightly but sensibly modified within so short a period as the last one or two centuries by the selection of the best individuals modified in many cases by crosses with other breeds and as we shall hereafter see that the breeding of dogs was attended to in ancient times as it still is by savages we may conclude that we have in selection even if only occasionally practised a potent means of modification  domestic cats  cats have been domesticated in the east from an ancient period mr blyth informs me that they are mentioned in a sanskrit writing 2000 years old and in egypt their antiquity is known to be even greater as shown by monumental drawings and their mummied bodies these mummies according to de blainville 188 de blainville osteographie felis page 65 on the character of f caligulata pages 85 89 90 175 on the other mummied species he quotes ehrenberg on f maniculata being mummied who has particularly studied the subject belong to no less than three species namely f caligulata bubastes and chaus the two former species are said to be still found both wild and domesticated in parts of egypt f caligulata presents a difference in the first inferior milk molar tooth as compared with the domestic cats of europe which makes de blainville conclude that it is not one of the parentforms of our cats several naturalists as pallas temminck blyth believe that domestic cats are the descendants of several species commingled it is certain that cats cross readily with various wild species and it would appear that the character of the domestic breeds has at least in some cases been thus affected sir w jardine has no doubt that in the north of scotland there has been occasional crossing with our native species f sylvestris and that the result of these crosses has been kept in our houses i have seen he adds many cats very closely resembling the wild cat and one or two that could scarcely be distinguished from it mr blyth 189 asiatic soc of calcutta curators report august 1856 the passage from sir w jardine is quoted from this report mr blyth who has especially attended to the wild and domestic cats of india has given in this report a very interesting discussion on their origin remarks on this passage but such cats are never seen in the southern parts of england still as compared with any indian tame cat the affinity of the ordinary british cat to f sylvestris is manifest and due i suspect to frequent intermixture at a time when the tame cat was first introduced into britain and continued rare while the wild species was far more abundant than at present in hungary jeitteles 190 fauna hungariae sup 1862 s 12 was assured on trustworthy authority that a wild male cat crossed with a female domestic cat and that the hybrids long lived in a domesticated state in algiers the domestic cat has crossed with the wild cat f lybica of that country 191 isid geoffroy sainthilaire hist nat gen tome 3 page 177 in south africa as mr e layard informs me the domestic cat intermingles freely with the wild f caffra he has seen a pair of hybrids which were quite tame and particularly attached to the lady who brought them up and mr fry has found that these hybrids are fertile in india the domestic cat according to mr blyth has crossed with four indian species with respect to one of these species f chaus an excellent observer sir w elliot informs me that he once killed near madras a wild brood which were evidently hybrids from the domestic cat these young animals had a thick lynxlike tail and the broad brown bar on the inside of the forearm characteristic of f chaus sir w elliot adds that he has often observed this same mark on the forearms of domestic cats in india mr blyth states that domestic cats coloured nearly like f chaus but not resembling that species in shape abound in bengal he adds such a colouration is utterly unknown in european cats and the proper tabby markings pale streaks on a black ground peculiarly and symmetrically disposed so common in english cats are never seen in those of india dr d short has assured mr blyth 192 proc zoolog soc 1863 page 184 that at hansi hybrids between the common cat and f ornata or torquata occur and that many of the domestic cats of that part of india were undistinguishable from the wild f ornata azara states but only on the authority of the inhabitants that in paraguay the cat has crossed with two native species from these several cases we see that in europe asia africa and america the common cat which lives a freer life than most other domesticated animals has crossed with various wild species and that in some instances the crossing has been sufficiently frequent to affect the character of the breed  whether domestic cats have descended from several distinct species or have only been modified by occasional crosses their fertility as far as is known is unimpaired the large angora or persian cat is the most distinct in structure and habits of all the domestic breeds and is believed by pallas but on no distinct evidence to be descended from the f manul of middle asia and i am assured by mr blyth that the angora cat breeds freely with indian cats which as we have already seen have apparently been much crossed with f chaus in england halfbred angora cats are perfectly fertile with one another  within the same country we do not meet with distinct races of the cat as we do of dogs and of most other domestic animals though the cats of the same country present a considerable amount of fluctuating variability the explanation obviously is that from their nocturnal and rambling habits indiscriminate crossing cannot without much trouble be prevented selection cannot be brought into play to produce distinct breeds or to keep those distinct which have been imported from foreign lands on the other hand in islands and in countries completely separated from each other we meet with breeds more or less distinct and these cases are worth giving showing that the scarcity of distinct races in the same country is not caused by a deficiency of variability in the animal the tailless cats of the isle of man are said to differ from common cats not only in the want of a tail but in the greater length of their hind legs in the size of their heads and in habits the creole cat of antigua as i am informed by mr nicholson is smaller and has a more elongated head than the british cat in ceylon as mr thwaites writes to me every one at first notices the different appearance of the native cat from the english animal it is of small size with closely lying hairs its head is small with a receding forehead but the ears are large and sharp altogether it has what is there called a lowcaste appearance rengger 193 saugethiere von paraguay 1830 s 212 says that the domestic cat which has been bred for 300 years in paraguay presents a striking difference from the european cat it is smaller by a fourth has a more lanky body its hair is short shining scanty and lies close especially on the tail he adds that the change has been less at ascension the capital of paraguay owing to the continual crossing with newly imported cats and this fact well illustrates the importance of separation the conditions of life in paraguay appear not to be highly favourable to the cat for though they have run halfwild they do not become thoroughly feral like so many other european animals in another part of south america according to roulin 194 mem presentes par divers savans acad roy des sciences tome 6 page 346 gomara first noticed this fact in 1554 the introduced cat has lost the habit of uttering its hideous nocturnal howl the rev wd fox purchased a cat in portsmouth which he was told came from the coast of guinea its skin was black and wrinkled fur bluishgrey and short its ears rather bare legs long and whole aspect peculiar this negro cat was fertile with common cats on the opposite coast of africa at mombas captain owen rn 195 narrative of voyages volume 2 page 180 states that all the cats are covered with short stiff hair instead of fur he gives a curious account of a cat from algoa bay which had been kept for some time on board and could be identified with certainty this animal was left for only eight weeks at mombas but during that short period it underwent a complete metamorphosis having parted with its sandycoloured fur a cat from the cape of good hope has been described by desmarest as remarkable from a red stripe extending along the whole length of its back throughout an immense area namely the malayan archipelago siam pegu and burmah all the cats have truncated tails about half the proper length 196 j crawfurd descript dict of the indian islands page 255 the madagascar cat is said to have a twisted tail see desmarest in encyclop nat mamm 1820 page 233 for some of the other breeds often with a sort of knot at the end in the caroline archipelago the cats have very long legs and are of a reddishyellow colour 197 admiral lutkes voyage volume 3 page 308 in china a breed has drooping ears at tobolsk according to gmelin there is a redcoloured breed in asia also we find the wellknown angora or persian breed  the domestic cat has run wild in several countries and everywhere assumes as far as can be judged by the short recorded descriptions a uniform character near maldonado in la plata i shot one which seemed perfectly wild it was carefully examined by mr waterhouse 198 zoology of the voyage of the beagle mammalia page 20 dieffenbach travels in new zealand volume 2 page 185 ch st john wild sports of the highlands 1846 page 40 who found nothing remarkable in it excepting its great size in new zealand according to dieffenbach the feral cats assume a streaky grey colour like that of wild cats and this is the case with the halfwild cats of the scotch highlands  we have seen that distant countries possess distinct domestic races of the cat the differences may be in part due to descent from several aboriginal species or at least to crosses with them in some cases as in paraguay mombas and antigua the differences seem due to the direct action of different conditions of life in other cases some slight effect may possibly be attributed to natural selection as cats in many cases have largely to support themselves and to escape diverse dangers but man owing to the difficulty of pairing cats has done nothing by methodical selection and probably very little by unintentional selection though in each litter he generally saves the prettiest and values most a good breed of mouse or ratcatchers those cats which have a strong tendency to prowl after game generally get destroyed by traps as cats are so much petted a breed bearing the same relation to other cats that lapdogs bear to larger dogs would have been much valued and if selection could have been applied we should certainly have had many breeds in each longcivilised country for there is plenty of variability to work upon  we see in this country considerable diversity in size some in the proportions of the body and extreme variability in colouring i have only lately attended to this subject but have already heard of some singular cases of variation one of a cat born in the west indies toothless and remaining so all its life mr tegetmeier has shown me the skull of a female cat with its canines so much developed that they protruded uncovered beyond the lips the tooth with the fang being 95 and the part projecting from the gum 6 of an inch in length i have heard of several families of sixtoed cats in one of which the peculiarity had been transmitted for at least three generations the tail varies greatly in length i have seen a cat which always carried its tail flat on its back when pleased the ears vary in shape and certain strains in england inherit a pencillike tuft of hairs above a quarter of an inch in length on the tips of their ears and this same peculiarity according to mr blyth characterises some cats in india the great variability in the length of the tail and the lynxlike tufts of hairs on the ears are apparently analogous to differences in certain wild species of the genus a much more important difference according to daubenton 199 quoted by isid geoffroy hist nat gen tome 3 page 427 is that the intestines of domestic cats are wider and a third longer than in wild cats of the same size and this apparently has been by their less strictly carnivorous diet   chapter 1ii  horses and

eight other living species of the genus equus  of individual variations not known to characterise particular breeds and not great or injurious enough to be called monstrosities i have not collected

ribs on each side is properly eighteen but youatt 25 the veterinary london volume 5 page 543 asserts that not unfrequently there are nineteen the additional one being always the posterior rib it is a remarkable fact that the ancient indian horse is said in the rigveda to have only seventeen ribs and m pietrement 26 memoire sur les chevaux a trentequatre cotes 1871 who has called attention to this subject gives various reasons for placing full trust in this statement more especially as during former times the hindoos carefully counted the bones of animals i have seen several notices of variations in the bones of the leg thus mr price 27 proc veterinary assoc in the veterinary volume 13 page 42 speaks of an additional bone in the hock and of certain abnormal appearances between the tibia and astragalus as quite common in irish horses and not due to disease horses have often been observed according to m gaudry 28 bulletin de la soc geolog tome 22 1866 page 22 to possess a trapezium and a rudiment of a fifth metacarpal bone so that one sees appearing by monstrosity in the foot of the horse structures which normally exist in the foot of the hipparionan allied and extinct animal in various countries hornlike projections have been observed on the frontal bones of the horse in one case described by mr percival they arose about two inches above the orbital processes and were very like those in a calf from five to six months old being from half to three quarters of an inch in length 29 mr percival of the enniskillen dragoons in the veterinary volume 1 page 224 see azara des quadrupedes du paraguay tome 2 page 313 the french translator of azara refers to other cases mentioned by huzard as having occurred in spain azara has described two cases in south america in which the projections were between three and four inches in length other instances have occurred in spain  that there has been much inherited variation in the horse cannot be doubted when we reflect on the number of the breeds existing throughout the world or even within the same country and when we know that they have largely increased in number since the earliest known records 210 godron de lespece tome 1 page 378 even in so fleeting a character as colour hofacker 211 ueber die eigenschaften etc 1828 s 10 found that out of 216 cases in which horses of the same colour were paired only eleven pairs produced foals of a quite different colour as professor low 212 domesticated animals of the british islands pages 527 532 in all the veterinary treatises and papers which i have read the writers insist in the strongest terms on the inheritance by the horse of all good and bad tendencies and qualities perhaps the principle of inheritance is not really stronger in the horse than in any other animal but from its value the tendency has been more carefully observed has remarked the english racehorse offers the best possible evidence of inheritance the pedigree of a racehorse is of more value in judging of its probable success than its appearance king herod gained in prizes 201505 pounds sterling and begot 497 winners eclipse begot 334 winners  whether the whole amount of difference between the various breeds has arisen under domestication is doubtful from the fertility of the most distinct breeds 213 andrew knight crossed breeds so different in size as a drayhorse and norwegian pony see a walker on intermarriage 1838 page 205 when crossed naturalists have generally looked at all the breeds as having descended from a single species few will agree with colonel h smith who believes that they have descended from no less than five primitive and differently coloured stocks 214 nat library horses volume 12 page 208 but as several species and varieties of the horse existed 215 gervais hist nat mamm tome 2 page 143 owen british fossil mammals page 383 during the later tertiary periods and as rutimeyer found differences in the size and form of the skull in the earliest known domesticated horses 216 kenntniss der fossilen pferde 1863 s 131 we ought not to feel sure that all our breeds are descended from a single species the savages of north and south america easily reclaim the feral horses so that there is no improbability in savages in various quarters of the world having domesticated more than one native species or natural race m sanson 217 comptes rendus 1866 page 485 and journal de lanat et de la phys mai 1868 thinks that he has proved that two distinct species have been domesticated one in the east and one in north africa and that these differed in the number of their lumbar vertebra and in various other parts but m sanson seems to believe that osteological characters are subject to very little variation which is certainly a mistake at present no aboriginal or truly wild horse is positively known to exist for it is commonly believed that the wild horses of the east are escaped domestic animals 218 mr wcl martin the horse 1845 page 34 in arguing against the belief that the wild eastern horses are merely feral has remarked on the improbability of man in ancient times having extirpated a species in a region where it can now exist in numbers if therefore our domestic breeds are descended from several species or natural races all have become extinct in the wild state  with respect to the causes of the modifications which horses have undergone the conditions of life seem to produce a considerable direct effect mr d forbes who has had excellent opportunities of comparing the horses of spain with those of south america informs me that the horses of chile which have lived under nearly the same conditions as their progenitors in andalusia remain unaltered whilst the pampas horses and the puno horses are considerably modified there can be no doubt that horses become greatly reduced in size and altered in appearance by living on mountains and islands and this apparently is due to want of nutritious or varied food every one knows how small and rugged the ponies are on the northern islands and on the mountains of europe corsica and sardinia have their native ponies and there were 219 transact maryland academy volume 1 part 1 page 28 or still are on some islands on the coast of virginia ponies like those of the shetland islands which are believed to have originated through exposure to unfavourable conditions the puno ponies which inhabit the lofty regions of the cordillera are as i hear from mr d forbes strange little creatures very unlike their spanish progenitors further south in the falkland islands the offspring of the horses imported in 1764 have already so much deteriorated in size 220 mr mackinnon the falkland islands page 25 the average height of the falkland horses is said to be 14 hands 2 inches see also my journal of researches and strength that they are unfitted for catching wild cattle with the lasso so that fresh horses have to be brought for this purpose from la plata at a great expense the reduced size of the horses bred on both southern and northern islands and on several mountainchains can hardly have been caused by the cold as a similar reduction has occurred on the

retains the instinct of scraping it away to get at the herbage beneath the wild tarpans in the east have this instinct and so it is as i am informed by admiral sulivan with the horses recently and formerly introduced into the falkland islands from la plata some of which have run wild this latter fact is remarkable as the progenitors of these horses could not have followed this instinct during many generations in la plata on the other hand the wild cattle of the falklands never scrape away the snow and perish when the ground is long covered in the northern parts of america the horses descended from those introduced by the spanish conquerors of mexico have the same habit as have the native bisons but not so the cattle introduced from europe 222 franklin narrative volume 1 page 87 note by sir j richardson  the horse can flourish under intense heat as well as under intense cold for he is known to come to the highest perfection though not attaining a large size in arabia and northern africa much humidity is apparently more injurious to the horse than heat or cold in the falkland islands horses suffer much from the dampness and this circumstance may perhaps partly account for the singular fact that to the eastward of the bay of bengal 223 mr jh moor notices of the indian archipelago singapore 1837 page 189 a pony from java was sent athenaeum 1842 page 718 to the queen

large part of china no fullsized horse is found when we advance as far eastward as japan the horse reacquires his full size 224 j crawfurd history of the horse journal of royal united service institution volume 4  with most of our domesticated animals some breeds are kept on account of their curiosity or beauty but the horse is valued almost solely for its utility hence semimonstrous breeds are not preserved and probably all the existing breeds have been slowly formed either by the direct action of the conditions of life or through the selection of individual differences no doubt semimonstrous breeds might have been formed thus mr waterton records 225 essays on natural history 2nd series page 161 the case of a mare which produced successively three foals without tails so that a tailless race might have been formed like the tailless races of dogs and cats a russian breed of horses is said to have curled hair and azara 226 quadrupedes du paraguay tome 2 page 333 dr canfield informs me that a breed with curly hair was formed by selection at los angeles in north america relates that in paraguay horses are occasionally born but are generally destroyed with hair like that on the head of a negro and this peculiarity is transmitted even to halfbreeds it is a curious case of correlation that such horses have short manes and tails and their hoofs are of a peculiar shape like those of a mule  it is scarcely possible to doubt that the longcontinued selection of qualities serviceable to man has been the chief agent in the formation of the several breeds of the horse look at a drayhorse and see how well adapted he is to draw heavy weights and how unlike in appearance to any allied wild animal the english racehorse is known to be derived from the commingled blood of arabs turks and barbs but selection which was carried on during very early times in england 227 see the evidence on this head in land and water may 2 1868 together with training have made him a very different animal from his parentstocks as a writer in india who evidently knows the pure arab well asks who now looking at our present breed of racehorses could have conceived that they were the result of the union of the arab horse and african mare the improvement is so marked that in running for the goodwood cup the first descendants of arabian turkish and persian horses are allowed a discount of 18 pounds weight and when both parents are of these countries a discount of 36 pounds 228 prof low domesticated animals page 546 with respect to the writer in india see india sporting review volume 2 page 181 as lawrence has remarked the horse page 9 perhaps no instance has ever occurred of a threepart bred horse ie a horse one of whose grandparents was of impure blood saving his distance in running two miles with thoroughbred racers some few instances are on record of seveneights racers having been successful it is notorious that the arabs have long been as careful about the pedigree of their horses as we are and this implies great and continued care in breeding seeing what has been done in england by careful breeding can we doubt that the arabs must likewise have produced during the course of centuries a marked effect on the qualities of their horses but we may go much farther back in time for in the bible we hear of studs carefully kept for breeding and of horses imported at high prices from various countries 229 prof gervais hist nat mamm tome 2 page 144 has collected many facts on this head for instance solomon 1 kings x 28 bought horses in egypt at a high price we may therefore conclude that whether or not the various existing breeds of the horse have proceeded from one or more aboriginal stocks yet that a great amount of change has resulted from the direct action of the conditions of life and probably a still greater amount from the longcontinued selection by man of slight individual differences  with several domesticated quadrupeds and birds certain coloured marks are either strongly inherited or tend to reappear after having been lost for a long time as this subject will hereafter be seen to be of importance i will give a full account of the colouring of horses all english breeds however unlike in size and appearance and several of those in india and the malay archipelago present a similar range and diversity of colour the english racehorse however is said 230 the field july 13 1861 page 42 never to be duncoloured but as dun and creamcoloured horses are considered by the arabs as worthless and fit only for jews to ride 231 e vernon harcourt sporting in algeria page 26 these tints may have been removed by longcontinued selection horses of every colour and of such widely different kinds as drayhorses cobs and ponies are all occasionally dappled 232 i state this from my own observations made during several years on the colours of horses i have seen creamcoloured lightdun and mousedun horses dappled which i mention because it has been stated martin history of the horse page 134 that duns are never dappled martin page 205 refers to dappled asses in the farrier london 1828 pages 453 455 there are some good remarks on the dappling of horses and likewise in col hamilton smith on the horse in the same manner as is so conspicuous with grey horses this fact does not throw any clear light on the colouring of the aboriginal horse but is a case of analogous variation for even asses are sometimes dappled and i have seen in the british museum a hybrid from the ass and zebra dappled on its hinder quarters by the expression analogous variation and it is one that i shall often have occasion to use i mean a variation occurring in a species or variety which resembles a normal character in another and distinct species or variety analogous variations may arise as will be explained in a future chapter from two or more forms with a similar constitution having been exposed to similar conditionsor from one of two forms having reacquired through reversion a character inherited by the other form from their common progenitoror from both forms having reverted to the same ancestral character we shall immediately see that horses occasionally exhibit a tendency to become striped over a large part of their bodies and as we know that in the varieties of the domestic cat and in several feline species stripes readily pass into spots and cloudy markseven the cubs of the uniformlycoloured lion being spotted with dark marks on a lighter groundwe may suspect that the dappling of the horse which has been noticed by some authors with surprise is a modification or vestige of a tendency to become striped  figure 1 dun devonshire pony with shoulder spinal and leg stripes  this tendency in the horse to become striped is in several respects an interesting fact horses of all colours of the most diverse breeds in various parts of the world often have a dark stripe extending along the spine from the mane to the tail but this is so common that i need enter into no particulars 233 some details are given in the farrier 1828 pages 452 455 one of the smallest ponies i ever saw of the colour of a mouse had a conspicuous spinal stripe a small indian chestnut pony had the same stripe as had a remarkably heavy chestnut carthorse racehorses often have the spinal stripe occasionally horses are transversely barred on the legs chiefly on the under side and more rarely they have a distinct stripe on the shoulder like that on the shoulder of the ass or a broad dark patch representing a stripe before entering on any details i must premise that the term duncoloured is vague and includes three groups of colours viz that between creamcolour and reddishbrown which graduates into lightbay or lightchestnutthis i believe is often called fallowdun secondly leaden or slatecolour or mousedun which graduates into an ashcolour and lastly darkdun between brown and black in england i have examined a rather large lightlybuilt fallowdun devonshire pony figure 1 with a conspicuous stripe along the back with light transverse stripes on the under sides of its front legs and with four parallel stripes on each shoulder of these four stripes the posterior one was very minute and faint the anterior one on the other hand was long and broad but interrupted in the middle and truncated at its lower extremity with the anterior angle produced into a long tapering point i mention this latter fact because the shoulderstripe of the ass occasionally presents exactly the same appearance i have had an outline and description sent to me of a small purelybred light fallowdun welch pony with a spinal stripe a single transverse stripe on each leg and three shoulderstripes the posterior stripe corresponding with that on the shoulder of the ass was the longest whilst the two anterior parallel stripes arising from the mane decreased in length in a reversed manner as compared with the shoulderstripes on the abovedescribed devonshire pony i have seen a bright fallowdun cob with its front legs transversely barred on the under sides in the most conspicuous manner also a dark leaden mousecoloured pony with similar leg stripes but much less conspicuous also a bright fallowdun colt fully threeparts thoroughbred with very plain transverse stripes on the legs also a chestnutdun cart horse with a conspicuous spinal stripe with distinct traces of shoulder stripes but none on the legs i could add other cases my son made a sketch for me of a large heavy belgian carthorse of a fallowdun with a conspicuous spinal stripe traces of legstripes and with two parallel three inches apart stripes about seven or eight inches in length on both shoulders i have seen another rather light carthorse of a dirty dark creamcolour with striped legs and on one shoulder a large illdefined dark cloudy patch and on the opposite shoulder two parallel faint stripes all the cases yet mentioned are duns of various tints but mr ww edwards has seen a nearly thoroughbred chestnut horse which had the spinal stripe and distinct bars on the legs and i have seen two bay carriagehorses with black spinal stripes one of these horses had on each shoulder a light shoulderstripe and the other had a broad back illdefined stripe running obliquely halfway down each shoulder neither had legstripes  the most interesting case which i have met with occurred in a colt of my own breeding a bay mare descended from a darkbrown flemish mare by a light grey turcoman horse was put to hercules a thoroughbred dark bay whose sire kingston and dam were both bays the colt ultimately turned out brown but when only a fortnight old it was a dirty bay shaded with mousegrey and in parts with a yellowish tint it had only a trace of the spinal stripe with a few obscure transverse bars on the legs but almost the whole body was marked with very narrow dark stripes in most parts so obscure as to be visible only in certain lights like the stripes which may be seen on black kittens these stripes were distinct on the hindquarters where they diverged from the spine and pointed a little forwards many of them as they diverged became a little branched exactly in the same manner as in some zebrine species the stripes were plainest on the forehead between the ears where they formed a set of pointed arches one under the other decreasing in size downwards towards the muzzle exactly similar marks may be seen on the forehead of the quagga and burchells zebra when this foal was two or three months old all the stripes entirely disappeared i have seen similar marks on the forehead of a fully grown fallowdun coblike horse having a conspicuous spinal stripe and with its front legs well barred  in norway the colour of the native horse or pony is dun varying from almost creamcolour to darkmouse dun and an animal is not considered purely bred unless it has the spinal and legstripes 234 i have received information through the kindness of the consulgeneral mr jr crowe from prof boeck rasck and esmarck on the colours of the norwegian ponies see also the field 1861 page 431 my son estimated that about a third of the ponies which he saw there had striped legs he counted seven stripes on the forelegs and two on the hindlegs of one pony only a few of them exhibited traces of shoulder stripes but i have heard of a cob imported from norway which had the shoulder as well as the other stripes well developed colonel h smith 235 col hamilton smith nat lib volume 12 page 275 alludes to dunhorses with the spinal stripe in the sierras of spain and the horses originally derived from spain in some parts of south america are now duns sir w elliot informs me that he inspected a herd of 300 south american horses imported into madras and many of these had transverse stripes on the legs and short shoulderstripes the most strongly marked individual of which a coloured drawing was sent me was a mousedun with the shoulderstripes slightly forked  in the northwestern parts of india striped horses of more than one breed are apparently commoner than in any other part of the world and i have received information respecting them from several officers especially from colonel poole colonel curtis major campbell brigadier st john and others the kattywar horses are often fifteen or sixteen hands in height and are well but lightly built they are of all colours but the several kinds of duns prevail and these are so generally striped that a horse without stripes is not considered pure colonel poole believes that all the duns have the spinal stripe the legstripes are generally present and he thinks that about half the horses have the shoulderstripe this stripe is sometimes double or treble on both shoulders colonel poole has often seen stripes on the cheeks and sides of the nose he has seen stripes on the grey and bay kattywars when first foaled but they soon faded away i have received other accounts of creamcoloured bay brown and grey kattywar horses being striped eastward of india the shan north of burmah ponies as i am informed by mr blyth have spinal leg and shoulder stripes sir w elliot informs me that he saw two bay pegu ponies with legstripes burmese and javanese ponies are frequently duncoloured and have the three kinds of stripes in the same degree as in england 236 mr g clark in annal and mag of nat history 2nd series volume 2 1848 page 363 mr wallace informs me that he saw in java a dun and claycoloured horse with spinal and leg stripes mr swinhoe informs me that he examined two light dun ponies of two chinese breeds viz those of shanghai and amoy both had the spinal stripe and the latter an indistinct shoulderstripe  we thus see that in all parts of the world breeds of the horse as different as possible when of a duncolour including under this term a wide range of tint from cream to dusty black and rarely when almost white tinged with yellow grey bay and chestnut have the several abovespecified stripes horses which are of a yellow colour with white mane and tail and which are sometimes called duns i have never seen with stripes 237 see also on this point the field july 27 1861 page 91  from reasons which will be apparent in the chapter on reversion i have endeavoured but with poor success to discover whether duns which are so much oftener striped than other coloured horses are ever produced from the crossing of two horses neither of which are duns most persons to whom i have applied believe that one parent must be dun and it is generally asserted that when this is the case the duncolour and the stripes are strongly inherited 238 the field 1861 pages 431 493 545 one case however has fallen under my own observation of a foal from a black mare by a bay horse which when fully grown was a dark fallowdun and had a narrow but plain spinal stripe hofacker 239 ueber die eigenschaften etc 1828 s 13 14 gives two instances of mouseduns mausrapp being produced from two parents of different colours and neither duns  the stripes of all kinds are generally plainer in the foal than in the adult horse being commonly lost at the first shedding of the hair 240 von nathusius vortrage uber viehzucht 1872 135 colonel poole believes that the stripes in the kattywar breed are plainest when the colt is first foaled they then become less and less distinct till after the first coat is shed when they come out as strongly as before but certainly often fade away as the age of the horse increases two other accounts confirm this fading of the stripes in old horses in india one writer on the other hand states that colts are often born without stripes but that they appear as the colt grows older three authorities affirm that in norway the stripes are less plain in the foal than in the adult in the case described by me of the young foal which was narrowly striped over nearly all its body there was no doubt about the early and complete disappearance of the stripes mr ww edwards examined for me twentytwo foals of racehorses and twelve had the spinal stripe more or less plain this fact and some other accounts which i have received lead me to believe that the spinal stripe often disappears in the english racehorse when old with natural species the young often exhibit characters which disappear at maturity  the stripes are variable in colour but are always darker than the rest of the body they do not by any means always coexist on the different parts of the body the legs may be striped without any shoulderstripe or the converse case which is rarer may occur but i have never heard of either shoulder or legstripes without the spinal stripe the latter is by far the commonest of all the stripes as might have been expected as it characterises the other seven or eight species of the genus it is remarkable that so trifling a character as the shoulderstripe being double or triple should occur in such different breeds as welch and devonshire ponies the shan pony heavy carthorses light south american horses and the lanky kattywar breed colonel hamilton smith believes that one of his five supposed primitive stocks was duncoloured and striped and that the stripes in all the other breeds result from ancient crosses with this one primitive dun but it is extremely improbable that different breeds living in such distant quarters of the world should all have been crossed with any one aboriginally distinct stock nor have we any reason to believe that the effects of a cross at a very remote period would be propagated for so many generations as is implied on this view  with respect to the primitive colour of the horse having been dun colonel hamilton smith 241 nat library volume 12 1841 pages 109 156 to 163 280 281 creamcolour passing into isabella ie the colour of the dirty linen of queen isabella seems to have been common in ancient times see also pallass account of the wild horses of the east who speaks of dun and brown as the prevalent colours in the icelandic sagas which were committed to writing in the twelfth century duncoloured horses with a black spinal stripe are mentioned see dasents translation volume 1 page 169 has collected a large body of evidence showing that this tint was common in the east as far back as the time of alexander and that the wild horses of western asia and eastern europe now are or recently were of various shades of dun it seems that not very long ago a wild breed of dun coloured horses with a spinal stripe was preserved in the royal parks in prussia i hear from hungary that the inhabitants of that country look at the duns with a spinal stripe as the aboriginal stock and so it is in norway duncoloured ponies are not rare in the mountainous parts of devonshire wales and scotland where the aboriginal breed would have the best chance of being preserved in south america in the time of azara when the horse had been feral for about 250 years 90 out of  100 horses were baichatains and the remaining ten were zains that is brown not more than one in 2000 being black in north america the feral horses show a strong tendency to become roans of various shades but in certain parts as i hear from dr canfield they are mostly duns and striped 242 azara quadrupedes du paraguay tome 2 page 307 in north america catlin volume 2 page 57 describes the wild horses believed to have descended from the spanish horses of mexico as of all colours black grey roan and roan pied with sorrel f michaux travels in north america english translation page 235 describes two wild horses from mexico as roan in the falkland islands where the horse has been feral only between 60 and 70 years i was told that roans and irongreys were the prevalent colours these several facts show that horses do not soon revert to any uniform colour  in the following chapters on the pigeon we shall see that a blue bird is occasionally produced by pure breeds of various colours and that when this occurs certain black marks invariably appear on the wings and tail so again when variously coloured breeds are crossed blue birds with the same black marks are frequently produced we shall further see that these facts are explained by and afford strong evidence in favour of the view that all the breeds are descended from the rockpigeon or columba livia which is thus coloured and marked but the appearance of the stripes on the various breeds of the horse when of a dun colour does not afford nearly such good evidence of their descent from a single primitive stock as in the case of the pigeon because no horse certainly wild is known as a standard of comparison because the stripes when they appear are variable in character because there is far from sufficient evidence that the crossing of distinct breeds produces stripes and lastly because all the species of the genus equus have the spinal stripe and several species have shoulder and leg stripes nevertheless the similarity in the most distinct breeds in their general range of colour in their dappling and in the occasional appearance especially in duns of legstripes and of double or triple shoulderstripes taken together indicate the probability of the descent of all the existing races from a single duncoloured more or less striped primitive stock to which our horses occasionally revert  the ass  four species of asses besides three zebras have been described by naturalists there is now little doubt that our domesticated animal is descended from the equus taeniopus of abyssinia 243 dr sclater in proc zoolog soc 1862 page 164 dr hartmann says annalen der landw b 44 page 222 that this animal in its wild state is not always striped across the legs the ass is sometimes advanced as an instance of an animal domesticated as we know by the old testament from an ancient period which has varied only in a very slight degree but this is by no means strictly true for in syria alone there are four breeds 244 wc martin history of the horse 1845 page 207 first a light and graceful animal with an agreeable gait used by ladies secondly an arab breed reserved exclusively for the saddle thirdly a stouter animal used for ploughing and various purposes and lastly the large damascus breed with a peculiarly long body and ears in the south of france also there are several breeds and one of extraordinary size some individuals being as tall as fullsized horses although the ass in england is by no means uniform in appearance distinct breeds have not been formed this may probably be accounted for by the animal being kept chiefly by poor persons who do not rear large numbers nor carefully match and select the young for as we shall see in a future chapter the ass can with ease be greatly improved in size and strength by careful selection combined no doubt with good food and we may infer that all its other characters would be equally amenable to selection the small size of the ass in england and northern europe is apparently due far more to want of care in breeding than to cold for in western india where the ass is used as a beast of burden by some of the lower castes it is not much larger than a newfoundland dog being generally not more than from twenty to thirty inches high 245 col sykes cat of mammalia proc zoolog soc july 12 1831 williamson oriental field sports volume 2 quoted by martin page 206  the ass varies greatly in colour and its legs especially the forelegs both in england and other countriesfor instance in chinaare occasionally barred more plainly than those of duncoloured horses thirteen or fourteen transverse stripes have been counted on both the fore and hind legs with the horse the occasional appearance of legstripes was accounted for by reversion to a supposed parentform and in the case of the ass we may confidently believe in this explanation as e taeniopus is known to be barred though only in a slight degree and not quite invariably the stripes are believed to occur most frequently and to be plainest on the legs of the domestic ass during early youth 246 blyth in charlesworths mag of nat hist vol 4 1840 page 83 i have also been assured by a breeder that this is the case as likewise occurs with the horse the shoulderstripe which is so eminently characteristic of the species is nevertheless variable in breadth length and manner of termination i have measured one four times as broad as another and some more than twice as long as others in one lightgrey ass the shoulder stripe was only six inches in length and as thin as a piece of string and in another animal of the same colour there was only a dusky shade representing a stripe i have heard of three white asses not albinoes with no trace of shoulder or spinal stripes 247 one case is given by martin the horse page 205 and i have seen nine other asses with no shoulderstripe and some of them had no spinal stripe three of the nine were lightgreys one a darkgrey another grey passing into reddishroan and the others were brown two being tinted on parts of their bodies with a reddish or bay shade if therefore grey and reddishbrown asses had been steadily selected and bred from the shoulder stripe would probably have been lost almost as generally and completely as in the case of the horse  the shoulder stripe on the ass is sometimes double and mr blyth has seen even three or four parallel stripes 248 journal as soc of bengal volume 28 1860 page 231 martin on the horse page 205 i have observed in ten cases shoulderstripes abruptly truncated at the lower end with the anterior angle produced into a tapering point precisely as in the above dun devonshire pony i have seen three cases of the terminal portion abruptly and angularly bent and have seen and heard of four cases of a distinct though slight forking of the stripe in syria dr hooker and his party observed for me no less than five similar instances of the shoulder stripe plainly bifurcating over the fore leg in the common mule it likewise sometimes bifurcates when i first noticed the forking and angular bending of the shoulderstripe i had seen enough of the stripes in the various equine species to feel convinced that even a character so unimportant as this had a distinct meaning and was thus led to attend to the subject i now find that in the e burchellii and quagga the stripe which corresponds with the shoulderstripe of the ass as well as some of the stripes on the neck bifurcate and that some of those near the shoulder have their extremities bent angularly backwards the bifurcation and angular bending of the stripes on the shoulders apparently are connected with the nearly upright stripes on the sides of the body and neck changing their direction and becoming transverse on the legs finally we see that the presence of shoulder leg and spinal stripes in the horse their occasional absence in the assthe occurrence of double and triple shoulderstripes in both animals and the similar manner in which these stripes terminate downwardsare all cases of analogous variation in the horse and ass these cases are probably not due to similar conditions acting on similar constitutions but to a partial reversion in colour to the common progenitor of the genus we shall hereafter return to this subject and discuss it more fully   chapter 1iii

semimonstrous breeds  goats remarkable variations of  the breeds of the pig have recently been more closely studied though much still remains to be done than those of almost any other domesticated animal this has been effected by hermann von nathusius in two admirable works especially in the later one on the skulls of the several races and by rutimeyer in his celebrated fauna of the ancient swiss lakedwellings 31 hermann von nathusius die racen des schweines berlin 1860 and vorstudien fur geschichte etc schweineschadel berlin 1864 rutimeyer die fauna der pfahlbauten basel 1861 nathusius has shown that all the known breeds may be divided into two great groups one resembling in all important respects and no doubt descended from the common wild boar so that this may be called the sus scrofa group the other group differs in several important and constant osteological characters its wild parent form is unknown the name given to it by nathusius according to the law of priority is sus indicus of pallas this name must now be followed though an unfortunate one as the wild aboriginal does not inhabit india and the bestknown domesticated breeds have been imported from siam and china  first for the sus scrofa breeds or those resembling the common wild boar these still exist according to nathusius schweineschadel s 75 in various parts of central and northern europe formerly every kingdom 32 nathusius die racen des schweines berlin 1860 an excellent appendix is given with references to published and trustworthy drawings of the breeds of each country and almost every province in britain possessed its own native breed but these are now everywhere rapidly disappearing being replaced by improved breeds crossed with the s indicus form the skull in the breeds of the s scrofa type resembles in all important respects that of the european wild boar but it has become schweineschadel s 6368 higher and broader relatively to its length and the hinder part is more upright the differences however are all variable in degree the breeds which thus resemble s scrofa in their essential skull characters differ conspicuously from each other in other respects as in the length of the ears and legs curvature of the ribs colour hairiness size and proportions of the body  the wild sus scrofa has a wide range namely europe north africa as identified by osteological characters by rutimeyer and hindostan as similarly identified by nathusius but the wild boars inhabiting these several countries differ so much from each other in external characters that they have been ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct even within hindostan these animals according to mr blyth form very distinct races in the different districts in the n western provinces as i am informed by the rev r everest the boar never exceeds 36 inches in height whilst in bengal one has been measured 44 inches in height in europe northern africa and hindostan domestic pigs have been known to cross with the wild native species 33 for europe see bechstein naturgesch deutschlands 1801 b 1 s 505 several accounts have been published on the fertility of the offspring from wild and tame swine see

w elliot catalogue of mammalia madras journal of lit and science volume 10 page 219 sir walter elliot after describing the differences between wild indian and wild german boars remarks that the same differences are perceptible in the domesticated individuals of the two countries we may therefore conclude that the breeds of the sus scrofa type are descended from or have been modified by crossing with forms which may be ranked as geographical races but which according to some naturalists ought to be ranked as distinct species  pigs of the sus indicus type are best known to englishmen under the form of the chinese breed the skull of s indicus as described by nathusius differs from that of s scrofa in several minor respects as in its greater breadth and in some details in the teeth but chiefly in the shortness of the lachrymal bones in the greater width of the fore part of the palate bones and in the divergence of the premolar teeth it deserves especial notice that these latter characters are not gained even in the least degree by the domesticated forms of s scrofa after reading the remarks and descriptions given by nathusius it seems to me to be merely playing with words to doubt whether s indicus ought to be ranked as a species for the abovespecified differences are more strongly marked than any that can be pointed out between for instance the fox and the wolf or the ass and the horse as already stated s indicus is not known in a wild state but its domesticated forms according to nathusius come near to s vittatus of java and some allied species a pig found wild in the aru islands schweineschadel s 169 is apparently identical with s indicus but it is doubtful whether this is a truly native animal the domesticated breeds of china cochinchina and siam belong to this type the roman or neapolitan breed the andalusian the hungarian and the krause swine of nathusius inhabiting southeastern europe and turkey and having fine curly hair and the small swiss bundtnerschwein of rutimeyer all agree in their more important skullcharacters with s indicus and as is supposed have all been largely crossed with this form pigs of this type have existed during a long period on the shores of the mediterranean for a figure schweineschadel s 142 closely resembling the existing neapolitan pig was found in the buried city of herculaneum  rutimeyer has made the remarkable discovery that there lived contemporaneously in switzerland during the neolithic period two domesticated forms the s scrofa and the s scrofa palustris or torfschwein rutimeyer perceived that the latter approached the eastern breeds and according to nathusius it certainly belongs to the s indicus group but rutimeyer has subsequently shown that it differs in some well marked characters this author was formerly convinced that his torfschwein existed as a wild animal during the first part of the stone period and was domesticated during a later part of the same period 35 pfahlbauten s 163 et passim nathusius whilst he fully admits the curious fact first observed by rutimeyer that the bones of domesticated and wild animals can be distinguished by their different aspect yet from special difficulties in the case of the bones of the pig schweineschadel s 147 is not convinced of the truth of the above conclusion and rutimeyer himself seems now to feel some doubt other naturalists have also argued strongly on the same side as nathusius 36 see jw schutz interesting essay zur kenntniss des torfschweins 1868 this author believes that the torfschwein is descended from a distinct species the s sennariensis of central africa  several breeds differing in the proportions of the body in the length of the ears in the nature of the hair in colour etc come under the s indicus type nor is this surprising considering how ancient the domestication of this form has been both in europe and in china in this latter country the date is believed by an eminent chinese scholar 37 stan julien quoted by de blainville osteographie page 163 to go back at least 4900 years from the present time this same scholar alludes to the existence of many local varieties of the pig in china and at the present time the chinese take extraordinary pains in feeding and tending their pigs not even allowing them to walk from place to place 38 richardson pigs their origin etc page 26 hence these pigs as nathusius has remarked 39 die racen des schweines s 47 64 display in an eminent degree the characters of a highlycultivated race and hence no doubt their high value in the improvement of our european breeds nathusius makes a remarkable statement schweineschadel s 138 that the infusion of the 132nd or even of the 164th part of the blood of s indicus into a breed of s scrofa is sufficient plainly to modify the skull of the latter species this singular fact may perhaps be accounted for by several of the chief distinctive characters of s indicus such as the shortness of the lachrymal bones etc being common to several species of the genus for in crosses characters which are common to many species apparently tend to be prepotent over those appertaining to only a few species  figure 2 head of japan or masked pig copied from mr bartletts paper in proc zoolog soc 1861 page 263  the japan pig s pliciceps of gray which was formerly exhibited in the zoological gardens has an extraordinary appearance from its short head broad forehead and nose great fleshy ears and deeply furrowed skin figure 2 is copied from that given by mr bartlett 310 proc zoolog soc 1861 page 263 not only is the face furrowed but thick folds of skin which are harder than the other parts almost like the plates on the indian rhinoceros hang about the shoulders and rump it is coloured black with white feet and breeds true that it has long been domesticated there can be little doubt and this might have been inferred even from the fact that its young are not longitudinally striped for this is a character common to all the species included within the genus sus and the allied genera whilst in their natural state 311 sclater in proc zoolog soc february 26 1861 dr gray 312 proc zoolog soc 1862 page 13 the skull has since been described much more fully by professor lucae in a very interesting essay der schadel des maskenschweines 1870 he confirms the conclusion of von nathusius on the relationship of this kind of pig has described the skull of this animal which he ranks not only as a distinct species but places it in a distinct section of the genus nathusius however after his careful study of the whole group states positively schweineschadel s 153158 that the skull in all essential characters closely resembles that of the shorteared chinese breed of the s indicus type hence nathusius considers the japan pig as only a domesticated variety of s indicus if this really be the case it is a wonderful instance of the amount of modification which can be effected under domestication  formerly there existed in the central islands of the pacific ocean a singular breed of pigs these are described by the rev d tyerman and g bennett 313 journal of voyages and travels from 1821 to 1829 volume 1 page 300 as of small size humpbacked with a disproportionately long head with short ears turned backwards with a bushy tail not more than two inches in length placed as if it grew from the back within half a century after the introduction of european and chinese pigs into these islands the native breed according to the above authors became almost completely lost by being repeatedly crossed with them secluded islands as might have been expected seem favourable for the production or retention of peculiar breeds thus in the orkney islands the hogs have been described as very small with erect and sharp ears and with an appearance altogether different from the hogs brought from the south 314 rev g low fauna orcadensis page 10 see also dr hibberts account of the pig of the shetland islands  seeing how different the chinese pigs belonging to the sus indicus type are in their osteological characters and in external appearance from the pigs of the s scrofa type so that they must be considered specifically distinct it is a fact well deserving attention that chinese and common pigs have been repeatedly crossed in various manners with unimpaired fertility one great breeder who had used pure chinese pigs assured me that the fertility of the halfbreeds inter se and of their recrossed progeny was actually increased and this is the general belief of agriculturists again the japan pig or s pliciceps of gray is so distinct in appearance from all common pigs that it stretches ones belief to the utmost to admit that it is simply a domestic variety yet this breed has been found perfectly fertile with the berkshire breed and mr eyton informs me that he paired a halfbred brother and sister and found them quite fertile together  figure 3 head of wild boar and of golden days a pig of the yorkshire large breed the latter from a photograph copied from sidneys edition of the pig by youatt  the modification of the skull in the most highly cultivated races is wonderful to appreciate the amount of change nathusius work with its excellent figures should be studied the whole of the exterior in all its parts has been altered the hinder surface instead of sloping backwards is directed forwards entailing many changes in other parts the front of the head is deeply concave the orbits have a different shape the auditory meatus has a different direction and shape the incisors of the upper and lower jaws do not touch each other and they stand in both jaws beyond the plane of the molars the canines of the upper jaw stand in front of those of the lower jaw and this is a remarkable anomaly the articular surfaces of the occipital condyles are so greatly changed in shape that as nathusius remarks s 133 no naturalist seeing this important part of the skull by itself would suppose that it belonged to the genus sus these and various other modifications as nathusius observes can hardly be considered as monstrosities for they are not injurious and are strictly inherited the whole head is much shortened thus whilst in common breeds its length to that of the body is as 1 to 6 in the culturracen the proportion is as 1 to 9 and even recently as 1 to 11 315 die racen des schweines s 70 figure 3 316 these woodcuts are copied from engravings given in mr s sidneys excellent edition of the pig by youatt 1860 see pages 1 16 19 of the head of a wild boar and of a sow from a photograph of the yorkshire large breed may aid in showing how greatly the head in a highly cultivated race has been modified and shortened  nathusius has well discussed the causes of the remarkable changes in the skull and shape of the body which the highly cultivated races have undergone these modifications occur chiefly in the pure and crossed races of the s indicus type but their commencement may be clearly detected in the slightly improved breeds of the s scrofa type 317 schweineschadel s 74 135 nathusius states positively s 99 103 as the result of common experience and of his experiments that rich and abundant food given during youth tends by some direct action to make the head broader and shorter and that poor food works a contrary result he lays much stress on the fact that all wild and semidomesticated pigs in ploughing up the ground with their muzzles have whilst young to exert the powerful muscles fixed to the hinder part of the head in highly cultivated races this habit is no longer followed and consequently the back of the skull becomes modified in shape entailing other changes in other parts there can hardly be a doubt that so great a change in habits would affect the skull but it seems rather doubtful how far this will account for the greatly reduced length of the skull and for its concave front it is well known nathusius himself advancing many cases s 104 that there is a strong tendency in many domestic animalsin bull and pugdogs in the niata cattle in sheep in polish fowls short faced tumbler pigeons and in one variety of the carpfor the bones of the face to become greatly shortened in the case of the dog as h muller has shown this seems caused by an abnormal state of the primordial cartilage we may however readily admit that abundant and rich food supplied during many generations would give an inherited tendency to increased size of body and that from disuse the limbs would become finer and shorter 318 nathusius die racen des schweines s 71 we shall in a future chapter see also that the skull and limbs are apparently in some manner correlated so that any change in the one tends to affect the other  nathusius has remarked and the observation is an interesting one that the peculiar form of the skull and body in the most highly cultivated races is not characteristic of any one race but is common to all when improved up to the same standard thus the largebodied longeared english breeds with a convex back and the smallbodied shorteared chinese breeds with a concave back when bred to the same state of perfection nearly resemble each other in the form of the head and body this result it appears is partly due to similar causes of change acting on the several races and partly to man breeding the pig for one sole purpose namely for the greatest amount of flesh and fat so that selection has always tended towards one and the same end with most domestic animals the result of selection has been divergence of character here it has been convergence 319 die racen des schweines s 47 schweineschadel s 104 compare also the figures of the old irish and the improved irish breeds in richardson on the pig 1847  the nature of the food supplied during many generations has apparently affected the length of the intestines for according to cuvier 320 quoted by isid geoffroy hist nat gen tome 3 page 441 their length to that of the body in the wild boar is as 9 to 1in the common domestic boar as 135 to 1and in the siam breed as 16 to 1 in this latter breed the greater length may be due either to descent from a distinct species or to more ancient domestication the number of mammae vary as does the period of gestation the latest authority says 321 s sidney the pig page 61 that the period averages from 17 to 20 weeks but i think there must be some error in this statement in m tessiers observations on 25 sows it varied from 109 to 123 days the rev wd fox has given me ten carefully recorded cases with wellbred pigs in which the period varied from 101 to 116 days according to nathusius the period is shortest in the races which come early to maturity but the course of their development does not appear to be actually shortened for the young animal is born judging from the state of the skull less fully developed or in a more embryonic condition 322 schweineschadel s 2 20 than in the case of common swine in the highly cultivated and early matured races the teeth also are developed earlier  the difference in the number of the vertebrae and ribs in different kinds

swine have occasionally been observed in various parts of the world although this peculiarity is strongly inherited it is hardly probable that all the animals with solid hoofs have descended from the same parents it is more probable that the same peculiarity has reappeared at various times and places dr struthers has lately described and figured 324 edinburgh new philosoph journal april 1863 see also de blainville osteographie page 128 for various authorities on this subject the structure of the feet in both front and hind feet the distal phalanges of the two greater toes are represented by a single great hoofbearing phalanx and in the front feet the middle phalanges are represented by a bone which is single towards the lower end but bears two separate articulations towards the upper end from other accounts it appears that an intermediate toe is likewise sometimes superadded  figure 4 old irish pig with jaw appendages copied from hd richardson on pigs  another curious anomaly is offered by the appendages described by m eudesdeslongchamps as often characterizing the normandy pigs these appendages are always attached to the same spot to the corners of the jaw they are cylindrical about three inches in length covered with bristles and with a pencil of bristles rising out of a sinus on one side they have a cartilaginous centre with two small longitudinal muscles they occur either symmetrically on both sides of the face or on one side alone richardson figures them on the gaunt old irish greyhound pig and nathusius states that they occasionally appear in all the long eared races but are not strictly inherited for they occur or fail in animals of the same litter 325 eudesdeslongchamps memoires de la soc linn de normandie volume 7 1842 page 41 richardson pigs their origin etc 1847 page 30 nathusius die racen des schweines 1863 s 54 as no wild pigs are known to have analogous appendages we have at present no reason to suppose that their appearance is due to reversion and if this be so we are forced to admit that a somewhat complex though apparently useless structure may be suddenly developed without the aid of selection  it is a remarkable fact that the boars of all domesticated breeds have much shorter tusks than wild boars many facts show that with many animals the state of the hair is much affected by exposure to or protection from climate and as we see that the state of the hair and teeth are correlated in turkish dogs other analogous facts will be hereafter given may we not venture to surmise that the reduction of the tusks in the domestic boar is related to his coat of bristles being diminished from living under shelter on the other hand as we shall immediately see the tusks and bristles reappear with feral boars which are no longer protected from the weather it is not surprising that the tusks should be more affected than the other teeth as parts developed to serve as secondary sexual characters are always liable to much variation  it is a wellknown fact that the young of wild european and indian pigs 326 d johnson sketches of indian field sports page 272 mr crawfurd informs me that the same fact holds good with the wild pigs of the malay peninsula for the first six months are longitudinally banded with lightcoloured stripes this character generally disappears under domestication the turkish domestic pigs however have striped young as have those of westphalia whatever may be their hue 327 for turkish pigs see desmarest mammalogie 1820 page 391 for those of westphalia see richardson pigs their origin etc 1847 page 41 whether these latter pigs belong to the same curlyhaired race as the turkish swine i do not know the pigs which have run wild in jamaica and the semiferal pigs of new granada both those which are black and those which are black with a white band across the stomach often extending over the back have resumed this aboriginal character and produce longitudinallystriped young this is likewise the case at least occasionally with the neglected pigs in the zambesi settlement on the coast of africa 328 with respect to the several foregoing and following statements on feral pigs see roulin in mem presentes par divers savans a lacad etc paris tome 6 1835 page 326 it should be observed that his account does not apply to truly feral pigs but to pigs long introduced into the country and living in a half wild state for the truly feral pigs of jamaica see gosse sojourn in jamaica 1851 page 386 and col hamilton smith in nat library volume 9 page 93 with respect to africa see livingstone expedition to the zambesi 1865 page 153 the most precise statement with respect to the tusks of the west indian feral boars is by p labat quoted by roulin but this author attributes the state of these pigs to descent from a domestic stock which he saw in spain admiral sulivan rn had ample opportunities of observing the wild pigs on eagle islet in the falklands and he informs me that they resembled wild boars with bristly ridged backs and large tusks the pigs which have run wild in the province of buenos ayres rengger saugethiere s 331 have not reverted to the wild type de blainville osteographie page 132 refers to two skulls of domestic pigs sent from patagonia by al dorbigny and he states that they have the occipital elevation of the wild european boar but that the head altogether is plus courte et plus ramassee he refers also to the skin of a feral pig from north america and says il ressemble tout a fait a un petit sanglier mais il est presque tout noir et peutetre un peu plus ramasse dans ses formes  the common belief that all domesticated animals when they run wild revert completely to the character of their parentstock is chiefly founded as far as i can discover on feral pigs but even in this case the belief is not grounded on sufficient evidence for the two main types namely s scrofa and indicus have not been distinguished the young as we have just seen reacquire their longitudinal stripes and the boars invariably reassume their tusks they revert also in the general shape of their bodies and in the length of their legs and muzzles to the state of the wild animal as might have been expected from the amount of exercise which they are compelled to take in search of food in jamaica the feral pigs do not acquire the full size of the european wild boar never attaining a greater height than 20 inches at the shoulder in various countries they reassume their original bristly covering but in different degrees dependent on the climate thus according to roulin the semiferal pigs in the hot valleys of new granada are very scantily clothed whereas on the paramos at the height of 7000 to 8000 feet they acquire a thick covering of wool lying under the bristles like that on the truly wild pigs of france these pigs on the paramos are small and stunted the wild boar of india is said to have the bristles at the end of its tail arranged like the plumes of an arrow whilst the european boar has a simple tuft and it is a curious fact that many but not all of the feral pigs in jamaica derived from a spanish stock have a plumed tail 329 gosse jamaica page 386 with a quotation from williamson oriental field sports also col hamilton smith in naturalist library volume 9 page 94 with respect to colour feral pigs generally revert to that of the wild boar but in certain parts of s america as we have seen some of the semiferal pigs have a curious white band across their stomachs and in certain other hot places the pigs are red and this colour has likewise occasionally been observed in the feral pigs of jamaica from these several facts we see that with pigs when feral there is a strong tendency to revert to the wild type but that this tendency is largely governed by the nature of the climate amount of exercise and other causes of change to which they have been subjected  the last point worth notice is that we have unusually good evidence of breeds of pigs now keeping perfectly true which have been formed by the crossing of several distinct breeds the improved essex pigs for instance breed very true but there is no doubt that they largely owe their present excellent qualities to crosses originally made by lord western with the neapolitan race and to subsequent crosses with the berkshire breed this also having been improved by neapolitan crosses and likewise probably with the sussex breed 330 s sidneys edition of youatt on the pig 1860 pages 7 26 27 29 30 in breeds thus formed by complex crosses the most careful and unremitting selection during many generations has been found to be indispensable chiefly in consequence of so much crossing some wellknown breeds have undergone rapid changes thus according to nathusius 331 schweineschadel s 140 the berkshire breed of 1780 is quite different from that of 1810 and since this latter period at least two distinct forms have borne the same name  cattle  domestic cattle are certainly the descendants of more than one wild form in the same manner as has been shown to be the case with our dogs and pigs naturalists have generally made two main divisions of cattle the humped kinds inhabiting tropical countries called in india zebus to which the specific name of bos indicus has been given and the common nonhumped cattle generally included under the name of bos taurus the humped cattle were domesticated as may be seen on the egyptian monuments at least as early as the twelfth dynasty that is 2100 bc they differ from common cattle in various osteological characters even in a greater degree according to rutimeyer 332 die fauna der pfahlbauten 1861 s 109 149 222 see also geoffroy sainthilaire in mem du mus dhist nat tome 10 page 172 and his son isidore in hist nat gen tome 3 page 69 vasey in his delineations of the ox tribe 1851 page 127 says the zebu has four and common ox five sacral vertebrae mr hodgson found the ribs either thirteen or fourteen in number see a note in indian field 1858 page 62 than do the fossil and prehistoric european species namely bos primigenius and longifrons from each other they differ also as mr blyth 333 the indian field 1858 page 74 where mr blyth gives his authorities with respect to the feral humped cattle pickering also in his races of man 1850 page 274 notices the peculiar gruntlike character of the voice of the humped cattle who has particularly attended to this subject remarks in general configuration in the shape of their ears in the point where the dewlap commences in the typical curvature of their horns in their manner of carrying their heads when at rest in their ordinary variations of colour especially in the frequent presence of nilgaulike markings on their feet and in the one being born with teeth protruding through the jaws and the other not so they have different habits and their voice is entirely different the humped cattle in india seldom seek shade and never go into the water and there stand kneedeep like the cattle of europe they have run wild in parts of oude and rohilcund and can maintain themselves in a region infested by tigers they have given rise to many races differing greatly in size in the presence of one or two humps in length of horns and other respects mr blyth sums up emphatically that the humped and humpless cattle must be considered as distinct species when we consider the number of points in external structure and habits independently of important osteological differences in which they differ from each other and that many of these points are not likely to have been affected by domestication there can hardly be a doubt notwithstanding the adverse opinion of some naturalists that the humped and nonhumped cattle must be ranked as specifically distinct  the european breeds of humpless cattle are numerous professor low enumerates 19 british breeds only a few of which are identical with those on the continent even the small channel islands of guernsey jersey and alderney possess their own subbreeds 334 mr he marquand in the times june 23 1856 and these again differ from the cattle of the other british islands such as anglesea and the western isles of scotland desmarest who paid attention to the subject describes 15 french races excluding subvarieties and those imported from other countries in other parts of europe there are several distinct races such as the palecoloured hungarian cattle with their light and free step and enormous horns sometimes measuring above five feet from tip to tip 335 vasey delineations of the oxtribe page 124 brace hungary 1851 page 94 the hungarian cattle descend according to rutimeyer zahmen europ rindes 1866 s 13 from bos primigenius the podolian cattle also are remarkable from the height of their forequarters in the most recent work on cattle 336 moll and gayot la connaissance gen du boeuf paris 1860 fig 82 is that of the podolian breed engravings are given of fiftyfive european breeds it is however probable that several of these differ very little from each other or are merely synonyms it must not be supposed that numerous breeds of cattle exist only in longcivilised countries for we shall presently see that several kinds are kept by the savages of southern africa  with respect to the parentage of the several european breeds we already know much from nilssons memoir 337 a translation appeared in three parts in the annals and mag of nat hist 2nd series volume 4 1849 and more especially from rutimeyers works and those of boyd dawkins two or three species or forms of bos closely allied to still living domestic races have been found in the more recent tertiary deposits or amongst prehistoric remains in europe following rutimeyer we have  bos primigenius  this magnificent well known species was domesticated in switzerland during the neolithic period even at this early period it varied a little having apparently been crossed with other races some of the larger races on the continent as the friesland etc and the pembroke race in england closely resemble in essential structure b primigenius and no doubt are its descendants this is likewise the opinion of nilsson bos primigenius existed as a wild animal in caesars time and is now semiwild though much degenerated in size in the park of chillingham for i am informed by professor rutimeyer to whom lord tankerville sent a skull that the chillingham cattle are less altered from the true primigenius type than any other known breed 338 see also rutimeyer beitrage pal gesch der wiederkauer basel 1865 s 54  bos trochoceros  this form is not included in the three species above mentioned for it is now considered by rutimeyer to be the female of an early domesticated form of b primigenius and as the progenitor of his frontosus race i may add that specific names have been given to four other fossil oxen now believed to be identical with b primigenius 339 pictet palaeontologie tome 1 page 365 2nd edition with respect to b trochoceros see rutimeyer zahmen europ rindes 1866 s 26  bos longifrons or brachyceros of owen  this very distinct species was of small size and had a short body with fine legs according to boyd dawkins 340 w boyd dawkins on the british fossil oxen journal of the geolog soc august 1867 page 182 also proc phil soc of manchester november 14 1871 and cave hunting 1875 page 27 138 it was introduced as a domesticated animal into britain at a very early period and supplied food to the roman legionaries 341 british pleistocene

neolithic period professor owen 343 lecture royal institution of g britain may 2 1856 page 4 british fossil mammals page 513 thinks it probable that the welsh and highland cattle are descended from this form as likewise is the case according to rutimeyer with some of the existing swiss breeds these latter are of different shades of colour from light grey to blackishbrown with a lighter stripe along the spine but they have no pure white marks the cattle of north wales and the highlands on the other hand are generally black or darkcoloured  bos frontosus of nilsson  this species is allied to b longifrons and according to the high authority of mr boyd dawkins is identical with it but in the opinion of some judges is distinct both coexisted in scania during the same late geological period 344 nilsson in annals and mag of nat hist 1849 volume 4 page 354 and both have been found in the irish crannoges 345 see wr wilde ut supra and mr blyth in proc irish academy march 5 1864 nilsson believes that his b frontosus may be the parent of the mountain cattle of norway which have a high protuberance on the skull between the base of the horns as professor owen and others believe that the scotch highland cattle are descended from his b longifrons it is worth notice that a capable judge 346 laing tour in norway page 110 has remarked that he saw no cattle in norway like the highland breed but that they more nearly resembled the devonshire breed  on the whole we may conclude more especially from the researches of boyd dawkins that european cattle are descended from two species and there is no improbability in this fact for the genus bos readily yields to domestication besides these two species and the zebu the yak the gayal and the arni 347 isid geoffroy sainthilaire hist nat gen tome 3 96 not to mention the buffalo or genus bubalus have been domesticated making altogether six species of bos the zebu and the two european species are now extinct in a wild state although certain races of cattle were domesticated at a very ancient period in europe it does not follow that they were first domesticated here those who place much reliance on philology argue that they were imported from the east 348 idem tome 3 pages 82 91 it is probable that they originally inhabited a temperate or cold climate but not a land long covered with snow for our cattle as we have seen in the chapter on horses have not the instinct of scraping away the snow to get at the herbage beneath no one could behold the magnificent wild bulls on the bleak falkland islands in the southern hemisphere and doubt about the climate being admirably suited to them azara has remarked that in the temperate regions of la plata the cows conceive when two years old whilst in the much hotter country of paraguay they do not conceive till three years old from which fact as he adds one may conclude that cattle do not succeed so well in warm countries 349 quadrupedes du paraguay tome 2 page 360  bos primigenius and longifrons have been ranked by nearly all palaeontologists as distinct species and it would not be reasonable to take a different view simply because their domesticated descendants now intercross with the utmost freedom all the european breeds have so often been crossed both intentionally and unintentionally that if any sterility had ensued from such unions it would certainly have been detected as zebus inhabit a distant and much hotter region and as they differ in so many characters from our european cattle i have taken pains to ascertain whether the two forms are fertile when crossed the late lord powis imported some zebus and crossed them with common cattle in shropshire and i was assured by his steward that the crossbred animals were perfectly fertile with both parentstocks mr blyth informs me that in india hybrids with various proportions of either blood are quite fertile and this can hardly fail to be known for in some districts 350 walther das rindvieh 1817 s 30 the two species are allowed to breed freely together most of the cattle which were first introduced into tasmania were humped so that at one time thousands of crossed animals existed there and mr b oneile wilson ma writes to me from tasmania that he has never heard of any sterility having been observed he himself formerly possessed a herd of such crossed cattle and all were perfectly fertile so much so that he cannot remember even a single cow failing to calve these several facts afford an important confirmation of the pallasian doctrine that the descendants of species which when first domesticated would if crossed have been in all probability in some degree sterile become perfectly fertile after a long course of domestication in a future chapter we shall see that this doctrine throws some light on the difficult subject of hybridism  i have alluded to the cattle in chillingham park which according to rutimeyer have been very little changed from the bos primigenius type this park is so ancient that it is referred to in a record of the year 1220 the cattle in their instincts and habits are truly wild they are white with the inside of the ears reddishbrown eyes rimmed with black muzzles brown hoofs black and horns white tipped with black within a period of thirtythree years about a dozen calves were born with brown and blue spots upon the cheeks or necks but these together with any defective animals were always destroyed according to bewick about the year 1770 some calves appeared with black ears but these were also destroyed by the keeper and black ears have not since reappeared the wild white cattle in the duke of hamiltons park where i have heard of the birth of a black calf are said by lord tankerville to be inferior to those at chillingham the cattle kept until the year 1780 by the duke of queensberry but now extinct had their ears muzzle and orbits of the eyes black those which have existed from time immemorial at chartley closely resemble the cattle at chillingham but are larger with some small difference in the colour of the ears they frequently tend to become entirely black and a singular superstition prevails in the vicinity that when a black calf is born some calamity impends over the noble house of ferrers all the black calves are destroyed the cattle at burton constable in yorkshire now extinct had ears muzzle and the tip of the tail black those at gisburne also in yorkshire are said by bewick to have been sometimes without dark muzzles with the inside alone of the ears brown and they are elsewhere said to have been low in stature and hornless 351 i am much indebted to the present earl of tankerville for information about his wild cattle and for the skull which was sent to prof rutimeyer the fullest account of the chillingham cattle is given by mr hindmarsh together with a letter by the late lord tankerville in annals and mag of nat hist volume 2 1839 page 274 see bewick quadrupeds 2nd edition 1791 page 35

quadrupeds and encyclop of rural sports page 101  the several abovespecified differences in the parkcattle slight though they be are worth recording as they show that animals living nearly in a state of nature and exposed to nearly uniform conditions if not allowed to roam freely and to cross with other herds do not keep as uniform as truly wild animals for the preservation of a uniform character even within the same park a certain degree of selectionthat is the destruction of the darkcoloured calvesis apparently necessary  boyd dawkins believes that the parkcattle are descended from anciently domesticated and not truly wild animals and from the occasional appearance of darkcoloured calves it is improbable that the aboriginal bos primigenius was white it is curious what a strong though not invariable tendency there is in wild or escaped cattle to become white with coloured ears under widely different conditions of life if the old writers boethius and leslie 352 boethius was born in 1470 annals and mag of nat hist volume 2 1839 page 281 and volume 4 1849 page 424 can be trusted the wild cattle of scotland were white and furnished with a great mane but the colour of their ears is not mentioned in wales 353 youatt on cattle 1834 page 48 see also page 242 on shorthorn cattle bell in his british quadrupeds page 423 states that after long attending to the subject he has found that white cattle invariably have coloured ears during the tenth century some of the cattle are described as being white with red ears four hundred cattle thus coloured were sent to king john and an early record speaks of a hundred cattle with red ears having been demanded as a compensation for some offence but if the cattle were of a dark or black colour 150 were to be presented the black cattle of north wales apparently belong as we have seen to the small longifrons type and as the alternative was offered of either 150 dark cattle or 100 white cattle with red ears we may presume that the latter were the larger beasts and probably belonged to the primigenius type youatt has remarked that at the present day whenever cattle of the shorthorn breed are white the extremities of their ears are more or less tinged with red  the cattle which have run wild on the pampas in texas and in two parts of africa have become of a nearly uniform dark brownishred 354 azara quadrupedes du paraguay tome 2 page

described as milkwhite except their ears which are generally black 355 ansons voyage see kerr and porter collection volume 12 page 103 the falkland islands situated far south with all the conditions of life as different as it is possible to conceive from those of the ladrones offer a more interesting case cattle have run wild there during eighty or ninety years and in the southern districts the animals are mostly white with their feet or whole heads or only their ears black but my informant admiral sulivan 356 see also mr mackinnons pamphlet on the falkland islands page 24 who long resided on these islands does not believe that they are ever purely white so that in these two archipelagos we see that the cattle tend to become white with coloured ears in other parts of the falkland islands other colours prevail near port pleasant brown is the common tint round mount usborn about half the animals in some of the herds were lead or mousecoloured which elsewhere is an unusual tint these latter cattle though generally inhabiting high land breed about a month earlier than the other cattle and this circumstance would aid in keeping them distinct and in perpetuating a peculiar colour it is worth recalling to mind that blue or leadcoloured marks have occasionally appeared on the white cattle of chillingham so plainly different were the colours of the wild herds in different parts of the falkland islands that in hunting them as admiral sulivan informs me white spots in one district and dark spots in another district were always looked out for on the distant hills in the intermediate districts intermediate colours prevailed whatever the cause may be this tendency in the wild cattle of the falkland islands which are all descended from a few brought from la plata to break up into herds of three different colours is an interesting fact  returning to the several british breeds the conspicuous difference in general appearance between shorthorns longhorns now rarely seen herefords highland cattle alderneys etc must be familiar to every one a part of this difference may be attributed to descent from primordially distinct species but we may feel sure that there has been a considerable amount of variation even during the neolithic period the domestic cattle were to a certain extent variable within recent times most of the breeds have been modified by careful and methodical selection how strongly the characters thus acquired are inherited may be inferred from the prices realised by the improved breeds even at the first sale of collings shorthorns eleven bulls reached an average of 214 pounds and lately shorthorn bulls have been sold for a thousand guineas and have been exported to all quarters of the world  some constitutional differences may be here noticed the shorthorns arrive at maturity far earlier than the wilder breeds such as those of wales or the highlands this fact has been shown in an interesting manner by mr simonds 357 the age of the ox sheep pig etc by prof james simonds published by order of the royal agricult soc who has given a table of the average period of their dentition which proves that there is a difference of no less than six months in the appearance of the permanent incisors the period of gestation from observations made by tessier on 1131 cows varies to the extent of eightyone days and what is more interesting m lefour affirms that the period of gestation is longer in the large german cattle than in the smaller breeds 358 ann agricult france april 1837 as quoted in the veterinary volume 12 page 725 i quote tessiers observations from youatt on cattle page 527 with respect to the period of conception it seems certain that alderney and zetland cows often become pregnant earlier than other breeds 359 the veterinary volume 8 page 681 and volume 10 page 268 low domest animals etc page 297 lastly as four fully developed mammae is a generic character in the genus bos 360 mr ogleby in proc zoolog soc 1836

ordinary number of twelve it is worth notice that with our domestic cows the two rudimentary mammae often become fairly well developed and yield milk  as numerous breeds are generally found only in longcivilised countries it may be well to show that in some countries inhabited by barbarous races who are frequently at war with each other and therefore have little free communication several distinct breeds of cattle now exist or formerly existed at the cape of good hope leguat observed in the year 1720 three kinds 361 leguats voyage quoted by vasey in his delineations of the oxtribe page 132 at the present day various travellers have noticed the differences in the breeds in southern africa sir andrew smith several years ago remarked to me that the cattle possessed by the different tribes of caffres though living near each other under the same latitude and in the same kind of country yet differed and he expressed much surprise at the fact mr andersson has described 362 travels in south africa pages 317 336 the damara bechuana and namaqua cattle and he informs me in a letter that the cattle north of lake ngami are likewise different as mr galton has heard is also the case with the cattle of benguela the namaqua cattle in size and shape nearly resemble european cattle and have short stout horns and large hoofs the damara cattle are very peculiar being bigboned with slender legs and small hard feet their tails are adorned with a tuft of long bushy hair nearly touching the ground and their horns are extraordinarily large the bechuana cattle have even larger horns and there is now a skull in london with the two horns 8 ft 8 14 in long as measured in a straight line from tip to tip and no less than 13 ft 5 in as measured along their curvature mr andersson in his letter to me says that though he will not venture to describe the differences between the breeds belonging to the many different subtribes yet such certainly exist as shown by the wonderful facility with which the natives discriminate them  that many breeds of cattle have originated through variation independently of descent from distinct species we may infer from what we see in south america where the genus bos was not endemic and where the cattle which now exist in such vast numbers are the descendants of a few imported from spain and portugal in columbia roulin 363 mem de 1institut

describes a breed which certainly originated in s america called chivos because they have straight vertical horns conical and very large at the base he likewise describes a dwarf race in corrientes with short legs and a body larger than usual cattle without horns and others with reversed hair have also originated in paraguay  another monstrous breed called niatas or natas of which i saw two small herds on the northern bank of the plata is so remarkable as to deserve a fuller description this breed bears the same relation to other breeds as bull or pug dogs do to other dogs or as improved pigs according to h von nathusius do to common pigs 364 schweineschadel 1864 s 104 nathusius states that the form of skull characteristic in the niata cattle occasionally appears in european cattle but he is mistaken as we shall hereafter see in supposing that these cattle do not form a distinct race prof wyman of cambridge united states informs me that the common cod fish presents a similar monstrosity called by the fishermen bulldog cod prof wyman also concluded after making numerous inquiries in la plata that the niata cattle transmit their peculiarities or form a race rutimeyer believes that these cattle belong to the primigenius type 365 ueber art des zahmen europ rindes 1866 s 28 the forehead is very short and broad with the nasal end of the skull together with the whole plane of the upper molarteeth curved upwards the lower jaw projects beyond the upper and has a corresponding upward curvature it is an interesting fact that an almost similar confirmation characterizes as i am informed by dr falconer the extinct and gigantic sivatherium of india and is not known in any other ruminant the upper lip is much drawn back the nostrils are seated high up and are widely open the eyes project outwards and the horns are large in walking the head is carried low and the neck is short the hind legs appear to be longer compared with the front legs than is usual the exposed incisor teeth the short head and upturned nostrils give these cattle the most ludicrous selfconfident air of defiance the skull which i presented to the college of surgeons has been thus described by professor owen 366 descriptive cat of ost collect of college of surgeons 1853 page 624 vasey in his delineations of the oxtribe has given a figure of this skull and i sent a photograph of it to prof rutimeyer it is remarkable from the stunted development of the nasals premaxillaries and forepart of the lower jaw which is unusually curved upwards to come into contact with the premaxillaries the nasal bones are about onethird the ordinary length but retain almost their normal breadth the triangular vacuity is left between them the frontal and lachrymal which latter bone articulates with the premaxillary and thus excludes the maxillary from any junction with the nasal so that even the connexion of some of the bones is changed other differences might be added thus the plane of the condyles is somewhat modified and the terminal edge of the premaxillaries forms an arch in fact on comparison with the skull of a common ox scarcely a single bone presents the same exact shape and the whole skull has a wonderfully different appearance  the first brief published notice of this race was by azara between the years 178396 but don f muniz of luxan who has kindly collected information for me states that about 1760 these cattle were kept as curiosities near buenos ayres their origin is not positively known but they must have originated subsequently to the year 1552 when cattle were first introduced senor muniz informs me that the breed is believed to have originated with the indians southward of the plata even to this day those reared near the plata show their less civilised nature in being fiercer than common cattle and in the cow if visited too often easily deserting her first calf the breed is very true and a niata bull and cow invariably produce niata calves the breed has already lasted at least a century a niata bull crossed with a common cow and the reverse cross yield offspring having an intermediate character but with the niata character strongly displayed according to senor muniz there is the clearest evidence contrary to the common belief of agriculturists in analogous cases that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull transmits her peculiarities more strongly than does the niata bull when crossed with a common cow when the pasture is tolerably long these cattle feed as well as common cattle with their tongue and palate but during the great droughts when so many animals perish on the pampas the niata breed lies under a great disadvantage and would if not attended to become extinct for the common cattle like horses are able to keep alive by browsing with their lips on the twigs of trees and on reeds this the niatas cannot so well do as their lips do not join and hence they are found to perish before the common cattle this strikes me as a good illustration of how little we are able to judge from the ordinary habits of an animal on what circumstances occurring only at long intervals of time its rarity or extinction may depend it shows us also how natural selection would have determined the rejection of the niata modification had it arisen in a state of nature  having described the semimonstrous niata breed i may allude to a white bull said to have been brought from africa which was exhibited in london in 1829 and which has been well figured by mr harvey 367 loudons magazine of nat hist volume 1 1829 page 113 separate figures are given of the animal its hoofs eye and dewlap it had a hump and was furnished with a mane the dewlap was peculiar being divided between its forelegs into parallel divisions its lateral hoofs were annually shed and grew to the length of five or six inches the eye was very peculiar being remarkably prominent and resembled a cup and ball thus enabling the animal to see on all sides with equal ease the pupil was small and oval or rather a parallelogram with the ends cut off and lying transversely across the ball a new and strange breed might probably have been formed by careful breeding and selection from this animal  i have often speculated on the probable causes through which each separate district in great britain came to possess in former times its own peculiar breed of cattle and the question is perhaps even more perplexing in the case of southern africa we now know that the differences may be in part attributed to descent from distinct species but this cause is far from sufficient have the slight differences in climate and in the nature of the pasture in the different districts of britain directly induced corresponding differences in the cattle we have seen that the semiwild cattle in the several british parks are not identical in colouring or size and that some degree of selection has been requisite to keep them true it is almost certain that abundant food given during many generations directly affects the size of a breed 368 low domesticated animals of the british isles page 264 that climate directly affects the thickness of the skin and the hair is likewise certain thus roulin asserts 69 mem de linstitut present par divers savans tome 6 1835 page 332 that the hides of the feral cattle on the hot llanos are always much less heavy than those of the cattle raised on the high platform of bogota and that these hides yield in weight and in thickness of hair to those of the cattle which have run wild on the lofty paramos the same difference has been observed in the hides of the cattle reared on the bleak falkland islands and on the temperate pampas low has remarked 370 idem pages 304 368 etc that the cattle which inhabit the more humid parts of britain have longer hair and thicker skins than other british cattle when we compare highly improved stallfed cattle with the wilder breeds or compare mountain and lowland breeds we cannot doubt that an active life leading to the free use of the limbs and lungs affects the shape and proportions of the whole body it is probable that some breeds such as the semi monstrous niata cattle and some peculiarities such as being hornless etc have appeared suddenly owing to what we may call in our ignorance spontaneous variation but even in this case a rude kind of selection is necessary and the animals thus characterised must be at least partially separated from others this degree of care however has sometimes been taken even in littlecivilised districts where we should least have expected it as in the case of the niata chivo and hornless cattle in s america  that methodical selection has done wonders within a recent period in modifying our cattle no one doubts during the process of methodical selection it has occasionally happened that deviations of structure more strongly pronounced than mere individual differences yet by no means deserving to be called monstrosities have been taken advantage of thus the famous longhorn bull shakespeare though of the pure canley stock scarcely inherited a single point of the longhorned breed his horns excepted 371 youatt on cattle page 193 a full account of this bull is taken from marshall yet in the hands of mr fowler this bull greatly improved his race we have also reason to believe that selection carried on so far unconsciously that there was at no one time any distinct intention to improve or change the breed has in the course of time modified most of our cattle for by this process aided by more abundant food all the lowland british breeds have increased greatly in size and in early maturity since the reign of henry vii 372 youatt on cattle page 116 lord spencer has written on this same subject it should never be forgotten that many animals have to be annually slaughtered so that each owner must determine which shall be killed and which preserved for breeding in every district as youatt has remarked there is a prejudice in favour of the native breed so that animals possessing qualities whatever they may be which are most valued in each district will be oftenest preserved and this unmethodical selection assuredly will in the long run affect the character of the whole breed but it may be asked can this rude kind of selection have been practised by barbarians such as those of southern africa in a future chapter on selection we shall see that this has certainly occurred to some extent therefore looking to the origin of the many breeds of cattle which formerly inhabited the several districts of britain i conclude that although slight differences in the nature of the climate food etc as well as changed habits of life aided by correlation of growth and the occasional appearance from unknown causes of considerable deviations of structure have all probably played their parts yet that the occasional preservation in each district of those individual animals which were most valued by each owner has perhaps been even more effective in the production of the several british breeds as soon as two or more breeds were formed in any district or when new breeds descended from distinct species were introduced their crossing especially if aided by some selection will have multiplied the number and modified the characters of the older breeds  sheep  i shall treat this subject briefly most authors look at our domestic sheep as descended from several distinct species mr blyth who has carefully attended to the subject believes that fourteen wild species now exist but that not one of them can be identified as the progenitor of any one of the interminable domestic races m gervais thinks that there are six species of ovis 373 blyth on the genus ovis in annals and mag of nat history volume 7 1841 page 261 with respect to the parentage of the breeds see mr blyths excellent articles in land and water 1867 pages 134 156 gervais hist nat des mammiferes 1855 tome 2 page 191 but that our domestic sheep form a distinct genus now completely extinct a german naturalist 374 dr l fitzinger ueber die racen des zahmen schafes 1860 s 86 believes that our sheep descend from ten aboriginally distinct species of which only one is still living in a wild state another ingenious observer 375 j anderson recreations in agriculture and natural history volume 2 page 264 though not a naturalist with a bold defiance of everything known on geographical distribution infers that the sheep of great britain alone are the descendants of eleven endemic british forms under such a hopeless state of doubt it would be useless for my purpose to give a detailed account of the several breeds but a few remarks may be added  sheep have been domesticated from a very ancient period rutimeyer 376 pfahlbauten s 127 193 found in the swiss lakedwellings the remains of a small breed with thin tall legs and horns like those of a goat thus differing somewhat from any kind now known almost every country has its own peculiar breed and many countries have several breeds differing greatly from each other one of the most strongly marked races is an eastern one with a long tail including according to pallas twenty vertebrae and so loaded with fat that it is sometimes placed on a truck which is dragged about by the living animal these sheep though ranked by fitzinger as a distinct aboriginal form bear in their drooping ears the stamp of long domestication this is likewise the case with those sheep which have two great masses of fat on the rump with the tail in a rudimentary condition the angola variety of the longtailed race has curious masses of fat on the back of the head and beneath the jaws 377 youatt on sheep page 120 mr hodgson in an admirable paper 378 journal of the asiatic soc of bengal volume 16 pages 1007 1016 on the sheep of the himalaya infers from the distribution of the several races that this caudal augmentation in most of its phases is an instance of degeneracy in these preeminently alpine animals the horns present an endless diversity in character being not rarely absent especially in the female sex or on the other hand amounting to four or even eight in number the horns when numerous arise from a crest on the frontal bone which is elevated in a peculiar manner it is remarkable that multiplicity of horns is generally accompanied by great length and coarseness of the fleece 379 youatt on sheep pages 142169 this correlation however is far from being general for instance i am informed by mr d forbes that the spanish sheep in chile resemble in fleece and in all other characters their parent merinorace except that instead of a pair they generally bear four horns the existence of a pair of mammae is a generic character in the genus ovis as well as in several allied forms nevertheless as mr hodgson has remarked this character is not absolutely constant even among the true and proper sheep for i have more than once met with cagias a subhimalayan domestic race possessed of four teats 380 journal asiat soc of bengal volume 16 1847 page 1015 this case is the more remarkable as when any part or organ is present in reduced number in comparison with the same part in allied groups it usually is subject to little variation the presence of interdigital pits has likewise been considered as a generic distinction in sheep but isidore geoffroy 381 hist nat gen tome 3 page 435 has shown that these pits or pouches are absent in some breeds  in sheep there is a strong tendency for characters which have apparently been acquired under domestication to become attached either exclusively to the male sex or to be more highly developed in this than in the other sex thus in many breeds the horns are deficient in the ewe though this likewise occurs occasionally with the female of the wild musmon in the rams of the wallachian breed the horns spring almost perpendicularly from the frontal bone and then take a beautiful spiral form in the ewes they protrude nearly at right angles from the head and then become twisted in a singular manner 382 youatt on sheep page 138 mr hodgson states that the extraordinarily arched nose or chaffron which is so highly developed in several foreign breeds is characteristic of the ram alone and apparently is the result of domestication 383 journal asiat soc of bengal volume 16 1847 pages 1015 1016 i hear from mr blyth that the accumulation of fat in the fattailed sheep of the plains of india is greater in the male than in the female and fitzinger 384 racen des zahmen schafes s 77 remarks that the mane in the african maned race is far more developed in the ram than in the ewe  different races of sheep like cattle present constitutional differences thus the improved breeds arrive at maturity at an early age as has been well shown by mr simonds through their early average period of dentition the several races have become adapted to different kinds of pasture and climate for instance no one can rear leicester sheep on mountainous regions where cheviots flourish as youatt has remarked in all the different districts of great britain we find various breeds of sheep beautifully adapted to the locality which they occupy no one knows their origin they are indigenous to the soil climate pasturage and the locality on which they graze they seem to have been formed for it and by it 385 rural economy of norfolk volume 2 page 136 marshall relates 386 youatt on sheep page 312 on same subject see excellent remarks in gardeners chronicle 1858 page 868 for experiments in crossing cheviot sheep with leicesters see youatt page 325 that a flock of heavy lincolnshire and light norfolk sheep which had been bred together in a large sheepwalk part of which was low rich and moist and another part high and dry with benty grass when turned out regularly separated from each other the heavy sheep drawing off to the rich soil and the lighter sheep to their own soil so that whilst there was plenty of grass the two breeds kept themselves as distinct as rooks and pigeons numerous sheep from various parts of the world have been brought during a long course of years to the zoological gardens of london but as youatt who attended the animals as a veterinary surgeon remarks few or none die of the rot but they are phthisical not one of them from a torrid climate lasts out the second year and when they die their lungs are tuberculated 387 youatt on sheep note page 491 there is very good evidence that english breeds of sheep will not succeed in france 388 m malingienouel journal r agricult soc volume 14 1853 page 214 translated and therefore approved by a great authority mr pusey even in certain parts of england it has been found impossible to keep certain breeds of sheep thus on a farm on the banks of the ouse the leicester sheep were so rapidly destroyed by pleuritis 389 the veterinary volume 10 page 217 that the owner could not keep them the coarserskinned sheep never being affected  the period of gestation was formerly thought to be of so unalterable a character that a supposed difference of this kind between the wolf and the dog was esteemed a sure sign of specific distinction but we have seen that the period is shorter in the improved breeds of the pig and in the larger breeds of the ox than in other breeds of these two animals and now we know on the excellent authority of hermann von nathusius 390 a translation of his paper is given in bull soc imp dacclimat tome 9 1862 page 723 that merino and southdown sheep when both have long been kept under exactly the same conditions differ in their average period of gestation as is seen in the following table  merinos                             1503 days southdowns                          1442    halfbred merinos and southdowns    1463    34 blood of southdown              1455    78 blood of southdown              1442     in this graduated difference in crossbred animals having different proportions of southdown blood we see how strictly the two periods of gestation have been transmitted nathusius remarks that as southdowns grow with remarkable rapidity after birth it is not surprising that their foetal development should have been shortened it is of course possible that the difference in these two breeds may be due to their descent from distinct parentspecies but as the early maturity of the southdowns has long been carefully attended to by breeders the difference is more probably the result of such attention lastly the fecundity of the several breeds differs much some generally producing twins or even triplets at a birth of which fact the curious shangai sheep with their truncated and rudimentary ears and great roman noses lately exhibited in the zoological gardens offer a remarkable instance  sheep are perhaps more readily affected by the direct action of the conditions of life to which they have been exposed than almost any other domestic animal according to pallas and more recently according to erman the fattailed kirghisian sheep when bred for a few generations in russia degenerate and the mass of fat dwindles away the scanty and bitter herbage of the steppes seems so essential to their development pallas makes an analogous statement with respect to one of the crimean breeds burnes states that the karakool breed which produces a fine curled black and valuable fleece when removed from its own canton near bokhara to persia or to other quarters loses its peculiar fleece 391 erman travels in siberia english translation volume 1 page 228 for pallas on the fattailed sheep i quote from andersons account of the sheep of russia 1794 page 34 with respect to the crimean sheep see pallas travels english translation volume 2 page 454 for the karakool sheep see burnes travels in bokhara volume 3 page 151 in all such cases however it may be that a change of any kind in the conditions of life causes variability and consequent loss of character and not that certain conditions are necessary for the development of certain characters  great heat however seems to act directly on the fleece several accounts have been published of the change which sheep imported from europe undergo in the west indies dr nicholson of antigua informs me that after the third generation the wool disappears from the whole body except over the loins and the animal then appears like a goat with a dirty doormat on its back a similar change is said to take place on the west coast of africa 392 see report of the directors of the sierra leone company as quoted in white gradation of man page 95 with respect to the change which sheep undergo in the west indies see also dr davy in edin new phil journal january 1852 for the statement made by roulin see mem de linstitut present par divers savans tome 6 1835 page 347 on the other hand many woolbearing sheep live on the hot plains of india roulin asserts that in the lower and heated valleys of the cordillera if the lambs are sheared as soon as the wool has grown to a certain thickness all goes on afterwards as usual but if not sheared the wool detaches itself in flakes and short shining hair like that on a goat is produced ever afterwards this curious result seems merely to be an exaggerated tendency natural to the merino breed for as a great authority namely lord somerville remarks the wool of our merino sheep after sheartime is hard and coarse to such a degree as to render it almost impossible to suppose that the same animal could bear wool so opposite in quality compared to that which has been clipped from it as the cold weather advances the fleeces recover their soft quality as in sheep of all breeds the fleece naturally consists of longer and coarser hair covering shorter and softer wool the change which it often undergoes in hot climates is probably merely a case of unequal development for even with those sheep which like goats are covered with hair a small quantity of underlying wool may always be found 393 youatt on sheep page 69 where lord somerville is quoted see page 117 on the presence of wool under the hair with respect to the fleeces of australian sheep page 185 on selection counteracting any tendency to change see pages 70 117 120 168 in the wild mountainsheep 0vis montana of north america there is an analogous annual change of coat the wool begins to drop out in early spring leaving in its place a coat of hair resembling that of the elk a change of pelage quite different in character from the ordinary thickening of the coat or hair common to all furred animals in winterfor instance in the horse the cow etc which shed their winter coat in the spring 394 audubon and bachman the quadrupeds of north america 1846 volume 5 page 365  a slight difference in climate or pasture sometimes slightly affects the fleece as has been observed even in different districts in england and is well shown by the great softness of the wool brought from southern australia but it should be observed as youatt repeatedly insists that the tendency to change may generally be counteracted by careful selection m lasterye after discussing this subject sums up as follows the preservation of the merino race in its utmost purity at the cape of good hope in the marshes of holland and under the rigorous climate of sweden furnishes an additional support of this my unalterable principle that finewoolled sheep may be kept wherever industrious men and intelligent breeders exist  that methodical selection has effected great changes in several breeds of sheep no one who knows anything on the subject entertains a doubt the case of the southdowns as improved by ellman offers perhaps the most striking instance unconscious or occasional selection has likewise slowly produced a great effect as we shall see in the chapters on selection that crossing has largely modified some breeds no one who will study what has been written on this subjectfor instance mr spooners paperwill dispute but to produce uniformity in a crossed breed careful selection and rigorous weeding as this author expresses it are indispensable 395 journal of r agricult soc of england volume 20 part 2 wc spooner on crossbreeding  in some few instances new breeds have suddenly originated thus in 1791 a ramlamb was born in massachusetts having short crooked legs and a long back like a turnspitdog from this one lamb the otter or ancon semi monstrous breed was raised as these sheep could not leap over the fences it was thought that they would be valuable but they have been supplanted by merinos and thus exterminated the sheep are remarkable from transmitting their character so truly that colonel humphreys 396 philosoph transactions london 1813 page 88 never heard of but one questionable case of an ancon ram and ewe not producing ancon offspring when they are crossed with other breeds the offspring with rare exceptions instead of being intermediate in character perfectly resemble either parent even one of twins has resembled one parent and the second the other lastly the ancons have been observed to keep together separating themselves from the rest of the flock when put into enclosures with other sheep  a more interesting case has been recorded in the report of the juries for the great exhibition 1851 namely the production of a merino ramlamb on the mauchamp farm in 1828 which was remarkable for its long smooth straight and silky wool by the year 1833 m graux had raised rams enough to serve his whole flock and after a few more years he was able to sell stock of his new breed so peculiar and valuable is the wool that it sells at 25 per cent above the best merino wool even the fleeces of halfbred animals are valuable and are known in france as the mauchampmerino it is interesting as showing how generally any marked deviation of structure is accompanied by other deviations that the first ram and his immediate offspring were of small size with large heads long necks narrow chests and long flanks but these blemishes were removed by judicious crosses and selection the long smooth wool was also correlated with smooth horns and as horns and hair are homologous structures we can understand the meaning of this correlation if the mauchamp and ancon breeds had originated a century or two ago we should have had no record of their birth and many a naturalist would no doubt have insisted especially in the case of the mauchamp race that they had each descended from or been crossed with some unknown aboriginal form  goats  from the recent researches of m brandt most naturalists now believe that all our goats are descended from the capra aegagrus of the mountains of asia possibly mingled with the allied indian species c falconeri of india 397 isidore geoffroy st hilaire hist nat generale tome 3 page 87 mr blyth land and water 1867 page 37 has arrived at a similar conclusion but he thinks that certain eastern races may perhaps be in part descended from the asiatic markhor in switzerland during the neolithic period the domestic goat was commoner than the sheep and this very ancient race differed in no respect from that now common in switzerland 398 rutimeyer pfahlbauten s 127 at the present time the many races found in several parts of the world differ greatly from each other nevertheless as far as they have been tried 399 godron de lespece tome 1 page 402 they are all quite fertile when crossed so numerous are the breeds that mr g clark 3100 annals and mag of nat history 2nd series volume 2 1848 page 363 has described eight distinct kinds imported into the one island of mauritius the ears of one kind were enormously developed being as measured by mr clark no less than 19 inches in length and 4 34 inches in breadth as with cattle the mammae of those breeds which are regularly milked become greatly developed and as mr clark remarks it is not rare to see their teats touching the ground the following cases are worth notice as presenting unusual points of variation according to godron 3101 de lespece tome 1 page 406 mr clark also refers to differences in the shape of the mammae godron states that in the nubian race the scrotum is divided into two lobes and mr clark gives a ludicrous proof of this fact for he saw in the mauritius a male goat of the muscat breed purchased at a high price for a female in full milk these differences in the scrotum are probably not due to descent from distinct species for mr clark states that this part varies much in form the mammae differ greatly in shape in different breeds being elongated in the common goat hemispherical in the angora race and bilobed and divergent in the goats of syria and nubia according to this same author the males of certain breeds have lost their usual offensive odour in one of the indian breeds the males and females have horns of widelydifferent shapes 3102 mr clark annals and mag of nat hist 2nd series volume 2 1848 page 361 and in some breeds the females are destitute of horns 3103 desmarest encyclop method mammalogie page 480 m ramu of nancy informs me that many of the goats there bear on the upper part of the throat a pair of hairy appendages 70 mm in length and about 10 mm in diameter which in external appearance resemble those above described on the jaws of pigs the presence of interdigital pits or glands on all four feet has been thought to characterise the genus ovis and their absence to be characteristic of the genus capra but mr hodgson has found that they exist in the front feet of the majority of himalayan goats 3104 journal of asiatic soc of bengal volume 16 1847 pages 1020 1025 mr hodgson measured the intestines in two goats of the dugu race and he found that the proportional length of the great and small intestines differed considerably in one of these goats the caecum was thirteen inches and in the other no less than thirtysix inches in length   chapter 1iv  domestic rabbits  domestic rabbits descended from the common wild rabbit ancient domestication ancient selection large lopeared rabbits various breeds fluctuating characters

of the brain summary on the modifications of domesticated rabbits  all naturalists with as far as i know a single exception believe that the several domestic breeds of the rabbit are descended from the common wild species i shall therefore describe them more carefully than in the previous cases professor gervais 41 mp gervais hist nat des mammiferes 1854 tome 1 page 288 states that the true wild rabbit is smaller than the domestic its proportions are not absolutely the same its tail is smaller its ears are shorter and more thickly clothed with hair and these characters without speaking of colour are so many indications opposed to the opinion which unites these animals under the same specific denomination few naturalists will agree with this author that such slight differences are sufficient to separate as distinct species the wild and domestic rabbit how extraordinary it would be if close confinement perfect tameness unnatural food and careful breeding all prolonged during many generations had not produced at least some effect the tame rabbit has been domesticated from an ancient period confucius ranges rabbits among animals worthy to be sacrificed to the gods and as he prescribes their multiplication they were probably at this early period domesticated in china they are mentioned by several of the classical writers in 1631 gervaise markham writes you shall not as in other cattell looke to their shape but to their richnesse onely elect your buckes the largest and goodliest conies you can get and for the richnesse of the skin that is accounted the richest which hath the equallest mixture of blacke and white haire together yet the blacke rather shadowing the white the furre should be thicke deepe smooth and shiningthey are of body much fatter and larger and when another skin is worth two or three pence they are worth two shillings from this full description we see that silvergrey rabbits existed in england at this period and what is far more important we see that the breeding or selection of rabbits was then carefully attended to aldrovandi in 1637 describes on the authority of several old writers as scaliger in 1557 rabbits of various colours some like a hare and he adds that p valerianus who died a very old man in 1558 saw at verona rabbits four times bigger than ours 42 u aldrovandi de quadrupedibus digitatis 1637 page 383 for confucius and g markham see a writer who has studied the subject in cottage gardener january 22 1861 page 250  from the fact of the rabbit having been domesticated at an ancient period we must look to the northern hemisphere of the old world and to the warmer temperate regions alone for the aboriginal parentform for the rabbit cannot live without protection in countries as cold as sweden and though it has run wild in the tropical island of jamaica it has never greatly multiplied there it now exists and has long existed in the warmer temperate parts of europe for fossil remains have been found in several countries 43 owen british fossil mammals page 212 the domestic rabbit readily becomes feral in these same countries and when variously coloured kinds are turned out they generally revert to the ordinary grey colour 44 bechstein naturgesch deutschlands 1801 b 1 page 1133 i have received similar accounts with respect to england and scotland wild rabbits if taken young can be domesticated though the process is generally very troublesome 45 pigeons and rabbits by es delamer 1854 page 133 sir j sebright observations on instinct 1836 page 10 speaks most strongly on the difficulty but this difficulty is not invariable as i have received two accounts of perfect success in taming and breeding from the wild rabbit see also dr p broca in journal de la physiologie tome 2 page 368 the various domestic races are often crossed and are believed to be quite fertile together and a perfect gradation can be shown to exist from the largest domestic kinds having enormously developed ears to the common wild kind the parentform must have been a burrowing animal a habit not common as far as i can discover to any other species in the large genus lepus only one wild species is known with certainty to exist in europe but the rabbit if it be a true rabbit from mount sinai and likewise that from algeria present slight differences and these forms have been considered by some authors as specifically distinct 46 gervais hist nat des mammiferes tome 1 page 292 but such slight differences would aid us little in explaining the more considerable differences characteristic of the several domestic races if the latter are the descendants of two or more closely allied species these with the exception of the common rabbit have been exterminated in a wild state and this is very improbable seeing with what pertinacity this animal holds its ground from these several reasons we may infer with safety that all the domestic breeds are the descendants of the common wild species but from what we hear of the marvellous success in france in rearing hybrids between the hare and rabbit 47 see dr p brocas interesting memoir on this subject in brownsequard journ de phys volume 2 page 367 it is possible though not probable from the great difficulty in making the first cross that some of the larger races which are coloured like the hare may have been modified by crosses with this animal nevertheless the chief differences in the skeletons of the several domestic breeds cannot as we shall presently see have been derived from a cross with the hare  there are many breeds which transmit their characters more or less truly every one has seen the enormous lopeared rabbits exhibited at our shows various allied subbreeds are reared on the continent such as the so called andalusian which is said to have a large head with a round forehead and to attain a greater size than any other kind another large paris breed is named the rouennais and has a square head the socalled patagonian rabbit has remarkably short ears and a large round head although i have not seen all these breeds i feel some doubt about there being any marked difference in the shape of their skulls 48 the skulls of these breeds are briefly described in the journal of horticulture may 7 1861 page 108 english lopeared rabbits often weigh 8 pounds or 10 pounds and one has been exhibited weighing 18 pounds whereas a fullsized wild rabbit weighs only about 3 14 pounds the head or skull in all the large lopeared rabbits examined by me is much longer relatively to its breadth than in the wild rabbit many of them have loose transverse folds of skin or dewlaps beneath the throat which can be pulled out so as to reach nearly to the ends of the jaws their ears are prodigiously developed and hang down on each side of their faces a rabbit was exhibited in 1867 with its two ears measured from the tip of one to the tip of the other 22 inches in length and each ear 5 38 inches in breadth in 1869 one was exhibited with ears measured in the same manner 23 18 in length and 5 12 in breadth thus exceeding any rabbit ever exhibited at a prize show in a common wild rabbit i found that the length of two ears from tip to tip was 7 58 inches and the breadth only 1 78 inch the weight of body in the larger rabbits and the development of their ears are the qualities which win prizes and have been carefully selected  the harecoloured or as it is sometimes called the belgian rabbit differs in nothing except colour from the other large breeds but mr j young of southampton a great breeder of this kind informs me that the females in all the specimens examined by him had only six mammae and this certainly was the case with two females which came into my possession mr bp brent however assures me that the number is variable with other domestic rabbits the common wild rabbit always has ten mammae the angora rabbit is remarkable from the length and fineness of its fur which even on the soles of the feet is of considerable length this breed is the only one which differs in its mental qualities for it is said to be much more sociable than other rabbits and the male shows no wish to destroy its young 49 journal of horticulture 1861 page 380 two live rabbits were brought to me from moscow of about the size of the wild species but with long soft fur different from that of the angora these moscow rabbits had pink eyes and were snowwhite excepting the ears two spots near the nose the upper and under surface of the tail and the hinder tarsi which were blackishbrown in short they were coloured nearly like the socalled himalayan rabbits presently to be described and differed from them only in the character of their fur there are two other breeds which come true to colour but differ in no other respect namely silvergreys and chinchillas lastly the nicard or dutch rabbit may be mentioned which varies in colour and is remarkable from its small size some specimens weighing only 1 14 pounds rabbits of this breed make excellent nurses for other and more delicate kinds 410 journal of horticulture may 28 1861 page 169  figure 5 halflop rabbit copied from es delamers work  certain characters are remarkably fluctuating or are very feebly transmitted by domestic rabbits thus one breeder tells me that with the smaller kinds he has hardly ever raised a whole litter of the same colour with the large lopeared breeds it is impossible says a great judge 411 journal of horticulture 1861 page 327 with respect to the ears see delamer on pigeons and rabbits 1854 page 141 also poultry chronicle volume 2 page 499 and ditto for 1854 page 586 to breed true to colour but by judicious crossing a great deal may be done towards it the fancier should know how his does are bred that is the colour of their parents nevertheless certain colours as we shall presently see are transmitted truly the dewlap is not strictly inherited lopeared rabbits with their ears hanging down flat on each side of the face do not transmit this character at all truly mr delamer remarks that with fancy rabbits when both the parents are perfectly formed have model ears and are handsomely marked their progeny do not invariably turn out the same when one parent or even both are oarlaps that is have their ears sticking out at right angles or when one parent or both are halflops that is have only one ear dependent there is nearly as good a chance of the progeny having both ears fulllop as if both parents had been thus characterised but i am informed if both parents have upright ears there is hardly a chance of a fulllop in some halflops the ear that hangs down is broader and longer than the upright ear 412 delamer pigeons and rabbits page 136 see also journal of horticulture 1861 page 375 so that we have the unusual case of a want of symmetry on the two sides this difference in the position and size of the two ears probably indicates that the lopping results from the great length and weight of the ear favoured no doubt by the weakness of the muscles consequent on disuse anderson 413 an account of the different kinds of sheep in the russian dominions 1794 page 39 mentions a breed having only a single ear and professor gervais another breed destitute of ears  we come now to the himalayan breed which is sometimes called chinese polish or russian these pretty rabbits are white or occasionally yellow excepting their ears nose feet and the upper side of the tail which are all brownishblack but as they have red eyes they may be considered as albinoes i have received several accounts of their breeding perfectly true from their symmetrical marks they were at first ranked as specifically distinct and were provisionally named l nigripes 414 proc zoolog soc june 23 1857 page 159 some good observers thought that they could detect a difference in their habits and stoutly maintained that they formed a new species the origin of this breed is so curious both in itself and as throwing some light on the complex laws of inheritance that it is worth giving in detail but it is first necessary briefly to describe two other breeds silvergreys or silversprigs generally have black heads and legs and their fine grey fur is interspersed with numerous black and white long hairs they breed perfectly true and have long been kept in warrens when they escape and cross with common rabbits the product as i hear from mr wyrley birch of wretham hall is not a mixture of the two colours but about half take after the one parent and the other half after the other parent secondly chinchillas or tame silvergreys i will use the former name have short paler mouse or slatecoloured fur interspersed with long blackish slatecoloured and white hairs 415 journal of horticulture april 9 1861 page 35 these rabbits breed perfectly true a writer stated in 1857 416 cottage gardener 1857 page 141 that he had produced himalayan rabbits in the following manner he had a breed of chinchillas which had been crossed with the common black rabbit and their offspring were either blacks or chinchillas these latter were again crossed with other chinchillas which had also been crossed with silvergreys and from this complicated cross himalayan rabbits were raised from these and other similar statements mr bartlett 417 mr bartlett in proc zoolog soc 1861 page 40 was led to make a careful trial in the zoological gardens and he found that by simply crossing silvergreys with chinchillas he could always produce some few himalayans and the latter notwithstanding their sudden origin if kept separate bred perfectly true but i have recently been assured the pure silvergreys of any subbreed occasionally produce himalayans  the himalayans when first born are quite white and are then true albinoes but in the course of a few months they gradually assume their dark ears nose feet and tail occasionally however as i am informed by mr wa wooler and the rev wd fox the young are born of a very pale grey colour and specimens of such fur were sent me by the former gentleman the grey tint however disappears as the animal comes to maturity so that with these himalayans there is a tendency strictly confined to early youth to revert to the colour of the adult silvergrey parentstock silvergreys and chinchillas on the other hand present a remarkable contrast with the himalayans in their colour whilst quite young for they are born perfectly black but soon assume their characteristic grey or silver tints the same thing occurs with grey horses which as long as they are foals are generally of a nearly black colour but soon become grey and get whiter and whiter as they grow older hence the usual rule is that himalayans are born white and afterwards become in certain parts of their bodies darkcoloured whilst silvergreys are born black and afterwards become sprinkled with white exceptions however and of a directly opposite nature occasionally occur in both cases for young silvergreys are sometimes born in warrens as i hear from mr w birch of a creamcolour but these young animals ultimately become black the himalayans on the other hand sometimes produce as is stated by an experienced amateur 418 phenomenon in himalayan rabbits in journal of horticulture january 27 1865 page 102 a single black young one in a litter and this before two months elapse becomes perfectly white  to sum up the whole curious case wild silvergreys may be considered as black rabbits which become grey at an early period of life when they are crossed with common rabbits the offspring are said not to have blended colours but to take after either parent and in this respect they resemble black and albino varieties of most quadrupeds which often transmit their colours in this same manner when they are crossed with chinchillas that is with a paler subvariety the young are at first pure albinoes but soon become darkcoloured in certain parts of their bodies and are then called himalayans the young himalayans however are sometimes at first either pale grey or completely black in either case changing after a time to white in a future chapter i shall advance a large body of facts showing that when two varieties are crossed both of which differ in colour from their parentstock there is a strong tendency in the young to revert to the aboriginal colour and what is very remarkable this reversion occasionally supervenes not before birth but during the growth of the animal hence if it could be shown that silvergreys and chinchillas were the offspring of a cross between a black and albino variety with the colours intimately blendeda supposition in itself not improbable and supported by the circumstance of silvergreys in warrens sometimes producing creamywhite young which ultimately become blackthen all the above given paradoxical facts on the changes of colour in silvergreys and in their descendants the himalayans would come under the law of reversion supervening at different periods of growth and in different degrees either to the original black or to the original albino parentvariety  it is also remarkable that himalayans though produced so suddenly breed true but as whilst young they are albinoes the case falls under a very general rule albinism being well known to be strongly inherited for instance with white mice and many other quadrupeds and even white flowers but why it may be asked do the ears tail nose and feet and no other part of the body revert to a black colour this apparently depends on a law which generally holds good namely that characters common to many species of a genusand this in fact implies long inheritance from the ancient progenitor of the genusare found to resist variation or to reappear if lost more persistently than the characters which are confined to the separate species now in the genus lepus a large majority of the species have their ears and the upper surface of the tail tinted black but the persistence of these marks is best seen in those species which in winter become white thus in scotland the l variabilis 419 gr waterhouse natural history of mammalia rodents 1846 pages 52 60 105 in its winter dress has a shade of colour on its nose and the tips of its ears are black in the l tibetanus the ears are black the upper surface of the tail greyishblack and the soles of the feet brown in l glacialis the winter fur is pure white except the soles of the feet and the points of the ears even in the variouslycoloured fancy rabbits we may often observe a tendency in these same parts to be more darkly tinted than the rest of the body thus the several coloured marks on the himalayan rabbits as they grow old are rendered intelligible i may add a nearly analogous case fancy rabbits very often have a white star on their foreheads and the common english hare whilst young generally has as i have myself observed a similar white star on its forehead  when variously coloured rabbits are set free in europe and are thus placed under their natural conditions they generally revert to the aboriginal grey colour this may be in part due to the tendency in all crossed animals as lately observed to revert to their primordial state but this tendency does not always prevail thus silvergrey rabbits are kept in warrens and remain true though living almost in a state of nature but a warren must not be stocked with both silvergreys and common rabbits otherwise in a few years there will be none but common greys surviving 420 delamer on pigeons and rabbits page 114 when rabbits run wild in foreign countries under new conditions of life they by no means always revert to their aboriginal colour in jamaica the feral rabbits are described as having been slatecoloured deeply tinted with sprinklings of white on the neck on the shoulders and on the back softening off to bluewhite under the breast and belly 421 gosse sojourn in jamaica 1851 page 441 as described by an excellent observer mr r hill this is the only known case in which rabbits have become feral in a hot country they can be kept however at loanda see livingstone travels page 407 in parts of india as i am informed by mr blyth they breed well but in this tropical island the conditions were not favourable to their increase and they never spread widely and are now extinct as i hear from mr r hill owing to a great fire which occurred in the woods rabbits during many years have run wild in the falkland islands they are abundant in certain parts but do not spread extensively most of them are of the common grey colour a few as i am informed by admiral sulivan are hare coloured and many are black often with nearly symmetrical white marks on their faces hence m lesson described the black variety as a distinct species under the name of lepus magellanicus but this as i have elsewhere shown is an error 422 darwin journal of researches page 193 and zoology of the voyage of the beagle mammalia page 92 within recent times the sealers have stocked some of the small outlying islets in the falkland group with rabbits and on pebble islet as i hear from admiral sulivan a large proportion are harecoloured whereas on rabbit islet a large proportion are of a bluish colour which is not elsewhere seen how the rabbits were coloured which were turned out of these islets is not known  the rabbits which have become feral on the island of porto santo near madeira deserve a fuller account in 1418 or 1419 j gonzales zarco 423 kerr collection of voyages volume 2 page 177 page 205 for cada mosto according to a work published in lisbon in 1717 entitled historia insulana written by a jesuit the rabbits were turned out in 1420 some authors believe that the island was discovered in 1413 happened to have a female rabbit on board which had produced young during the voyage and he turned them all out on the island these animals soon increased so rapidly that they became a nuisance and actually caused the abandonment of the settlement thirtyseven years subsequently cada mosto describes them as innumerable nor is this surprising as the island was not inhabited by any beast of prey or by any terrestrial mammal we do not know the character of the motherrabbit but it was probably the common domesticated kind the spanish peninsula whence zarco sailed is known to have abounded with the common wild species at the most remote historical period and as these rabbits were taken on board for food it is improbable that they should have been of any peculiar breed that the breed was well domesticated is shown by the doe having littered during the voyage mr wollaston at my request brought home two of these feral rabbits in spirits of wine and subsequently mr w haywood sent to me three more specimens in brine and two alive these seven specimens though caught at different periods closely resembled each other they were full grown as shown by the state of their bones although the conditions of life in porto santo are evidently highly favourable to rabbits as proved by their extraordinarily rapid increase yet they differ conspicuously in their small size from the wild english rabbit four english rabbits measured from the incisors to the anus varied between 17 and 17 34 inches in length whilst two of the porto santo rabbits were only 14 12 and 15 inches in length but the decrease in size is best shown by weight four wild english rabbits averaged 3 pounds 5 ounces whilst one of the porto santo rabbits which had lived for four years in the zoological gardens but had become thin weighed only 1 pound 9 ounces a fairer test is afforded by the comparison of the wellcleaned limbbones of a porto santo rabbit killed on the island with the same bones of a wild english rabbit of average size and they differed in the proportion of rather less than five to nine so that the porto santo rabbits have decreased nearly three inches in length and almost half in weight of body 424 something of the same kind has occurred on the island of lipari where according to spallanzani voyage dans les deux siciles quoted by godron de lespece page 364 a countryman turned out some rabbits which multiplied prodigiously but says spallanzani les lapins de lile de lipari sont plus petits que ceux quon eleve en domesticite the head has not decreased in length proportionally with the body and the capacity of the brain case is as we shall hereafter see singularly variable i prepared four skulls and these resembled each other more closely than do generally the skulls of wild english rabbits but the only difference in structure which they presented was that the supraorbital processes of the frontal bones were narrower  in colour the porto santo rabbit differs considerably from the common rabbit the upper surface is redder and is rarely interspersed with any black or blacktipped hairs the throat and certain parts of the under surface instead of being pure white are generally pale grey or leaden colour but the most remarkable difference is in the ears and tail i have examined many fresh english rabbits and the large collection of skins in the british museum from various countries and all have the upper surface of the tail and the tips of the ears clothed with blackishgrey fur and this is given in most works as one of the specific characters of the rabbit now in the seven porto santo rabbits the upper surface of the tail was reddishbrown and the tips of the ears had no trace of the black edging but here we meet with a singular circumstance in june 1861 i examined two of these rabbits recently sent to the zoological gardens and their tails and ears were coloured as just described but when one of their dead bodies was sent to me in february 1865 the ears were plainly edged and the upper surface of the tail was covered with blackishgrey fur and the whole body was much less red so that under the english climate this individual rabbit had recovered the proper colour of its fur in rather less than four years  the two little porto santo rabbits whilst alive in the zoological gardens had a remarkably different appearance from the common kind they were extraordinarily wild and active so that many persons exclaimed on seeing them that they were more like large rats than rabbits they were nocturnal to an unusual degree in their habits and their wildness was never in the least subdued so that the superintendent mr bartlett assured me that he had never had a wilder animal under his charge this is a singular fact considering that they are descended from a domesticated breed i was so much surprised at it that i requested mr haywood to make inquiries on the spot whether they were much hunted by the inhabitants or persecuted by hawks or cats or other animals but this is not the case and no cause can be assigned for their wildness they live both on the central higher rocky land and near the seacliffs and from being exceedingly shy and timid seldom appear in the lower and cultivated districts they are said to produce from four to six young at a birth and their breeding season is in july and august lastly and this is a highly remarkable fact mr bartlett could never succeed in getting these two rabbits which were both males to associate or breed with the females of several breeds which were repeatedly placed with them  if the history of these porto santo rabbits had not been known most naturalists on observing their much reduced size their colour reddish above and grey beneath their tails and ears not tipped with black would have ranked them as a distinct species they would have been strongly confirmed in this view by seeing them alive in the zoological gardens and hearing that they refused to couple with other rabbits yet this rabbit which there can be little doubt would thus have been ranked as a distinct species as certainly originated since the year 1420 finally from the three cases of the rabbits which have run wild in porto santo jamaica and the falkland islands we see that these animals do not under new conditions of life revert to or retain their aboriginal character as is so generally asserted to be the case by most authors  osteological characters  when we remember on the one hand how frequently it is stated that important parts of the structure never vary and on the other hand on what small differences in the skeleton fossil species have often been founded the variability of the skull and of some other bones in the domesticated rabbit well deserves attention it must not be supposed that the more important differences immediately to be described strictly characterise any one breed all that can be said is that they are generally present in certain breeds we should bear in mind that selection has not been applied to fix any character in the skeleton and that the animals have not had to support themselves under uniform habits of life we cannot account for most of the differences in the skeleton but we shall see that the increased size of the body due to careful nurture and continued selection has affected the head in a particular manner even the elongation and lopping of the ears have influenced in a small degree the form of the whole skull the want of exercise has apparently modified the proportional length of the limbs in comparison with that of the body  as a standard of comparison i prepared skeletons of two wild rabbits from kent one from the shetland islands and one from antrim in ireland as all the bones in these four specimens from such distant localities closely resembled each other presenting scarcely any appreciable difference it may be concluded that the bones of the wild rabbit are generally uniform in character  skull  i have carefully examined skulls of ten large lopeared rabbits and of five common domestic rabbits which latter differ from the lopeared only in not having such large bodies or ears yet both larger than in the wild rabbit first for the ten lopeared rabbits in all these the skull is remarkably elongated in comparison with its breadth in a wild rabbit the length was 315 inches in a large fancy rabbit 43 whilst the breadth of the cranium enclosing the brain was in both almost exactly the same even by taking as the standard of comparison the widest part of the zygomatic arch the skulls of the lopeared are proportionally to their breadth threequarters of an inch too long the depth of the head has increased almost in the same proportion with the length it is the breadth alone which has not increased the parietal and occipital bones enclosing the brain are less arched both in a longitudinal and transverse line than in the wild rabbit so that the shape of the cranium is somewhat different the surface is rougher less cleanly sculptured and the lines of sutures are more prominent  although the skulls of the large lopeared rabbits in comparison with those of the wild rabbit are much elongated relatively to their breadth yet relatively to the size of body they are far from elongated the lopeared rabbits which i examined were though not fat more than twice as heavy as the wild specimens but the skull was very far from being twice as long even if we take the fairer standard of the length of body from the nose to the anus the skull is not on an average as long as it ought to be by a third of an inch in the small feral porto santo rabbit on the other hand the head relatively to the length of body is about a quarter of an inch too long  this elongation of the skull relatively to its breadth i find a universal character not only with the large lopeared rabbits but in all the artificial breeds as is well seen in the skull of the angora i was at first much surprised at the fact and could not imagine why domestication could produce this uniform result but the explanation seems to lie in the circumstance that during a number of generations the artificial races have been closely confined and have had little occasion to exert either their senses or intellect or voluntary muscles consequently the brain as we shall presently more fully see has not increased relatively with the size of body as the brain has not increased the bony case enclosing it has not increased and this has evidently affected through correlation the breadth of the entire skull from end to end  figure 6 skull of wild rabbit of natural size  figure 7 skull of large lopeared rabbit of natural size  figure 8 part of zygomatic arch showing the projecting end of the malar bone of the auditory meatus of natural size upper figure wild rabbit lower figure lopeared harecoloured rabbit  figure 9 posterior end of skull of natural size showing the inter parietal bone a wild rabbit b feral rabbit from island of p santo near madeira c large lopeared rabbit  in all the skulls of the large lopeared rabbits the supraorbital plates or processes of the frontal bones are much broader than in the wild rabbit and they generally project more upwards in the zygomatic arch the posterior or projecting point of the malarbone is broader and blunter and in the specimen figure 8 it is so in a remarkable degree this point approaches nearer to the auditory meatus than in the wild rabbit as may be best seen in figure 8 but this circumstance mainly depends on the changed direction of the meatus the interparietal bone see figure 9 differs much in shape in the several skulls generally it is more oval that is more extended in the line of the longitudinal axis of the skull than in the wild rabbit the posterior margin of the square raised platform 425 waterhouse nat hist mammalia volume 2 page 36 of the occiput instead of being truncated or projecting slightly as in the wild rabbit is in most lopeared rabbits pointed as in figure 9 c the paramastoids relatively to the size of the skull are generally much thicker than in the wild rabbit  figure 10 occipital foramen of natural size ina wild rabbit b large lopeared rabbit  the occipital foramen figure 10 presents some remarkable differences in the wild rabbit the lower edge between the condyles is considerably and almost angularly hollowed out and the upper edge is deeply and squarely notched hence the longitudinal axis exceeds the transverse axis in the skulls of the lopeared rabbits the transverse axis exceeds the longitudinal for in none of these skulls was the lower edge between the condyles so deeply hollowed out in five of them there was no upper square notch in three there was a trace of the notch and in two alone it was well developed these differences in the shape of the foramen are remarkable considering that it gives passage to so important a structure as the spinal marrow though apparently the outline of the latter is not affected by the shape of the passage  figure 11 skull of natural size of halflop rabbit showing the different direction of the auditory meatus on the two sides and the consequent general distortion of the skull the left ear of the animal or right side of figure lopped forwards  in all the skulls of the large lopeared rabbits the bony auditory meatus is conspicuously larger than in the wild rabbit in a skull 43 inches in length and which barely exceeded in breadth the skull of a wild rabbit which was 315 inches in length the longer diameter of the meatus was exactly twice as great the orifice is more compressed and its margin on the side nearest the skull stands up higher than the outer side the whole meatus is directed more forwards as in breeding lopeared rabbits the length of the ears and their consequent lopping and lying flat on the face are the chief points of excellence there can hardly be a doubt that the great change in the size form and direction of the bony meatus relatively to this same part in the wild rabbit is due to the continued selection of individuals having larger and larger ears the influence of the external ear on the bony meatus is well shown in the skulls i have examined three of halflops see figure 5 in which one ear stands upright and the other and longer ear hangs down for in these skulls there was a plain difference in the form and direction of the bony meatus on the two sides but it is a much more interesting fact that the changed direction and increased size of the bony meatus have slightly affected on the same side the structure of the whole skull i here give a drawing figure 11 of the skull of a halflop and it may be observed that the suture between the parietal and frontal bones does not run strictly at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the skull the left frontal bone projects beyond the right one both the posterior and anterior margins of the left zygomatic arch on the side of the lopping ear stand a little in advance of the corresponding bones on the opposite side even the lower jaw is affected and the condyles are not quite symmetrical that on the left standing a little in advance of that on the right this seems to me a remarkable case of correlation of growth who would have surmised that by keeping an animal during many generations under confinement and so leading to the disuse of the muscles of the ears and by continually selecting individuals with the longest and largest ears he would thus indirectly have affected almost every suture in the skull and the form of the lower jaw  in the large lopeared rabbits the only difference in the lower jaw in comparison with that of the wild rabbit is that the posterior margin of the ascending ramus is broader and more inflected the teeth in neither jaw present any difference except that the small incisors beneath the large ones are proportionately a little longer the molar teeth have increased in size proportionately with the increased width of the skull measured across the zygomatic arch and not proportionally with its increased length the inner line of the sockets of the molar teeth in the upper jaw of the wild rabbit forms a perfectly straight line but in some of the largest skulls of the lopeared this line was plainly bowed inwards in one specimen there was an additional molar tooth on each side of the upper jaw between the molars and premolars but these two teeth did not correspond in size and as no rodent has seven molars this is merely a monstrosity though a curious one  the five other skulls of common domestic rabbits some of which approach in size the abovedescribed largest skulls whilst the others exceed but little those of the wild rabbit are only worth notice as presenting a perfect gradation in all the abovespecified differences between the skulls of the largest lopeared and wild rabbits in all however the supra orbital plates are rather larger and in all the auditory meatus is larger in conformity with the increased size of the external ears than in the wild rabbit the lower notch in the occipital foramen in some was not so deep as in the wild rabbit but in all five skulls the upper notch was well developed  the skull of the angora rabbit like the latter five skulls is intermediate in general proportions and in most other characters between those of the largest lopeared and wild rabbits it presents only one singular character though considerably longer than the skull of the wild rabbit the breadth measured within the posterior supraorbital fissures is nearly a third less than in the wild the skulls of the silvergrey and chinchilla and himalayan rabbits are more elongated than in the wild with broader supraorbital plates but differ little in any other respect excepting that the upper and lower notches of the occipital foramen are not so deep or so well developed the skull of the moscow rabbit scarcely differs at all from that of the wild rabbit in the porto santo feral rabbits the supraorbital plates are generally narrower and more pointed than in our wild rabbits  as some of the largest lopeared rabbits of which i prepared skeletons were coloured almost like hares and as these latter animals and rabbits have as it is affirmed been recently crossed in france it might be thought that some of the abovedescribed characters had been derived from a cross at a remote period with the hare consequently i examined skulls of the hare but no light could thus be thrown on the peculiarities of the skulls of the larger rabbits it is however an interesting fact as illustrating the law that varieties of one species often assume the characters of other species of the same genus that i found on comparing the skulls of ten species of hares in the british museum that they differed from each other chiefly in the very same points in which domestic rabbits varynamely in general proportions in the form and size of the supraorbital plates in the form of the free end of the malar bone and in the line of suture separating the occipital and frontal bones moreover two eminently variable characters in the domestic rabbit namely the outline of the occipital foramen and the shape of the raised platform of the occiput were likewise variable in two instances in the same species of hare  vertebrae  the number is uniform in all the skeletons which i have examined with two exceptions namely in one of the small feral porto santo rabbits and in one of the largest lopeared kinds both of these had as usual seven cervical twelve dorsal with ribs but instead of seven lumbar both had eight lumbar vertebrae this is remarkable as gervais gives seven as the number for the whole genus lepus the caudal vertebrae apparently differ by two or three but i did not attend to them and they are difficult to count with certainty  figure 12 atlas vertebrae of natural size inferior surface viewed obliquely upper figure wild rabbit lower figure harecoloured large lopeared

differ more conspicuously when their anterior articular surfaces are compared for the extremities of the anterodorsal processes in the wild rabbit are simply rounded whilst in the lopeared they are trifid with a deep central pit the canal for the spinal marrow in the lopeared b b is more elongated in a transverse direction than in the wild rabbit and the passages for the arteries are of a slightly different shape these several differences in this vertebra seem to me well deserving attention  first dorsal vertebra  its neural spine varies in length in the wild rabbit being sometimes very short but generally more than half as long as that of the second dorsal but i have seen it in two large lopeared rabbits threefourths of the length of that of the second dorsal vertebra  figure 14 dorsal vertebrae from sixth to tenth inclusive of natural size viewed laterally a wild rabbit b large harecoloured so called spanish rabbit  ninth and tenth dorsal vertebrae  in the wild rabbit the neural spine of the ninth vertebra is just perceptibly thicker than that of the eighth and the neural spine of the tenth is plainly thicker and shorter than those of all the anterior vertebrae in the large lopeared rabbits the neural spines of the tenth ninth and eighth vertebrae and even in a slight degree that of the seventh are very much thicker and of somewhat different shape in comparison with those of the wild rabbit so that this part of the vertebral column differs considerably in appearance from the same part in the wild rabbit and closely resembles in an interesting manner these same vertebrae in some species of hares in the angora chinchilla and himalayan rabbits the neural spines of the eighth and ninth vertebrae are in a slight degree thicker than in the wild on the other hand in one of the feral porto santo rabbits which in most of its characters deviates from the common wild rabbit in a direction exactly opposite to that assumed by the large lopeared rabbits the neural spines of the ninth and tenth vertebrae were not at all larger than those of the several anterior vertebra in this same porto santo specimen there was no trace in the ninth vertebra of the anterior lateral processes see figure 14 which are plainly developed in all british wild rabbits and still more plainly developed in the large lopeared rabbits in a halfwild rabbit from sandon park 426 these rabbits have run wild for a considerable time in sandon park and in other places in staffordshire and shropshire they originated as i have been informed by the gamekeeper from variouslycoloured domestic rabbits which had been turned out they vary in colour but many are symmetrically coloured being white with a streak along the spine and with the ears and certain marks about the head of a blackishgrey tint they have rather longer bodies than common rabbits a haemal spine was moderately well developed on the under side of the twelfth dorsal vertebra and i have seen this in no other specimen  lumbar vertebrae  i have stated that in two cases there were eight instead of seven lumbar vertebrae the third lumbar vertebrae in one skeleton of a wild british rabbit and in one of the porto santo feral rabbits had a haemal spine whilst in four skeletons of large lopeared rabbits and in the himalayan rabbit this same vertebra had a well developed haemal spine  pelvis  in four wild specimens this bone was almost absolutely identical in shape but in several domesticated breeds shades of differences could be distinguished in the large lopeared rabbits the whole upper part of the ilium is straighter or less splayed outwards than in the wild rabbit and the tuberosity on the inner lip of the anterior and upper part of the ilium is proportionally more prominent  figure 15

does the apex of the acromion in sharpness and the part just below the rectangular bar in breadth but the variations in these respects in the wild rabbit are very slight whilst in the large lopeared rabbits they are considerable thus in some specimens b the oblique terminal knob is developed into a short bar forming an obtuse angle with the rectangular bar in another specimen c these two unequal bars form nearly a straight line the apex of the acromion varies much in breadth and sharpness as may be seen by comparing figures b c and d  limbs  in these i could detect no variation but the bones of the feet were too troublesome to compare with much care  i have now described all the differences in the skeletons which i have observed it is impossible not to be struck with the high degree of variability or plasticity of many of the bones we see how erroneous the oftenrepeated statement is that only the crests of the bones which give attachment to muscles vary in shape and that only parts of slight importance become modified under domestication no one will say for instance that the occipital foramen or the atlas or the third cervical vertebra is a part of slight importance if the several vertebrae of the wild and lopeared rabbits of which figures have been given had been found fossil palaeontologists would have declared without hesitation that they had belonged to distinct species  the effects of the use and disuse of parts  in the large lopeared rabbits the relative proportional length of the bones of the same leg and of the front and hind legs compared with each other have remained nearly the same as in the wild rabbit but in weight the bones of the hind legs apparently have not increased in due proportion with the front legs the weight of the whole body in the large rabbits examined by me was from twice to twice and a half as great as that of the wild rabbit and the weight of the bones of the front and hind limbs taken together excluding the feet on account of the difficulty of cleaning so many small bones has increased in the large lopeared rabbits in nearly the same proportion consequently in due proportion to the weight of body which they have to support if we take the length of the body as the standard of comparison the limbs of the large rabbits have not increased in length in due proportion by one inch and a half again if we take as the standard of comparison the length of the skull which as we have before seen has not increased in length in due proportion to the length of body the limbs will be found to be proportionally with those of the wild rabbit from half to threequarters of an inch too short hence whatever standard of comparison be taken the limbbones of the large lopeared rabbits have not increased in length though they have in weight in full proportion to the other parts of the frame and this i presume may be accounted for by the inactive life which during many generations they have spent nor has the scapula increased in length in due proportion to the increased length of the body  the capacity of the osseous case of the brain is a more interesting point to which i was led to attend by finding as previously stated that with all domesticated rabbits the length of the skull relatively to its breadth has greatly increased in comparison with that of the wild rabbits if we had possessed a large number of domesticated rabbits of nearly the same size with the wild rabbits it would have been a simple task to have measured and compared the capacities of their skulls but this is not the case almost all the domestic breeds have larger bodies than wild rabbits and the lopeared kinds are more than double their weight as a small animal has to exert its senses intellect and instincts equally with a large animal we ought not by any means to expect an animal twice or thrice as large as another to have a brain of double or treble the size 427 see prof owens remarks on this subject in his paper on the zoological significance of the brain etc of man etc read before brit association 1862 with respect to birds see proc zoolog soc january 11 1848 page 8 now after weighing the bodies of four wild rabbits and of four large but not fattened lopeared rabbits i find that on an average the wild are to the lopeared in weight as 1 to 217 in average length of body as 1 to 141 whilst in capacity of skull they are as 1 to 115 hence we see that the capacity of the skull and consequently the size of the brain has increased but little relatively to the increased size of the body and this fact explains the narrowness of the skull relatively to its length in all domestic rabbits  table 3 measurements of wild and semiwild rabbits  i length of skull inches  ii length of body from incisors

of eleven thoroughly domesticated kinds as these rabbits differ so greatly in size it is necessary to have some standard by which to compare the capacities of their skulls i have selected the length of skull as the best standard for in the larger rabbits it has not as already stated increased in length so much as the body but as the skull like every other part varies in length neither it nor any other part affords a perfect standard  in the first column of figures the extreme length of the skull is given in inches and decimals i am aware that these measurements pretend to greater accuracy than is possible but i have found it the least trouble to record the exact length which the compass gave the second and third columns give the length and weight of body whenever these observations were made the fourth column gives the capacity of the skull by the weight of small shot with which the skulls were filled but it is not pretended that these weights are accurate within a few grains in the fifth column the capacity is given which the skull ought to have had by calculation according to the length of skull in comparison with that of the wild rabbit no 1 in the sixth column the difference between the actual and calculated capacities and in the seventh the percentage of increase or decrease are given for instance as the wild rabbit no 5 has a shorter and lighter body than the wild rabbit no 1 we might have expected that its skull would have had less capacity the actual capacity as expressed by the weight of shot is 875 grains which is 97 grains less than that of the first rabbit but comparing these two rabbits by the length of their skulls we see that in no 1 the skull is 315 inches in length and in no 5 296 inches in length according to this ratio the brain of no 5 ought to have had a capacity of 913 grains of shot which is above the actual capacity but only by 38 grains or to put the case in another way as in column vii the brain of this small rabbit no 5 for every 100 grains of weight is only 4 grains too lightthat is it ought according to the standard rabbit no 1 to have been 4 per cent heavier i have taken the rabbit no 1 as the standard of comparison because of the skulls having a full average length this has the least capacity so that it is the least favourable to the result which i wish to show namely that the brain in all longdomesticated rabbits has decreased in size either actually or relatively to the length of the head and body in comparison with the brain of the wild rabbit had i taken the irish rabbit no 3 as the standard the following results would have been somewhat more striking  turning to table 3 the first four wild rabbits have skulls of the same length and these differ but little in capacity the sandon rabbit no 4 is interesting as though now wild it is known to be descended from a domesticated breed as is still shown by its peculiar colouring and longer body nevertheless the skull has recovered its normal length and full capacity the next three rabbits are wild but of small size and they all have skulls with slightly lessened capacities the three porto santo feral rabbits nos 8 to 10 offer a perplexing case their bodies are greatly reduced in size as in a lesser degree are their skulls in length and in actual capacity in comparison with the skulls of wild english rabbits but when we compare the capacities of the skull in the three porto santo rabbits we observe a surprising difference which does not stand in any relation to the slight difference in the length of their skulls nor as i believe to any difference in the size of their bodies but i neglected weighing separately their bodies i can hardly suppose that the medullary matter of the brain in these three rabbits living under similar conditions can differ as much as is indicated by the proportional difference of capacity in their skulls nor do i know whether it is possible that one brain may contain considerably more fluid than another hence i can throw no light on this case  looking to the lower half of table 3 which gives the measurements of domesticated rabbits we see that in all the capacity of the skull is less but in very various degrees than might have been anticipated according to the length of their skulls relatively to that of the wild rabbit no 1 in line 22 the average measurements of seven large lopeared rabbits are given now the question arises has the average capacity of the skull in these seven large rabbits increased as much as might have been expected from the greatly increased size of body we may endeavour to answer this question in two ways in the upper half of the table we have measurements of the skulls of six small wild rabbits nos 5 to 10 and we find that on an average the skulls are 18 of an inch shorter and in capacity 91 grains less than the average length and capacity of the three first wild rabbits on the list the seven large lopeared rabbits on an average have skulls 411 inches in length and 1136 grains in capacity so that these skulls have increased in length more than five times as much as the skulls of the six small wild rabbits have decreased in length hence we might have expected that the skulls of the large lopeared rabbits would have increased in capacity five times as much as the skulls of the six small rabbits have decreased in capacity and this would have given an average increased capacity of 455 grains whilst the real average increase is only 155 grains again the large lopeared rabbits have bodies of nearly the same weight and size as the common hare but their heads are longer consequently if the lopeared rabbits had been wild it might have been expected that their skulls would have had nearly the same capacity as that of the skull of the hare but this is far from being the case for the average capacity of the two hareskulls nos 23 24 is so much larger than the average capacity of the seven lopeared skulls that the latter would have to be increased 21 per cent to come up to the standard of the hare 423 this standard is apparently considerably too low for dr crisp proc zoolog soc 1861 page 86 gives 210 grains as the actual weight of the brain of a hare which weighed 7 pounds and 125 grains as the weight of the brain of a rabbit which weighed 3 pounds 5 ounces that is the same weight as the rabbit no 1 in my list now the contents of the skull of rabbit no 1 in shot is in my table 972 grains and according to dr crisps ratio of 125 to 210 the skull of the hare ought to have contained 1632 grains of shot instead of only in the largest hare in my table 1455 grains  i have previously remarked that if we had possessed many domestic rabbits of the same average size with the wild rabbit it would have been easy to compare the capacity of their skulls now the himalayan moscow and angora rabbits nos 11 12 13 of table 3 are only a little larger in body and have skulls only a little longer than the wild animal and we see that the actual capacity of their skulls is less than in the wild animal and considerably less by calculation column 7 according to the difference in the length of their skulls the narrowness of the braincase in these three rabbits could be plainly seen and proved by external measurement the chinchilla rabbit no 14 is a considerably larger animal than the wild rabbit yet the capacity of its skull only slightly exceeds that of the wild rabbit the angora rabbit no 13 offers the most remarkable case this animal in its pure white colour and length of silky fur bears the stamp of long domesticity it has a considerably longer head and body than the wild rabbit but the actual capacity of its skull is less than that of even the little wild porto santo rabbits by the standard of the length of skull the capacity see column 7 is only half of what it ought to have been i kept this individual animal alive and it was not unhealthy nor idiotic this case of the angora rabbit so much surprised me that i repeated all the measurements and found them correct i have also compared the capacity of the skull of the angora with that of the wild rabbit by other standards namely by the length and weight of the body and by the weight of the limbbones but by all these standards the brain appears to be much too small though in a less degree when the standard of the limb bones was used and this latter circumstance may probably be accounted for by the limbs of this anciently domesticated breed having become much reduced in weight from its longcontinued inactive life hence i infer that in the angora breed which is said to differ from other breeds in being quieter and more social the capacity of the skull has really undergone a remarkable amount of reduction  from the several facts above givennamely firstly that the actual capacity of the skull in the himalayan moscow and angora breeds is less than in the wild rabbit though they are in all their dimensions rather larger animals secondly that the capacity of the skull of the large lop eared rabbits has not been increased in nearly the same ratio as the capacity of the skull of the smaller wild rabbits has been decreased and thirdly that the capacity of the skull in these same large lopeared rabbits is very inferior to that of the hare an animal of nearly the same sizei conclude notwithstanding the remarkable differences in capacity in the skulls of the small porto santo rabbits and likewise in the large lopeared kinds that in all longdomesticated rabbits the brain has either by no means increased in due proportion with the increased length of the head and increased size of the body or that it has actually decreased in size relatively to what would have occurred had these animals lived in a state of nature when we remember that rabbits from having been domesticated and closely confined during many generations cannot have exerted their intellect instincts senses and voluntary movements either in escaping from various dangers or in searching for food we may conclude that their brains will have been feebly exercised and consequently have suffered in development we thus see that the most important and complicated organ in the whole organisation is subject to the law of decrease in size from disuse  finally let us sum up the more important modifications which domestic rabbits have undergone together with their causes as far as we can obscurely see them by the supply of abundant and nutritious food together with little exercise and by the continued selection of the heaviest individuals the weight of the larger breeds has been more than doubled the bones of the limbs taken together have increased in weight in due proportion with the increased weight of body but the hind legs have increased less than the front legs but in length they have not increased in due proportion and this may have been caused by the want of proper exercise with the increased size of the body the third cervical has assumed characters proper to the fourth cervical vertebra and the eighth and ninth dorsal vertebrae have similarly assumed characters proper to the tenth and posterior vertebrae the skull in the larger breeds has increased in length but not in due proportion with the increased length of body the brain has not duly increased in dimensions or has even actually decreased and consequently the bony case for the brain has remained narrow and by correlation has affected the bones of the face and the entire length of the skull the skull has thus acquired its characteristic narrowness from unknown causes the supraorbital process of the frontal bones and the free end of the malar bones have increased in breadth and in the larger breeds the occipital foramen is generally much less deeply notched than in wild rabbits certain parts of the scapula and the terminal sternal bones have become highly variable in shape the ears have been increased enormously in length and breadth through continued selection their weight conjoined probably with the disuse of their muscles has caused them to lop downwards and this has affected the position and form of the bony auditory meatus and this again by correlation the position in a slight degree of almost every bone in the upper part of the skull and even the position of the condyles of the lower jaw   chapter 1v  domestic pigeons

beak length of sternum scapula and furculum length of wings summary on the points of difference in the several breeds  i have been led to study domestic pigeons with particular care because the evidence that all the domestic races are descended from one known source is far clearer than with any other anciently domesticated animal secondly because many treatises in several languages some of them old have been written on the pigeon so that we are enabled to trace the history of several breeds and lastly because from causes which we can partly understand the amount of variation has been extraordinarily great the details will often be tediously minute but no one who really wants to understand the progress of change in domestic animals and especially no one who has kept pigeons and has marked the great difference between the breeds and the trueness with which most of them propagate their kind will doubt that this minuteness is worth while notwithstanding the clear evidence that all the breeds are the descendants of a single species i could not persuade myself until some years had passed that the whole amount of difference between them had arisen since man first domesticated the wild rockpigeon  i have kept alive all the most distinct breeds which i could procure in england or from the continent and have prepared skeletons of all i have received skins from persia and a large number from india and other quarters of the world 51 the hon c murray has sent me some very valuable specimens from persia and hm consul mr keith abbott has given me information on the pigeons of the same country i am deeply indebted to sir walter elliot for an immense collection of skins from madras with much information regarding them mr blyth has freely communicated to me his stores of knowledge on this and all other related subjects the rajah sir james brooke sent me specimens from borneo as has hm consul mr swinhoe from amoy in china and dr daniell from the west coast of africa since my admission into two of the london pigeonclubs i have received the kindest assistance from many of the most eminent amateurs 52 mr bp brent well known for his various contributions to poultry literature has aided me in every way during several years so has mr tegetmeier with unwearied kindness this latter gentleman who is well known for his works on poultry and who has largely bred pigeons has looked over this and the following chapters mr bult formerly showed me his unrivalled collection of pouters and gave me specimens i had access to mr wickings collection which contained a greater assortment of kinds than could anywhere else be seen and he has always aided me with specimens and information given in the freest manner mr haynes and mr corker have given me specimens of their magnificent carriers to mr harrison weir i am likewise indebted nor must i by any means pass over the assistance received from mr jm eaton mr baker mr evans and mr j baily jun of mountstreetto the latter gentleman i have been indebted for some valuable specimens to all these gentlemen i beg permission to return my sincere and cordial thanks  the races of the pigeon which can be distinguished and which breed true are very numerous mm boitard and corbie 53 les pigeons de voliere et de colombier paris 1824 during fortyfive years the sole occupation of m corbie was the care of the pigeons belonging to the duchess of berry bonizzi has described a large number of coloured varieties in italy le variazioni dei colombi domestici padova 1873 describe in detail 122 kinds and i could add several european kinds not known to them in india judging from the skins sent me there are many breeds unknown here and sir w elliot informs me that a collection imported by an indian merchant into madras from cairo and constantinople included several kinds unknown in india i have no doubt that there exist considerably above 150 kinds which breed true and have been separately named but of these the far greater number differ from each other only in unimportant characters such differences will be here entirely passed over and i shall confine myself to the more important points of structure that many important differences exist we shall presently see i have looked through the magnificent collection of the columbidae in the british museum and with the exception of a few forms such as the didunculus calaenas goura etc i do not hesitate to affirm that some domestic races of the rockpigeon differ fully as much from each other in external characters as do the most distinct natural genera we may look in vain through the 288 known species 54 coup doeil sur lordre des pigeons par prince cl bonaparte paris 1855 this author makes 288 species ranked under 85 genera for a beak so small and conical as that of the shortfaced tumbler for one so broad and short as that of the barb for one so long straight and narrow with its enormous wattles as that of the english carrier for an expanded upraised tail like that of the fantail or for an oesophagus like that of the pouter i do not for a moment pretend that the domestic races differ from each other in their whole organisation as much as the more distinct natural genera i refer only to external characters on which however it must be confessed that most genera of birds have been founded when in a future chapter we discuss the principle of selection as followed by man we shall clearly see why the differences between the domestic races are almost always confined to external or at least to externally visible characters  owing to the amount and gradations of difference between the several breeds i have found it indispensable in the following classification to rank them under groups races and subraces to which varieties and sub varieties all strictly inheriting their proper characters must often be added even with the individuals of the same subvariety when long kept by different fanciers different strains can sometimes be recognised there can be no doubt that if wellcharacterised forms of the several races had been found wild all would have been ranked as distinct species and several of them would certainly have been placed by ornithologists in distinct genera a good classification of the various domestic breeds is extremely difficult owing to the manner in which many of the forms graduate into each other but it is curious how exactly the same difficulties are encountered and the same rules have to be followed as in the classification of any natural but difficult group of organic beings an artificial classification might be followed which would present fewer difficulties than a natural classification but then it would interrupt many plain affinities extreme forms can readily be defined but intermediate and troublesome forms often destroy our definitions forms which may be called aberrant must sometimes be included within groups to which they do not accurately belong characters of all kinds must be used but as with birds in a state of nature those afforded by the beak are the best and most readily appreciated it is not possible to weigh the importance of all the characters which have to be used so as to make the groups and subgroups of equal value lastly a group may contain only one race and another and less distinctly defined group may contain several races and subraces and in this case it is difficult as in the classification of natural species to avoid placing too high a value on the number of forms which a group may contain  in my measurements i have never trusted to the eye and when speaking of a part being large or small i always refer to the wild rockpigeon columba livia as the standard of comparison the measurements are given in decimals of an inch  55 as i so

group includes a single race that of the pouters if the most strongly marked subrace be taken namely the improved english pouter this is perhaps the most distinct of all domesticated pigeons  race i pouter pigeons kropftauben german grossesgorges or boulans french  oesophagus of great size barely separated from the crop often inflated body and legs elongated beak of moderate dimensions  subrace 1i  the improved english pouter when its crop is fully inflated presents a truly astonishing appearance the habit of slightly inflating the crop is common to all domestic pigeons but is carried to an extreme in the pouter the crop does not differ except in size from that of other pigeons but is less plainly separated by an oblique constriction from the oesophagus the diameter of the upper part of the oesophagus is immense even close up to the head the beak in one bird which i possessed was almost completely buried when the oesophagus was fully expanded the males especially when excited pout more than the females and they glory in exercising this power if a bird will not to use the technical expression play the fancier as i have witnessed by taking the beak into his mouth blows him up like a balloon and the bird then puffed up with wind and pride struts about retaining his magnificent size as long as he can pouters often take flight with their crops inflated after one of my birds had swallowed a good meal of peas and water as he flew up in order to disgorge them and feed his nearly fledged young i heard the peas rattling in his inflated crop as if in a bladder when flying they often strike the backs of their wings together and thus make a clapping noise  pouters stand remarkably upright and their bodies are thin and elongated in connexion with this form of body the ribs are generally broader and the vertebrae more numerous than in other breeds from their manner of standing their legs appear longer than they really are though in proportion with those of c livia the legs and feet are actually longer the wings appear much elongated but by measurement in relation to the length of body this is not the case the beak likewise appears longer but it is in fact a little shorter about o3 of an inch proportionally with the size of the body and relatively to the beak of the rockpigeon the pouter though not bulky is a large bird i measured one which was 34 12 inches from tip to tip of wing and 19 inches from tip of beak to end of tail in a wild rock pigeon from the shetland islands the same measurements gave only 28 14 and 14 34 there are many subvarieties of the pouter of different colours but these i pass over  subrace 1ii dutch pouter  this seems to be the parentform of our improved english pouters i kept a pair but i suspect that they were not pure birds they are smaller than english pouters and less well developed in all their characters neumeister 57 das ganze der taubenzucht weimar 1837 pl 11 and 12 says that the wings are crossed over the tail and do not reach to its extremity  subrace 1iii the lille pouter  i know this breed only from description 58 boitard and corbie les pigeons etc page 177 pl 6 it approaches in general form the dutch pouter but the inflated oesophagus assumes a spherical form as if the pigeon had swallowed a large orange which had stuck close under the beak this inflated ball is represented as rising to a level with the crown of the head the middle toe alone is feathered a variety of this subrace called the claquant is described by mm boitard and corbie it pouts but little and is characterised by the habit of violently hitting its wings together over its backa habit which the english pouter has in a slight degree  subrace 1iv common german pouter  i know this bird only from the figures and description given by the accurate neumeister one of the few writers on pigeons who as i have found may always be trusted this subrace seems considerably different the upper part of the oesophagus is much less distended the bird stands less upright the feet are not feathered and the legs and beak are shorter in these respects there is an approach in form to the common rock pigeon the tailfeathers are very long yet the tips of the closed wings extend beyond the end of the tail and the length of the wings from tip to tip and of the body is greater than in the english pouter  figure 19 english carrier  group ii  this group includes three races namely carriers runts and barbs which are manifestly allied to each other indeed certain carriers and runts pass into each other by such insensible gradations that an arbitrary line has to be drawn between them carriers also graduate through foreign breeds into the rockpigeon yet if wellcharacterised carriers and barbs see figures 19 and 20 had existed as wild species no ornithologist would have placed them in the same genus with each other or with the rockpigeon this group may as a general rule be recognised by the beak being long with the skin over the nostrils swollen and often carunculated or wattled and with that round the eyes bare and likewise carunculated the mouth is very wide and the feet are large nevertheless the barb which must be classed in this same group has a very short beak and some runts have very little bare skin round their eyes  race ii carriers turkische tauben pigeons turcs dragons  beak elongated narrow pointed eyes surrounded by much naked generally carunculated skin neck and body elongated  subrace 2i the english carrier  this is a fine bird of large size close feathered generally dark coloured with an elongated neck the beak is attenuated and of wonderful length in one specimen it was 14 inch in length from the feathered base to the tip therefore nearly twice as long as that of the rockpigeon which measured only 77 whenever i compare proportionally any part in the carrier and rockpigeon i take the length of the body from the base of the beak to the end of the tail as the standard of comparison and according to this standard the beak in one carrier was nearly half an inch longer than in the rockpigeon the upper mandible is often slightly arched the tongue is very long the development of the carunculated skin or wattle round the eyes over the nostrils and on the lower mandible is prodigious the eyelids measured longitudinally were in some specimens exactly twice as long as in the rockpigeon the external orifice or furrow of the nostrils was also twice as long the open mouth in its widest part was in one case 75 of an inch in width whereas in the rockpigeon it is only about 4 of an inch this great width of mouth is shown in the skeleton by the reflexed edges of the ramus of the lower jaw the head is flat on the summit and narrow between the orbits the feet are large and coarse the length as measured from end of hind toe to end of middle toe without the claws was in two specimens 26 inches and this proportionally with the rockpigeon is an excess of nearly a quarter of an inch one very fine carrier measured 31 12 inches from tip to tip of wing birds of this subrace are too valuable to be flown as carriers  subrace 2ii dragons persian carriers  the english dragon differs from the improved english carrier in being smaller in all its dimensions and in having less wattle round the eyes and over the nostrils and none on the lower mandible sir w elliot sent me from madras a bagdad carrier sometimes called khandesi the name of which shows its persian origin it would be considered here a very poor dragon the body was of the size of the rockpigeon with the beak a little longer namely 1 inch from the tip to the feathered base the skin round the eyes was only slightly wattled whilst that over the nostrils was fairly wattled the hon c murray also sent me two carriers direct from persia these had nearly the same character as the madras bird being about as large as the rockpigeon but the beak in one specimen was as much as 115 in length the skin over the nostrils was only moderately and that round the eyes scarcely at all wattled  subrace 2iii bagadottentauben of neumeister pavdotten or hocker tauben  i owe to the kindness of mr baily jun a dead specimen of this singular breed imported from germany it is certainly allied to the runts nevertheless from its close affinity with carriers it will be convenient here to describe it the beak is long and is hooked or bowed downwards in a highly remarkable manner as will be seen in figure 24d when i treat of the skeleton the eyes are surrounded by a wide space of bright red skin which as well as that over the nostrils is moderately wattled the breastbone is remarkably protuberant being abruptly bowed outwards the feet and tarsi are of great length larger than in firstrate english carriers the whole bird is of large size but in proportion to the size of the body the feathers of the wing and tail are short a wild rockpigeon of considerably less size had tailfeathers 46 inches in length whereas in the large bagadotten these feathers were scarcely over 41 inches in length riedel 59 die taubenzucht ulm 1824 s 42 remarks that it is a very silent bird  subrace 2iv bussorah carrier  two specimens were sent me by sir w elliot from madras one in spirits and the other skinned the name shows its persian origin it is much valued in india and is considered as a distinct breed from the bagdad carrier which forms my second subrace at first i suspected that these two sub races might have been recently formed by crosses with other breeds though the estimation in which they are held renders this improbable but in a persian treatise 510 this treatise was written by sayzid mohammed musari who died in 1770 i owe to the great kindness of sir w elliot a translation of this curious treatise believed to have been written about 100 years ago the bagdad and bussorah breeds are described as distinct the bussorah carrier is of about the same size as the wild rockpigeon the shape of the beak with some little carunculated skin over the nostrils the much elongated eyelidsthe broad mouth measured internallythe narrow headthe feet proportionally a little longer than in the rock pigeonand the general appearance all show that this bird is an undoubted carrier yet in one specimen the beak was of exactly the same length as in the rockpigeon in the other specimen the beak as well as the opening of the nostrils was only a very little longer viz by 08 of an inch although there was a considerable space of bare and slightly carunculated skin round the eyes that over the nostrils was only in a slight degree rugose sir w elliot informs me that in the living bird the eye seems remarkably large and prominent and the same fact is noticed in the persian treatise but the bony orbit is barely larger than that in the rockpigeon  amongst the several breeds sent to me from madras by sir w elliot there is a pair of the kali par black birds with the beak slightly elongated with the skin over the nostrils rather full and with a little naked skin round the eyes this breed seems more closely allied to the carrier than to any other breed being nearly intermediate between the bussorah carrier and the rockpigeon  the names applied in different parts of europe and in india to the several kinds of carriers all point to persia or the surrounding countries as the source of this race and it deserves especial notice that even if we neglect the kali par as of doubtful origin we get a series broken by very small steps from the rockpigeon through the bussorah which sometimes has a beak not at all longer than that of the rockpigeon and with the naked skin round the eyes and over the nostrils very slightly swollen and carunculated through the bagdad subrace and dragons to our improved english carriers which present so marvellous a difference from the rock pigeon or columba livia  race iii runts scanderoons die florentiner tauben and hinkeltauben of neumeister pigeon bagadais pigeon romain  beak long massive body of great size  inextricable confusion reigns in the classification affinities and naming of runts several characters which are generally pretty constant in other pigeons such as the length of the wings tail legs and neck and the amount of naked skin round the eyes are excessively variable in runts when the naked skin over the nostrils and round the eyes is considerably developed and wattled and when the size of body is not very great runts graduate in so insensible a manner into carriers that the distinction is quite arbitrary this fact is likewise shown by the names given to them in different parts of europe nevertheless taking the most distinct forms at least five subraces some of them including wellmarked varieties can be distinguished which differ in such important points of structure that they would be considered as good species in a state of nature  subrace 3i scanderoon of english writers die florentiner and hinkeltauben of neumeister  birds of this subrace of which i kept one alive and have since seen two others differ from the bagadotten of neumeister only in not having the beak nearly so much curved downwards and in the naked skin round the eyes and over the nostrils being hardly at all wattled nevertheless i have felt myself compelled to place the bagadotten in race ii or that of the carriers and the present bird in race iii or that of the runts the scanderoon has a very short narrow and elevated tail wings extremely short so that the first primary feathers were not longer than those of a small tumbler pigeon neck long much bowed breastbone prominent beak long being 115 inch from tip to feathered base vertically thick slightly curved downwards the skin over the nostrils swollen not wattled naked skin round the eyes broad slightly carunculated legs long feet very large skin of neck bright red often showing a naked medial line with a naked red patch at the distal end of the radius of the wing my bird as measured from the base of the beak to the root of the tail was fully 2 inches longer than the rockpigeon yet the tail itself was only 4 inches in length whereas in the rockpigeon which is a much smaller bird the tail is 4 58 inches in length  the hinkel or florentiner taube of neumeister table 13 figure 1 agrees with the above description in all the specified characters for the beak is not mentioned except that neumeister expressly says that the neck is short whereas in my scanderoon it was remarkably long and bowed so that the hinkel forms a wellmarked variety  subrace 3ii pigeon cygne and pigeon bagadais of boitard and corbie scanderoon of french writers  i kept two of these birds alive imported from france they differed from the first subrace or true scanderoon in the much greater length of the wing and tail in the beak not being so long and in the skin about the head being more carunculated the skin of the neck is red but the naked patches on the wings are absent one of my birds measured 38 12 inches from tip to tip of wing by taking the length of the body as the standard of comparison the two wings were no less than 5 inches longer than those of the rockpigeon the tail was 6 14 inches in length and therefore 2 14 inches longer than that of the scanderoona bird of nearly the same size the beak is longer thicker and broader than in the rockpigeon proportionally with the size of body the eyelids nostrils and internal gape of mouth are all proportionally very large as in carriers the foot from the end of the middle to end of hind toe was actually 285 inches in length which is an excess of 32 of an inch over the foot of the rock pigeon proportionally to the relative size of the two birds  subrace 3iii spanish and roman runts  i am not sure that i am right in placing these runts in a distinct sub race yet if we take wellcharacterised birds there can be no doubt of the propriety of the separation they are heavy massive birds with shorter necks legs and beaks than in the foregoing races the skin over the nostrils is swollen but not carunculated the naked skin round the eyes is not very wide and only slightly carunculated and i have seen a fine socalled spanish runt with hardly any naked skin round the eyes of the two varieties to be seen in england one which is the rarer has very long wings and tail and agrees pretty closely with the last subrace the other with shorter wings and tail is apparently the pigeon romain ordinaire of boitard and corbie these runts are apt to tremble like fantails they are bad flyers a few years ago mr gulliver 511 poultry chronicle volume 2 page 573 exhibited a runt which weighed 1 pound 14 ounces and as i am informed by mr tegetmeier two runts from the south of france were lately exhibited at the crystal palace each of which weighed 2 pounds 2 12 ounces a very fine rockpigeon from the shetland islands weighed only 14 12 ounces  subrace 3iv tronfo of aldrovandi leghorn runt  in aldrovandis work published in 1600 there is a coarse woodcut of a great italian pigeon with an elevated tail short legs massive body and with the beak short and thick i had imagined that this latter character so abnormal in the group was merely a false representation from bad drawing but moore in his work published in 1735 says that he possessed a leghorn runt of which the beak was very short for so large a bird in other respects moores bird resembled the first subrace or scanderoon for it had a long bowed neck long legs short beak and elevated tail and not much wattle about the head so that aldrovandis and moores birds must have formed distinct varieties both of which seem to be now extinct in europe sir w elliot however informs me that he has seen in madras a shortbeaked runt imported from cairo  subrace 3v murassa adorned pigeon of madras  skins of these handsome chequered birds were sent me from madras by sir w elliot they are rather larger than the largest rockpigeon with longer and more massive beaks the skin over the nostrils is rather full and very slightly carunculated and they have some naked skin round the eyes feet large this breed is intermediate between the rockpigeon and a very poor variety of runt or carrier  from these several descriptions we see that with runts as with carriers we have a fine gradation from the rockpigeon with the tronfo diverging as a distinct branch to our largest and most massive runts but the chain of affinities and many points of resemblance between runts and carriers make me believe that these two races have not descended by independent lines from the rockpigeon but from some common parent as represented in the table which had already acquired a moderately long beak with slightly swollen skin over the nostrils and with some slightly carunculated naked skin round the eyes  figure 20 english barb  race iv barbs indische tauben pigeons polonais  beak short broad deep naked skin round the eyes broad and carunculated skin over nostrils slightly swollen  misled by the extraordinary shortness and form of the beak i did not at first perceive the near affinity of this race to that of carriers until the fact was pointed out to me by mr brent subsequently after examining the bussorah carrier i saw that no very great amount of modification would be requisite to convert it into a barb this view of the affinity of barbs to carriers is supported by the analogical difference between the short and longbeaked runts and still more strongly by the fact that young barbs and dragons within 24 hours after being hatched resemble each other much more closely than do young pigeons of other and equally distinct breeds at this early age the length of beak the swollen skin over the rather open nostrils the gape of the mouth and the size of the feet are the same in both although these parts afterwards become widely different we thus see that embryology as the comparison of very young animals may perhaps be called comes into play in the classification of domestic varieties as with species in a state of nature  fanciers with some truth compare the head and beak of the barb to that of a bullfinch the barb if found in a state of nature would certainly have been placed in a new genus formed for its reception the body is a little larger than that of the rockpigeon but the beak is more than 2 of an inch shorter although shorter it is both vertically and horizontally thicker from the outward flexure of the rami of the lower jaw the mouth internally is very broad in the proportion of 6 to 4 to that of the rockpigeon the whole head is broad the skin over the nostril is swollen but not carunculated except slightly in firstrate birds when old whilst the naked skin round the eye is broad and much carunculated it is sometimes so much developed that a bird belonging to mr harrison weir could hardly see to pick up food from the ground the eyelids in one specimen were nearly twice as long as those of the rockpigeon the feet are coarse and strong but proportionally rather shorter than in the rock pigeon the plumage is generally dark and uniform barbs in short may be called shortbeaked carriers bearing the same relation to carriers that the tronfo of aldrovandi does to the common runt  group iii  this group is artificial and includes a heterogeneous collection of distinct forms it may be defined by the beak in wellcharacterised specimens of the several races being shorter than in the rockpigeon and by the skin round the eyes not being much developed  figure 21 english fantail  race vfantails  subrace 5i european fantails pfauentauben trembleurs  tail expanded directed upwards formed of many feathers oilgland aborted body and beak rather short  the normal number of tailfeathers in the genus columba is 12 but fantails have from only 12 as has been asserted up to according to mm boitard and corbie 42 i have counted in one of my own birds 33 and at calcutta mr blyth 512 annals and mag of nat history volume 19 1847 page 105 has counted in an imperfect tail 34 feathers in madras as i am informed by sir w elliot 32 is the standard number but in england number is much less valued than the position and expansion of the tail the feathers are arranged in an irregular double row their permanent fanlike expansion and their upward direction are more remarkable characters than their increased number the tail is capable of the same movements as in other pigeons and can be depressed so as to sweep the ground it arises from a more expanded basis than in other pigeons and in three skeletons there were one or two extra coccygeal vertebrae i have examined many specimens of various colours from different countries and there was no trace of the oilgland this is a curious case of abortion 513 this gland occurs in most birds but nitzsch in his pterylographie 1840 page 55 states that it is absent in two species of columba in several species of psittacus in some species of otis and in most or all birds of the ostrich family it can hardly be an accidental coincidence that the two species of columba which are destitute of an oilgland have an unusual number of tailfeathers namely 16 and in this respect resemble fantails the neck is thin and bowed backwards the breast is broad and protuberant the feet are small the carriage of the bird is very different from that of other pigeons in good birds the head touches the tailfeathers which consequently often become crumpled they habitually tremble much and their necks have an extraordinary apparently convulsive backward and forward movement good birds walk in a singular manner as if their small feet were stiff owing to their large tails they fly badly on a windy day the dark coloured varieties are generally larger than white fantails  although between the best and common fantails now existing in england there is a vast difference in the position and size of the tail in the carriage of the head and neck in the convulsive movements of the neck in the manner of walking and in the breadth of the breast the differences so graduate away that it is impossible to make more than one subrace moore however an excellent old authority 514 see the two excellent editions published by mr jm eaton in 1852 and 1858 entitled a treatise on fancy pigeons says that in 1735 there were two sorts of broadtailed shakers ie fantails one having a neck much longer and more slender than the other and i am informed by mr bp brent that there is an existing german fantail with a thicker and shorter beak  subrace 5ii java fantail  mr swinhoe sent me from amoy in china the skin of a fantail belonging to a breed known to have been imported from java it was coloured in a peculiar manner unlike any european fantail and for a fantail had a remarkably short beak although a good bird of the kind it had only 14 tailfeathers but mr swinhoe has counted in other birds of this breed from 18 to 24 tailfeathers from a rough sketch sent to me it is evident that the tail is not so much expanded or so much upraised as in even secondrate european fantails the bird shakes its neck like our fantails it had a welldeveloped oilgland fantails were known in india as we shall hereafter see before the year 1600 and we may suspect that in the java fantail we see the breed in its earlier and less improved condition  figure 22 african owl  race vi turbit and owl moventauben pigeons a cravate  feathers divergent along the front of the neck and breast beak very short vertically rather thick oesophagus somewhat enlarged  turbits and owls differ from each other slightly in the shape of the head the former have a crest and the beak is differently curved but they may be here conveniently grouped together these pretty birds some of which are very small can be recognised at once by the feathers irregularly diverging like a frill along the front of the neck in the same manner but in a less degree as along the back of the neck in the jacobin they have the remarkable habit of continually and momentarily inflating the upper part of the oesophagus which causes a movement in the frill when the oesophagus of a dead bird is inflated it is seen to be larger than in other breeds and not so distinctly separated from the crop the pouter inflates both its true crop and oesophagus the turbit inflates in a much less degree the oesophagus alone the beak of the turbit is very short being 28 of an inch shorter than that of the rockpigeon proportionally with the size of their bodies and in some owls brought by mr e vernon harcourt from tunis it was even shorter the beak is vertically thicker and perhaps a little broader in proportion to that of the rockpigeon  race vii tumblers tummler or burzeltauben culbutants  during flight tumble backwards body generally small beak generally short sometimes excessively short and conical  this race may be divided into four subraces namely persian lotan common and shortfaced tumblers these subraces include many varieties which breed true i have examined eight skeletons of various kinds of tumblers excepting in one imperfect and doubtful specimen the ribs are only seven in number whereas the rockpigeon has eight ribs  subrace 7i persian tumblers  i received a pair direct from persia from the hon c murray they are rather smaller birds than the wild rockpigeon about the size of the common dovecote pigeon white and mottled slightly feathered on the feet with the beak just perceptibly shorter than in the rockpigeon hm consul mr keith abbott informs me that the difference in the length of beak is so slight that only practised persian fanciers can distinguish these tumblers from the common pigeon of the country he informs me that they fly in flocks high up in the air and tumble well some of them occasionally appear to become giddy and tumble to the ground in which respect they resemble some of our tumblers  subrace 7ii lotan or lowtun indian ground tumblers  these birds present one of the most remarkable inherited habits or instincts ever recorded the specimens sent to me from madras by sir w elliot are white slightly feathered on the feet with the feathers on the head reversed and they are rather smaller than the rock or dovecote pigeon the beak is proportionally only slightly shorter and rather thinner than in the rockpigeon these birds when gently shaken and placed on the ground immediately begin tumbling head over heels and they continue thus to tumble until taken up and soothedthe ceremony being generally to blow in their faces as in recovering a person from a state of hypnotism or mesmerism it is asserted that they will continue to roll over till they die if not taken up there is abundant evidence with respect to these remarkable peculiarities but what makes the case the more worthy of attention is that the habit has been inherited since before the year 1600 for the breed is distinctly described in the ayeen akbery 515 english translation by f gladwin 4th edition volume 1 the habit of the lotan is also described in the persian treatise before alluded to published about 100 years ago at this date the lotans were generally white and crested as at present mr blyth describes these birds in annals and mag of nat hist volume 14 1847 page 104 he says that they may be seen at any of the calcutta birddealers mr evans kept a pair in london imported by captain vigne and he assures me that he has seen them tumble in the air as well as in the manner above described on the ground sir w elliot however writes to me from madras that he is informed that they tumble exclusively on the ground or at a very small height above it he also mentions birds of another subvariety called the kalmi lotan which begin to roll over if only touched on the neck with a rod or wand  subrace 7iii common english tumblers  these birds have exactly the same habits as the persian tumbler but tumble better the english bird is rather smaller than the persian and the beak is plainly shorter compared with the rockpigeon and proportionally with the size of body the beak is from 15 to nearly 2 of an inch shorter but it is not thinner there are several varieties of the common tumbler namely baldheads beards and dutch rollers i have kept the latter alive they have differently shaped heads longer necks and are featherfooted they tumble to an extraordinary degree as mr brent remarks 516 journal of horticulture october 22 1861 page 76 every few seconds over they go one two or three summersaults at a time here and there a bird gives a very quick and rapid spin revolving like a wheel though they sometimes lose their balance and make a rather ungraceful fall in which they occasionally hurt themselves by striking some object from madras i have received several specimens of the common tumbler of india differing slightly from each other in the length of their beaks mr brent sent me a dead specimen of a housetumbler 517 see the account of the house tumblers kept at glasgow in the cottage gardener 1858 page 285 also mr brents paper journal of horticulture 1861 page 76 which is a scotch variety not differing in general appearance and form of beak from the common tumbler mr brent states that these birds generally begin to tumble almost as soon as they can well fly at three months old they tumble well but still fly strong at five or six months they tumble excessively and in the second year they mostly give up flying on account of their tumbling so much and so close to the ground some fly round with the flock throwing a clean summersault every few yards till they are obliged to settle from giddiness and exhaustion these are called air tumblers and they commonly throw from twenty to thirty summersaults in a minute each clear and clean i have one red cock that i have on two or three occasions timed by my watch and counted forty summersaults in the minute others tumble differently at first they throw a single summersault then it is double till it becomes a continuous roll which puts an end to flying for if they fly a few yards over they go and roll till they reach the ground thus i had one kill herself and another broke his leg many of them turn over only a few inches from the ground and will tumble two or three times in flying across their loft these are called housetumblers from tumbling in the house the act of tumbling seems to be one over which they have no control an involuntary movement which they seem to try to prevent i have seen a bird sometimes in his struggles fly a yard or two straight upwards the impulse forcing him backwards while he struggles to go forwards if suddenly startled or in a strange place they seem less able to fly than if quiet in their accustomed loft these housetumblers differ from the lotan or ground tumbler of india in not requiring to be shaken in order to begin tumbling the breed has probably been formed merely by selecting the best common tumblers though it is possible that they may have been crossed at some former period with lotans  figure 23 shortfaced english tumbler  subrace 71v shortfaced tumblers  these are marvellous birds and are the glory and pride of many fanciers in their extremely short sharp and conical beaks with the skin over the nostrils but little developed they almost depart from the type of the columbidae their heads are nearly globular and upright in front so that some fanciers say 518 jm eaton treatise on pigeons 1852 page 9 the head should resemble a cherry with a barleycorn stuck in it these are the smallest kind of pigeons mr esquilant possessed a blue baldhead two years old which when alive weighed before feedingtime only 6 ounces 5 drs two others each weighed 7 ounces we have seen that a wild rock pigeon weighed 14 ounces 2 drs and a runt 34 ounces 4 drs shortfaced tumblers have a remarkably erect carriage with prominent breasts drooping wings and very small feet the length of the beak from the tip to the feathered base was in one good bird only 4 of an inch in a wild rock pigeon it was exactly double this length as these tumblers have shorter bodies than the wild rockpigeon they ought of course to have shorter beaks but proportionally with the size of the body the beak is 28 of an inch too short so again the feet of this bird were actually 45 shorter and proportionally 21 of an inch shorter than the feet of the rock pigeon the middle toe has only twelve or thirteen instead of fourteen or fifteen scutellae the primary wingfeathers are not rarely nine instead of ten in number the improved shortfaced tumblers have almost lost the power of tumbling but there are several authentic accounts of their occasionally tumbling there are several subvarieties such as baldheads beards mottles and almonds the latter are remarkable from not acquiring their perfectlycoloured plumage until they have moulted three or four times there is good reason to believe that most of these subvarieties some of which breed truly have arisen since the publication of moores treatise in 1735 519 jm eaton treatise edition 1858 page 76  finally in regard to the whole group of tumblers it is impossible to conceive a more perfect gradation than i have now lying before me from the rockpigeon through persian lotan and common tumblers up to the marvellous shortfaced birds which latter no ornithologist judging from mere external structure would place in the same genus with the rock pigeon the differences between the successive steps in this series are not greater than those which may be observed between common dovecotepigeons c livia brought from different countries  race viii indian frillback  beak very short feathers reversed  a specimen of this bird in spirits was sent to me from madras by sir w elliot it is wholly different from the frillback often exhibited in england it is a smallish bird about the size of the common tumbler but has a beak in all its proportions like our shortfaced tumblers the beak measured from the tip to the feathered base was only 46 of an inch in length the feathers over the whole body are reversed or curl backwards had this bird occurred in europe i should have thought it only a monstrous variety of our improved tumbler but as shortfaced tumblers are not known in india i think it must rank as a distinct breed probably this is the breed seen by hasselquist in 1757 at cairo and said to have been imported from india  race ix jacobin zopf or perrfickentaube nonnain  feathers of the neck forming a hood wings and tail long beak moderately short  this pigeon can at once be recognised by its hood almost enclosing the head and meeting in front of the neck the hood seems to be merely an exaggeration of the crest of reversed feathers on the back of the head which is common to many subvarieties and which in the latztaube 520 neumeister taubenzucht tab 4 figure 1 is in a nearly intermediate state between a hood and a crest the feathers of the hood are elongated both the wings and tail are likewise much elongated thus the folded wing of the jacobin though a somewhat smaller bird is fully 1 14 inch longer than in the rockpigeon taking the length of the body without the tail as the standard of comparison the folded wing proportionally with the wings of the rockpigeon is 2 14 inches too long and the two wings from tip to tip 5 14 inches too long in disposition this bird is singularly quiet seldom flying or moving about as bechstein and riedel have likewise remarked in germany 521 riedel die taubenzucht 1824 s 26 bechstein naturgeschichte deutschlands b 4 s 36 1795 the latter author also notices the length of the wings and tail the beak is nearly 2 of an inch shorter in proportion to the size of the body than in the rockpigeon but the internal gape of the mouth is considerably wider  group iv  the birds of this group may be characterised by their resemblance in all important points of structure especially in the beak to the rockpigeon the trumpeter forms the only wellmarked race of the numerous other sub races and varieties i shall specify only a few of the most distinct which i have myself seen and kept alive  race x trumpeter trommeltaube pigeon tambour glouglou  a tuft of feathers at the base of the beak curling forward feet much feathered voice very peculiar size exceeding that of the rockpigeon  this is a wellmarked breed with a peculiar voice wholly unlike that of any other pigeon the coo is rapidly repeated and is continued for several minutes hence their name of trumpeters they are also characterised by a tuft of elongated feathers which curls forward over the base of the beak and which is possessed by no other breed their feet are so heavily feathered that they almost appear like little wings they are larger birds than the rockpigeon but their beak is of very nearly the same proportional size their feet are rather small this breed was perfectly characterised in moores time in 1735 mr brent says that two varieties exist which differ in size  race xi scarcely differing in structure from the wild columba livia  subrace 11i laughers  size less than the rockpigeon voice very peculiar  as this bird agrees in nearly all its proportions with the rockpigeon though of smaller size i should not have thought it worthy of mention had it not been for its peculiar voicea character supposed seldom to vary with birds although the voice of the laugher is very different from that of the trumpeter yet one of my trumpeters used to utter a single note like that of the laugher i have kept two varieties of laughers which differed only in one variety being turncrowned the smoothheaded kind for which i am indebted to the kindness of mr brent besides its peculiar note used to coo in a singular and pleasing manner which independently struck both mr brent and myself as resembling that of the turtledove both varieties come from arabia this breed was known by moore in 1735 a pigeon which seems to say yakroo is mentioned in 1600 in the ayeen akbery and is probably the same breed sir w elliot has also sent me from madras a pigeon called yahui said to have come from mecca which does not differ in appearance from the laugher it has a deep melancholy voice like yahu often repeated yahu yahu means oh god oh god and sayzid mohammed musari in the treatise written about 100 years ago says that these birds are not flown because they repeat the name of the most high god mr keith abbott however informs me that the common pigeon is called yahoo in persia  subrace 11ii common frillback die strupptaube  beak rather longer than in the rockpigeon feathers reversed   this is a considerably larger bird than the rockpigeon and with the beak proportionally with the size of body a little viz by 04 of an inch longer the feathers especially on the wingcoverts have their points curled upwards or backwards  subrace 11iii nuns pigeons coquilles  these elegant birds are smaller than the rockpigeon the beak is actually 17 and proportionally with the size of the body 1 of an inch shorter than in the rockpigeons although of the same thickness in young birds the scutellae on the tarsi and toes are generally of a leadenblack colour and this is a remarkable character though observed in a lesser degree in some other breeds as the colour of the legs in the adult state is subject to very little variation in any breed i have on two or three occasions counted thirteen or fourteen feathers in the tail this likewise occurs in the barely distinct breed called helmets nuns are symmetrically coloured with the head primary wingfeathers tail and tailcoverts of the same colour namely black or red and with the rest of the body white this breed has retained the same character since aldrovandi wrote in 1600 i have received from madras almost similarly coloured birds  subrace 11iv spots die blasstauben pigeons heurtes  these birds are a very little larger than the rockpigeon with the beak a trace smaller in all its dimensions and with the feet decidedly smaller they are symmetrically coloured with a spot on the forehead with the tail and tailcoverts of the same colour the rest of the body being white this breed existed in 1676 522 willughby ornithology edited by ray and in 1735 moore remarks that they breed truly as is the case at the present day  subrace 11v swallows  these birds as measured from tip to tip of wing or from the end of the beak to the end of the tail exceed in size the rockpigeon but their bodies are much less bulky their feet and legs are likewise smaller the beak is of about the same length but rather slighter altogether their general appearance is considerably different from that of the rockpigeon their heads and wings are of the same colour the rest of the body being white their flight is said to be peculiar this seems to be a modern breed which however originated before the year 1795 in germany for it is described by bechstein  besides the several breeds now described three or four other very distinct kinds existed lately or perhaps still exist in germany and france firstly the karmeliten or carme pigeon which i have not seen it is described as of small size with very short legs and with an extremely short beak secondly the finnikin which is now extinct in england it had according to moores 523 jm eatons edition 1858 of moore page 98 treatise published in 1735 a tuft of feathers on the hinder part of the head which ran down its back not unlike a horses mane when it is salacious it rises over the hen and turns round three or four times flapping its wings then reverses and turns as many times the other way the turner on the other hand when it plays to the female turns only one way whether these extraordinary statements may be trusted i know not but the inheritance of any habit may be believed after what we have seen with respect to the groundtumbler of india mm boitard and corbie describe a pigeon 524 pigeon pattu plongeur les pigeons etc page 165 which has the singular habit of sailing for a considerable time through the air without flapping its wings like a bird of prey the confusion is inextricable from the time of aldrovandi in 1600 to the present day in the accounts published of the draijers smiters finnikins turners claquers etc which are all remarkable from their manner of flight mr brent informs me that he has seen one of these breeds in germany with its wingfeathers injured from having been so often struck together but he did not see it flying an old stuffed specimen of a finnikin in the british museum presents no wellmarked character thirdly a singular pigeon with a forked tail is mentioned in some treatises and as bechstein 525 naturgeschichte deutschlands b 4 s 47 briefly describes and figures this bird with a tail having completely the structure of that of the houseswallow it must once have existed for bechstein was far too good a naturalist to have confounded any distinct species with the domestic pigeon lastly an extraordinary pigeon imported from belgium has lately been exhibited at the philoperisteron society in london 526 mr wb tegetmeier journal of horticulture january 20 1863 page 58 which conjoins the colour of an archangel with the head of an owl or barb its most striking peculiarity being the extraordinary length of the tail and wingfeathers the latter crossing beyond the tail and giving to the bird the appearance of a gigantic swift cypselus or longwinged hawk mr tegetmeier informs me that this bird weighed only 10 ounces but in length was 15 12 inches from tip to beak to end of tail and 32 12 inches from tip to tip of wing now the wild rockpigeon weighs 14 12 ounces and measures from tip to beak to end of tail 15 inches and from tip to tip of wing only 26 34 inches  i have now described all the domestic pigeons known to me and have added a few others on reliable authority i have classed them under four groups in order to mark their affinities and degrees of difference but the third group is artificial the kinds examined by me form eleven races which include several subraces and even these latter present differences that would certainly have been thought of specific value if observed in a state of nature the subraces likewise include many strictly inherited varieties so that altogether there must exist as previously remarked above 150 kinds which can be distinguished though generally by characters of extremely slight importance many of the genera of the columbidae admitted by ornithologists do not differ in any great degree from each other taking this into consideration there can be no doubt that several of the most strongly characterised domestic forms if found wild would have been placed in at least five new genera thus a new genus would have been formed for the reception of the improved english pouter a second genus for carriers and runts and this would have been a wide or comprehensive genus for it would have admitted common spanish runts without any wattle shortbeaked runts like the tronfo and the improved english carrier a third genus would have been formed for the barb a fourth for the fantail and lastly a fifth for the short beaked not wattled pigeons such as turbits and shortfaced tumblers the remaining domestic forms might have been included in the same genus with the wild rockpigeon  individual variability variations of a remarkable nature  the differences which we have as yet considered are characteristic of distinct breeds but there are other differences either confined to individual birds or often observed in certain breeds but not characteristic of them these individual differences are of importance as they might in most cases be secured and accumulated by mans power of selection and thus an existing breed might be greatly modified or a new one formed fanciers notice and select only those slight differences which are externally visible but the whole organisation is so tied together by correlation of growth that a change in one part is frequently accompanied by other changes for our purpose modifications of all kinds are equally important and if affecting a part which does not commonly vary are of more importance than a modification in some conspicuous part at the present day any visible deviation of character in a wellestablished breed is rejected as a blemish but it by no means follows that at an early period before wellmarked breeds had been formed such deviations would have been rejected on the contrary they would have been eagerly preserved as presenting a novelty and would then have been slowly augmented as we shall hereafter more clearly see by the process of unconscious selection  i have made numerous measurements of the various parts of the body in the several breeds and have hardly ever found them quite the same in birds of the same breedthe differences being greater than we commonly meet with in wild species within the same district to begin with the primary feathers of the wing and tail but i must first mention as some readers may not be aware of the fact that the number of the primary wing and tail feathers in wild birds is generally constant and characterises not only whole genera but even whole families when the tailfeathers are unusually numerous as for instance in the swan they are apt to be variable in number but this does not apply to the several species and genera of the columbidae which never as far as i can hear have less than twelve or more than sixteen tailfeathers and these numbers characterise with rare exception whole subfamilies 527 coupdoeil sur lordre des pigeons par cl bonaparte comptes rendus 185455 mr blyth in annals of nat hist volume 19 1847 page 41 mentions as a very singular fact that of the two species of ectopistes which are nearly allied to each other one should have fourteen tailfeathers while the other the passenger pigeon of north america should possess but the usual numbertwelve the wild rockpigeon has twelve tailfeathers with fantails as we have seen the number varies from fourteen to fortytwo in two young birds in the same nest i counted twentytwo and twentyseven feathers pouters are very liable to have additional tailfeathers and i have seen on several occasions fourteen or fifteen in my own birds mr bult had a specimen examined by mr yarrell with seventeen tailfeathers i had a nun with thirteen and another with fourteen tailfeathers and in a helmet a breed barely distinguishable from the nun i have counted fifteen and have heard of other such instances on the other hand mr brent possessed a dragon which during its whole life never had more than ten tailfeathers and one of my dragons descended from mr brents had only eleven i have seen a baldhead tumbler with only ten and mr brent had an airtumbler with the same number but another with fourteen tailfeathers two of these latter tumblers bred by mr brent were remarkableone from having the two central tailfeathers a little divergent and the other from having the two outer feathers longer by threeeighths of an inch than the others so that in both cases the tail exhibited a tendency but in different ways to become forked and this shows us how a swallowtailed breed like that described by bechstein might have been formed by careful selection  with respect to the primary wingfeathers the number in the columbidae as far as i can find out is always nine or ten in the rockpigeon it is ten but i have seen no less than eight shortfaced tumblers with only nine primaries and the occurrence of this number has been noticed by fanciers owing to ten primaries of a white colour being one of the points in short faced baldheadtumblers mr brent however had an airtumbler not shortfaced which had in both wings eleven primaries mr corker the eminent breeder of prize carriers assures me that some of his birds had eleven primaries in both wings i have seen eleven in one wing in two pouters i have been assured by three fanciers that they have seen twelve in scanderoons but as neumeister asserts that in the allied florence runt the middle flightfeather is often double the number twelve may have been caused by two of the ten primaries having each two shafts to a single feather the secondary wingfeathers are difficult to count but the number seems to vary from twelve to fifteen the length of the wing and tail relatively to the body and of the wings to the tail certainly varies i have especially noticed this in jacobins in mr bults magnificent collection of pouters the wings and tail varied greatly in length and were sometimes so much elongated that the birds could hardly play upright in the relative length of the few first primaries i have observed only a slight degree of variability mr brent informs me that he has observed the shape of the first feather to vary very slightly but the variation in these latter points is extremely slight compared with the differences which may be observed in the natural species of the columbidae  in the beak i have seen very considerable differences in birds of the same breed as in carefully bred jacobins and trumpeters in carriers there is often a conspicuous difference in the degree of attenuation and curvature of the beak so it is indeed in many breeds thus i had two strains of black barbs which evidently differed in the curvature of the upper mandible in width of mouth i have found a great difference in two swallows in fantails of firstrate merit i have seen some birds with much longer and thinner necks than in others other analogous facts could be given we have seen that the oilgland is aborted in all fantails with the exception of the subrace from java and i may add so hereditary is this tendency to abortion that some although not all of the mongrels which i reared from the fantail and pouter had no oilgland in one swallow out of many which i have examined and in two nuns there was no oilgland  the number of the scutellae on the toes often varies in the same breed and sometimes even differs on the two feet of the same individual the shetland rockpigeon has fifteen on the middle and six on the hinder toe whereas i have seen a runt with sixteen on the middle and eight on the hind toe and a shortfaced tumbler with only twelve and five on these same toes the rockpigeon has no sensible amount of skin between its toes but i possessed a spot and a nun with the skin extending for a space of a quarter of an inch from the fork between the two inner toes on the other hand as will hereafter be more fully shown pigeons with feathered feet very generally have the bases of their outer toes connected by skin i had a red tumbler which had a coo unlike that of its fellows approaching in tone to that of the laugher this bird had the habit to a degree which i never saw equalled in any other pigeon of often walking with its wings raised and arched in an elegantmanner i need say nothing on the great variability in almost every breed in size of body in colour in the feathering of the feet and in the feathers on the back of the head being reversed but i may mention a remarkable tumbler 528 described and figured in the poultry chronicle volume 3 1855 page 82 exhibited at the crystal palace which had an irregular crest of feathers on its head somewhat like the tuft on the head of the polish fowl mr bult reared a hen jacobin with the feathers on the thigh so long as to reach the ground and a cock having but in a lesser degree the same peculiarity from these two birds he bred others similarly characterised which were exhibited at the philoperisteron soc i bred a mongrel pigeon which had fibrous feathers and the wing and tailfeathers so short and imperfect that the bird could not fly even a foot in height  there are many singular and inherited peculiarities in the plumage of pigeons thus almondtumblers do not acquire their perfect mottled feathers until they have moulted three or four times the kite tumbler is at first brindled black and red with a barred appearance but when it throws its nest feathers it becomes almost black generally with a bluish tail and a reddish colour on the inner webs of the primary wingfeathers 529 the pigeon book by mr bp brent 1859 page 41 neumeister describes a breed of a black colour with white bars on the wing and a white crescentshaped mark on the breast these marks are generally rustyred before the first moult but after the third or fourth moult they undergo a change the wing feathers and the crown of the head likewise then become white or grey 530 die staarhalsige taube das ganze etc s 21 tab 1 figure 4  it is an important fact and i believe there is hardly an exception to the rule that the especial characters for which each breed is valued are eminently variable thus in the fantail the number and direction of the tailfeathers the carriage of the body and the degree of trembling are all highly variable points in pouters the degree to which they pout and the shape of their inflated crops in the carrier the length narrowness and curvature of the beak and the amount of wattle in shortfaced tumblers the shortness of the beak the prominence of the forehead and general carriage 531 a treatise on the almondtumbler by jm eaton 1852 page 8 et passim and in the almondtumbler the colour of the plumage in common tumblers the manner of tumbling in the barb the breadth and shortness of the beak and the amount of eyewattle in runts the size of body in turbits the frill and lastly in trumpeters the cooing as well as the size of the tuft of feathers over the nostrils these which are the distinctive and selected characters of the several breeds are all eminently variable  there is another interesting fact with respect to the characters of the several breeds namely that they are often most strongly displayed in the male bird in carriers when the males and females are exhibited in separate pens the wattle is plainly seen to be much more developed in the males though i have seen a hen carrier belonging to mr haynes heavily wattled mr tegetmeier informs me that in twenty barbs in mr ph joness possession the males had generally the largest eyewattles mr esquilant also believes in this rule but mr h weir a firstrate judge entertains some doubt on the subject male pouters distend their crops to a much greater size than do the females i have however seen a hen in the possession of mr evans which pouted excellently but this is an unusual circumstance mr harrison weir a successful breeder of prize fantails informs me that his male birds often have a greater number of tailfeathers than the females mr eaton asserts 532 a treatise etc page 10 that if a cock and hen tumbler were of equal merit the hen would be worth double the money and as pigeons always pair so that an equal number of both sexes is necessary for reproduction this seems to show that high merit is rarer in the female than in the male in the development of the frill in turbits of the hood in jacobins of the tuft in trumpeters of tumbling in tumblers there is no difference between the males and females i may here add a rather different case namely the existence in france 533 boitard and corbie les pigeons etc 1824 page 173 of a wine coloured variety of the pouter in which the male is generally chequered with black whilst the female is never so chequered dr chapuis also remarks 534 le pigeon voyageur belge 1865 page 87 i have given in my descent of man 6th edition page 466 some curious cases on the authority of mr tegetmeier of silvercoloured ie very pale blue birds being generally females and of the ease with which a race thus characterised could be produced bonizzi see variazioni dei columbi domestici padova 1873 states that certain coloured spots are often different in the two sexes and the certain tints are commoner in females than in male pigeons that in certain lightcoloured pigeons the males have their feathers striated with black and these striae increase in size at each moult so that the male ultimately becomes spotted with black with carriers the wattle both on the beak and round the eyes and with barbs that round the eyes goes on increasing with age this augmentation of character with advancing age and more especially the difference between the males and females in the abovementioned several respects are remarkable facts for there is no sensible difference at any age between the two sexes in the aboriginal rockpigeon and not often any strongly marked difference throughout the family of the columbidae 535 prof a newton proc zoolog soc 1865 page 716 remarks that he knows no species which present any remarkable sexual distinction but mr wallace informs me that in the subfamily of the treronidae the sexes often differ considerably in colour see also on sexual differences in the columbidae gould handbook to the birds of australia volume 2 pages 109149  osteological characters  in the skeletons of the various breeds there is much variability and though certain differences occur frequently and others rarely in certain breeds yet none can be said to be absolutely characteristic of any breed considering that stronglymarked domestic races have been formed chiefly by mans selection we ought not to expect to find great and constant differences in the skeleton for fanciers neither see nor do they care for modifications of structure in the internal framework nor ought we to expect changes in the skeletons from changed habits of life as every facility is given to the most distinct breeds to follow the same habits and the much modified races are never allowed to wander abroad and procure their own food in various ways moreover i find on comparing the skeletons of columba livia oenas palumbus and turtur which are ranked by all systematists in two or three distinct though allied genera that the differences are extremely slight certainly less than between the skeletons of some of the most distinct domestic breeds how far the skeleton of the wild rockpigeon is constant i have had no means of judging as i have examined only two  figure 24 skulls of pigeons viewed laterally of natural size a wild rockpigeon columba livia b shortfaced tumbler c english carrier d bagadotten carrier  skull  the individual bones especially those at the base do not differ in shape but the whole skull in its proportions outline and relative direction of the bones differs greatly in some of the breeds as may be seen by comparing the figures of a the wild rockpigeon b the shortfaced tumbler c the english carrier and d the bagadotten carrier of neumeister all drawn of the natural size and viewed laterally in the carrier besides the elongation of the bones of the face the space between the orbits is proportionally a little narrower than in the rockpigeon in the bagadotten the upper mandible is remarkably arched and the premaxillary bones are proportionally broader in the shortfaced tumbler the skull is more globular all the bones of the face are much shortened and the front of the skull and descending nasal bones are almost perpendicular the maxillojugal arch and premaxillary bones form an almost straight line the space between the prominent edges of the eyeorbits is depressed in the barb the premaxillary bones are much shortened and their anterior portion is thicker than in the rockpigeon as is the lower part of the nasal bone in two nuns the ascending branches of the premaxillaries near their tips were somewhat attenuated and in these birds as well as in some others for instance in the spot the occipital crest over the foramen was considerably more prominent than in the rock pigeon  figure 25 lower jaws seen from above of natural size a rockpigeon b runt c barb  figure 26 skull of runt seen from above of natural size showing the reflexed margin of the distal portion of the lower jaw  figure 27 lateral view of jaws of natural size a rockpigeon b shortfaced tumbler c bagadotten carrier  in the lower jaw the articular surface is proportionably smaller in many breeds than in the rockpigeon and the vertical diameter more especially of the outer part of the articular surface is considerably shorter may not this be accounted for by the lessened use of the jaws owing to nutritious food having been given during a long period to all highly improved pigeons in runts carriers and barbs and in a lesser degree in several breeds the whole side of the jaw near the articular end is bent inwards in a highly remarkable manner and the superior margin of the ramus beyond the middle is reflexed in an equally remarkable manner as may be seen in figure 25 in comparison with the jaw of the rockpigeon this reflection of the upper margin of the lower jaw is plainly connected with the singularly wide gape of the mouth as has been described in runts carriers and barbs the reflection is well shown in figure 26 of the head of a runt seen from above here a wide open space may be observed on each side between the edges of the lower jaw and of the premaxillary bones in the rockpigeon and in several domestic breeds the edges of the lower jaw on each side come close up to the premaxillary bones so that no open space is left the degree of downward curvature of the distal half of the lower jaw also differs to an extraordinary degree in some breeds as may be seen in the drawings figure 27 a of the rockpigeon b of the shortfaced tumbler and c of the bagadotten carrier of neumeister in some runts the symphysis of the lower jaw is remarkably solid no one would readily have believed that jaws differing in the several abovespecified points so greatly could have belonged to the same species  vertebrae  all the breeds have twelve cervical vertebrae 536 i am not sure that i have designated the different kinds of vertebra correctly but i observe that different anatomists follow in this respect different rules and as i use the same terms in the comparison of all the skeletons this i hope will not signify but in a bussorah carrier from india the twelfth vertebra carried a small rib a quarter of an inch in length with a perfect double articulation  the dorsal vertebrae are always eight in the rockpigeon all eight bear ribs the eighth rib being very thin and the seventh having no process in pouters all the ribs are extremely broad eight bear ribs the eighth rib being very thin and the seventh having no process in pouters all the ribs are extremely broad and in three out of four skeletons examined by me the eighth rib was twice or even thrice as broad as in the rockpigeon and the seventh pair had distinct processes in many breeds there are only seven ribs as in seven out of eight skeletons of various tumblers and in several skeletons of fantails turbits and nuns  in all these breeds the seventh pair was very small and was destitute of processes in which respect it differed from the same rib in the rock pigeon in one tumbler and in the bussorah carrier even the sixth pair had no process the hypapophysis of the second dorsal vertebra varies much in development being sometimes as in several but not all tumblers nearly as prominent as that of the third dorsal vertebra and the two hypapophyses together tend to form an ossified arch the development of the arch formed by the hypapophyses of the third and fourth dorsal vertebrae also varies considerably as does the size of the hypapophysis of the fifth vertebra  the rockpigeon has twelve sacral vertebrae but these vary in number relative size and distinctness in the different breeds in pouters with their elongated bodies there are thirteen or even fourteen and as we shall immediately see an additional number of caudal vertebrae in runts and carriers there is generally the proper number namely twelve but in one runt and in the bussorah carrier there were only eleven in tumblers there are either eleven or twelve or thirteen sacral vertebrae  the caudal vertebrae are seven in number in the rockpigeon in fantails which have their tails so largely developed there are eight or nine and apparently in one case ten and they are a little longer than in the rock pigeon and their shape varies considerably pouters also have eight or nine caudal vertebrae i have seen eight in a nun and jacobin tumblers though such small birds always have the normal number seven as have carriers with one exception in which there were only six  the following table will serve as a summary and will show the most remarkable deviations in the number of the vertebra and ribs which i have observed  table 4 number of vertebrae and ribs in  1 the rock pigeon cervical vertebrae 12 dorsal vertebrae    8 dorsal ribs         8   the 6th pair with processes the 7th pair without a process

a little more equally rounded on both sides than in the rockpigeon the ischium is also frequently rather more elongated the obturatornotch is sometimes as in many tumblers less developed than in the rockpigeon the ridges on the ilium are very prominent in most runts  figure 28 scapulae of natural size a rockpigeon b shortfaced tumbler  in the bones of the extremities i could detect no difference except in their proportional lengths for instance the metatarsus in a pouter was 165 inch and in a shortfaced tumbler only 95 in length and this is a greater difference than would naturally follow from their differentlysized bodies but long legs in the pouter and small feet in the tumbler are selected points in some pouters the scapula is rather straighter and in some tumblers it is straighter with the apex less elongated than in the rockpigeon in figure 28 the scapula of the rockpigeon a and of a shortfaced tumbler b are given the processes at the summit of the coracoid which receive the extremities of the furculum form a more perfect cavity in some tumblers than in the rockpigeon in pouters these processes are larger and differently shaped and the exterior angle of the extremity of the coracoid which is articulated to the sternum is squarer  figure 29 furcula of natural size a shortfaced tumbler b and c fantail d pouter  the two arms of the furculum in pouters diverge less proportionally to their length than in the rockpigeon and the symphysis is more solid and pointed in fantails the degree of divergence of the two arms varies in a remarkable manner in figure 29 b and c represent the furcula of two fantails and it will be seen that the divergence in b is rather less even than in the furculum of the shortfaced smallsized tumbler a whereas the divergence in c equals that in a rockpigeon or in the pouter d though the latter is a much larger bird the extremities of the furculum where articulated to the coracoids vary considerably in outline  in the sternum the differences in form are slight except in the size and outline of the perforations which both in the larger and lesser sized breeds are sometimes small these perforations also are sometimes either nearly circular or elongated as is often the case with carriers the posterior perforations occasionally are not complete being left open posteriorly the marginal apophyses forming the anterior perforations vary greatly in development the degree of convexity of the posterior part of the sternum differs much being sometimes almost perfectly flat the manubrium is rather more prominent in some individuals than in others and the pore immediately under it varies greatly in size  correlation of growth  by this term i mean that the whole organisation is so connected that when one part varies other parts vary but which of two correlated variations ought to be looked at as the cause and which as the effect or whether both result from some common cause we can seldom or never tell the point of interest for us is that when fanciers by the continued selection of slight variations have largely modified one part they often unintentionally produce other modifications for instance the beak is readily acted on by selection and with its increased or diminished length the tongue increases or diminishes but not in due proportion for in a barb and shortfaced tumbler both of which have very short beaks the tongue taking the rockpigeon as the standard of comparison was proportionally not shortened enough whilst in two carriers and in a runt the tongue proportionally with the beak was not lengthened enough thus in a firstrate english carrier in which the beak from the tip to the feathered base was exactly thrice as long as in a firstrate shortfaced tumbler the tongue was only a little more than twice as long but the tongue varies in length independently of the beak thus in a carrier with a beak 12 inch in length the tongue was 67 in length whilst in a runt which equalled the carrier in length of body and in stretch of wings from tip to tip the beak was 92 whilst the tongue was 73 of an inch in length so that the tongue was actually longer than in the carrier with its long beak the tongue of the runt was also very broad at the root of two runts one had its beak longer by 23 of an inch whilst its tongue was shorter by 14 than in the other  with the increased or diminished length of the beak the length of the slit forming the external orifice of the nostrils varies but not in due proportion for taking the rockpigeon as the standard the orifice in a shortfaced tumbler was not shortened in due proportion with its very short beak on the other hand and this could not have been anticipated the orifice in three english carriers in the bagadotten carrier and in a runt pigeon cygne was longer by above the tenth of an inch than would follow from the length of the beak proportionally with that of the rockpigeon in one carrier the orifice of the nostrils was thrice as long as in the rock pigeon though in body and length of beak this bird was not nearly double the size of the rockpigeon this greatly increased length of the orifice of the nostrils seems to stand partly in correlation with the enlargement of the wattled skin on the upper mandible and over the nostrils and this is a character which is selected by fanciers so again the broad naked and wattled skin round the eyes of carriers and barbs is a selected character and in obvious correlation with this the eyelids measured longitudinally are proportionally more than double the length of those of the rockpigeon  the great difference see figure 27 in the curvature of the lower jaw in the rockpigeon the tumbler and bagadotten carrier stands in obvious relation to the curvature of the upper jaw and more especially to the angle formed by the maxillojugal arch with the premaxillary bones but in carriers runts and barbs the singular reflexion of the upper margin of the middle part of the lower jaw see figure 25 is not strictly correlated with the width or divergence as may be clearly seen in figure 26 of the premaxillary bones but with the breadth of the horny and soft parts of the upper mandible which are always overlapped by the edges of the lower mandible  in pouters the elongation of the body is a selected character and the ribs as we have seen have generally become very broad with the seventh pair furnished with processes the sacral and caudal vertebrae have been augmented in number the sternum has likewise increased in length but not in the depth of the crest by 4 of an inch more than would follow from the greater bulk of the body in comparison with that of the rockpigeon in fantails the length and number of the caudal vertebrae have increased hence during the gradual progress of variation and selection the internal bony framework and the external shape of the body have been to a certain extent modified in a correlated manner  although the wings and tail often vary in length independently of each other it is scarcely possible to doubt that they generally tend to become elongated or shortened in correlation this is well seen in jacobins and still more plainly in runts some varieties of which have their wings and tail of great length whilst others have both very short with jacobins the remarkable length of the tail and wingfeathers is not a character which is intentionally selected by fanciers but fanciers have been trying for centuries at least since the year 1600 to increase the length of the reversed feathers on the neck so that the hood may more completely enclose the head and it may be suspected that the increased length of the wing and tailfeathers stand in correlation with the increased length of the neck feathers shortfaced tumblers have short wings in nearly due proportion with the reduced size of their bodies but it is remarkable seeing that the number of the primary wingfeathers is a constant character in most birds that these tumblers generally have only nine instead of ten primaries i have myself observed this in eight birds and the original columbarian society 537 jm eaton treatise edition 1858 page 78 reduced the standard for baldhead tumblers from ten to nine white flight feathers thinking it unfair that a bird which had only nine feathers should be disqualified for a prize because it had not ten white flight feathers on the other hand in carriers and runts which have large bodies and long wings eleven primary feathers have occasionally been observed  mr tegetmeier has informed me of a curious and inexplicable case of correlation namely that young pigeons of all breeds which when mature become white yellow silver ie extremely pale blue or duncoloured are born almost naked whereas pigeons of other colours are born well clothed with down mr esquilant however has observed that young dun carriers are not so bare as young dun barbs and tumblers mr tegetmeier has seen two young birds in the same nest produced from differently coloured parents which differed greatly in the degree to which they were at first clothed with down  i have observed another case of correlation which at first sight appears quite inexplicable but on which as we shall see in a future chapter some light can be thrown by the law of homologous parts varying in the same manner the case is that when the feet are much feathered the roots of the feathers are connected by a web of skin and apparently in correlation with this the two outer toes become connected for a considerable space by skin i have observed this in very many specimens of pouters trumpeters swallows rollertumblers likewise observed in this breed by mr brent and in a lesser degree in other featherfooted pigeons  the feet of the smaller and larger breeds are of course much smaller or larger than those of the rockpigeon but the scutellae or scales covering the toes and tarsi have not only decreased or increased in size but likewise in number to give a single instance i have counted eight scutellae on the hind toe of a runt and only five on that of a shortfaced tumbler with birds in a state of nature the number of the scutellae on the feet is usually a constant character the length of the feet and the length of the beak apparently stand in correlation but as disuse apparently has affected the size of the feet this case may come

the length of beak itself being so variable to the end of the tail and to the oilgland but unfortunately except in a few cases not to the root of the tail i measured each bird from the extreme tip to tip of wing and the length of the terminal folded part of the wing from the extremity of the primaries to the joint of the radius i measured the feet without the claws from the end of the middle toe to the end of the hind toe and the tarsus and middle toe together i have taken in every case the mean measurement of two wild rockpigeons from the shetland islands as the standard of comparison the following table shows the actual length of the feet in each bird and the difference between the length which the feet ought to have had according to the size of body of each in comparison with the size of body and length of feet of the rock pigeon calculated with a few specified exceptions by the standard of the length of the body from the base of the beak to the oilgland i have preferred this standard owing to the variability of the length of tail but i have made similar calculations taking as the standard the length from tip to tip of wing and likewise in most cases from the base of the beak to the end of the tail and the result has always been closely similar to give an example the first bird in the table being a short faced tumbler is much smaller than the rockpigeon and would naturally have shorter feet but it is found on calculation to have feet too short by 11 of an inch in comparison with the feet of the rockpigeon relatively to the size of the body in these two birds as measured from the base of beak to the oilgland so again when this same tumbler and the rockpigeon were compared by the length of their wings or by the extreme length of their bodies the feet of the tumbler were likewise found to be too short in very nearly the same proportion i am well aware that the measurements pretend to greater accuracy than is possible but it was less trouble to write down

    8   in these two tables tables 5iand 5ii we see in the first column the actual length of the feet in thirtysix birds belonging to various breeds and in the two other columns we see by how much the feet are too short or too long according to the size of bird in comparison with the rock pigeon in the first table twentytwo specimens have their feet too short on an average by a little above the tenth of an inch viz 107 and five specimens have their feet on an average a very little too long namely by 07 of an inch but some of these latter cases can be explained for instance with pouters the legs and feet are selected for length and thus any natural tendency to a diminution in the length of the feet will have been counteracted in the swallow and barb when the calculation was made on any standard of comparison besides the one used viz length of body from base of beak to oilgland the feet were found to be too small  in the second table we have eight birds with their beaks much longer than in the rockpigeon both actually and proportionally with the size of body and their feet are in an equally marked manner longer namely in proportion on an average by 29 of an inch i should here state that in table 5i there are a few partial exceptions to the beak being proportionally shorter than in the rockpigeon thus the beak of the english frillback is just perceptibly longer and that of the bussorah carrier of the same length or slightly longer than in the rockpigeon the beaks of spots swallows and laughers are only a very little shorter or of the same proportional length but slenderer nevertheless these two tables taken conjointly indicate pretty plainly some kind of correlation between the length of the beak and the size of the feet breeders of cattle and horses believe that there is an analogous connection between the length of the limbs and head they assert that a racehorse with the head of a drayhorse or a greyhound with the head of a bulldog would be a monstrous production as fancy pigeons are generally kept in small aviaries and are abundantly supplied with food they must walk about much less than the wild rockpigeon and it may be admitted as highly probable that the reduction in the size of the feet in the twentytwo birds in the first table has been caused by disuse 538 in an analogous but converse manner certain natural groups of the columbidae from being more terrestrial in their habits than other allied groups have larger feet see prince bonaparte coup doeil sur lordre des pigeons and that this reduction has acted by correlation on the beaks of the great majority of the birds in table 5i when on the other hand the beak has been much elongated by the continued selection of successive slight increments of length the feet by correlation have likewise become much elongated in comparison with those of the wild rockpigeon notwithstanding their lessened use  as i had taken measures from the end of the middle toe to the heel of the tarsus in the rockpigeon and in the above thirtysix birds i have made calculations analogous with those above given and the result is the same namely that in the shortbeaked breeds with equally few exceptions as in the former case the middle toe conjointly with the tarsus has decreased in length whereas in the longbeaked breeds it has increased in length though not quite so uniformly as in the former case for the leg in some varieties of the runt varies much in length  length of sternum  as fancy pigeons are generally confined in aviaries of moderate size and as even when not confined they do not search for their own food they must during many generations have used their wings incomparably less than the wild rockpigeon hence it seemed to me probable that all the parts of the skeleton subservient to flight would be found to be reduced in size with respect to the sternum i have carefully measured its extreme length in twelve birds of different breeds and in two wild rockpigeons from the shetland islands for the proportional comparison i have tried three standards of measurement with all twelve birds namely the length from the base of the beak to the oilgland to the end of the tail and from the extreme tip to tip of wings the result has been in each case nearly the same the sternum being invariably found to be shorter than in the wild rockpigeon i will give only a single table as calculated by the standard from the base of the beak to the oilgland for the result in this case is nearly the mean between the results obtained by the two other standards  table 5iii  length

of an inch exactly 332 shorter than in the rock pigeon proportionally with the size of their bodies so that the sternum has been reduced by between oneseventh and oneeighth of its entire length and this is a considerable reduction  i have also measured in twentyone birds including the above dozen the prominence of the crest of the sternum relatively to its length independently of the size of the body in two of the twentyone birds the crest was prominent in the same relative degree as in the rockpigeon in seven it was more prominent but in five out of these seven namely in a fantail two scanderoons and two english carriers this greater prominence may to a certain extent be explained as a prominent breast is admired and selected by fanciers in the remaining twelve birds the prominence was less hence it follows that the crest exhibits a slight though uncertain tendency to be reduced in prominence in a greater degree than does the length of the sternum relatively to the size of body in comparison with the rockpigeon  i have measured the length of the scapula in nine different large and smallsized breeds and in all the scapula is proportionally shorter taking the same standard as before than in the wild rockpigeon the reduction in length on an average is very nearly onefifth of an inch or about oneninth of the length of the scapula in the rockpigeon  the arms of the furcula in all the specimens which i compared diverged less proportionally with the size of body than in the rockpigeon and the whole furculum was proportionally shorter thus in a runt which measured from tip to tip of wings 38 12 inches the furculum was only a very little longer with the arms hardly more divergent than in a rock pigeon which measured from tip to tip 26 12 inches in a barb which in all its measurements was a little larger than the same rockpigeon the furculum was a quarter of an inch shorter in a pouter the furculum had not been lengthened proportionally with the increased length of the body in a shortfaced tumbler which measured from tip to tip of wings 24 inches therefore only 2 12 inches less than the rockpigeon the furculum was barely twothirds of the length of that of the rockpigeon  we thus clearly see that the sternum scapula and furculum are all reduced in proportional length but when we turn to the wings we find what at first appears a wholly different and unexpected result i may here remark that i have not picked out specimens but have used every measurement made by me taking the length from the base of beak to the end of the tail as the standard of comparison i find that out of thirtyfive birds of various breeds twentyfive have wings of greater and ten have them of less proportional length than in the rockpigeon but from the frequently correlated length of the tail and wingfeathers it is better to take as the standard of comparison the length from the base of the beak to the oil gland and by this standard out of twentysix of the same birds which had been thus measured twentyone had wings too long and only five had them too short in the twentyone birds the wings exceeded in length those of the rockpigeon on an average by 1 13 inch whilst in the five birds they were less in length by only 8 of an inch as i was much surprised that the wings of closely confined birds should thus so frequently have been increased in length it occurred to me that it might be solely due to the greater length of the wingfeathers for this certainly is the case with the jacobin which has wings of unusual length as in almost every case i had measured the folded wings i subtracted the length of this terminal part from that of the expanded wings and thus i obtained with a moderate degree of accuracy the length of the wings from the ends of the two radii answering from wrist to wrist in our arms the wings thus measured in the same twentyfive birds now gave a widely different result for they were proportionally with those of the rockpigeon too short in seventeen birds and in only eight too long of these eight birds five were longbeaked 539 it perhaps deserves notice that besides these five birds two of the eight were barbs which as i have shown must be classed in the same group with the longbeaked carriers and runts barbs may properly be called shortbeaked carriers it would therefore appear as if during the reduction of their beaks their wings had retained a little of that excess of length which is characteristic of their nearest relations and progenitors and this fact perhaps indicates that there is some correlation of the length of the beak with the length of the bones of the wings in the same manner as with that of the feet and tarsi the shortening of the humerus and radius in the seventeen birds may probably be attributed to disuse as in the case of the scapula and furculum to which the wingbones are attachedthe lengthening of the wingfeathers and consequently the expansion of the wings from tip to tip being on the other hand as completely independent of use and disuse as is the growth of the hair or wool on our longhaired dogs or longwoolled sheep  to sum up we may confidently admit that the length of the sternum and frequently the prominence of its crest the length of the scapula and furculum have all been reduced in size in comparison with the same parts in the rockpigeon and i presume that this may be attributed to disuse or lessened exercise the wings as measured from the ends of the radii have likewise been generally reduced in length but owing to the increased growth of the wingfeathers the wings from tip to tip are commonly longer than in the rockpigeon the feet as well as the tarsi conjointly with the middle toe have likewise in most cases become reduced and this it is probable has been caused by their lessened use but the existence of some sort of correlation between the feet and beak is shown more plainly than the effects of disuse we have also some faint indication of a similar correlation between the main bones of the wing and the beak  summary on the points of difference between the several domestic races and between the individual birds  the beak together with the bones of the face differ remarkably in length breadth shape and curvature the skull differs in shape and greatly in the angle formed by the union of the premaxillary nasal and maxillo jugal bones the curvature of the lower jaw and the reflection of its upper margin as well as the gape of the mouth differ in a highly remarkable manner the tongue varies much in length both independently and in correlation with the length of the beak the development of the naked wattled skin over the nostrils and round the eyes varies in an extreme degree the eyelids and the external orifices of the nostrils vary in length and are to a certain extent correlated with the degree of development of the wattle the size and form of the oesophagus and crop and their capacity for inflation differ immensely the length of the neck varies with the varying shape of the body the breadth and number of the ribs the presence of processes the number of the sacral vertebrae and the length of the sternum all vary the number and size of the coccygeal vertebrae vary apparently in correlation with the increased size of the tail the size and shape of the perforations in the sternum and the size and divergence of the arms of the furculum differ the oilgland varies in development and is sometimes quite aborted the direction and length of certain feathers have been much modified as in the hood of the jacobin and the frill of the turbit the wing and tailfeathers generally vary in length together but sometimes independently of each other and of the size of the body the number and position of the tailfeather vary to an unparalleled degree the primary and secondary wingfeathers occasionally vary in number apparently in correlation with the length of the wing the length of the leg and the size of the feet and in connection with the latter the number of the scutellae all vary a web of skin sometimes connects the bases of the two inner toes and almost invariably the two outer toes when the feet are feathered  the size of the body differs greatly a runt has been known to weigh more than five times as much as a shortfaced tumbler the eggs differ in size and shape according to parmentier 540 temminck hist nat gen des pigeons et des gallinaces tome 1 1813 page 170 some races use much straw in building their nests and others use little but i cannot hear of any recent corroboration of this statement the length of time required for hatching the eggs is uniform in all the breeds the period at which the characteristic plumage of some breeds is acquired and at which certain changes of colour supervene differs the degree to which the young birds are clothed with down when first hatched is different and is correlated in a singular manner with the colour of the plumage the manner of flight and certain inherited movements such as clapping the wings tumbling either in the air or on the ground and the manner of courting the female present the most singular differences in disposition the several races differ some races are very silent others coo in a highly peculiar manner  although many different races have kept true in character during several centuries as we shall hereafter more fully see yet there is far more individual variability in the most constant breeds than in birds in a state of nature there is hardly any exception to the rule that those characters vary most which are now most valued and attended to by fanciers and which consequently are now being improved by continued selection this is indirectly admitted by fanciers when they complain that it is much more difficult to breed high fancy pigeons up to the proper standard of excellence than the socalled toy pigeons which differ from each other merely in colour for particular colours when once acquired are not liable to continued improvement or augmentation some characters become attached from quite unknown causes more strongly to the male than to the female sex so that we have in certain races a tendency towards the appearance of secondary sexual characters 541 this term was used by john hunter for such differences in structure between the males and females

this superfluous who considers the great amount of difference between the races who knows how ancient many of them are and how truly they breed at the present day fanciers almost unanimously believe that the different races are descended from several wild stocks whereas most naturalists believe that all are descended from the columba livia or rockpigeon  temminck 61 temminck hist nat gen des pigeons etc tome 1 page 191 has well observed and mr gould has made the same remark to me that the aboriginal parent must have been a species which roosted and built its nest on rocks and i may add that it must have been a social bird for all the domestic races are highly social and none are known to build or habitually to roost on trees the awkward manner in which some pigeons kept by me in a summerhouse near an old walnuttree occasionally alighted on the barer branches was evident 62 i have heard through sir c lyell from miss buckley that some halfbred carriers kept during many years near london regularly settled by day on some adjoining trees and after being disturbed in their loft by their young being taken roosted on them at night nevertheless mr r scot skirving informs me that he often saw crowds of pigeons in upper egypt settling on low trees but not on palms in preference to alighting on the mud hovels of the natives in india mr blyth 63 annals and mag of nat hist 2nd series volume 20 1857 page 509 and in a late volume of the journal of the asiatic society has been assured that the wild c livia var intermedia sometimes roosts in trees i may here give a curious instance of compulsion leading to changed habits the banks of the nile above lat 28 deg 30 are perpendicular for a long distance so that when the river is full the pigeons cannot alight on the shore to drink and mr skirving repeatedly saw whole flocks settle on the water and drink whilst they floated down the stream these flocks seen from a distance resembled flocks of gulls on the surface of the sea  if any domestic race had descended from a species which was not social or which built its nest and roosted in trees 64 in works written on the pigeon by fanciers i have sometimes observed the mistaken belief expressed that the species which naturalists called groundpigeons in contradistinction to arboreal pigeons do not perch and build on trees in these same works by fanciers wild species resembling the chief domestic races are often said to exist in various parts of the world but such species are quite unknown to naturalists the sharp eyes of fanciers would assuredly have detected some vestige of so different an aboriginal habit for we have reason to believe that aboriginal habits are long retained under domestication thus with the common ass we see signs of its original desert life in its strong dislike to cross the smallest stream of water and in its pleasure in rolling in the dust the same strong dislike to cross a stream is common to the camel which has been domesticated from a very ancient period young pigs though so tame sometimes squat when frightened and thus try to conceal themselves even on an open and bare place young turkeys and occasionally even young fowls when the hen gives the dangercry run away and try to hide themselves like young partridges or pheasants in order that their mother may take flight of which she has lost the power the muskduck cairina moschata in its native country often perches and roosts on trees 65 sir r schomburgk in journal r geograph soc volume 13 1844 page 32 and our domesticated muskducks though such sluggish birds are fond of perching

earth in the delight with which lambs and kids crowd together and frisk on the smallest hillock we see a vestige of their former alpine habits  we have therefore good reason to believe that all the domestic races of the pigeon are descended either from some one or from several species which both roosted and built their nests on rocks and were social in disposition as only five or six wild species have these habits and make any near approach in structure to the domesticated pigeon i will enumerate them  firstly the columba leuconota resembles certain domestic varieties in its plumage with the one marked and neverfailing difference of a white band which crosses the tail at some distance from the extremity this species moreover inhabits the himalaya close to the limit of perpetual snow and therefore as mr blyth has remarked is not likely to have been the parent of our domestic breeds which thrive in the hottest countries secondly the c rupestris of central asia which is intermediate 67 proc zoolog soc 1859 page 400 between the c leuconota and livia but has nearly the same coloured tail as the former species thirdly the columba littoralis builds and roosts according to temminck on rocks in the malayan archipelago it is white excepting parts of the wing and the tip of the tail which are black its legs are lividcoloured and this is a character not observed in any adult domestic pigeon but i need not have mentioned this species or the closelyallied c luctuosa as they in fact belong to the genus carpophaga fourthly columba guinea which ranges from guinea 68 temminck hist nat gen des pigeons tome 1 also les pigeons par mme knip and temminck bonaparte however in his coup doeil believes that two closely allied species are confounded together under this name the c leucocephala of the west indies is stated by temminck to be a rockpigeon but i am informed by mr gosse that this is an error to the cape of good hope and roosts either on trees or rocks according to the nature of the country this species belongs to the genus strictoenas of reichenbach but is closely allied to columba it is to some extent coloured like certain domestic races and has been said to be domesticated in abyssinia but mr mansfield parkyns who collected the birds of that country and knows the species informs me that this is a mistake moreover the c guinea is characterised by the feathers of the neck having peculiar notched tipsa character not observed in any domestic race fifthly the columba oenas of europe which roosts on trees and builds its nest in holes either in trees or the ground this species as far as external characters go might be the parent of several domestic races but though it crosses readily with the true rockpigeon the offspring as we shall presently see are sterile hybrids and of such sterility there is not a trace when the domestic races are intercrossed it should also be observed that if we were to admit against all probability that any of the foregoing five or six species were the parents of some of our domestic pigeons not the least light would be thrown on the chief differences between the eleven most stronglymarked races  we now come to the best known rockpigeon the columba livia which is often designated in europe preeminently as the rockpigeon and which naturalists believe to be the parent of all the domesticated breeds this bird agrees in every essential character with the breeds which have been only slightly modified it differs from all other species in being of a slatyblue colour with two black bars on the wings and with the croup or loins white occasionally birds are seen in faroe and the hebrides with the black bars replaced by two or three black spots this form has been named by brehm 69 handbuch der naturgesch vogel deutschlands c amaliae but this species has not been admitted as distinct by other ornithologists graba 610 tagebuch reise nach faro 1830 s 62 even found a difference in the bars on the right and left wings of the same bird in faroe another and rather more distinct form is either truly wild or has become feral on the cliffs of england and was doubtfully named by mr blyth 611 annals and mag of nat hist volume 19 1847 page 102 this excellent paper on pigeons is well worth consulting as c affinis but is now no longer considered by him as a distinct species c affinis is rather smaller than the rockpigeon of the scottish islands and has a very different appearance owing to the wingcoverts being chequered with black with similar marks often extending over the back the chequering consists of a large black spot on the two sides but chiefly on the outer side of each feather the wingbars in the true rockpigeon and in the chequered variety are in fact due to similar though larger spots symmetrically crossing the secondary wingfeather and the larger coverts hence the chequering arises merely from an extension of these marks to other parts of the plumage chequered birds are not confined to the coasts of england for they were found by graba at faroe and w thompson 612 natural history of ireland birds volume 2 1850 page 11 for graba see previous reference says that at islay fully half the wild rockpigeons were chequered colonel king of hythe stocked his dovecote with young wild birds which he himself procured from nests at the orkney islands and several specimens kindly sent to me by him were all plainly chequered as we thus see that chequered birds occur mingled with the true rockpigeon at three distinct sites namely faroe the orkney islands and islay no importance can be attached to this natural variation in the plumage  prince cl bonaparte 613 coupdoeil sur lordre des pigeons comptes rendus 185455 a great divider of species enumerates with a mark of interrogation as distinct from c livia the c turricola of italy the c rupestris of daouria and the c schimperi of abyssinia but these birds differ from c livia in characters of the most trifling value in the british museum there is a chequered pigeon probably the c schimperi of bonaparte from abyssinia to these may be added the c gymnocyclus of gr gray from w africa which is slightly more distinct and has rather more naked skin round the eyes than the rockpigeon but from information given me by dr daniell it is doubtful whether this is a wild bird for dovecotepigeons which i have examined are kept on the coast of guinea  the wild rockpigeon of india c intermedia of strickland has been more generally accepted as a distinct species it differs chiefly in the croup being blue instead of snowwhite but as mr blyth informs me the tint varies being sometimes albescent when this form is domesticated chequered birds appear just as occurs in europe with the truly wild c livia moreover we shall immediately have proof that the blue and white croup is a highly variable character and bechstein 614 naturgeschichte deutschlands b 4 1795 s 14 asserts that with dovecotepigeons in germany this is the most variable of all the characters of the plumage hence it may be concluded that c intermedia cannot be ranked as specifically distinct from c livia  in madeira there is a rockpigeon which a few ornithologists have suspected to be distinct from c livia i have examined numerous specimens collected by mr ev harcourt and mr mason they are rather smaller than the rock pigeon from the shetland islands and their beaks are plainly thinner but the thickness of the beak varied in the several specimens in plumage there is remarkable diversity some specimens are identical in every feather i speak after actual comparison with the rockpigeon of the shetland islands others are chequered like c affinis from the cliffs of england but generally to a greater degree being almost black over the whole back others are identical with the socalled c intermedia of india in the degree of blueness of the croup whilst others have this part very pale or very dark blue and are likewise chequered so much variability raises a strong suspicion that these birds are domestic pigeons which have become feral  from these facts it can hardly be doubted that c livia affinis intermedia and the forms marked with an interrogation by bonaparte ought all to be included under a single species but it is quite immaterial whether or not they are thus ranked and whether some one of these forms or all are the progenitors of the various domestic kinds as far as any light can thus be thrown on the differences between the more stronglymarked races that common dovecotepigeons which are kept in various parts of the world are descended from one or from several of the abovementioned wild varieties of c livia no one who compares them will doubt but before making a few remarks on dovecotepigeons it should be stated that the wild rockpigeon has been found easy to tame in several countries we have seen that colonel king at hythe stocked his dovecote more than twenty years ago with young wild birds taken at the orkney islands and since then they have greatly multiplied the accurate macgillivray 615 history of british birds volume 1 pages 275284 mr andrew duncan tamed a rockpigeon in the shetland islands mr james barclay and mr smith of uyea sound both say that the wild rockpigeon can be easily tamed and the former gentleman asserts that the tamed birds breed four times a year dr lawrence edmondstone informs me that a wild rockpigeon came and settled in his dovecote in balta sound in the shetland islands and bred with his pigeons he has also given me other instances of the wild rockpigeon having been taken young and breeding in captivity asserts that he completely tamed a wild rockpigeon in the hebrides and several accounts are on records of these pigeons having bred in dovecotes in the shetland islands in india as captain hutton informs me the wild rockpigeon is easily tamed and breeds readily with the domestic kind and mr blyth 616 annals and mag of nat history volume 19 1847 page 103 and volume for 1857 page 512 asserts that wild birds come frequently to the dovecotes and mingle freely with their inhabitants in the ancient ayeen akbery it is written that if a few wild pigeons be taken they are speedily joined by a thousand others of their kind  dovecotepigeons are those which are kept in dovecotes in a semi domesticated state for no special care is taken of them and they procure their own food except during the severest weather in england and judging from mm boitard and corbies work in france the common dovecote pigeon exactly resembles the chequered variety of c livia but i have seen dovecotes brought from yorkshire without any trace of chequering like the wild rockpigeon of the shetland islands the chequered dovecotes from the orkney islands after having been domesticated by colonel king for more than twenty years differed slightly from each other in the darkness of their plumage and in the thickness of their beaks the thinnest beak being rather thicker than the thickest one in the madeira birds in germany according to bechstein the common dovecotepigeon is not chequered in india they often become chequered and sometimes pied with white the croup also as i am informed by mr blyth becomes nearly white i have received from sir j brooke some dovecotepigeons which originally came from the s natunas islands in the malay archipelago and which had been crossed with the singapore dovecotes they were small and the darkest variety was extremely like the dark chequered variety with a blue croup from madeira but the beak was not so thin though decidedly thinner than in the rock pigeon from the shetland islands a dovecotepigeon sent to me by mr swinhoe from foochow in china was likewise rather small but differed in no other respect i have also received through the kindness of dr daniell four living dovecotepigeons from sierra leone 617 domestic pigeons of the common kind are mentioned as being pretty numerous in john barbuts description of the coast of guinea page 215 published in 1746 they are said in accordance with the name which they bear to have been imported these were fully as large as the shetland rockpigeon with even bulkier bodies in plumage some of them were identical with the shetland rock pigeon but with the metallic tints apparently rather more brilliant others had a blue croup and resembled the chequered variety of c intermedia of india and some were so much chequered as to be nearly black in these four birds the beak differed slightly in length but in all it was decidedly shorter more massive and stronger than in the wild rockpigeon from the shetland islands or in the english dovecote when the beaks of these african pigeons were compared with the thinnest beaks of the wild madeira specimens the contrast was great the former being fully onethird thicker in a vertical direction than the latter so that any one at first would have felt inclined to rank these birds as specifically distinct yet so perfectly graduated a series could be formed between the abovementioned varieties that it was obviously impossible to separate them  to sum up the wild columba livia including under this name c affinis intermedia and the other still more closelyaffined geographical races has a vast range from the southern coast of norway and the faroe islands to the shores of the mediterranean to madeira and the canary islands to abyssinia india and japan it varies greatly in plumage being in many places chequered with black and having either a white or blue croup or loins it varies also slightly in the size of the beak and body dovecote pigeons which no one disputes are descended from one or more of the above wild forms present a similar but greater range of variation in plumage in the size of body and in the length and thickness of the beak there seems to be some relation between the croup being blue or white and the temperature of the country inhabited by both wild and dovecote pigeons for nearly all the dovecotepigeons in the northern parts of europe have a white croup like that of the wild european rockpigeon and nearly all the dovecotepigeons of india have a blue croup like that of the wild c intermedia of india as in various countries the wild rockpigeon has been found easy to tame it seems extremely probable that the dovecotepigeons throughout the world are the descendants of at least two and perhaps more wild stocks but these as we have just seen cannot be ranked as specifically distinct  with respect to the variation of c livia we may without fear of contradiction go one step further those pigeonfanciers who believe that all the chief races such as carriers pouters fantails etc are descended from distinct aboriginal stocks yet admit that the socalled toypigeons which differ from the rockpigeon in little except colour are descended from this bird by toypigeons are meant such birds as spots nuns helmets swallows priests monks porcelains swabians archangels breasts shields and others in europe and many others in india it would indeed be as puerile to suppose that all these birds are descended from so many distinct wild stocks as to suppose this to be the case with the many varieties of the gooseberry heartsease or dahlia yet these kinds all breed true and many of them include subvarieties which likewise transmit their character truly they differ greatly from each other and from the rockpigeon in plumage slightly in size and proportions of body in size of feet and in the length and thickness of their beaks they differ from each other in these respects more than do dovecotepigeons although we may safely admit that dovecotepigeons which vary slightly and that toy pigeons which vary in a greater degree in accordance with their more highlydomesticated condition are descended from c livia including under this name the aboveenumerated wild geographical races yet the question becomes far more difficult when we consider the eleven principal races most of which have been profoundly modified it can however be shown by indirect evidence of a perfectly conclusive nature that these principal races are not descended from so many wild stocks and if this be once admitted few will dispute that they are the descendants of c livia which agrees with them so closely in habits and in most characters which varies in a state of nature and which has certainly undergone a considerable amount of variation as in the toypigeons we shall moreover presently see how eminently favourable circumstances have been for a great amount of modification in the more carefully tended breeds  the reasons for concluding that the several principal races are not descended from so many aboriginal and unknown stocks may be grouped under the following six heads  firstly  if the eleven chief races have not arisen from the variation of some one species together with its geographical races they must be descended from several extremely distinct aboriginal species for no amount of crossing between only six or seven wild forms could produce races so distinct as pouters carriers runts fantails turbits shortfaced tumblers jacobins and trumpeters how could crossing produce for instance a pouter or a fantail unless the two supposed aboriginal parents possessed the remarkable characters of these breeds i am aware that some naturalists following pallas believe that crossing gives a strong tendency to variation independently of the characters inherited from either parent they believe that it would be easier to raise a pouter or fantail pigeon from crossing two distinct species neither of which possessed the characters of these races than from any single species i can find few facts in support of this doctrine and believe in it only to a limited degree but in a future chapter i shall have to recur to this subject for our present purpose the point is not material the question which concerns us is whether or not many new and important characters have arisen since man first domesticated the pigeon on the ordinary view variability is due to changed conditions of life on the pallasian doctrine variability or the appearance of new characters is due to some mysterious effect from the crossing of two species neither of which possesses the characters in question in some few instances it is possible that wellmarked races may have been formed by crossing for instance a barb might perhaps be formed by a cross between a longbeaked carrier having large eyewattles and some shortbeaked pigeon that many races have been in some degree modified by crossing and that certain varieties which are distinguished only by peculiar tints have arisen from crosses between differentlycoloured varieties is almost certain on the doctrine therefore that the chief races owe their differences to their descent from distinct species we must admit that at least eight or nine or more probably a dozen species all having the same habit of breeding and roosting on rocks and living in society either now exist somewhere or formerly existed but have become extinct as wild birds considering how carefully wild pigeons have been collected throughout the world and what conspicuous birds they are especially when frequenting rocks it is extremely improbable that eight or nine species which were long ago domesticated and therefore must have inhabited some anciently known country should still exist in the wild state and be unknown to ornithologists  the hypothesis that such species formerly existed but have become extinct is in some slight degree more probable but the extinction of so many species within the historical period is a bold hypothesis seeing how little influence man has had in exterminating the common rockpigeon which agrees in all its habits of life with the domestic races the c livia now exists and flourishes on the small northern islands of faroe on many islands off the coast of scotland on sardinia and the shores of the mediterranean and in the centre of india fanciers have sometimes imagined that the several supposed parentspecies were originally confined to small islands and thus might readily have been exterminated but the facts just given do not favour the probability of their extinction even on small islands nor is it probable from what is known of the distribution of birds that the islands near europe should have been inhabited by peculiar species of pigeons and if we assume that distant oceanic islands were the homes of the supposed parentspecies we must remember that ancient voyages were tediously slow and that ships were then illprovided with fresh food so that it would not have been easy to bring home living birds i have said ancient voyages for nearly all the races of the pigeon were known before the year 1600 so that the supposed wild species must have been captured and domesticated before that date  secondly  the doctrine that the chief domestic races are descended from several aboriginal species implies that several species were formerly so thoroughly domesticated as to breed readily when confined although it is easy to tame most wild birds experience shows us that it is difficult to get them to breed freely under confinement although it must be owned that this is less difficult with pigeons than with most other birds during the last two or three hundred years many birds have been kept in aviaries but hardly one has been added to our list of thoroughly reclaimed species yet on the above doctrine we must admit that in ancient times nearly a dozen kinds of pigeons now unknown in the wild state were thoroughly domesticated  thirdly  most of our domesticated animals have run wild in various parts of the world but birds owing apparently to their partial loss of the power of flight less often than quadrupeds nevertheless i have met with accounts showing that the common fowl has become feral in south america and perhaps in west africa and on several islands the turkey was at one time almost feral on the banks of the parana and the guineafowl has become perfectly wild at ascension and in jamaica in this latter island the peacock also has become a maroon bird the common duck wanders from its home and becomes almost wild in norfolk hybrids between the common and muskduck which have become wild have been shot in north america belgium and near the caspian sea the goose is said to have run wild in la plata the common dovecotepigeon has become wild at juan fernandez norfolk island ascension probably at madeira on the shores of scotland and as is asserted on the banks of the hudson in north america 618 with respect to feral pigeonsfor juan fernandez see

the wild guineafowl in ascension for the peacock see a week at port royal by a competent authority mr r hill page 42 for the turkey i rely on oral information i ascertained that they were not curassows with respect to fowls i will give the references in the next chapter but how different is the case when we turn to the eleven chief domestic races of the pigeon which are supposed by some authors to be descended from so many distinct species no one has ever pretended that any one of these races has been found wild in any quarter of the world yet they have been transported to all countries and some of them must have been carried back to their native homes on the view that all the races are the product of variation we can understand why they have not become feral for the great amount of modification which they have undergone shows how long and how thoroughly they have been domesticated and this would unfit them for a wild life  fourthly  if it be assumed that the characteristic differences between the various domestic races are due to descent from several aboriginal species we must conclude that man chose for domestication in ancient times either intentionally or by chance a most abnormal set of pigeons for that species resembling such birds as pouters fantails carriers barbs short faced tumblers turbits etc would be in the highest degree abnormal as compared with all the existing members of the great pigeon family cannot be doubted thus we should have to believe that man not only formerly succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several highly abnormal species but that these same species have since all become extinct or are at least now unknown this double accident is so extremely improbable that the assumed existence of so many abnormal species would require to be supported by the strongest evidence on the other hand if all the races are descended from c livia we can understand as will hereafter be more fully explained how any slight deviation in structure which first appeared would continually be augmented by the preservation of the most strongly marked individuals and as the power of selection would be applied according to mans fancy and not for the birds own good the accumulated amount of deviation would certainly be of an abnormal nature in comparison with the structure of pigeons living in a state of nature  i have already alluded to the remarkable fact that the characteristic differences between the chief domestic races are eminently variable we see this plainly in the great difference in the number of the tailfeathers in the fantail in the development of the crop in pouters in the length of the beak in tumblers in the state of the wattle in carriers etc if these characters are the result of successive variations added together by selection we can understand why they should be so variable for these are the very parts which have varied since the domestication of the pigeon and therefore would be likely still to vary these variations moreover have been recently and are still being accumulated by mans selection therefore they have not as yet become firmly fixed  fifthly  all the domestic races pair readily together and what is equally important their mongrel offspring are perfectly fertile to ascertain this fact i made many experiments which are given in the note below and recently mr tegetmeier has made similar experiments with the same result 619 i have drawn out a long table of the various crosses made by fanciers between the several domestic breeds but i do not think it worth while publishing i have myself made for this special purpose many crosses and all were perfectly fertile i have united in one bird five of the most distinct races and with patience i might undoubtedly have thus united all the case of five distinct breeds being blended together with unimpaired fertility is important because gartner has shown that it is a very general though not as he thought universal rule that complex crosses between several species are excessively sterile i have met with only two or three cases of reported sterility in the offspring of certain races when crossed pistor das ganze der feldtaubenzucht 1831 s 15 asserts that the mongrels from barbs and fantails are sterile i have proved this to be erroneous not only by crossing those hybrids with several other hybrids of the same parentage but by the more severe test of pairing brother and sister hybrids inter se and they were perfectly fertile temminck has stated hist nat gen des pigeons tome 1 page 197 that the turbit or owl will not cross readily with other breeds but my turbits crossed when left free with almond tumblers and with trumpeters the same thing has occurred rev es dixon the dovecote page 107 between turbits and dovecotes and nuns i have crossed turbits with barbs as has m boitard page 34 who says the hybrids were very fertile hybrids from a turbit and fantail have been known to breed inter se riedel taubenzucht s 25 and bechstein naturgesch deutsch b 4 s 44 turbits riedel s 26 have been crossed with pouters and with jacobins and with a hybrid jacobintrumpeter riedel s 27 the latter author has however made some vague statements s 22 on the sterility of turbits when crossed with certain other crossed breeds but i have little doubt that the rev es dixons explanation of such statements is correct viz that individual birds both with turbits and other breeds are occasionally sterile the accurate neumeister asserts that when dovecotes are crossed with pigeons of any other breed the mongrels are extremely fertile and hardy 620 das ganze der taubenzucht s 18 mm boitard and corbie 621 les pigeons etc page 35 affirm after their great experience that the more distinct the breeds are which are crossed the more productive are their mongrel offspring i admit that the doctrine first broached by pallas is highly probable if not actually proved namely that closely allied species which in a state of nature or when first captured would have been in some degree sterile if crossed lose this sterility after a long course of domestication yet when we consider the great difference between such races as pouters carriers runts fantails turbits tumblers etc the fact of their perfect or even increased fertility when intercrossed in the most complicated manner becomes a strong argument in favour of their having all descended from a single species this argument is rendered much stronger when we hear i append in a note 622 domestic pigeons pair readily with the allied c oenas bechstein naturgesch deutschlands b 4 s 3 and mr brent has made the same cross several times in england but the young were very apt to die at about ten days old one hybrid which he reared from c oenas and a male antwerp carrier paired with a dragon but never laid eggs bechstein further states s 26 that the domestic pigeon will cross with c palumbus turtur risoria and t vulgaris but nothing is said of the fertility of the hybrids and this would have been mentioned had the fact been ascertained in the zoological gardens ms report to me from mr james hunt a male hybrid from turtur vulgaris and a domestic pigeon paired with several different species of pigeons and doves but none of the eggs were good hybrids from c oenas and gymnophthalmos were sterile in loudons mag of nat hist volume 7 1834 page 154 it is said that a male hybrid from turtur vulgaris male and the creamcoloured t risoria female paired during two years with a female t risoria and the latter laid many eggs but all were sterile mm boitard and corbie les pigeons page 235 state that the hybrids from these two turtledoves are invariably sterile both inter se and with either pure parent the experiment was tried by m corbie avec une espece dobstination and likewise by m mauduyt and by m vieillot temminck also found the hybrids from these two species quite barren therefore when bechstein naturgesch deutschlands vogel b 4 s 101 asserts that the hybrids from these two turtledoves propagate inter se equally well with pure species and when a writer in the field newspaper in a letter dated november 10th 1858 makes a similar assertion it would appear that there must be some mistake though what the mistake is i know not as bechstein at least must have known the white variety of t risoria it would be an unparalleled fact if the same two species sometimes produced extremely fertile and sometimes extremely barren offspring in the ms report from the zoological gardens it is said that hybrids from turtur vulgaris and suratensis and from t vulgaris and ectopistes migratorius were sterile two of the latter male hybrids paired with their pure parents viz turtur vulgaris and the ectopistes and likewise with t risoria and with columba oenas and many eggs were produced but all were barren at paris hybrids have been raised isid geoffrey sainthilaire hist nat generale tome 3 page 180 from turtur auritus with t cambayensis and with t suratensis but nothing is said of their fertility at the zoological gardens of london the goura coronata and victoriae produced a hybrid which paired with the pure g coronata and laid several eggs but these proved barren in 1860 columba gymnophthalmos and maculosa produced hybrids in these same gardens all the cases which i have collected that hardly a single wellascertained instance is known of hybrids between two true species of pigeons being fertile inter se or even when crossed with one of their pure parents  sixthly  excluding certain important characteristic differences the chief races agree most closely both with each other and with c livia in all other respects as previously observed all are eminently sociable all dislike to perch or roost and refuse to build in trees all lay two eggs and this is not a universal rule with the columbidae all as far as i can hear require the same time for hatching their eggs all can endure the same great range of climate all prefer the same food and are passionately fond of salt all exhibit with the asserted exception of the finnikin and turner which do not differ much in any other character the same peculiar gestures when courting the females and all with the exception of trumpeters and laughers which likewise do not differ much in any other character coo in the same peculiar manner unlike the voice of any other wild pigeon all the coloured breeds display the same peculiar metallic tints on the breast a character far from general with pigeons each race presents nearly the same range of variation in colour and in most of the races we have the same singular correlation between the development of down in the young and the future colour of plumage all have the proportional length of their toes and of their primary wingfeathers nearly the same characters which are apt to differ in the several members of the columbidae in those races which present some remarkable deviation of structure such as in the tail of fantails crop of pouters beak of carriers and tumblers etc the other parts remain nearly unaltered now every naturalist will admit that it would be scarcely possible to pick out a dozen natural species in any family which should agree closely in habits and in general structure and yet should differ greatly in a few characters alone this fact is explicable through the doctrine of natural selection for each successive modification of structure in each natural species is preserved solely because it is of service and such modifications when largely accumulated imply a great change in the habits of life and this will almost certainly lead to other changes of structure throughout the whole organisation on the other hand if the several races of the pigeon have been produced by man through selection and variation we can readily understand how it is that they should still all resemble each other in habits and in those many characters which man has not cared to modify whilst they differ to so prodigious a degree in those parts which have struck his eye or pleased his fancy  besides the points above enumerated in which all the domestic races resemble c livia and each other there is one which deserves special notice the wild rockpigeon is of a slatyblue colour the wings are crossed by two bars the croup varies in colour being generally white in the pigeon of europe and blue in that of india the tail has a black bar close to the end and the outer webs of the outer tailfeathers are edged with white except near the tips these combined characters are not found in any wild pigeon besides c livia i have looked carefully through the great collections of pigeons in the british museum and i find that a dark bar at the end of the tail is common that the white edging to the outer tailfeathers is not rare but that the white croup is extremely rare and the two black bars on the wings occur in no other pigeon excepting the alpine c leuconota and c rupestris of asia now if we turn to the domestic races it is highly remarkable as an eminent fancier mr wicking observed to me that whenever a blue bird appears in any race the wings almost invariably show the double black bars 623 there is one exception to the rule namely in a subvariety of the swallow of german origin which is figured by neumeister and was shown to me by mr wicking this bird is blue but has not the black wingbars for our object however in tracing the descent of the chief races this exception signifies the less as the swallow approaches closely in structure to c livia in many subvarieties the black bars are replaced by bars of various colours the figures given by neumeister are sufficient to show that if the wings alone are blue the black wingbars appear the primary wing feathers may be white or black and the whole body may be of any colour but if the wingcoverts are blue the two black bars are sure to appear i have myself seen or acquired trustworthy evidence as given below 624 i have observed blue birds with all the abovementioned marks in the following races which seemed to be perfectly pure and were shown at various exhibitions pouters with the double black wingbars with white croup dark bar to end of tail and white edging to outer tailfeathers turbits with all these same characters fantails with the same but the croup in some was bluish or pure blue mr wicking bred blue fantails from two black birds carriers including the bagadotten of neumeister with all the marks two birds which i examined had white and two had blue croups the white edging to the outer tailfeathers was not present in all mr corker a great breeder assures me that if black carriers are matched for many successive generations the offspring become first ashcoloured and then blue with black wingbars runts of the elongated breed had the same marks but the croup was pale blue the outer tailfeathers had white edges neumeister figures the great florence runt of a blue colour with black bars jacobins are very rarely blue but i have received authentic accounts of at least two instances of the blue variety with black bars having appeared in england blue jacobins were bred by mr brent from two black birds i have seen common tumblers both indian and english and shortfaced tumblers of a blue colour with black wingbars with the black bar at the end of the tail and with the outer tailfeathers edged with white the croup in all was blue or extremely pale blue never absolutely white blue barbs and trumpeters seem to be excessively rare but neumeister who may be implicitly trusted figures blue varieties of both with black wingbars mr brent informs me that he has seen a blue barb and mr h weir as i am informed by mr tegetmeier once bred a silver which means very pale blue barb from two yellow birds of blue birds with black bars on the wing with the croup either white or very pale or dark blue with the tail having a terminal black bar and with the outer feathers externally edged with white or very pale coloured in the following races which as i carefully observed in each case appeared to be perfectly true namely in pouters fantails tumblers jacobins turbits barbs carriers runts of three distinct varieties trumpeters swallows and in many other toypigeons which as being closely allied to c livia are not worth enumerating thus we see that in purelybred races of every kind known in europe blue birds occasionally appear having all the marks which characterise c livia and which concur in no other wild species mr blyth also has made the same observation with respect to the various domestic races known in india  certain variations in the plumage are equally common in the wild c livia in dovecotepigeons and in all the most highly modified races thus in all the croup varies from white to blue being most frequently white in europe and very generally blue in india 625 mr blyth informs me that all the domestic races in india have the croup blue but this is not invariable for i possess a very pale blue simmali pigeon with the croup perfectly white sent to me by sir w elliot from madras a slatyblue and chequered nakshi pigeon has some white feathers on the croup alone in some other indian pigeons there were a few white feathers confined to the croup and i have noticed the same fact in a carrier from persia the java fantail imported into amoy and thence sent me has a perfectly white croup we have seen that the wild c livia in europe and dovecotes in all parts of the world often have the upper wingcoverts chequered with black and all the most distinct races when blue are occasionally chequered in precisely the same manner thus i have seen pouters fantails carriers turbits tumblers indian and english swallows baldpates and other toypigeons blue and chequered and mr esquilant has seen a chequered runt i bred from two pure blue tumblers a chequered bird  the facts hitherto given refer to the occasional appearance in pure races of blue birds with black wingbars and likewise of blue and chequered birds but it will now be seen that when two birds belonging to distinct races are crossed neither of which have nor probably have had during many generations a trace of blue in their plumage or a trace of wingbars and the other characteristic marks they very frequently produce mongrel offspring of a blue colour sometimes chequered with black wingbars etc or if not of a blue colour yet with the several characteristic marks more or less plainly developed i was led to investigate this subject from mm boitard and corbie 626 les pigeons etc page 37 having asserted that from crosses between certain breeds it is rare to get anything but bisets or dovecote pigeons which as we know are blue birds with the usual characteristic marks we shall hereafter see that this subject possesses independently of our present object considerable interest so that i will give the results of my own trials in full i selected for experiment races which when pure very seldom produce birds of a blue colour or have bars on their wings and tail  the nun is white with the head tail and primary wingfeathers black it is a breed which was established as long ago as the year 1600 i crossed a male nun with a female red common tumbler which latter variety generally breeds true thus neither parent had a trace of blue in the plumage or of bars on the wing and tail i should premise that common tumblers are rarely blue in england from the above cross i reared several young one was red over the whole back but with the tail as blue as that of the rockpigeon the terminal bar however was absent but the outer feathers were edged with white a second and third nearly resembled the first but the tail in both presented a trace of the bar at the end a fourth was brownish and the wings showed a trace of the double bar a fifth was pale blue over the whole breast back croup and tail but the neck and primary wingfeathers were reddish the wings presented two distinct bars of a red colour the tail was not barred but the outer feathers were edged with white i crossed this last curiously coloured bird with a black mongrel of complicated descent namely from a black barb a spot and almondtumbler so that the two young birds produced from this cross included the blood of five varieties none of which had a trace of blue or of wing and tailbars one of the two young birds was brownishblack with black wingbars the other was reddishdun with reddish wingbars paler than the rest of the body with the croup pale blue the tail bluish with a trace of the terminal bar  mr eaton 627 treatise on pigeons 1858 page 145 matched two short faced tumblers namely a splash cock and kite hen neither of which are blue or barred and from the first nest he got a perfect blue bird and from the second a silver or pale blue bird both of which in accordance with all analogy no doubt presented the usual characteristic marks  i crossed two male black barbs with two female red spots these latter have the whole body and wings white with a spot on the forehead the tail and tailcoverts red the race existed at least as long ago as 1676 and now breeds perfectly true as was known to be the case in the year 1735 628 j moore columbarium 1735 in jm eatons edition 1852 page 71 barbs are uniformlycoloured birds with rarely even a trace of bars on the wing or tail they are known to breed very true the mongrels thus raised were black or nearly black or dark or pale brown sometimes slightly piebald with white of these birds no less than six presented double wingbars in two the bars were conspicuous and quite black in seven some white feathers appeared on the croup and in two or three there was a trace of the terminal bar to the tail but in none were the outer tailfeathers edged with white  i crossed black barbs of two excellent strains with purelybred snow white fantails the mongrels were generally quite black with a few of the primary wing and tail feathers white others were dark reddishbrown and others snowwhite none had a trace of wingbars or of the white croup i then paired together two of these mongrels namely a brown and black bird and their offspring displayed wingbars faint but of a darker brown than the rest of body in a second brood from the same parents a brown bird was produced with several white feathers confined to the croup  i crossed a male dun dragon belonging to a family which had been dun coloured without wingbars during several generations with a uniform red barb bred from two black barbs and the offspring presented decided but faint traces of wingbars i crossed a uniform red male runt with a white trumpeter and the offspring had a slatyblue tail with a bar at the end and with the outer feathers edged with white i also crossed a female black and white chequered trumpeter of a different strain from the last with a male almondtumbler neither of which exhibited a trace of blue or of the white croup or of the bar at end of tail nor is it probable that the progenitors of these two birds had for many generations exhibited any of these characters for i have never even heard of a blue trumpeter in this country and my almondtumbler was purely bred yet the tail of this mongrel was bluish with a broad black bar at the end and the croup was perfectly white it may be observed in several of these cases that the tail first shows a tendency to become by reversion blue and this fact of the persistency of colour in the tail and tailcoverts 629 i could give numerous examples two will suffice a mongrel whose four grandparents were a white turbit white trumpeter white fantail and blue pouter was white all over except a very few feathers about the head and on the wings but the whole tail and tailcoverts were dark bluishgrey another mongrel whose four grandparents were a red runt white trumpeter white fantail and the same blue pouter was pure white all over except the tail and upper aillcoverts which were pale fawn and except the faintest trace of double wingbars of the same pale fawn tint will surprise no one who has attended to the crossing of pigeons  the last case which i will give is the most curious i paired a mongrel female barbfantail with a mongrel male barbspot neither of which mongrels had the least blue about them let it be remembered that blue barbs are excessively rare that spots as has been already stated were perfectly characterised in the year 1676 and breed perfectly true this likewise is the case with white fantails so much so that i have never heard of white fantails throwing any other colour nevertheless the offspring from the above two mongrels was of exactly the same blue tint as that of the wild rockpigeon from the shetland islands over the whole back and wings the double black wingbars were equally conspicuous the tail was exactly alike in all its characters and the croup was pure white the head however was tinted with a shade of red evidently derived from the spot and was of a paler blue than in the rockpigeon as was the stomach so that two black barbs a red spot and a white fantail as the four purelybred grandparents produced a bird exhibiting the general blue colour together with every characteristic mark the wild columba livia  with respect to crossed breeds frequently producing blue birds chequered with black and resembling in all respects both the dovecotepigeon and the chequered wild variety of the rockpigeon the statement before referred to by mm boitard and corbie would almost suffice but i will give three instances of the appearance of such birds from crosses in which one alone of the parents or greatgrandparents was blue but not chequered i crossed a male blue turbit with a snowwhite trumpeter and the following year with a dark leadenbrown shortfaced tumbler the offspring from the first cross were as perfectly chequered as any dovecotepigeon and from the second so much so as to be nearly as black as the most darkly chequered rockpigeon from madeira another bird whose greatgrandparents were a white trumpeter a white fantail a white redspot a red runt and a blue pouter was slatyblue and chequered exactly like a dovecotepigeon i may here add a remark made to me by mr wicking who has had more experience than any other person in england in breeding pigeons of various colours namely that when a blue or a blue and chequered bird having black wing bars once appears in any race and is allowed to breed these characters are so strongly transmitted that it is extremely difficult to eradicate them  what then are we to conclude from this tendency in all the chief domestic races both when purely bred and more especially when intercrossed to produce offspring of a blue colour with the same characteristic marks varying in the same manner as in columbia livia if we admit that these races are all descended from c livia no breeder will doubt that the occasional appearance of blue birds thus characterised is accounted for on the wellknown principle of throwing back or reversion why crossing should give so strong a tendency to reversion we do not with certainty know but abundant evidence of this fact will be given in the following chapters it is probable that i might have bred even for a century pure black barbs spots nuns white fantails trumpeters etc without obtaining a single blue or barred bird yet by crossing these breeds i reared in the first and second generation during the course of only three or four years a considerable number of young birds more or less plainly coloured blue and with most of the characteristic marks when black and white or black and red birds are crossed it would appear that a slight tendency exists in both parents to produce blue offspring and that this when combined overpowers the separate tendency in either parent to produce black or white or red offspring  if we reject the belief that all the races of the pigeon are the modified descendants of c livia and suppose that they are descended from several aboriginal stocks then we must choose between the three following assumptions firstly that at least eight or nine species formerly existed which were aboriginally coloured in various ways but have since varied in exactly the same manner so as to assume the colouring of c livia but this assumption throws not the least light on the appearance of such colours and marks when the races are crossed or secondly we may assume that the aboriginal species were all coloured blue and had the wingbars and other characteristic marks of c liviaa supposition which is highly improbable as besides this one species no existing member of the columbidae presents these combined characters and it would not be possible to find any other instance of several species identical in plumage yet as different in important points of structure as are pouters fantails carriers tumblers etc or lastly we may assume that all the races whether descended from c livia or from several aboriginal species although they have been bred with so much care and are so highly valued by fanciers have all been crossed within a dozen or score of generations with c livia and have thus acquired their tendency to produce blue birds with the several characteristic marks i have said that it must be assumed that each race has been crossed with c livia within a dozen or at the utmost within a score of generations for there is no reason to believe that crossed offspring ever revert to one of their ancestors when removed by a greater number of generations in a breed which has been crossed only once the tendency to reversion will naturally become less and less in the succeeding generations as in each there will be less and less of the blood of the foreign breed but when there has been no cross with a distinct breed and there is a tendency in both parents to revert to some longlost character this tendency for all that we can see to the contrary may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations these two distinct cases of reversion are often confounded together by those who have written on inheritance  considering on the one hand the improbability of the three assumptions which have just been discussed and on the other hand how simply the facts are explained on the principle of reversion we may conclude that the occasional appearance in all the races both when purely bred and more especially when crossed of blue birds sometimes chequered with double wingbars with white or blue croups with a bar at the end of the tail and with the outer tailfeathers edged with white affords an argument of the greatest weight in favour of the view that all are descended from columba livia including under this name the three or four wild varieties or subspecies before enumerated  to sum up the six foregoing arguments which are opposed to the belief that the chief domestic races are the descendants of at least eight or nine or perhaps a dozen species for the crossing of any less number would not yield the characteristic differences between the several races firstly the improbability that so many species should still exist somewhere but be unknown to ornithologists or that they should have become within the historical period extinct although man has had so little influence in exterminating the wild c livia secondly the improbability of man in former times having thoroughly domesticated and rendered fertile under confinement so many species thirdly these supposed species having nowhere become feral fourthly the extraordinary fact that man should intentionally or by chance have chosen for domestication several species extremely abnormal in character and furthermore the points of structure which render these supposed species so abnormal being now highly variable fifthly the fact of all the races though differing in many important points of structure producing perfectly fertile mongrels whilst all the hybrids which have been produced between even closely allied species in the pigeonfamily are sterile sixthly the remarkable statements just given on the tendency in all the races both when purely bred and when crossed to revert in numerous minute details of colouring to the character of the wild rockpigeon and to vary in a similar manner to these arguments may be added the extreme improbability that a number of species formerly existed which differed greatly from each other in some few points but which resembled each other as closely as do the domestic races in other points of structure in voice and in all their habits of life when these several facts and arguments are fairly taken into consideration it would require an overwhelming amount of evidence to make us admit that the chief domestic races are descended from several aboriginal stocks and of such evidence there is absolutely none  the belief that the chief domestic races are descended from several wild stocks no doubt has arisen from the apparent improbability of such great modifications of structure having been effected since man first domesticated the rockpigeon nor am i surprised at any degree of hesitation in admitting their common parentage formerly when i went into my aviaries and watched such birds as pouters carriers barbs fantails and shortfaced tumblers etc i could not persuade myself that all had descended from the same wild stock and that man had consequently in one sense created these remarkable modifications therefore i have argued the question of their origin at great and as some will think superfluous length  finally in favour of the belief that all the races are descended from a single stock we have in columba livia a still existing and widely distributed species which can be and has been domesticated in various countries this species agrees in most points of structure and in all its habits of life as well as occasionally in every detail of plumage with the several domestic races it breeds freely with them and produces fertile offspring it varies in a state of nature 630 it deserves notice as bearing on the general subject of variation that not only c livia presents several wild forms regarded by some naturalists as species and by others as subspecies or as mere varieties but that the species of several allied genera are in the same predicament this is the case as mr blyth has remarked to me with treron palumbus and turtur and still more so when semidomesticated as shown by comparing the sierra leone pigeons with those of india or with those which apparently have run wild in madeira it has undergone a still greater amount of variation in the case of the numerous toypigeons which no one supposes to be descended from distinct species yet some of these toypigeons have transmitted their character truly for centuries why then should we hesitate to believe in that greater amount of variation which is necessary for the production of the eleven chief races it should be borne in mind that in two of the most stronglymarked races namely carriers and shortfaced tumblers the extreme forms can be connected with the parentspecies by graduated differences not greater than those which may be observed between the dovecotepigeons inhabiting different countries or between the various kinds of toypigeonsgradations which must certainly be attributed to variation  that circumstances have been eminently favourable for the modification of the pigeon through variation and selection will now be shown the earliest record as has been pointed out to me by professor lepsius of pigeons in a domesticated condition occurs in the fifth egyptian dynasty about 3000 bc 631 denkmaler abth 2 bl 70 but mr birch of the british museum informs me that the pigeon appears in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty domestic pigeons are mentioned in genesis leviticus and isaiah 632 the dovecote by the rev es dixon 1851 pages 1113 adolphe pictet in his les origines indoeuropeennes 1859 page 399 states that there are in the ancient sanscrit language between 25 and 30 names for the pigeon and other 15 or 16 persian names none of these are common to the european languages this fact indicates the antiquity of the domestication of the pigeon in the east in the time of the romans as we hear from pliny 633 english translation 1601 book 10 ch 37 immense prices were given for pigeons nay they are come to this pass that they can reckon up their pedigree and race in india about the year 1600 pigeons were much valued by akber khan 20000 birds were carried about with the court and the merchants brought valuable collections the monarch of iran and turan sent him some very rare breeds his majesty says the courtly historian by crossing the breeds which method was never practised before has improved them astonishingly 634 ayeen akbery translated by f gladwin 4to edition volume 1 page 270 akber khan possessed seventeen distinct kinds eight of which were valuable for beauty alone at about this same period of 1600 the dutch according to aldrovandi were as eager about pigeons as the romans had formerly been the breeds which were kept during the fifteenth century in europe and in india apparently differed from each other tavernier in his travels in 1677 speaks as does chardin in 1735 of the vast number of pigeonhouses in persia and the former remarks that as christians were not permitted to keep pigeons some of the vulgar actually turned mahometans for this sole purpose the emperor of morocco had his favourite keeper of pigeons as is mentioned in moores treatise published 1737 in england from the time of willughby in 1678 to the present day as well as in germany and in france numerous treatises have been published on the pigeon in india about a hundred years ago a persian treatise was written and the writer thought it no light affair for he begins with a solemn invocation in the name of god the gracious and merciful many large towns in europe and the united states now have their societies of devoted pigeonfanciers at present there are three such societies in london in india as i hear from mr blyth the inhabitants of delhi and of some other great cities are eager fanciers mr layard informs me that most of the known breeds are kept in ceylon in china according to mr swinhoe of amoy and dr lockhart of shangai carriers fantails tumblers and other varieties are reared with care especially by the bonzes or priests the chinese fasten a kind of whistle to the tailfeathers of their pigeons and as the flock wheels through the air they produce a sweet sound in egypt the late abbas pacha was a great fancier of fantails many pigeons are kept at cairo and constantinople and these have lately been imported by native merchants as i hear from sir w elliot into southern india and sold at high prices  the foregoing statements show in how many countries and during how long a period many men have been passionately devoted to the breeding of pigeons hear how an enthusiastic fancier at the present day writes if it were possible for noblemen and gentlemen to know the amazing amount of solace and pleasure derived from almond tumblers when they begin to understand their properties i should think that scarce any nobleman or gentleman would be without their aviaries of almond tumblers 635 jm eaton treatise on the almond tumbler 1851 preface page 6 the pleasure thus taken is of paramount importance as it leads amateurs carefully to note and preserve each slight deviation of structure which strikes their fancy pigeons are often closely confined during their whole lives they do not partake of their naturally varied diet they have often been transported from one climate to another and all these changes in their conditions of life would be likely to cause variability pigeons have been domesticated for nearly 5000 years and have been kept in many places so that the numbers reared under domestication must have been enormous and this is another circumstance of high importance for it obviously favours the chance of rare modifications of structure occasionally appearing slight variations of all kinds would almost certainly be observed and if valued would owing to the following circumstances be preserved and propagated with unusual facility pigeons differently from any other domesticated animal can easily be mated for life and though kept with other pigeons rarely prove unfaithful to each other even when the male does break his marriagevow he does not permanently desert his mate i have bred in the same aviaries many pigeons of different kinds and never reared a single bird of an impure strain hence a fancier can with the greatest ease select and match his birds he will also see the good results of his care for pigeons breed with extraordinary rapidity he may freely reject inferior birds as they serve at an early age as excellent food  history of the principal races of the pigeon 636 as in the following discussion i often speak of the present time i should state that this chapter was completed in the year 1858  before discussing the means and steps by which the chief races have been formed it will be advisable to give some historical details for more is known of the history of the pigeon little though this is than of any other domesticated animal some of the cases are interesting as proving how long domestic varieties may be propagated with exactly the same or nearly the same characters and other cases are still more interesting as showing how slowly but steadily races have been greatly modified during successive generations in the last chapter i stated that trumpeters and laughers both so remarkable for their voices seem to have been perfectly characterised in 1735 and laughers were apparently known in india before the year 1600 spots in 1676 and nuns in the time of aldrovandi before 1600 were coloured exactly as they now are common tumblers and ground tumblers displayed in india before the year 1600 the same extraordinary peculiarities of flight as at the present day for they are well described in the ayeen akbery these breeds may all have existed for a much longer period we know only that they were perfectly characterised at the dates above given the average length of life of the domestic pigeon is probably about five or six years if so some of these races have retained their character perfectly for at least forty or fifty generations  pouters  these birds as far as a very short description serves for comparison appear to have been well characterised in aldrovandis time 637 ornithologie 1600 volume 2 page 360 before the year 1600 length of body and length of leg are at the present time the two chief points of excellence in 1735 moore said see mr jm eatons editionand moore was a firstrate fancierthat he once saw a bird with a body 20 inches in length though 17 or 18 inches is reckoned a very good length and he has seen the legs very nearly 7 inches in length yet a leg 6 12 or 6 34 long must be allowed to be a very good one mr bult the most successful breeder of pouters in the world informs me that at present 1858 the standard length of the body is not less than 18 inches but he has measured one bird 19 inches in length and has heard of 20 and 22 inches but doubts the truth of these latter statements the standard length of the leg is now 7 inches but mr bult has recently measured two of his own birds with legs 7 12 long so that in the 123 years which have elapsed since 1735 there has been hardly any increase in the standard length of the body 17 or 18 inches was formerly reckoned a very good length and now 18 inches is the minimum standard but the length of leg seems to have increased as moore never saw one quite 7 inches long now the standard is 7 and two of mr bults birds measured 7 12 inches in length the extremely slight improvement in pouters except in the length of the leg during the last 123 years may be partly accounted for by the neglect which they suffered as i am informed by mr bult until within the last 20 or 30 years about 1765 638 a treatise on domestic pigeons dedicated to mr mayor 1765 preface page 14 there was a change of fashion stouter and more feathered legs being preferred to thin and nearly naked legs  fantails  the first notice of the existence of this breed is in india before the year 1600 as given in the ayeen akbery 639 mr blyth has given a translation of part of the ayeen akbery in annals and mag of nat hist volume 19 1847 page 104 at this date judging from aldrovandi the breed was unknown in europe in 1677 willughby speaks of a fantail with 26 tailfeathers in 1735 moore saw one with 36 feathers and in 1824 mm boitard and corbie assert that in france birds can easily be found with 42 tailfeathers in england the number of the tailfeathers is not at present so much regarded as their upward direction and expansion the general carriage of the bird is likewise now much valued the old descriptions do not suffice to show whether in these latter respects there has been much improvement but if fantails with their heads and tails touching had formerly existed as at the present time the fact would almost certainly have been noticed the fantails which are now found in india probably show the state of the race as far as carriage is concerned at the date of their introduction into europe and some said to have been brought from calcutta which i kept alive were in a marked manner inferior to our exhibition birds the java fantail shows the same difference in carriage and although mr swinhoe has counted 18 and 24 tailfeathers in his birds a firstrate specimen sent to me had only 14 tailfeathers  jacobins  this breed existed before 1600 but the hood judging from the figure given by aldrovandi did not enclose the head nearly so perfectly as at present nor was the head then white nor were the wings and tail so long but this last character might have been overlooked by the rude artist in moores time in 1735 the jacobin was considered the smallest kind of pigeon and the bill is said to be very short hence either the jacobin or the other kinds with which it was then compared must since that time have been considerably modified for moores description and it must be remembered that he was a firstrate judge is clearly not applicable as far as size of body and length of beak are concerned to our present jacobins in 1795 judging from bechstein the breed had assumed its present character  turbits  it has generally been supposed by the older writers on pigeons that the turbit is the cortbeck of aldrovandi but if this be the case it is an extraordinary fact that the characteristic frill should not have been noticed the beak moreover of the cortbeck is described as closely resembling that of the jacobin which shows a change in the one or the other race the turbit with its characteristic frill and bearing its present name is described by willughby in 1677 and the bill is said to be like that of the bullfincha good comparison but now more strictly applicable to the beak of the barb the subbreed called the owl was well known in moores time in 1735  tumblers  common tumblers as well as ground tumblers perfect as far as tumbling is concerned existed in india before the year 1600 and at this period diversified modes of flight such as flying at night the ascent to a great height and manner of descent seem to have been much attended to in india as at the present time belon 640 lhistoire de la nature des oiseaux page 314 in 1555 saw in paphlagonia what he describes as a very new thing viz pigeons which flew so high in the air that they were lost to view but returned to their pigeonhouse without separating this manner of flight is characteristic of our present tumblers but it is clear that belon would have mentioned the act of tumbling if the pigeons described by him had tumbled tumblers were not known in europe in 1600 as they are not mentioned by aldrovandi who discusses the flight of pigeons they are briefly alluded to by willughby in 1687 as small pigeons which show like footballs in the air the shortfaced race did not exist at this period as willughby could not have overlooked birds so remarkable for their small size and short beaks we can even trace some of the steps by which this race has been produced moore in 1735 enumerates correctly the chief points of excellence but does not give any description of the several subbreeds and from this fact mr eaton infers 641 treatise on pigeons 1852 page 64 that the shortfaced tumbler had not then come to full perfection moore even speaks of the jacobin as being the smallest pigeon thirty years afterwards in 1765 in the treatise dedicated to mayor shortfaced almond tumblers are fully described but the author an excellent fancier expressly states in his preface page 14 that from great care and expense in breeding them they have arrived to so great perfection and are so different from what they were 20 or 30 years past that an old fancier would have condemned them for no other reason than because they are not like what used to be thought good when he was in the fancy before hence it would appear that there was a rather sudden change in the character of the shortfaced tumbler at about this period and there is reason to suspect that a dwarfed and halfmonstrous bird the parentform of the several shortfaced subbreeds then appeared i suspect this because shortfaced tumblers are born with their beaks ascertained by careful measurement as short proportionally with the size of their bodies as in the adult bird and in this respect they differ greatly from all other breeds which slowly acquire during growth their various characteristic qualities  since the year 1765 there has been some change in one of the chief characters of the shortfaced tumbler namely in the length of the beak fanciers measure the head and beak from the tip of the beak to the front corner of the eyeball about the year 1765 a head and beak was considered good 642 jm eaton treatise on the breeding and managing of the almond tumbler 1851 compare page 5 of preface page 9 and page 32 which measured in the usual manner was 78 of an inch in length now it ought not to exceed 58 of an inch it is however possible as mr eaton candidly confesses for a bird to be considered as pleasant or neat even at 68 of an inch but exceeding that length it must be looked upon as unworthy of attention mr eaton states that he has never seen in the course of his life more than two or three birds with the head and beak not exceeding half an inch in length still i believe in the course of a few years that the head and beak will be shortened and that halfinch birds will not be considered so great a curiosity as at the present time that mr eatons opinion deserves attention cannot be doubted considering his success in winning prizes at our exhibitions finally in regard to the tumbler it may be concluded from the facts above given that it was originally introduced into europe probably first into england from the east and that it then resembled our common english tumbler or more probably the persian or indian tumbler with a beak only just perceptibly shorter than that of the common dovecotepigeon with respect to the short faced tumbler which is not known to exist in the east there can hardly be a doubt that the whole wonderful change in the size of the head beak body and feet and in general carriage has been produced during the last two centuries by continued selection aided probably by the birth of a semi monstrous bird somewhere about the year 1750  runts  of their history little can be said in the time of pliny the pigeons of campania were the largest known and from this fact alone some authors assert that they were runts in aldrovandis time in 1600 two subbreeds existed but one of them the shortbeaked is now extinct in europe  barbs  notwithstanding statements to the contrary it seems to me impossible to recognise the barb in aldrovandis description and figures four breeds however existed in the year 1600 which evidently were allied both to barbs and carriers to show how difficult it is to recognise some of the breeds described by aldrovandi i will give the different opinions in regard to the above four kinds named by him c indica cretensis gutturosa and persica willughby thought that the columba indica was a turbit but the eminent fancier mr brent believes that it was an inferior barb c cretensis with a short beak and a swelling on the upper mandible cannot be recognised c falsely called gutturosa which from its rostrum breve crassum et tuberosum seems to me to come nearest to the barb mr brent believes to be a carrier and lastly the c persica et turcica mr brent thinks and i quite concur with him was a shortbeaked carrier with very little wattle in 1687 the barb was known in england and willughby describes the beak as like that of the turbit but it is not credible that his barbs should have had a beak like that of our present birds for so accurate an observer could not have overlooked its great breadth  english carrier  we may look in vain in aldrovandis work for any bird resembling our prize carriers the c persica et turcica of this author comes the nearest but is said to have had a short thick beak therefore it must have approached in character a barb and have differed greatly from our carriers in willughbys time in 1677 we can clearly recognise the carrier yet he adds the bill is not short but of a moderate length a description which no one would apply to our present carriers so conspicuous for the extraordinary length of their beaks the old names given in europe to the carrier and the several names now in use in india indicate that carriers originally came from persia and willughbys description would perfectly apply to the bussorah carrier as it now exists in madras in later times we can partially trace the progress of change in our english carriers moore in 1735 says an inch and a half is reckoned a long beak though there are very good carriers that are found not to exceed an inch and a quarter these birds must have resembled or perhaps been a little superior to the carriers previously described now found in persia in england at the present day there are as mr eaton 643 treatise on pigeons 1852 page 41 states beaks that would measure from edge of eye to tip of beak one inch and threequarters and some few even two inches in length  from these historical details we see that nearly all the chief domestic races existed before the year 1600 some remarkable only for colour appear to have been identical with our present breeds some were nearly the same some considerably different and some have since become extinct several breeds such as finnikins and turners the swallowtailed pigeon of bechstein and the carmelite seem to have originated and to have disappeared within this same period any one now visiting a wellstocked english aviary would certainly pick out as the most distinct kinds the massive runt the carrier with its wonderfully elongated beak and great wattles the barb with its short broad beak and eyewattles the short faced tumbler with its small conical beak the pouter with its great crop long legs and body the fantail with its upraised widelyexpanded well feathered tail the turbit with its frill and short blunt beak and the jacobin with his hood now if this same person could have viewed the pigeons kept before 1600 by akber khan in india and by aldrovandi in europe he would have seen the jacobin with a less perfect hood the turbit apparently without its frill the pouter with shorter legs and in every way less remarkablethat is if aldrovandis pouter resembled the old german kind the fantail would have been far less singular in appearance and would have had much fewer feathers in its tail he would have seen excellent flying tumblers but he would in vain have looked for the marvellous shortfaced breeds he would have seen birds allied to barbs but it is extremely doubtful whether he would have met with our actual barbs and lastly he would have found carriers with beaks and wattle incomparably less developed than in our english carriers he might have classed most of the breeds in the same groups as at present but the differences between the groups were then far less strongly pronounced than at present in short the several breeds had at this early period not diverged in so great a degree as now from their aboriginal common parent the wild rockpigeon  manner of formation of the chief races  we will now consider more closely the probable steps by which the chief races have been formed as long as pigeons are kept semidomesticated in dovecotes in their native country without any care in selecting and matching them they are liable to little more variation than the wild c livia namely in the wings becoming chequered with black in the croup being blue or white and in the size of the body when however dovecote pigeons are transported into diversified countries such as sierra leone the malay archipelago and madeira they are exposed to new conditions of life and apparently in consequence vary in a somewhat greater degree when closely confined either for the pleasure of watching them or to prevent their straying they must be exposed even in their native climate to considerably different conditions for they cannot obtain their natural diversity of food and what is probably more important they are abundantly fed whilst debarred from taking much exercise under these circumstances we might expect to find from the analogy of all other domesticated animals a greater amount of individual variability than with the wild pigeon and this is the case the want of exercise apparently tends to reduce the size of the feet and organs of flight and then from the law of correlation of growth the beak apparently becomes affected from what we now see occasionally taking place in our aviaries we may conclude that sudden variations or sports such as the appearance of a crest of feathers on the head of feathered feet of a new shade of colour of an additional feather in the tail or wing would occur at rare intervals during the many centuries which have elapsed since the pigeon was first domesticated at the present day such sports are generally rejected as blemishes and there is so much mystery in the breeding of pigeons that if a valuable sport did occur its history would often be concealed before the last hundred and fifty years there is hardly a chance of the history of any such sport having been recorded but it by no means follows from this that such sports in former times when the pigeon had undergone much less variation would have been rejected we are profoundly ignorant of the cause of each sudden and apparently spontaneous variation as well as of the infinitely numerous shades of difference between the birds of the same family but in a future chapter we shall see that all such variations appear to be the indirect result of changes of some kind in the conditions of life  hence after a long course of domestication we might expect to see in the pigeon much individual variability and occasional sudden variations as well as slight modifications from the lessened use of certain parts together with the effects of correlation of growth but without selection all this would produce only a trifling or no result for without such aid differences of all kinds would from the two following causes soon disappear in a healthy and vigorous lot of pigeons many more young birds are killed for food or die than are reared to maturity so that an individual having any peculiar character if not selected would run a good chance of being destroyed and if not destroyed the peculiarity in question would generally be obliterated by free intercrossing it might however occasionally happen that the same variation repeatedly occurred owing to the action of peculiar and uniform conditions of life and in this case it would prevail independently of selection but when selection is brought into play all is changed for this is the foundationstone in the formation of new races and with the pigeon circumstances as we have already seen are eminently favourable for selection when a bird presenting some conspicuous variation has been preserved and its offspring have been selected carefully matched and again propagated and so onwards during successive generations the principle is so obvious that nothing more need be said about it this may be called methodical selection for the breeder has a distinct object in view namely to preserve some character which has actually appeared or to create some improvement already pictured in his mind  another form of selection has hardly been noticed by those authors who have discussed this subject but is even more important this form may be called unconscious selection for the breeder selects his birds unconsciously unintentionally and without method yet he surely though slowly produces a great result i refer to the effects which follow from each fancier at first procuring and afterwards rearing as good birds as he can according to his skill and according to the standard of excellence at each successive period he does not wish permanently to modify the breed he does not look to the distant future or speculate on the final result of the slow accumulation during many generations of successive slight changes he is content if he possesses a good stock and more than content if he can beat his rivals the fancier in the time of aldrovandi when in the year 1600 he admired his own jacobins pouters or carriers never reflected what their descendants in the year 1860 would become he would have been astonished could he have seen our jacobins our improved english carriers and our pouters he would probably have denied that they were the descendants of his own onceadmired stock and he would perhaps not have valued them for no other reason as was written in 1765 than because they were not like what used to be thought good when he was in the fancy no one will attribute the lengthened beak of the carrier the shortened beak of the shortfaced tumbler the lengthened leg of the pouter the more perfectly enclosed hood of the jacobin etcchanges effected since the time of aldrovandi or even since a much later periodto the direct and immediate action of the conditions of life for these several races have been modified in various and even in directly opposite ways though kept under the same climate and treated in all respects in as nearly uniform a manner as possible each slight change in the length or shortness of the beak in the length of leg etc has no doubt been indirectly and remotely caused by some change in the conditions to which the bird has been subjected but we must attribute the final result as is manifest in those cases of which we have any historical record to the continued selection and accumulation of many slight successive variations  the action of unconscious selection as far as pigeons are concerned depends on a universal principle in human nature namely on our rivalry and desire to outdo our neighbours we see this in every fleeting fashion even in our dress and it leads the fancier to endeavour to exaggerate every peculiarity in his breeds a great authority on pigeons 644 eaton treatise on pigeons 1858 page 86 says fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard that is half and half which is neither here nor there but admire extremes after remarking that the fancier of short faced beard tumblers wishes for a very short beak and that the fancier of longfaced beard tumblers wishes for a very long beak he says with respect to one of intermediate length dont deceive yourself do you suppose for a moment the short or the longfaced fancier would accept such a bird as a gift certainly not the shortfaced fancier could see no beauty in it the longfaced fancier would swear there was no use in it etc in these comical passages written seriously we see the principle which has ever guided fanciers and has led to such great modifications in all the domestic races which are valued solely for their beauty or curiosity  fashions in pigeonbreeding endure for long periods we cannot change the structure of a bird as quickly as we can the fashion of our dress in the time of aldrovandi no doubt the more the pouter inflated his crop the more he was valued nevertheless fashions do to a certain extent change first one point of structure and then another is attended to or different breeds are admired at different times and in different countries as the author just quoted remarks the fancy ebbs and flows a thorough fancier nowadays never stoops to breed toybirds yet these very toys are now most carefully bred in germany breeds which at the present time are highly valued in india are considered worthless in england no doubt when breeds are neglected they degenerate still we may believe that as long as they are kept under the same conditions of life characters once gained will be partially retained for a long time and may form the startingpoint for a future course of selection  let it not be objected to this view of the action of unconscious selection that fanciers would not observe or care for extremely slight differences those alone who have associated with fanciers can be thoroughly aware of their accurate powers of discrimination acquired by long practice and of the care and labour which they bestow on their birds i have known a fancier deliberately study his birds day after day to settle which to match together and which to reject observe how difficult the subject appears to one of the most eminent and experienced fanciers mr eaton the winner of many prizes says i would here particularly guard you against keeping too great a variety of pigeons otherwise you will know a little about all the kinds but nothing about one as it ought to be known it is possible there may be a few fanciers that have a good general knowledge of the several fancy pigeons but there are many who labour under the delusion of supposing they know what they do not speaking exclusively of one sub variety of one race namely the shortfaced almond tumbler and after saying that some fanciers sacrifice every property to obtain a good head and beak and that other fanciers sacrifice everything for plumage he remarks some young fanciers who are over covetous go in for all the five properties at once and they have their reward by getting nothing in india as i hear from mr blyth pigeons are likewise selected and matched with the greatest care we must not judge of the slight divergences from existing varieties which would have been valued in ancient days by those which are now valued after the formation of so many races each with its own standard of perfection kept uniform by our numerous exhibitions the ambition of the most energetic fancier may be fully satisfied by the difficulty of excelling other fanciers in the breeds already established without trying to form a new one  a difficulty with respect to the power of selection will perhaps already have occurred to the reader namely what could have led fanciers first to attempt to make such singular breeds as pouters fantails carriers etc but it is this very difficulty which the principle of unconscious selection removes undoubtedly no fancier ever did intentionally make such an attempt all that we need suppose is that a variation occurred sufficiently marked to catch the discriminating eye of some ancient fancier and then unconscious selection carried on for many generations that is the wish of succeeding fanciers to excel their rivals would do the rest in the case of the fantail we may suppose that the first progenitor of the breed had a tail only slightly erected as may now be seen in certain runts 645 see neumeisters figure of the florence runt tab 13 in das ganze der taubenzucht with some increase in the number of the tailfeathers as now occasionally occurs with nuns in the case of the pouter we may suppose that some bird inflated its crop a little more than other pigeons as is now the case in a slight degree with the oesophagus of the turbit we do not know the origin of the common tumbler but we may suppose that a bird was born with some affection of the brain leading it to make somersaults in the air 646 mr wj moore gives a full account of the ground tumblers of india indian medical gazette january and february 1873 and says the pricking the base of the brain and giving hydrocyanic acid together with strychnine to an ordinary pigeon brings on convulsive movements exactly like those of a tumbler one pigeon the brain of which had been pricked completely recovered and ever afterwards occasionally made somersaults and before the year 1600 pigeons remarkable for their diversified manner of flight were much valued in india and by the order of the emperor akber khan were sedulously trained and carefully matched  in the foregoing cases we have supposed that a sudden variation conspicuous enough to catch a fanciers eye first appeared but even this degree of abruptness in the process of variation is not necessary for the formation of a new breed when the same kind of pigeon has been kept pure and has been bred during a long period by two or more fanciers slight differences in the strain can often be recognised thus i have seen first rate jacobins in one mans possession which certainly differed slightly in several characters from those kept by another i possessed some excellent barbs descended from a pair which had won a prize and another lot descended from a stock formerly kept by that famous fancier sir john sebright and these plainly differed in the form of the beak but the differences were so slight that they could hardly be given by words again the common english and dutch tumbler differ in a somewhat greater degree both in length of beak and shape of head what first caused these slight differences cannot be explained any more than why one man has a long nose and another a short one in the strains long kept distinct by different fanciers such differences are so common that they cannot be accounted for by the accident of the birds first chosen for breeding having been originally as different as they now are the explanation no doubt lies in selection of a slightly different nature having been applied in each case for no two fanciers have exactly the same taste and consequently no two in choosing and carefully matching their birds prefer or select exactly the same as each man naturally admires his own birds he goes on continually exaggerating by selection whatever slight peculiarities they may possess this will more especially happen with fanciers living in different countries who do not compare their stocks or aim at a common standard of perfection thus when a mere strain has once been formed unconscious selection steadily tends to augment the amount of difference and thus converts the strain into a subbreed and this ultimately into a wellmarked breed or race  the principle of correlation of growth should never be lost sight of most pigeons have small feet apparently caused by their lessened use and from correlation as it would appear their beaks have likewise become reduced in length the beak is a conspicuous organ and as soon as it had thus become perceptibly shortened fanciers would almost certainly strive to reduce it still more by the continued selection of birds with the shortest beaks whilst at the same time other fanciers as we know has actually been the case would in other subbreeds strive to increase its length with the increased length of the beak the tongue becomes greatly lengthened as do the eyelids with the increased development of the eyewattles with the reduced or increased size of the feet the number of the scutellae vary with the length of the wing the number of the primary wingfeathers differ and with the increased length of the body in the pouter the number of the sacral vertebrae is augmented these important and correlated differences of structure do not invariably characterise any breed but if they had been attended to and selected with as much care as the more conspicuous external differences there can hardly be a doubt that they would have been rendered constant fanciers could assuredly have made a race of tumblers with nine instead of ten primary wingfeathers seeing how often the number nine appears without any wish on their part and indeed in the case of the whitewinged varieties in opposition to their wish in a similar manner if the vertebrae had been visible and had been attended to by fanciers assuredly an additional number might easily have been fixed in the pouter if these latter characters had once been rendered constant we should never have suspected that they had at first been highly variable or that they had arisen from correlation in the one case with the shortness of the wings and in the other case with the length of the body  in order to understand how the chief domestic races have become distinctly separated from each other it is important to bear in mind that fanciers constantly try to breed from the best birds and consequently that those which are inferior in the requisite qualities are in each generation neglected so that after a time the less improved parentstocks and many subsequently formed intermediate grades become extinct this has occurred in the case of the pouter turbit and trumpeter for these highly improved breeds are now left without any links closely connecting them either with each other or with the aboriginal rockpigeon in other countries indeed where the same care has not been applied or where the same fashion has not prevailed the earlier forms may long remain unaltered or altered only in a slight degree and we are thus sometimes enabled to recover the connecting links this is the case in persia and india with the tumbler and carrier which there differ but slightly from the rockpigeon in the proportions of their beaks so again in java the fantail sometimes has only fourteen caudal feathers and the tail is much less elevated and expanded than in our improved birds so that the java bird forms a link between a firstrate fantail and the rockpigeon  occasionally a breed may be retained for some particular quality in a nearly unaltered condition in the same country together with highly modified offshoots or subbreeds which are valued for some distinct property we see this exemplified in england where the common tumbler which is valued only for its flight does not differ much from its parent form the eastern tumbler whereas the shortfaced tumbler has been prodigiously modified from being valued not for its flight but for other qualities but the commonflying tumbler of europe has already begun to branch out into slightly different subbreeds such as the common english tumbler the dutch roller the glasgow housetumbler and the longfaced beard tumbler etc and in the course of centuries unless fashions greatly change these subbreeds will diverge through the slow and insensible process of unconscious selection and become modified in a greater and greater degree after a time the perfectly graduated links which now connect all these subbreeds together will be lost for there would be no object and much difficulty in retaining such a host of intermediate subvarieties  the principle of divergence together with the extinction of the many previously existing intermediate forms is so important for understanding the origin of domestic races as well as of species in a state of nature that i will enlarge a little more on this subject our third main group includes carriers barbs and runts which are plainly related to one another yet wonderfully distinct in several important characters according to the view given in the last chapter these three races have probably descended from an unknown race having an intermediate character and this race from the rockpigeon their characteristic differences are believed to be due to different breeders having at an early period admired different points of structure and then on the acknowledged principle of admiring extremes having gone on breeding without any thought of the future as good birds as they couldcarrierfanciers preferring long beaks with much wattlebarbfanciers preferring short thick beaks with much eyewattleand runtfanciers not caring about the beak or wattle but only for the size and weight of the body this process would have led to the neglect and final extinction of the earlier inferior and intermediate birds and thus it has come to pass that in europe these three races are now so extraordinarily distinct from each other but in the east whence they were originally brought the fashion has been different and we there see breeds which connect the highly modified english carrier with the rockpigeon and others which to a certain extent connect carriers and runts looking back to the time of aldrovandi we find that there existed in europe before the year 1600 four breeds which were closely allied to carriers and barbs but which competent authorities cannot now identify with our present barbs and carriers nor can aldrovandis runts be identified with our present runts these four breeds certainly did not differ from each other nearly so much as do our existing english carriers barbs and runts all this is exactly what might have been anticipated if we could collect all the pigeons which have ever lived from before the time of the romans to the present day we should be able to group them in several lines diverging from the parent rockpigeon each line would consist of almost insensible steps occasionally broken by some slightly greater variation or sport and each would culminate in one of our present highly modified forms of the many former connecting links some would be found to have become absolutely extinct without having left any issue whilst others though extinct would be recognised as the progenitors of the existing races  i have heard it remarked as a strange circumstance that we occasionally hear of the local or complete extinction of domestic races whilst we hear nothing of their origin how it has been asked can these losses be compensated and more than compensated for we know that with almost all domesticated animals the races have largely increased in number since the time of the romans but on the view here given we can understand this apparent contradiction the extinction of a race within historical times is an event likely to be noticed but its gradual and scarcely sensible modification through unconscious selection and its subsequent divergence either in the same or more commonly in distant countries into two or more strains and their gradual conversion into subbreeds and these into well marked breeds are events which would rarely be noticed the death of a tree that has attained gigantic dimensions is recorded the slow growth of smaller trees and their increase in number excite no attention  in accordance with the belief in the great power of selection and of the little direct power of changed conditions of life except in causing general variability or plasticity of organisation it is not surprising that dovecotepigeons have remained unaltered from time immemorial and that some toypigeons which differ in little else besides colour from the dovecotepigeon have retained the same character for several centuries for when one of these toypigeons had once become beautifully and symmetrically colouredwhen for instance a spot had been produced with the crown of its head its tail and tailcoverts of a uniform colour the rest of the body being snowwhiteno alteration or improvement would be desired on the other hand it is not surprising that during this same interval of time our highlybred pigeons have undergone an astonishing amount of change for in regard to them there is no defined limit to the wish of the fancier and there is no known limit to the variability of their characters what is there to stop the fancier desiring to give to his carrier a longer and longer beak or to his tumbler a shorter and shorter beak nor has the extreme limit of variability in the beak if there be any such limit as yet been reached notwithstanding the great improvement effected within recent times in the shortfaced almond tumbler mr eaton remarks the field is still as open for fresh competitors as it was one hundred years ago but this is perhaps an exaggerated assertion for the young of all highlyimproved fancy birds are extremely liable to disease and death  i have heard it objected that the formation of the several domestic races of the pigeon throws no light on the origin of the wild species of the columbidae because their differences are not of the same nature the domestic races for instance do not differ or differ hardly at all in the relative lengths and shape of the primary wingfeathers in the relative length of the hind toe or in habits of life as in roosting and building in trees but the above objection shows how completely the principle of selection has been misunderstood it is not likely that characters selected by the caprice of man should resemble differences preserved under natural conditions either from being of direct service to each species or from standing in correlation with other modified and serviceable structures until man selects birds differing in the relative length of the wing feathers or toes etc no sensible change in these parts should be expected nor could man do anything unless these parts happened to vary under domestication i do not positively assert that this is the case although i have seen traces of such variability in the wingfeathers and certainly in the tailfeathers it would be a strange fact if the relative length of the hind toe should never vary seeing how variable the foot is both in size and in the number of the scutellae with respect to the domestic races not roosting or building in trees it is obvious that fanciers would never attend to or select such changes in habits but we have seen that the pigeons in egypt which do not for some reason like settling on the low mud hovels of the natives are led apparently by compulsion to perch in crowds on the trees we may even affirm that if our domestic races had become greatly modified in any of the above specified respects and it could be shown that fanciers had never attended to such points or that they did not stand in correlation with other selected characters the fact on the principles advocated in this chapter would have offered a serious difficulty  let us briefly sum up the last two chapters on the pigeon we may conclude with confidence that all the domestic races notwithstanding their great amount of difference are descended from the columba livia including under this name certain wild races but the differences between the latter throw no light whatever on the characters which distinguish the domestic races in each breed or subbreed the individual birds are more variable than birds in a state of nature and occasionally they vary in a sudden and stronglymarked manner this plasticity of organisation apparently results from changed conditions of life disuse has reduced certain parts of the body correlation of growth so ties the organisation together that when one part varies other parts vary at the same time when several breeds have once been formed their intercrossing aids the progress of modification and has even produced new subbreeds but as in the construction of a building mere stones or bricks are of little avail without the builders art so in the production of new races selection has been the presiding power fanciers can act by selection on excessively slight individual differences as well as on those greater differences which are called sports selection is followed methodically when the fancier tries to improve and modify a breed according to a prefixed standard of excellence or he acts unmethodically and unconsciously by merely trying to rear as good birds as he can without any wish or intention to alter the breed the progress of selection almost inevitably leads to the neglect and ultimate extinction of the earlier and less improved forms as well as of many intermediate links in each long line of descent thus it has come to pass that most of our present races are so marvellously distinct from each other and from the aboriginal rockpigeon   chapter 1vii  fowls  brief descriptions of the chief breeds arguments in favour of their

disuse on certain parts correlation of growth  as some naturalists may not be familiar with the chief breeds of the fowl it will be advisable to give a condensed description of them 71 i have drawn up this brief synopsis from various sources but chiefly from information given me by mr tegetmeier this gentleman has kindly looked through this chapter and from his wellknown knowledge the statements here given may be fully trusted mr tegetmeier has likewise assisted me in every possible way in obtaining for me information and specimens i must not let this opportunity pass without expressing my cordial thanks to mr bp brent a wellknown writer on poultry for continuous assistance and the gift of many specimens from what i have read and seen of specimens brought from several quarters of the world i believe that most of the chief kinds have been imported into england but many subbreeds are probably still unknown here the following discussion on the origin of the various breeds and on their characteristic differences does not pretend to completeness but may be of some interest to the naturalist the classification of the breeds cannot as far as i can see be made natural they differ from each other in different degrees and do not afford characters in subordination to each other by which they can be ranked in group under group they seem all to have diverged by independent and different roads from a single type each chief breed includes differently coloured subvarieties most of which can be truly propagated but it would be superfluous to describe them i have classed the various crested fowls as subbreeds under the polish fowl but i have great doubts whether this is a natural arrangement showing true affinity or blood relationship it is scarcely possible to avoid laying stress on the commonness of a breed and if certain foreign subbreeds had been largely kept in this country they would perhaps have been raised to the rank of mainbreeds several breeds are abnormal in character that is they differ in certain points from all wild gallinaceous birds at first i made a division of the breeds into normal and abnormal but the result was wholly unsatisfactory  1 game breed  this may be considered as the typical breed as it deviates only slightly from the wild gallus bankiva or as perhaps more correctly named ferrugineus beak strong comb single and upright

informed by mr birch of the british museum characterised by small size alone carriage bold and erect there are several subbreeds such as the cochin game and sebright bantams some of which have been recently formed by various crosses the black bantam has a differently shaped skull with the occipital foramen like that of the cochin fowl  9 rumpless fowls  these are so variable in character 76

thus characterised  from this synopsis we see that the several breeds differ considerably and they would have been nearly as interesting for us as pigeons if there had been equally good evidence that all had descended from one parentspecies most fanciers believe that they are descended from several primitive stocks the rev es dixon 77 ornamental and domestic poultry 1848 argues strongly on this side of the question and one fancier even denounces the opposite conclusion by asking do we not perceive pervading this spirit the spirit of the deist most naturalists with the exception of a few such as temminck believe that all the breeds have proceeded from a single species but authority on such a point goes for little fanciers look to all parts of the world as the possible sources of their unknown stocks thus ignoring the laws of geographical distribution they know well that the several kinds breed truly even in colour they assert but as we shall see on very weak grounds that most of the breeds are extremely ancient they are strongly impressed with the great difference between the chief kinds and they ask with force can differences in climate food or treatment have produced birds so different as the black stately spanish the diminutive elegant bantam the heavy cochin with its many peculiarities and the polish fowl with its great topknot and protuberant skull but fanciers whilst admitting and even overrating the effects of crossing the various breeds do not sufficiently regard the probability of the occasional birth during the course of centuries of birds with abnormal and hereditary peculiarities they overlook the effects of correlation of growthof the longcontinued use and disuse of parts and of some direct result from changed food and climate though on this latter head i have found no sufficient evidence and lastly they all as far as i know entirely overlook the allimportant subject of unconscious or unmethodical selection though they are well aware that their birds differ individually and that by selecting the best birds for a few generations they can improve their stocks  an amateur writes 78 ferguson illustrated series of rare and prize poultry 1834 page 6 preface as follows the fact that poultry have until lately received but little attention at the hands of the fancier and been entirely confined to the domains of the producer for the market would alone suggest the improbability of that constant and unremitting attention having been observed in breeding which is requisite to the consummating in the offspring of any two birds transmittable forms not exhibited by the parents this at first sight appears true but in a future chapter on selection abundant facts will be given showing not only that careful breeding but that actual selection was practised during ancient periods and by barely civilised races of man in the case of the fowl i can adduce no direct facts showing that selection was anciently practised but the romans at the commencement of the christian era kept six or seven breeds and columella particularly recommends as the best those sorts that have five toes and white ears 79 rev es dixon in his ornamental poultry page 203 gives an account of columellas work in the fifteenth century several breeds were known and described in europe and in china at nearly the same period seven kinds were named a more striking case is that at present in one of the philippine islands the semibarbarous inhabitants have distinct native names for no less than nine subbreeds of the game fowl 710 mr crawfurd on the relation of the domesticated animals to civilization separately printed page 6 first read before the brit assoc at oxford 1860 azara 711 quadrupedes du paraguay tome 2 page 324 who wrote towards the close of the last century states that in the interior parts of south america where i should not have expected that the least care would have been taken of poultry a blackskinned and black boned breed is kept from being considered fertile and its flesh good for sick persons now every one who has kept poultry knows how impossible it is to keep several breeds distinct unless the utmost care be taken in separating the sexes will it then be pretended that those persons who in ancient times and in semicivilised countries took pains to keep the breeds distinct and who therefore valued them would not occasionally have destroyed inferior birds and occasionally have preserved their best birds this is all that is required it is not pretended that any one in ancient times intended to form a new breed or to modify an old breed according to some ideal standard of excellence he who cared for poultry would merely wish to obtain and afterwards to rear the best birds which he could but this occasional preservation of the best birds would in the course of time modify the breed as surely though by no means as rapidly as does methodical selection at the present day if one person out of a hundred or out of a thousand attended to the breeding of his birds this would be sufficient for the birds thus tended would soon become superior to others and would form a new strain and this strain would as explained in the last chapter slowly have its characteristic differences augmented and at last be converted into a new subbreed or breed but breeds would often be for a time neglected and would deteriorate they would however partially retain their character and afterwards might again come into fashion and be raised to a standard of perfection higher than their former standard as has actually occurred quite recently with polish fowls if however a breed were utterly neglected it would become extinct as has recently happened with one of the polish subbreeds whenever in the course of past centuries a bird appeared with some slight abnormal structure such as with a larklike crest on its head it would probably often have been preserved from that love of novelty which leads some persons in england to keep rumpless fowls and others in india to keep frizzled fowls and after a time any such abnormal appearance would be carefully preserved from being esteemed a sign of the purity and excellence of the breed for on this principle the romans eighteen centuries ago valued the fifth toe and the white earlobe in their fowls  thus from the occasional appearance of abnormal characters though at first only slight in degree from the effects of the use and the disuse of parts possibly from the direct effects of changed climate and food from correlation of growth from occasional reversions to old and longlost characters from the crossing of breeds when more than one had been formed but above all from unconscious selection carried on during many generations there is no insuperable difficulty to the best of my judgment in believing that all the breeds have descended from some one parentsource can any single species be named from which we may reasonably suppose that all are descended the gallus bankiva apparently fulfils every requirement i have already given as fair an account as i could of the arguments in favour of the multiple origin of the several breeds and now i will give those in favour of their common descent from g bankiva  but it will be convenient first briefly to describe all the known species of gallus the g sonneratii does not range into the northern parts of india according to colonel sykes 712 proc zoolog soc 1832 page 151 it presents at different heights of the ghauts two strongly marked varieties perhaps deserving to be called species it was at one time thought to be the primitive stock of all our domestic breeds and this shows that it closely approaches the common fowl in general structure but its hackles partially consist of highly peculiar horny laminae transversely banded with three colours and i have met no authentic account of any such character having been observed in any domestic breed 713 these feathers have been described by dr w marshall der zoolog garten april 1874 page 124 i examined the feathers of some hybrids raised in the zoological gardens between the male g sonneratii and a red gamehen and they exhibited the true character of those of g sonneratii except that the horny laminae were much smaller this species also differs greatly from the common fowl in the comb being finely serrated and in the loins being destitute of true hackles its voice is utterly different it crosses readily in india with domestic hens and mr blyth 714 see also an excellent letter on the poultry of india by mr blyth in gardeners chronicle 1851 page 619 raised nearly 100 hybrid chickens but they were tender and mostly died whilst young those which were reared were absolutely sterile when crossed inter se or with either parent at the zoological gardens however some hybrids of the same parentage were not quite so sterile mr dixon as he informed me made with mr yarrells aid particular inquiries on this subject and was assured that out of 50 eggs only five or six chickens were reared some however of these half bred birds were crossed with one of their parents namely a bantam and produced a few extremely feeble chickens mr dixon also procured some of these same birds and crossed them in several ways but all were more or less infertile nearly similar experiments have recently been tried on a great scale in the zoological gardens with almost the same result 715 mr sj salter in natural history review april 1863 page 276 out of 500 eggs raised from various first crosses and hybrids between g sonneratii bankiva and varius only 12 chickens were reared and of these only three were the product of hybrids inter se from these facts and from the abovementioned stronglymarked differences in structure between the domestic fowl and g sonneratii we may reject this latter species as the parent of any domestic breed  ceylon possesses a fowl peculiar to the island viz g stanleyii this species approaches so closely except in the colouring of the comb to the domestic fowl that messrs layard and kellaert 716 see also mr layards paper in annals and mag of nat history 2nd series volume 14 page 62 would have considered it as they inform me as one of the parentstocks had it not been for its singularly different voice this bird like the last crosses readily with tame hens and even visits solitary farms and ravishes them two hybrids a male and female thus produced were found by mr mitford to be quite sterile both inherited the peculiar voice of g stanleyii this species then may in all probability be rejected as one of the primitive stocks of the domestic fowl  java and the islands eastward as far as flores are inhabited by g varius or furcatus which differs in so many charactersgreen plumage unserrated comb and single median wattlethat no one supposes it to have been the parent of any one of our breeds yet as i am informed by mr crawfurd 717 see also mr crawfurd descriptive dict of the indian islands 1856 page 113 hybrids are commonly raised between the male g varius and the common hen and are kept for their great beauty but are invariably sterile this however was not the case with some bred in the zoological gardens these hybrids were at one time thought to be specifically distinct and were named g aeneus mr blyth and others believe that the g temminckii 718 described by mr gr gray proc zoolog soc 1849 page 62 of which the history is not known is a similar hybrid sir j brooke sent me some skins of domestic fowls from borneo and across the tail of one of these as mr tegetmeier observed there were transverse blue bands like those which he had seen on the tail feathers of hybrids from g varius reared in the zoological gardens this fact apparently indicates that some of the fowls of borneo have been slightly affected by crosses with g varius but the case may possibly be one of analogous variation i may just allude to the g giganteus so often referred to in works on poultry as a wild species but marsden 719 the passage from marsden is given by mr dixon in his poultry book page 176 no ornithologist now ranks this bird as a distinct species the first describer speaks of it as a tame breed and the specimen in the british museum evidently has the aspect of a domestic variety  the last species to be mentioned namely gallus bankiva has a much wider geographical range than the three previous species it inhabits northern india as far west as sinde and ascends the himalaya to a height of 4000 ft it inhabits burmah the malay peninsula the indochinese countries the philippine islands and the malayan archipelago as far eastward as timor this species varies considerably in the wild state mr blyth informs me that the specimens both male and female brought from near the himalaya are rather paler coloured than those from other parts of india whilst those from the malay peninsula and java are brighter coloured than the indian birds i have seen specimens from these countries and the difference of tint in the hackles was conspicuous the malayan hens were a shade redder on the breast and neck than the indian hens the malayan males generally had a red earlappet instead of a white one as in india but mr blyth has seen one indian specimen without the white earlappet the legs are leaden blue in the indian whereas they show some tendency to be yellowish in the malayan and javan specimens in the former mr blyth finds the tarsus remarkably variable in length according to temminck 720 coupdoeil general sur linde archipelagique tome 3 1849 page 177 see also mr blyth in indian sporting review volume 2 page 5 1856 the timor specimens differ as a local race from that of java these several wild varieties have not as yet been ranked as distinct species if they should as is not unlikely be hereafter thus ranked the circumstance would be quite immaterial as far as the parentage and differences of our domestic breeds are concerned the wild g bankiva agrees most closely with the blackbreasted red gamebreed in colouring and in all other respects except in being smaller and in the tail being carried more horizontally but the manner in which the tail is carried is highly variable in many of our breeds for as mr brent informs me the tail slopes much in the malays is erect in the games and some other breeds and is more than erect in dorkings bantams etc there is one other difference namely that in g bankiva according to mr blyth the neckhackles when first moulted are replaced during two or three months not by other hackles as with our domestic poultry but by short blackish feathers 721 mr blyth annals and mag of nat hist 2nd series volume 1 1848 page 455 mr brent however has remarked that these black feathers remain in the wild bird after the development of the lower hackles and appear in the domestic bird at the same time with them so that the only difference is that the lower hackles are replaced more slowly in the wild than in the tame bird but as confinement is known sometimes to affect the masculine plumage this slight difference cannot be considered of any importance it is a significant fact that the voice of both the male and female g bankiva closely resembles as mr blyth and others have noted the voice of both sexes of the common domestic fowl but the last note of the crow of the wild bird is rather less prolonged captain hutton well known for his researches into the natural history of india informs me that he has seen several crossed fowls from the wild species and the chinese bantam these crossed fowls bred freely with bantams but unfortunately were not crossed inter se captain hutton reared chickens from the eggs of the gallus bankiva and these though at first very wild afterwards became so tame that they would crowd round his feet he did not succeed in rearing them to maturity but as he remarks no wild gallinaceous bird thrives well at first on hard grain mr blyth also found much difficulty in keeping g bankiva in confinement in the philippine islands however the natives must succeed better as they keep wild cocks to fight with their domestic gamebirds 722 crawfurd desc dict of indian islands 1856 page 112 sir walter elliot informs me that the hen of a native domestic breed of pegu is undistinguishable from the hen of the wild g bankiva and the natives constantly catch wild cocks by taking tame cocks to fight with them in the woods 723 in burmah as i hear from mr blyth the wild and tame poultry constantly cross together and irregular transitional forms may be seen mr crawfurd remarks that from etymology it might be argued that the fowl was first domesticated by the malays and javanese 724 ibid page 113 it is also a curious fact of which i have been assured by mr blyth that wild specimens of the gallus bankiva brought from the countries east of the bay of bengal are far more easily tamed than those of india nor is this an unparalleled fact for as humboldt long ago remarked the same species sometimes evinces a more tameable disposition in one country than in another if we suppose that the g bankiva was first tamed in malaya and afterwards imported into india we can understand an observation made to me by mr blyth that the domestic fowls of india do not resemble the wild g bankiva of india more closely than do those of europe  from the extremely close resemblance in colour general structure and especially in voice between gallus bankiva and the game fowl from their fertility as far as this has been ascertained when crossed from the possibility of the wild species being tamed and from its varying in the wild state we may confidently look at it as the parent of the most typical of all the domestic breeds namely the game fowl it is a significant fact that almost all the naturalists in india namely sir w elliot mr sn ward mr layard mr jc jerdon and mr blyth 725 mr jerdon in the madras journ of lit and science volume 22 page 2 speaking of g bankiva says unquestionably the origin of most of the varieties of our common fowls for mr blyth see his excellent article in gardeners chronicle 1851 page 619 and in annals and mag of nat hist volume 20 1847 page 388 who are familiar with g bankiva believe that it is the parent of most or all our domestic breeds but even if it be admitted that g bankiva is the parent of the game breed yet it may be urged that other wild species have been the parents of the other domestic breeds and that these species still exist though unknown in some country or have become extinct the extinction however of several species of fowls is an improbable hypothesis seeing that the four known species have not become extinct in the most ancient and thickly peopled regions of the east there is in fact not one other kind of domesticated bird of which the wild parentform is unknown that is become extinct for the discovery of new or the rediscovery of old species of gallus we must not look as fanciers often look to the whole world the larger gallinaceous birds as mr blyth has remarked 726 gardeners chronicle 1851 page 619 generally have a restricted range we see this well illustrated in india where the genus gallus inhabits the base of the himalaya and is succeeded higher up by gallophasis and still higher up by phasianus australia with its islands is out of the question as the home for unknown species of the genus it is also as improbable that gallus should inhabit south america 727 i have consulted an eminent authority mr sclater on this subject and he thinks that i have not expressed myself too strongly i am aware that one ancient author acosta speaks of fowls as having inhabited s america at the period of its discovery and more recently about 1795 olivier de serres speaks of wild fowls in the forests of guiana these were probably feral birds dr daniell tells me he believes that fowls have become wild on the west coast of equatorial africa they may however not be true fowls but gallinaceous birds belonging to the genus phasidus the old voyager barbut says that poultry are not natural to guinea capt w allen narrative of niger expedition 1848 volume 2 page 42 describes wild fowls on ilha dos rollas an island near st thomass on the west coast of africa the natives informed him that they had escaped from a vessel wrecked there many years ago they were extremely wild and had a cry quite different to that of the domestic fowl and their appearance was somewhat changed hence it is not a little doubtful notwithstanding the statement of the natives whether these birds really were fowls that the fowl has become feral on several islands is certain mr fry a very capable judge informed mr layard in a letter that the fowls which have run wild on ascension had nearly all got back to their primitive colours red and black cocks and smokygrey hens but unfortunately we do not know the colour of the poultry which were turned out fowls have become feral on the nicobar islands blyth in the indian field 1858 page 62 and in the ladrones ansons voyage those found in the pellew islands crawfurd are believed to be feral and lastly it is asserted that they have become feral in new zealand but whether this is correct i know not as that a hummingbird should be found in the old world from the character of the other gallinaceous birds of africa it is not probable that gallus is an african genus we need not look to the western parts of asia for messrs blyth and crawfurd who have attended to this subject doubt whether gallus ever existed in a wild state even as far west as persia although the earliest greek writers speak of the fowl as a persian bird this probably merely indicates its line of importation for the discovery of unknown species we must look to india to the indochinese countries and to the northern parts of the malay archipelago the southern portion of china is the most likely country but as mr blyth informs me skins have been exported from china during a long period and living birds are largely kept there in aviaries so that any native species of gallus would probably have become known mr birch of the british museum has translated for me passages from a chinese encyclopaedia published in 1609 but compiled from more ancient documents in which it is said that fowls are creatures of the west and were introduced into the east ie china in a dynasty 1400 bc whatever may be thought of so ancient a date we see that the indochinese and indian regions were formerly considered by the chinese as the source of the domestic fowl from these several considerations we must look to the present metropolis of the genus namely to the southeastern parts of asia for the discovery of species which were formerly domesticated but are now unknown in the wild state and the most experienced ornithologists do not consider it probable that such species will be discovered  in considering whether the domestic breeds are descended from one species namely g bankiva or from several we must not quite overlook though we must not exaggerate the importance of the test of fertility most of our domestic breeds have been so often crossed and their mongrels so largely kept that it is almost certain if any degree of infertility had existed between them it would have been detected on the other hand the four known species of gallus when crossed with each other or when crossed with the exception of g bankiva with the domestic fowl produce infertile hybrids  finally we have not such good evidence with fowls as with pigeons of all the breeds having descended from a single primitive stock in both cases the argument of fertility must go for something in both we have the improbability of man having succeeded in ancient times in thoroughly domesticating several supposed speciesmost of these supposed species being extremely abnormal as compared with their natural alliesall being now either unknown or extinct though the parentform of no other domesticated bird has been lost but in searching for the supposed parent stocks of the various breeds of the pigeon we were enabled to confine our search to species having peculiar habits of life whilst with fowls there is nothing in their habits in any marked manner distinct from those of other gallinaceous birds in the case of pigeons i have shown that purely bred birds of every race and the crossed offspring of distinct races frequently resemble or revert to the wild rockpigeon in general colour and in each characteristic mark with fowls we have facts of a similar nature but less strongly pronounced which we will now discuss  reversion and analogous variation  purelybred game malay cochin dorking bantam and as i hear from mr tegetmeier silk fowls may frequently or occasionally be met with which are almost identical in plumage with the wild g bankiva this is a fact well deserving attention when we reflect that these breeds rank amongst the most distinct fowls thus coloured are called by amateurs black breasted reds hamburghs properly have a very different plumage nevertheless as mr tegetmeier informs me the great difficulty in breeding cocks of the goldenspangled variety is their tendency to have black breasts and red backs the males of white bantams and white cochins as they come to maturity often assume a yellowish or saffron tinge and the longer neck hackles of black bantam cocks 728 mr hewitt in the poultry book by wb tegetmeier 1866 page 248 when two or three years old not uncommonly become ruddy these latter bantams occasionally even moult brassywinged or actually redshouldered so that in these several cases we see a plain tendency to reversion to the hues of g bankiva even during the lifetime of the individual bird with spanish polish pencilled hamburgh silverspangled hamburgh fowls and with some other less common breeds i have never heard of a blackbreasted red bird having appeared  from my experience with pigeons i made the following crosses i first killed all my own poultry no others living near my house and then procured by mr tegetmeiers assistance a firstrate black spanish cock and hens of the following pure breedswhite game white cochin silver spangled polish silverspangled hamburgh silverpencilled hamburgh and white silk in none of these breeds is there a trace of red nor when kept pure have i ever heard of the appearance of a red feather though such an occurrence would perhaps not be very improbable with white games and white cochins of the many chickens reared from the above six crosses the majority were black both in the down and in the first plumage some were white and a very few were mottled black and white in one lot of eleven mixed eggs from the white game and white cochin by the black spanish cock seven of the chickens were white and only four black i mention this fact to show that whiteness of plumage is strongly inherited and that the belief in the prepotent power in the male to transmit his colour is not always correct the chickens were hatched in the spring and in the latter part of august several of the young cocks began to exhibit a change which with some of them increased during the following years thus a young male bird from the silverspangled polish hen was in its first plumage coal black and combined in its comb crest wattle and beard the characters of both parents but when two years old the secondary wingfeathers became largely and symmetrically marked with white and wherever in g bankiva the hackles are red they were in this bird greenishblack along the shaft narrowly bordered with brownishblack and this again broadly bordered with very pale yellowishbrown so that in general appearance the plumage had become palecoloured instead of black in this case with advancing age there was a great change but no reversion to the red colour of g bankiva  a cock with a regular rose comb derived either from the spangled or pencilled silver hamburgh was likewise at first quite black but in less than a year the neckhackles as in the last case became whitish whilst those on the loins assumed a decided reddishyellow tint and here we see the first symptom of reversion this likewise occurred with some other young cocks which need not here be described it has also been recorded 729 journal of horticulture january 14 1862 page 325 by a breeder that he crossed two silverpencilled hamburgh hens with a spanish cock and reared a number of chickens all of which were black the cocks having golden and the hens brownish hackles so that in this instance likewise there was a clear tendency to reversion  two young cocks from my white game hen were at first snow white of these one subsequently assumed male orangecoloured hackles chiefly on the loins and the other an abundance of fine orangered hackles on the neck loins and upper wingcoverts here again we have a more decided though partial reversion to the colours of g bankiva this second cock was in fact coloured like an inferior pile came cocknow this subbreed can be produced as i am informed by mr tegetmeier by crossing a blackbreasted red game cock with a white game hen and the pile subbreed thus produced can afterwards be truly propagated so that we have the curious fact of the glossyblack spanish cock and the blackbreasted red game cock when crossed with white game hens producing offspring of nearly the same colours  i reared several birds from the white silk hen by the spanish cock all were coalblack and all plainly showed their parentage in having blackish combs and bones none inherited the socalled silky feathers and the non inheritance of this character has been observed by others the hens never varied in their plumage as the young cocks grew old one of them assumed yellowishwhite hackles and thus resembled in a considerable degree the cross from the hamburgh hen the other became a gorgeous bird so much so that an acquaintance had it preserved and stuffed simply from its beauty when stalking about it closely resembled the wild gallus bankiva but with the red feathers rather darker on close comparison one considerable difference presented itself namely that the primary and secondary wing feathers were edged with greenishblack instead of being edged as in g bankiva with fulvous and red tints the space also across the back which bears darkgreen feathers was broader and the comb was blackish in all other respects even in trifling details of plumage there was the closest accordance altogether it was a marvellous sight to compare this bird first with g bankiva and then with its father the glossy green black spanish cock and with its diminutive mother the white silk hen this case of reversion is the more extraordinary as the spanish breed has long been known to breed true and no instance is on record of its throwing a single red feather the silk hen likewise breeds true and is believed to be ancient for aldrovandi before 1600 alludes probably to this breed and described it as covered with wool it is so peculiar in many characters that some writers have considered it as specifically distinct yet as we now see when crossed with the spanish fowl it yields offspring closely resembling the wild g bankiva  mr tegetmeier has been so kind as to repeat at my request the cross between a spanish cock and silk hen and he obtained similar results for he thus raised besides a black hen seven cocks all of which were dark bodied with more or less orangered hackles in the ensuing year he paired the black hen with one of her brothers and raised three young cocks all coloured like their father and a black hen mottled with white  the hens from the six abovedescribed crosses showed hardly any tendency to revert to the mottledbrown plumage of the female g bankiva one hen however from the white cochin which was at first coalblack became slightly brown or sooty several hens which were for a long time snow white acquired as they grew old a few black feathers a hen from the white game which was for a long time entirely black glossed with green when two years old had some of the primary wing feathers greyishwhite and a multitude of feathers over her body narrowly and symmetrically tipped or laced with white i had expected that some of the chickens whilst covered with down would have assumed the longitudinal stripes so general with gallinaceous birds but this did not occur in a single instance two or three alone were reddishbrown about their heads i was unfortunate in losing nearly all the white chickens from the first crosses so that black prevailed with the grandchildren but they were much diversified in colour some being sooty others mottled and one blackish chicken had its feathers oddly tipped and barred with brown  i will here add a few miscellaneous facts connected with reversion and with the law of analogous variation this law implies as stated in a previous chapter that the varieties of one species frequently mock distinct but allied species and this fact is explained according to the views which i maintain on the principle of allied species having descended from one primitive form the white silk fowl with black skin and bones degenerates as has been observed by mr hewitt and mr r orton in our climate that is it reverts to the ordinary colour of the common fowl in its skin and bones due care having been taken to prevent any cross in germany 730 die huhner und pfauenzucht ulm 1827 s 17 for mr hewitts statement with respect to the white silk fowl see the poultry book by wb tegetmeier 1866 page 222 i am indebted to mr orton for a letter on the same subject a distinct breed with black bones and with black not silky plumage has likewise been observed to degenerate  mr tegetmeier informs me that when distinct breeds are crossed fowls are frequently produced with their feathers marked or pencilled by narrow transverse lines of a darker colour this may be in part explained by direct reversion to the parentform the bankiva hen for this bird has all its upper plumage finely mottled with dark and rufous brown with the mottling partially and obscurely arranged in transverse lines but the tendency to pencilling is probably much strengthened by the law of analogous variation for the hens of some other species of gallus are more plainly pencilled and the hens of many gallinaceous birds belonging to other genera as the partridge have pencilled feathers mr tegetmeier has also remarked to me that although with domestic pigeons we have so great a diversity of colouring we never see either pencilled or spangled feathers and this fact is intelligible on the law of analogous variation as neither the wild rock pigeon nor any closely allied species has such feathers the frequent appearance of pencilling in crossed birds probably accounts for the existence of cuckoo subbreeds in the game polish dorking cochin andalusian and bantam breeds the plumage of these birds is slatyblue or grey with each feather transversely barred with darker lines so as to resemble in some degree the plumage of the cuckoo it is a singular fact considering that the male of no species of gallus is in the least barred that the cuckoolike plumage has often been transferred to the male more especially in the cuckoo dorking and the fact is all the more singular as in gold and silverpencilled hamburghs in which pencilling is characteristic of the breed the male is hardly at all pencilled this kind of plumage being confined to the female  another case of analogous variation is the occurrence of spangled sub breeds of hamburgh polish malay and bantam fowls spangled feathers have a dark mark properly crescentshaped on their tips whilst pencilled feathers have several transverse bars the spangling cannot be due to reversion to g bankiva nor does it often follow as i hear from mr tegetmeier from crossing distinct breeds but it is a case of analogous variation for many gallinaceous birds have spangled feathersfor instance the common pheasant hence spangled breeds are often called pheasantfowls another case of analogous variation in several domestic breeds is inexplicable it is that the chickens whilst covered with down of the black spanish black game black polish and black bantam all have white throats and breasts and often have some white on their wings 731 dixon ornamental and domestic poultry pages 253 324 335 for game fowls see ferguson on prize poultry page 260 the editor of the poultry chronicle 732 poultry chronicle volume 2 71 remarks that all the breeds which properly have red earlappets occasionally produce birds with white eartappets this remark more especially applies to the game breed which of all comes nearest to the g bankiva and we have seen that with this species living in a state of nature the earlappets vary in colour being red in the malayan countries and generally but not invariably white in india  in concluding this part of my subject i may repeat that there exists one widelyranging varying and common species of gallus namely g bankiva which can be tamed produces fertile offspring when crossed with common fowls and closely resembles in its whole structure plumage and voice the game breed hence it may be safely ranked as the parent of this the most typical domesticated breed we have seen that there is much difficulty in believing that other now unknown species have been the parents of the other domestic breeds we know that all the breeds are most closely allied as shown by their similarity in most points of structure and in habits and by the analogous manner in which they vary we have also seen that several of the most distinct breeds occasionally or habitually closely resemble in plumage g bankiva and that the crossed offspring of other breeds which are not thus coloured show a stronger or weaker tendency to revert to this same plumage some of the breeds which appear the most distinct and the least likely to have proceeded from g bankiva such as polish fowls with their protuberant and little ossified skulls and cochins with their imperfect tail and small wings bear in these characters the plain marks of their artificial origin we know well that of late years methodical selection has greatly improved and fixed many characters and we have every reason to believe that unconscious selection carried on for many generations will have steadily augmented each new peculiarity and thus have given rise to new breeds as soon as two or three breeds were once formed crossing would come into play in changing their character and in increasing their number brahma pootras according to an account lately published in america offer a good instance of a breed lately formed by a cross which can be truly propagated the wellknown sebright bantams offer another and similar instance hence it may be concluded that not only the gamebreed but that all our breeds are probably the descendants of the malayan or indian variety of g bankiva if so this species has varied greatly since it was first domesticated but there has been ample time as we shall now show  history of the fowl  rutimeyer found no remains of the fowl in the ancient swiss lakedwellings but according to jeitteles 733 die vorgeschichtlichen alterthumer ii theil 1872 page 5 dr pickering in his races of man 1850 page 374 says that the head and neck of a fowl is carried in a tributeprocession to thoutmousis iii 1445 bc but mr birch of the british museum doubts whether the figure can be identified as the head of a fowl some caution is necessary with reference to the absence of figures of the fowl on the ancient egyptian monuments on account of the strong and widely prevalent prejudice against this bird i am informed by the rev s erhardt that on the east coast of africa from 4 to 6 deg south of the equator most of the pagan tribes at the present day hold the fowl in aversion the natives of the pellew islands would not eat the fowl nor will the indians in some parts of s america for the ancient history of the fowl see also volz beitrage zur culturgeschichte 1852 s 77 and isid geoffroy sthilaire hist nat gen tome 3 page 61 mr crawfurd has given an admirable history of the fowl in his paper on the relation of domesticated animals to civilisation read before the brit assoc at oxford in 1860 and since printed separately i quote from him on the greek poet theognis and on the harpy tomb described by sir c fellowes i quote from a letter of mr blyths with respect to the institutes of manu such have certainly since been found associated with extinct animals and prehistoric remains it is therefore a strange fact that the fowl is not mentioned in the old testament nor figured on the ancient egyptian monuments it is not referred to by homer or hesiod about 900 bc but is mentioned by theognis and aristophanes between 400 and 500 bc it is figured on some of the babylonian cylinders between the sixth and seventh centuries bc of which mr layard sent me an impression and on the harpy tomb in lycia about 600 bc so that the fowl apparently reached europe in a domesticated condition somewhere about the sixth century bc it had travelled still farther westward by the time of the christian era for it was found in britain by julius caesar in india it must have been domesticated when the institutes of manu were written that is according to sir w jones 1200 bc but according to the later authority of mr h wilson only 800 bc for the domestic fowl is forbidden whilst the wild is permitted to be eaten if as before remarked we may trust the old chinese encyclopaedia the fowl must have been domesticated several centuries earlier as it is said to have been introduced from the west into china 1400 bc  sufficient materials do not exist for tracing the history of the separate breeds about the commencement of the christian era columella mentions a fivetoed fighting breed and some provincial breeds but we know nothing about them he also alludes to dwarf fowls but these cannot have been the same with our bantams which as mr crawfurd has shown were imported from japan into bantam in java a dwarf fowl probably the true bantam is referred to in an old japanese encyclopaedia as i am informed by mr birch in the chinese encyclopaedia published in 1596 but compiled from various sources some of high antiquity seven breeds are mentioned including what we should now call jumpers or creepers and likewise fowls with black feathers bones and flesh in 1600 aldrovandi describes seven or eight breeds of fowls and this is the most ancient record from which the age of our european breeds can be inferred the gallus turcicus certainly seems to be a pencilled hamburgh but mr brent a most capable judge thinks that aldrovandi evidently figured what he happened to see and not the best of the breed mr brent indeed considers all aldrovandis fowls as of impure breed but it is a far more probable view that all our breeds have been much improved and modified since his time for as he went to the expense of so many figures he probably would have secured characteristic specimens the silk fowl however probably then existed in its present state as did almost certainly the fowl with frizzled or reversed feathers mr dixon 734 ornamental and domestic poultry 1847 page 185 for passages translated from columella see page 312 for golden hamburghs see albin natural history of birds 3 volumes with plates 173138 considers aldrovandis paduan fowl as a variety of the polish whereas mr brent believes it to have been more nearly allied to the malay the anatomical peculiarities of the skull of the polish breed were noticed by p borelli in 1656 i may add that in 1737 one polish sub breed viz the goldenspangled was known but judging from albins description the comb was then larger the crest of feathers much smaller the breast more coarsely spotted and the stomach and thighs much blacker a goldenspangled polish fowl in this condition would now be of no value  differences in external and internal structure between the breeds individual variability  fowls have been exposed to diversified conditions of life and as we have just seen there has been ample time for much variability and for the slow action of unconscious selection as there are good grounds for believing that all the breeds are descended from gallus bankiva it will be worth while to describe in some detail the chief points of difference beginning with the eggs and chickens i will pass on to their secondary sexual characters and then to their differences in external structure and in the skeleton i enter on the following details chiefly to show how variable almost every character has become under domestication  eggs  mr dixon remarks 735 ornamental and domestic poultry page 152 that to every hen belongs an individual peculiarity in the form colour and size of her egg which never changes during her lifetime so long as she remains in health and which is as well known to those who are in the habit of taking her produce as the handwriting of their nearest acquaintance i believe that this is generally true and that if no great number of hens be kept the eggs of each can almost always be recognised the eggs of differently sized breeds naturally differ much in size but apparently not always in strict relation to the size of the hen thus the malay is a larger bird than the spanish but generally she produces not such large eggs white bantams are said to lay smaller eggs than other bantams 736 ferguson on rare prize poultry page 297 this writer i am informed cannot generally be trusted he gives however figures and much information on eggs see pages 34 and 235 on the eggs of the game fowl white cochins on the other hand as i hear from mr tegetmeier certainly lay larger eggs than buff cochins the eggs however of the different breeds vary considerably in character for instance mr ballance states 737 see poultry book by mr tegetmeier 1866 pages 81 and 78 that his malay pullets of last year laid eggs equal in size to those of any duck and other malay hens two or three years old laid eggs very little larger than a good sized bantams egg some were as white as a spanish hens egg and others varied from a light creamcolour to a deep rich buff or even to a brown the shape also varies the two ends being much more equally rounded in cochins than in games or polish spanish fowls lay smoother eggs than cochins of which the eggs are generally granulated the shell in this latter breed and more especially in malays is apt to be thicker than in games or spanish but the minorcas a subbreed of spanish are said to lay harder eggs than true spanish 738 the cottage gardener october 1855 page 13 on the thinness of the eggs of gamefowls see mowbray on poultry 7th edition page 13 the colour differs considerablythe cochins laying buffcoloured eggs the malays a paler variable buff and games a still paler buff it would appear that darkercoloured eggs characterise the breeds which have lately come from the east or are still closely allied to those now living there the colour of the yolk according to ferguson as well as of the shell differs slightly in the subbreeds of the game i am also informed by mr brent that dark partridgecoloured cochin hens lay darker coloured eggs than the other cochin subbreeds the flavour and richness of the egg certainly differ in different breeds the productiveness of the several breeds is very different spanish polish and hamburgh hens have lost the incubating instinct  chickens  as the young of almost all gallinaceous birds even of the black curassow and black grouse whilst covered with down are longitudinally striped on the backof which character when adult neither sex retains a traceit might have been expected that the chickens of all our domestic fowls would have been similarly striped 739 my information which is very far from perfect on chickens in the down is derived chiefly from mr dixons ornamental and domestic poultry mr bp brent has also communicated to me many facts by letter as has mr tegetmeier i will in each case mark my authority by the name within brackets for the chickens of white silk fowls see tegetmeier poultry book 1866 page 221 this could however hardly have been expected when the adult plumage in both sexes has undergone so great a change as to be wholly white or black in white fowls of various breeds the chickens are uniformly yellowish white passing in the black boned silk fowl into bright canaryyellow this is also generally the case with the chickens of white cochins but i hear from mr zurhost that they are sometimes of a buff or oak colour and that all those of this latter colour which were watched turned out males the chickens of buff cochins are of a goldenyellow easily distinguishable from the paler tint of the white cochins and are often longitudinally streaked with dark shades the chickens of silvercinnamon cochins are almost always of a buff colour the chickens of the white game and white dorking breeds when held in particular lights sometimes exhibit on the authority of mr brent faint traces of longitudinal stripes fowls which are entirely black namely spanish black game black polish and black bantams display a new character for their chickens have their breasts and throats more or less white with sometimes a little white elsewhere spanish chickens also occasionally brent have where the down was white their first true feathers tipped for a time with white the primordially striped character is retained by the chickens of most of the game subbreeds brent dixon by dorkings by the partridge and grousecoloured subbreeds of cochins brent but not as we have seen by the subbreeds by the pheasantmalay dixon but apparently not at which i am much surprised by other malays the following breeds and subbreeds are barely or not at all longitudinally striped viz gold and silver pencilled hamburghs which can hardly be distinguished from each other brent in the down both having a few dark spots on the head and rump with occasionally a longitudinal stripe dixon on the back of the neck i have seen only one chicken of the silverspangled hamburgh and this was obscurely striped along the back goldspangled polish chickens tegetmeier are of a warm russet brown and silverspangled polish chickens are grey sometimes dixon with dashes of ochre on the head wings and breast cuckoo and bluedun fowls dixon are grey in the down the chickens of sebright bantams dixon are uniformly dark brown whilst those of the brown breasted red game bantam are black with some white on the throat and breast from these facts we see that young chickens of the different breeds and even of the same main breed differ much in their downy plumage and although longitudinal stripes characterise the young of all wild gallinaceous birds they disappear in several domestic breeds perhaps it may be accepted as a general rule that the more the adult plumage differs from that of the adult g bankiva the more completely the chickens have lost their stripes  with respect to the period of life at which the characters proper to each breed first appear it is obvious that such structures as additional toes must be formed long before birth in polish fowls the extraordinary protuberance of the anterior part of the skull is well developed before the chickens come out of the egg 740 as i hear from mr tegetmeier see also proc zoolog soc 1856 page 366 on the late development of the crest see poultry chronicle volume 2 page 132 but the crest which is supported on the protuberance is at first feebly developed nor does it attain its full size until the second year the spanish cock is preeminent for his magnificent comb and this is developed at an unusually early age so that the young males can be distinguished from the females when only a few weeks old and therefore earlier than in other breeds they likewise crow very early namely when about six weeks old in the dutch subbreed of the spanish fowl the white earlappets are developed earlier than in the common spanish breed 741 on these points see poultry chronicle volume 3 page 166 and tegetmeier poultry book 1866 pages 105 and 121 cochins are characterised by a small tail and in the young cocks the tail is developed at an unusually late period 742 dixon ornamental and domestic poultry page 273 game fowls are notorious for their pugnacity and the young cocks crow clap their little wings and fight obstinately with each other even whilst under their mothers care 743 ferguson on rare and prize poultry page 261 i have often had says one author 744 mowbray on poultry 7th edition 1834 page 13 whole broods scarcely feathered stoneblind from fighting the rival couples moping in corners and renewing their battles on obtaining the first ray of light the weapons and pugnacity of all male gallinaceous birds evidently serve the purpose of gaining possession of the females so that the tendency in our game chickens to fight at an extremely early age is not only useless but injurious as they suffer much from their wounds the training for battle during an early age may be natural to the wild gallus bankiva but as man during many generations has gone on selecting the most obstinately pugnacious cocks it is more probable that their pugnacity has been unnaturally increased and unnaturally transferred to the young male chickens in the same manner it is probable that the extraordinary development of the comb in the spanish cock has been unintentionally transferred to the young cocks for fanciers would not care whether their young birds had large combs but would select for breeding the adults which had the finest combs whether or not developed at an early period the last point which need here be noticed is that though the chickens of spanish and malay fowls are well covered with down the true feathers are acquired at an unusually late age so that for a time the young birds are partially naked and are liable to suffer from cold  secondary sexual characters  the two sexes in the parentform the gallus bankiva differ much in colour in our domestic breeds the difference is never greater but is often less and varies much in degree even in the subbreeds of the same main breed thus in certain game fowls the difference is as great as in the parentform whilst in the black and white subbreeds there is no difference in plumage mr brent informs me that he has seen two strains of blackbreasted red games of which the cocks could not be distinguished whilst the hens in one were partridgebrown and in the other fawnbrown a similar case has been observed in the strains of the brownbreasted red game the hen of the duckwinged game is extremely beautiful and differs much from the hens of all the other game subbreeds but generally as with the blue and grey game and with some subvarieties of the pile game a moderately close relation may be observed between the males and females in the variation of their plumage 745 see the full description of the varieties of the gamebreed in tegetmeier poultry book 1866 page 131 for cuckoo dorkings page 97 a similar relation is also evident when we compare the several varieties of cochins in the two sexes of gold and silverspangled and of buff polish fowls there is much general similarity in the colouring and marks of the whole plumage excepting of course in the hackles crest and beard in spangled hamburghs there is likewise a considerable degree of similarity between the two sexes in pencilled hamburghs on the other hand there is much dissimilarity the pencilling which is characteristic of the hens being almost absent in the males of both the golden and silver varieties but as we have already seen it cannot be given as a general rule that male fowls never have pencilled feathers for cuckoo dorkings are remarkable from having nearly similar markings in both sexes  it is a singular fact that the males in certain subbreeds have lost some of their secondary masculine characters and from their close resemblance in plumage to the females are often called hennies there is much diversity of opinion whether these males are in any degree sterile that they sometimes are partially sterile seems clear 746 mr hewitt in tegetmeier poultry book 1866 pages 246 and 156 for hentailed gamecocks see page 131 but this may have been caused by too close interbreeding that they are not quite sterile and that the whole case is widely different from that of old females assuming masculine characters is evident from several of these henlike subbreeds having been long propagated the males and females of gold and silverlaced sebright bantams can be barely distinguished from each other except by their combs wattles and spurs for they are coloured alike and the males have not hackles nor the flowing sicklelike tailfeathers a hentailed subbreed of hamburghs was recently much esteemed there is also a breed of game fowls in which the males and females resemble each other so closely that the cocks have often mistaken their henfeathered opponents in the cockpit for real hens and by the mistake have lost their lives 747 the field april 20 1861 the writer says he has seen halfadozen cocks thus sacrificed the cocks though dressed in the feathers of the hen are highspirited birds and their courage has been often proved an engraving even has been published of one celebrated hentailed victor mr tegetmeier 748 proceedings of zoolog soc march 1861 page 102 the engraving of the hentailed cock just alluded to was exhibited before the society has recorded the remarkable case of a brownbreasted red game cock which after assuming its perfect masculine plumage became henfeathered in the autumn of the following year but he did not lose voice spurs strength nor productiveness this bird has now retained the same character during five seasons and has begot both henfeathered and malefeathered offspring mr grantley f berkeley relates the still more singular case of a celebrated strain of polecat game fowls which produced in nearly every brood a single hencock the great peculiarity in one of these birds was that he as the seasons succeeded each other was not always a hencock and not always of the colour called the polecat which is black from the polecat and hencock feather in one season he moulted to a full maleplumaged blackbreasted red and in the following year he returned to the former feather 749 the field april 20 1861  i have remarked in my origin of species that secondary sexual characters are apt to differ much in the species of the same genus and to be unusually variable in the individuals of the same species so it is with the breeds of the fowl as we have already seen as far as the colour of plumage is concerned and so it is with the other secondary sexual characters firstly the comb differs much in the various breeds 750 i am much indebted to mr brent for an account with sketches of all the variations of the comb known to him and likewise with respect to the tail as presently to be given and its form is eminently characteristic of each kind with the exception of the dorkings in which the form has not been as yet determined on by fanciers and fixed by selection a single deeply serrated comb is the typical and most common form it differs much in size being immensely developed in spanish fowls and in a local breed called redcaps it is sometimes upwards of three inches in breadth at the front and more than four inches in length measured to the end of the peak behind 751 the poultry book by tegetmeier 1866 page 234 in some breeds the comb is double and when the two ends are cemented together it forms a cupcomb in the rosecomb it is depressed covered with small projections and produced backwards in the horned and crevecoeur fowl it is produced into two horns it is triple in the peacombed brahmas short and truncated in the malays and absent in the guelderlands in the tasselled game a few long feathers rise from the back of the comb in many breeds a crest of feathers replaces the comb the crest when little developed arises from a fleshy mass but when much developed from a hemispherical protuberance of the skull in the best polish fowls it is so largely developed that i have seen birds which could hardly pick up their food and a german writer asserts 752 die huhner und pfauenzucht 1827 s 11 that they are in consequence liable to be struck by hawks monstrous structures of this kind would thus be suppressed in a state of nature the wattles also vary much in size being small in malays and some other breeds in certain polish subbreeds they are replaced by a great tuft of feathers called a beard  the hackles do not differ much in the various breeds but are short and stiff in malays and absent in hennies as in some orders male birds display extraordinarilyshaped feathers such as naked shafts with discs at the end etc the following case may be worth giving in the wild gallus bankiva and in our domestic fowls the barbs which arise from each side of the extremities of the hackles are naked or not clothed with barbules so that they resemble bristles but mr brent sent me some scapular hackles from a young birchen duckwing game cock in which the naked barbs became densely reclothed with barbules towards their tips so that these tips which were dark coloured with a metallic lustre were separated from the lower parts by a symmetricallyshaped transparent zone formed of the naked portions of the barbs hence the coloured tips appeared like little separate metallic discs  the sicklefeathers in the tail of which there are three pair and which are eminently characteristic of the male sex differ much in the various breeds they are scimitarshaped in some hamburghs instead of being long and flowing as in the typical breeds they are extremely short in cochins and are not at all developed in hennies they are carried together with the whole tail erect in dorkings and gaines but droop much in malays and in some cochins sultans are characterised by an additional number of lateral sicklefeathers the spurs vary much being placed higher or lower on the shank being extremely long and sharp in games and blunt and short in cochins these latter birds seem aware that their spurs are not efficient weapons for though they occasionally use them they more frequently fight as i am informed by mr tegetmeier by seizing and shaking each other with their beaks in some indian game cocks received by mr brent from germany there are as he informs me three four or even five spurs on each leg some dorkings also have two spurs on each leg 753 poultry chronicle volume 1 page 595 mr brent has informed me of the same fact with respect to the position of the spurs in dorkings see cottage gardener september 18 1860 page 380 and in birds of this breed the spur is often placed almost on the outside of the leg double spurs are mentioned in an ancient chinese encyclopaedia their occurrence may be considered as a case of analogous variation for some wild gallinaceous birds for instance the polyplectron have double spurs  judging from the differences which generally distinguish the sexes in the gallinaceae certain characters in our domestic fowls appear to have been transferred from the one sex to the other in all the species except in turnix when there is any conspicuous difference in plumage between the male and female the male is always the most beautiful but in golden spangled hamburghs the hen is equally beautiful with the cock and incomparably more beautiful than the hen in any natural species of gallus so that here a masculine character has been transferred to the female on the other hand in cuckoo dorkings and in other cuckoo breeds the pencilling which in gallus is a female attribute has been transferred to the male nor on the principle of analogous variation is this transference surprising as the males in many gallinaceous genera are barred or pencilled with most of these birds head ornaments of all kinds are more fully developed in the male than in the female but in polish fowls the crest or topknot which in the male replaces the comb is equally developed in both sexes in the males of certain other subbreeds which from the hen having a small crest are called larkcrested a single upright comb sometimes almost entirely takes the place of the crest 754 dixon ornamental and domestic poultry page 320 from this latter case and more especially from some facts presently to be given with respect to the protuberance of the skull in polish fowls the crest in this breed must be viewed as a feminine character which has been transferred to the male in the spanish breed the male as we know has an immense comb and this has been partially transferred to the female for her comb is unusually large though not upright in game fowls the bold and savage disposition of the male has likewise been largely transferred to the female 755 mr tegetmeier informs me that game hens have been found so combative that it is now generally the practice to exhibit each hen in a separate pen and she sometimes even possesses the eminently masculine character of spurs many cases are on record of fertile hens being furnished with spurs and in germany according to bechstein 756 naturgeschichte deutschlands b 3 1793 s 339 407 the spurs in the silk hen are sometimes very long he mentions also another breed similarly characterised in which the hens are excellent layers but are apt to disturb and break their eggs owing to their spurs  mr layard 757 on the ornithology of ceylon in annals and mag of nat history 2nd series volume 14 1854 page 63 has given an account of a breed of fowls in ceylon with black skin bones and wattle but with ordinary feathers and which cannot be more aptly described than by comparing them to a white fowl drawn down a sooty chimney it is however adds mr layard a remarkable fact that a male bird of the pure sooty variety is almost as rare as a tortoiseshell tomcat mr blyth found the same rule to hold good with this breed near calcutta the males and females on the other hand of the blackboned european breed with silky feathers do not differ from each other so that in the one breed black skin and bones and the same kind of plumage are common to both sexes whilst in the other breed these characters are confined to the female sex  at the present day all the breeds of polish fowls have the great bony protuberance on their skulls which includes part of the brain and supports the crest equally developed in both sexes but formerly in germany the skull of the hen alone was protuberant blumenbach 758 handbuch der vergleich anatomie 1805 page 85 note mr tegetmeier who gives in proc zoolog soc november 25 1856 a very interesting account of the skulls of polish fowls not knowing of bechsteins account has disputed the accuracy of blumenbachs statement for bechstein see naturgeschichte deutschlands b 3 1793 s 399 note i may add that at the first exhibition of poultry at the zoological gardens in may 1845 i saw some fowls called friezland fowls of which the hens were crested and the cocks furnished with a comb who particularly attended to abnormal peculiarities in domestic animals states in 1805 that this was the case and bechstein had previously in 1793 observed the same fact this latter author has carefully described the effects on the skull of a crest not only in the case of fowls but of ducks geese and canaries he states that with fowls when the crest is not much developed it is supported on a fatty mass but when much developed it is always supported on a bony protuberance of variable size he well describes the peculiarities of this protuberance he attended also to the effects of the modified shape of the brain on the intellect of these birds and disputes pallas statement that they are stupid he then expressly remarks that he never observed this protuberance in male fowls hence there can be no doubt that this extraordinary character in the skulls of polish fowls was formerly in germany confined to the female sex but has now been transferred to the males and has thus become common to both sexes  external differences not connected with the sexes between the breeds and between individual birds  the size of the body differs greatly mr tegetmeier has known a brahma to weigh 17 pounds a fine malay cock 10 pounds whilst a firstrate sebright bantam weighs hardly more than 1 pound during the last 20 years the size of some of our breeds has been largely increased by methodical selection whilst that of other breeds has been much diminished we have already seen how greatly colour varies even within the same breed we know that the wild g bankiva varies slightly in colour we know that colour is variable in all our domestic animals nevertheless some eminent fanciers have so little faith in variability that they have actually argued that the chief game subbreeds which differ from each other in nothing but colour are descended from distinct wild species crossing often causes strange modification of colour mr tegetmeier informs me that when buff and white cochins are crossed some of the chickens are almost invariably black according to mr brent black and white cochins occasionally produce chickens of a slatyblue tint and this same tint results as mr tegetmeier tells me from crossing white cochins with black spanish fowls or white dorkings with black minorcas 759 cottage gardener january 3 1860 page 218 a good observer 760 mr williams in a paper read before the dublin nat hist soc quoted in cottage gardener 1856 page 161 states that a firstrate silverspangled hamburgh hen gradually lost the most characteristic qualities of the breed for the black lacing to her feathers disappeared and her legs changed from leadenblue to white but what makes the case remarkable is that this tendency ran in the blood for her sister changed in a similar but less strongly marked manner and chickens produced from this latter hen were at first almost pure white but on moulting acquired black colours and some spangled feathers with almost obliterated markings so that a new variety arose in this singular manner the skin in the different breeds differs much in colour being white in common kinds yellow in malays and cochins and black in silk fowls thus mocking as m godron 761 de lespece 1859 page 442 for the occurrence of blackboned fowls in south america see roulin in mem de lacad des sciences tome 6 page 351 and azara quadrupedes du paraguay tome 2 page 324 a frizzled fowl sent to me from madras had black bones remarks the three principal types of skin in mankind the same author adds that as different kinds of fowls living in distant and isolated parts of the world have black skin and bones this colour must have appeared at various times and places  the shape and carriage of the body and the shape of the head differ much the beak varies slightly in length and curvature but incomparably less than with pigeons in most crested fowls the nostrils offer a remarkable peculiarity in being raised with a crescentic outline the primary wing feathers are short in cochins in a male which must have been more than twice as heavy as g bankiva these feathers were in both birds of the same length i have counted with mr tegetmeiers aid the primary wing feathers in thirteen cocks and hens of various breeds in four of them namely in two hamburghs a cochin and game bantam there were 10 instead of the normal number 9 but in counting these feathers i have followed the practice of fanciers and have not included the first minute primary feather barely threequarters of an inch in length these feathers differ considerably in relative length the fourth or the fifth or the sixth being the longest with the third either equal to or considerably shorter than the fifth in wild gallinaceous species the relative length and number of the main wing and tailfeathers are extremely constant  the tail differs much in erectness and size being small in malays and very small in cochins in thirteen fowls of various breeds which i have examined five had the normal number of 14 feathers including in this number the two middle sicklefeathers six others viz a caffre cock goldspangled polish cock cochin hen sultan hen game hen and malay hen had 16 and two an old cochin cock and malay hen had 17 feathers the rumpless fowl has no tail and in one which i possessed there was no oil gland but this bird though the os coccygis was extremely imperfect had a vestige of a tail with two rather long feathers in the position of the outer caudals this bird came from a family where as i was told the breed had kept true for twenty years but rumpless fowls often produce chickens with tails 762 mr hewitt in tegetmeier poultry book 1866 page 231 an eminent physiologist 763 dr broca in brownsequard journal de phys tome 2 page 361 has recently spoken of this breed as a distinct species had he examined the deformed state of the os coccyx he would never have come to this conclusion he was probably misled by the statement which may be found in some works that tailless fowls are wild in ceylon but this statement as i have been assured by mr layard and dr kellaert who have so closely studied the birds of ceylon is utterly false  the tarsi vary considerably in length being relatively to the femur considerably longer in the spanish and frizzled and shorter in the silk and bantam breeds than in the wild g bankiva but in the latter as we have seen the tarsi vary in length the tarsi are often feathered the feet in many breeds are furnished with additional toes goldenspangled polish fowls are said 764 dixon ornamental poultry page 325 to have the skin between their toes much developed mr tegetmeier observed this in one bird but it was not so in one which i examined prof hoffmann has sent me a sketch of the feet of a fowl of the common breed at giessen with a web extending between the three toes for about a third of their length in cochins the middle toe is said 765 poultry chronicle volume 1 page 485 tegetmeier poultry book 1866 page 41 on cochins grazing ibid page 46 to be nearly double the length of the lateral toes and therefore much longer than in g bankiva or in other fowls but this was not the case in two which i examined the nail of the middle toe in this same breed is surprisingly broad and flat but in a variable degree in two birds which i examined of this structure in the nail there is only a trace in g bankiva  the voice differs slightly as i am informed by mr dixon in almost every breed the malays 766 ferguson on prize poultry page 87 have a loud deep somewhat prolonged crow but with considerable individual difference colonel sykes remarks that the domestic kulm cock in india has not the shrill clear pipe of the english bird and his scale of notes appears more limited dr hooker was struck with the prolonged howling screech of the cocks in sikhim 767 col sykes in proc zoolog soc 1832 page 151 dr hookers himalayan journals volume 1 page 314 the crow of the cochin is notoriously and ludicrously different from that of the common cock the disposition of the different breeds is widely different varying from the savage and defiant temper of the gamecock to the extremely peaceable temper of the cochins the latter it has been asserted graze to a much greater extent than any other varieties the spanish fowls suffer more from frost than other breeds  before we pass on to the skeleton the degree of distinctness of the several breeds from g bankiva ought to be noticed some writers speak of the spanish as one of the most distinct breeds and so it is in general aspect but its characteristic differences are not important the malay appears to me more distinct from its tall stature small drooping tail with more than fourteen tailfeathers and from its small comb and wattles nevertheless one malay subbreed is coloured almost exactly like g bankiva some authors consider the polish fowl as very distinct but this is a semimonstrous breed as shown by the protuberant and irregularly perforated skull the cochin from its deeply furrowed frontal bones peculiarly shaped occipital foramen short wingfeathers short tail containing more than fourteen feathers broad nail to the middle toe fluffy plumage rough and darkcoloured eggs and especially from its peculiar voice is probably the most distinct of all the breeds if any one of our breeds has descended from some unknown species distinct from g bankiva it is probably the cochin but the balance of evidence does not favour this view all the characteristic differences of the cochin breed are more or less variable and may be detected in a greater or lesser degree in other breeds one subbreed is coloured closely like g bankiva the feathered legs often furnished with an additional toe the wings incapable of flight the extremely quiet disposition indicate a long course of domestication and these fowls come from china where we know that plants and animals have been tended from a remote period with extraordinary care and where consequently we might expect to find profoundly modified domestic races  osteological differences  i have examined twentyseven skeletons and fiftythree skulls of various breeds including three of g bankiva nearly half of these skulls i owe to the kindness of mr tegetmeier and three of the skeletons to mr eyton  skull  figure 33 occipital foramen of natural

above a little obliquely in the possession of tegetmeier  the skull differs greatly in size in different breeds being nearly twice as long in the largest cochins but not nearly twice as broad as in bantams the bones at the base from the occipital foramen to the anterior end including the quadrates and pterygoids are absolutely identical in shape in all the skulls so is the lower jaw in the forehead slight differences are often perceptible between the males and females evidently caused by the presence of the comb in every case i take the skull of g bankiva as the standard of comparison in four games in one malay hen in an african cock in a frizzled cock from madras in two blackboned silk hens no differences worth notice occur in three spanish cocks the form of the forehead between the orbits differs considerably in one it is considerably depressed whilst in the two others it is rather prominent with a deep medial furrow the skull of the hen is smooth in three skulls of sebright bantams the crown is more globular and slopes more abruptly to the occiput than in g bankiva in a bantam or jumper from burmah these same characters are more strongly pronounced and the supraocciput is more pointed in a black bantam the skull is not so globular and the occipital foramen is very large and has nearly the same subtriangular outline presently to be described in cochins and in this skull the two ascending branches of the premaxillary are overlapped in a singular manner by the processes of the nasal bone but as i have seen only one specimen some of these differences may be individual of cochins and brahmas the latter a crossed race approaching closely to cochins i have examined seven skulls at the point where the ascending branches of the premaxillary rest on the frontal bone the surface is much depressed and from this depression a deep medial furrow extends backwards to a variable distance the edges of this fissure are rather prominent as is the top of the skull behind and over the orbits these characters are less developed in the hens the pterygoids and the processes of the lower jaw are broader relatively to the size of the head than in g bankiva and this is likewise the case with dorkings when of large size the fork of the hyoid bone in cochins is twice as wide as in g bankiva whereas the length of the other hyoid bones is only as three to two but the most remarkable character is the shape of the occipital foramen in g bankiva a the breadth in a horizontal line exceeds the height in a vertical line and the outline is nearly circular whereas in cochins b the outline is subtriangular and the vertical line exceeds the horizontal line in length this same form likewise occurs in the black bantam above referred to and an approach to it may be seen in some dorkings and in a slight degree in certain other breeds  of dorkings i have examined three skulls one belonging to the whitesub breed the one character deserving notice is the breadth of the frontal bones which are moderately furrowed in the middle thus in a skull which was less than once and a half the length of that of g bankiva the breadth between the orbits was exactly double of hamburghs i have examined four skulls male and female of the pencilled subbreed and one male of the spangled subbreed the nasal bones stand remarkably wide apart but in a variable degree consequently narrow membranecovered spaces are left between the tips of the two ascending branches of the premaxillary bones which are rather short and between these branches and the nasal bones the surface of the frontal bone on which the branches of the premaxillary rest is very little depressed these peculiarities no doubt stand in close relation with the broad flattened rosecomb characteristic of the hamburgh breed  i have examined fourteen skulls of polish and other crested breeds their differences are extraordinary first for nine skulls of different sub breeds of english polish fowls the hemispherical protuberance of the frontal bones 768 see mr tegetmeiers account with woodcuts of the skull of polish fowls in proc zoolog soc november 25 1856 for other references see isid geoffroy sainthilaire hist gen des anomalies tome 1 page 287 m c dareste suspects recherches sur les conditions de la vie etc lille 1863 page 36 that the protuberance is not formed by the frontal bones but by the ossification of the dura mater may be seen in figure 34 in which b the skull of a whitecrested polish fowl is shown obliquely from above with the skull a of g bankiva in the same position in figure 35 longitudinal sections are given of the skull of a polish fowl and for comparison of a cochin of the same size the protuberance in all polish fowls occupies the same position but differs much in size in one of my nine specimens it was extremely slight the degree to which the protuberance is ossified varies greatly larger or smaller portions of bone being replaced by membrane in one specimen there was only a single open pore generally there are many variously shaped open spaces the bone forming an irregular reticulation a medial longitudinal arched ribbon of bone is generally retained but in one specimen there was no bone whatever over the whole protuberance and the skull when cleaned and viewed from above presented the appearance of an open basin the change in the whole internal form of the skull is surprisingly great the brain is modified in a corresponding manner as is shown in the two longitudinal sections which deserve attentive consideration the upper and anterior cavity of the three into which the skull may be divided is the one which is so greatly modified it is evidently much larger than in the cochin skull of the same size and extends much further beyond the interorbital septum but laterally is less deep this cavity as i hear from mr tegetmeier is entirely filled with brain in the skull of the cochin and of all ordinary fowls a strong internal ridge of bone separates the anterior from the central cavity but this ridge is quite absent in the polish skull here figured the shape of the central cavity is circular in the polish and lengthened in the cochin skull the shape of the posterior cavity together with the position size and number of the pores for the nerves differ much in these two skulls a pit deeply penetrating the occipital bone of the cochin is entirely absent in this polish skull whilst in another specimen it was well developed in this second specimen the whole internal surface of the posterior cavity likewise differs to a certain extent in shape i made sections of two other skullsnamely of a polish fowl with the protuberance singularly little developed and of a sultan in which it was a little more developed and when these two skulls were placed between the two above figured figure 35 a perfect gradation in the configuration of each part of the internal surface could be traced in the polish skull with a small protuberance the ridge between the anterior and middle cavities was present but low and in the sultan this ridge was replaced by a narrow furrow standing on a broad raised eminence  it may naturally be asked whether these remarkable modifications in the form of the brain affect the intellect of polish fowls some writers have stated that they are extremely stupid but bechstein and mr tegetmeier have shown that this is by no means generally the case nevertheless bechstein 769 naturgeschichte deutschlands b 3 1793 s 400 states that he had a polish hen which was crazy and anxiously wandered about all day long a hen in my possession was solitary in her habits and was often so absorbed in reverie that she could be touched she was also deficient in the most singular manner in the faculty of finding her way so that if she strayed a hundred yards from her feedingplace she was completely lost and would then obstinately try to proceed in a wrong direction i have received other and similar accounts of polish fowls appearing stupid or halfidiotic 770 the field may 11 1861 i have received communications to a similar effect from messrs brent and tegetmeier  to return to the skull of polish fowls the posterior part viewed externally differs little from that of g bankiva in most fowls the posteriorlateral process of the frontal bone and the process of the squamosal bone run together and are ossified near their extremities this union of the two bones however is not constant in any breed and in eleven out of fourteen skulls of crested breeds these processes were quite distinct these processes when not united instead of being inclined anteriorly as in all common breeds descend at right angles to the lower jaw and in this case the longer axis of the bony cavity of the ear is likewise more perpendicular than in other breeds when the squamosal process is free instead of expanding at the tip it is reduced to an extremely fine and pointed style of variable length the pterygoid and quadrate bones present no differences the palatine bones are a little more curved upwards at their posterior ends the frontal bones anteriorly to the protuberance are as in dorkings very broad but in a variable degree the nasal bones either stand far apart as in hamburghs or almost touch each other and in one instance were ossified together each nasal bone properly sends out in front two long processes of equal lengths forming a fork but in all the polish skulls except one the inner process was considerably but in a variable degree shortened and somewhat upturned in all the skulls except one the two ascending branches of the premaxillary instead of running up between the processes of the nasal bones and resting on the ethmoid bone are much shortened and terminate in a blunt somewhat upturned point in those skulls in which the nasal bones approach quite close to each other or are ossified together it would be impossible for the ascending branches of the premaxillary to reach the ethmoid and frontal bones hence we see that even the relative connection of the bones has been changed apparently in consequence of the branches of the premaxillary and of the inner processes of the nasal bones being somewhat upturned the external orifices of the nostrils are upraised and assume a crescentic outline  i must still say a few words on some of the foreign crested breeds the skull of a crested rumpless white turkish fowl was very slightly protuberant and but little perforated the ascending branches of the premaxillary were well developed in another turkish breed called ghoondooks the skull was considerably protuberant and perforated the ascending branches of the premaxillary were so much aborted that they projected only 115th of an inch and the inner processes of the nasal bone were so completely aborted that the surface where they should have projected was quite smooth here then we see these two bones modified to an extreme degree of sultans another turkish breed i examined two skulls in that of the female the protuberance was much larger than in the male in both skulls the ascending branches of the premaxillary were very short and in both the nasal portion of the inner processes of the nasal bones were ossified together these sultan skulls differed from those of english polish fowls in the frontal bones anteriorly to the protuberance not being broad  the last skull which i need describe is a unique one lent to me by mr tegetmeier it resembles a polish skull in most of its characters but has not the great frontal protuberance it has however two rounded knobs of a different nature which stand more in front above the lachrymal bones these curious knobs into which the brain does not enter are separated from each other by a deep medial furrow and this is perforated by a few minute pores the nasal bones stand rather wide apart with their inner processes and the ascending branches of the premaxillary upturned and shortened the two knobs no doubt supported the two great hornlike projections of the comb  from the foregoing facts we see in how astonishing a manner some of the bones of the skull vary in crested fowls the protuberance may certainly be called in one sense a monstrosity as being wholly unlike anything observed in nature but as in ordinary cases it is not injurious to the bird and as it is strictly inherited it can hardly in another sense be called a monstrosity a series may be formed commencing with the blackboned silk fowl which has a very small crest with the skull beneath penetrated only by a few minute orifices but with no other change in its structure and from this first stage we may proceed to fowls with a moderately large crest which rests according to bechstein on a fleshy mass but without any protuberance in the skull i may add that i have seen a similar fleshy or fibrous mass beneath the tuft of feathers on the head of the tufted duck and in this case there was no actual protuberance in the skull but it had become a little more globular lastly when we come to fowls with a largely developed crest the skull becomes largely protuberant and is perforated by a multitude of irregular open spaces the close relation between the crest and the size of the bony protuberance is shown in another way for mr tegetmeier informs me that if chickens lately hatched be selected with a large bony protuberance when adult they will have a large crest there can be no doubt that in former times the breeder of polish fowls attended solely to the crest and not to the skull nevertheless by increasing the crest in which he has been wonderfully successful he has unintentionally made the skull protuberant to an astonishing degree and through correlation of growth he has at the same time affected the form and relative connexion of the premaxillary and nasal bones the shape of the orifice of the nose the breadth of the frontal bones the shape of the postlateral processes of the frontal and squamosal bones the direction of the axis of the bony cavity of the ear and lastly the internal configuration of the whole skull together with the shape of the brain  vertebrae  figure 37 sixth cervical vertebra natural size viewed laterally a wild gallus bankiva b cochin cock  in g bankiva there are fourteen cervical seven dorsal with ribs apparently fifteen lumbar and sacral and six caudal vertebrae 771 it appears that i have not correctly designated the several groups of vertebrae for a great authority mr wk parker transact zoolog soc volume 5 page 198 specifies 16 cervical 4 dorsal 15 lumbar and 6 caudal vertebrae in this genus but i have used the same terms in all the following descriptions but the lumbar and sacral are so much anchylosed that i am not sure of their number and this makes the comparison of the total number of vertebrae in the several breeds difficult i have spoken of six caudal vertebrae because the basal one is almost completely anchylosed with the pelvis but if we consider the number as seven the caudal vertebrae agree in all the skeletons the cervical vertebrae are as just stated in appearance fourteen but out of twentythree skeletons in a fit state for examination in five of them namely in two games in two pencilled hamburghs and in a polish the fourteenth vertebra bore ribs which though small were perfectly developed with a double articulation the presence of these little ribs cannot be considered as a fact of much importance for all the cervical vertebrae bear representatives of ribs but their development in the fourteenth vertebra reduces the size of the passages in the transverse processes and makes this vertebra exactly like the first dorsal vertebra the addition of these little ribs does not affect the fourteenth cervical alone for properly the ribs of the first true dorsal vertebra are destitute of processes but in some of the skeletons in which the fourteenth cervical bore little ribs the first pair of true ribs had welldeveloped processes when we know that the sparrow has only nine and the swan twentythree cervical vertebrae 772 macgillivray british birds volume 1 page 25 we need feel no surprise at the number of the cervical vertebrae in the fowl being as it appears variable  there are seven dorsal vertebrae bearing ribs the first dorsal is never anchylosed with the succeeding four which are generally anchylosed together in one sultan fowl however the two first dorsal vertebrae were free in two skeletons the fifth dorsal was free generally the sixth is free as in g bankiva but sometimes only at its posterior end where in contact with the seventh the seventh dorsal vertebra in every case excepting in one spanish cock was anchylosed with the lumbar vertebrae so that the degree to which these middle dorsal vertebrae are anchylosed is variable  seven is the normal number of true ribs but in two skeletons of the sultan fowl in which the fourteenth cervical vertebra was not furnished with little ribs there were eight pairs the eighth pair seemed to be developed on a vertebra corresponding with the first lumbar in g bankiva the sternal portion of both the seventh and eighth ribs did not reach the sternum in four skeletons in which ribs were developed on the fourteenth cervical vertebra there were when these cervical ribs are included eight pairs but in one game cock in which the fourteenth cervical was furnished with ribs there were only six pairs of true dorsal ribs the sixth pair in this case did not have processes and thus resembled the seventh pair in other skeletons in this game cock as far as could be judged from the appearance of the lumbar vertebrae a whole dorsal vertebra with its ribs was missing we thus see that the ribs whether or not the little pair attached to the fourteenth cervical vertebra be counted vary from six to eight pair the sixth pair is frequently not furnished with processes the sternal portion of the seventh pair is extremely broad in cochins and is completely ossified as previously stated it is scarcely possible to count the lumbosacral vertebrae but they certainly do not correspond in shape or number in the several skeletons the caudal vertebrae are closely similar in all the skeletons the only difference being whether or not the basal one is anchylosed to the pelvis they hardly vary even in length not being shorter in cochins with their short tailfeathers than in other breeds in a spanish cock however the caudal vertebrae were a little elongated in three rumpless fowls the caudal vertebrae were few in number and anchylosed together into a misformed mass  in the individual vertebrae the differences in structure are very slight in the atlas the cavity for the occipital condyle is either ossified into a ring or is as in bankiva open on its upper margin the upper arc of the spinal canal is a little more arched    in cochins in conformity with the shape of the occipital foramen than in g bankiva in several skeletons a difference but not of much importance may be observed which commences at the fourth cervical vertebra and is greatest at about the sixth seventh or eighth vertebra this consists in the haemal descending processes being united to the body of the vertebra by a sort of buttress this structure may be observed in cochins polish some hamburghs and probably other breeds but is absent or barely developed in game dorking spanish bantam and several other breeds examined by me on the dorsal surface of the sixth cervical vertebra in cochins three prominent points are more strongly developed than in the corresponding vertebra of the game fowl or g bankiva  pelvis  this differs in some few points in the several skeletons the anterior margin of the ilium seems at first to vary much in outline but this is chiefly due to the degree to which the margin in the middle part is ossified to the crest of the vertebrae the outline however does differ in being more truncated in bantams and more rounded in certain breeds as in cochins the outline of the ischiadic foramen differs considerably being nearly circular in bantams instead of eggshaped as in the bankiva and more regularly oval in some skeletons as in the spanish the obturator notch is also much less elongated in some skeletons than in others the end of the pubic bone presents the greatest difference being hardly enlarged in the bankiva considerably and gradually enlarged in cochins and in a lesser degree in some other breeds and abruptly enlarged in bantams in one bantam this bone extended very little beyond the extremity of the ischium the whole pelvis in this latter bird differed widely in its proportions being far broader proportionally to its length than in bankiva  figure 38 extremity of the furcula of natural size viewed laterally a wild gallus bankiva b spangled polish fowl c spanish fowl d dorking fowl  sternum  this bone is generally so much deformed that it is scarcely possible to compare its shape strictly in the several breeds the form of the triangular extremity of the lateral processes differs considerably being either almost equilateral or much elongated the front margin of the crest is more or less perpendicular and varies greatly as does the curvature of the posterior end and the flatness of the lower surface the outline of the manubrial process also varies being wedgeshaped in the bankiva and rounded in the spanish breed the furculum differs in being more or less arched and greatly as may be seen in the accompanying outlines in the shape of the terminal plate but the shape of this part differed a little in two skeletons of the wild bankiva the coracoid presents no difference worth notice the scapula varies in shape being of nearly uniform breadth in bankiva much broader in the middle in the polish fowl and abruptly narrowed towards the apex in the two sultan fowls  i carefully compared each separate bone of the leg and wing relatively to the same bones in the wild bankiva in the following breeds which i thought were the most likely to differ namely in cochin dorking spanish polish burmese bantam frizzled indian and blackboned silk fowls and it was truly surprising to see how absolutely every process articulation and pore agreed though the bones differed greatly in size the agreement is far more absolute than in other parts of the skeleton in stating this i do not refer to the relative thickness and length of the several bones for the tarsi varied considerably in both these respects but the other limbbones varied little even in relative length  finally i have not examined a sufficient number of skeletons to say whether any of the foregoing differences except in the skull are characteristic of the several breeds apparently some differences are more common in certain breeds than in othersas an additional rib to the fourteenth cervical vertebra in hamburghs and games and the breadth of the end of the pubic bone in cochins both skeletons of the sultan fowl had eight dorsal vertebrae and the end of the scapula in both was somewhat attenuated in the skull the deep medial furrow in the frontal bones and the vertically elongated occipital foramen seem to be characteristic of cochins as is the great breadth of the frontal bones in dorkings the separation and open spaces between the tips of the ascending branches of the premaxillaries and nasal bones as well as the front part of the skull being but little depressed characterise hamburghs the globular shape of the posterior part of the skull seems to be characteristic of laced bantams and lastly the protuberance of the skull with the ascending branches of the premaxillaries partially aborted together with the other differences before specified are eminently characteristic of polish and other crested fowls  but the most striking result of my examination of the skeleton is the great variability of all the bones except those of the extremities to a certain extent we can understand why the skeleton fluctuates so much in structure fowls have been exposed to unnatural conditions of life and their whole organisation has thus been rendered variable but the breeder is quite indifferent to and never intentionally selects any modification in the skeleton external characters if not attended to by man such as the number of the tail and wing feathers and their relative lengths which in wild birds are generally constantfluctuate in our domestic fowls in the same manner as the several parts of the skeleton an additional toe is a point in dorkings and has become a fixed character but is variable in cochins and silk fowls the colour of the plumage and the form of the comb are in most breeds or even subbreeds eminently fixed characters but in dorkings these points have not been attended to and are variable when any modification in the skeleton is related to some external character which man values it has been unintentionally on his part acted on by selection and has become more or less fixed we see this in the wonderful protuberance of the skull which supports the crest of feathers in polish fowls and which by correlation has affected other parts of the skull we see the same result in the two protuberances which support the horns in the horned fowl and in the flattened shape of the front of the skull in hamburghs consequent on their flattened and broad rosecombs we know not in the least whether additional ribs or the changed outline of the occipital foramen or the changed form of the scapula or of the extremity of the furculum are in any way correlated with other structures or have arisen from the changed conditions and habits of life to which our fowls have been subjected but there is no reason to doubt that these various modifications in the skeleton could be rendered either by direct selection or by the selection of correlated structures as constant and as characteristic of each breed as are the size and shape of the body the colour of the plumage and the form of the comb  effects of the disuse of parts  judging from the habits of our european gallinaceous birds gallus bankiva in its native haunts would use its legs and wings more than do our domestic fowls which rarely fly except to their roosts the silk and the frizzled fowls from having imperfect wingfeathers cannot fly at all and there is reason to believe that both these breeds are ancient so that their progenitors during many generations cannot have flown the cochins also from their short wings and heavy bodies can hardly fly up to a low perch therefore in these breeds especially in the two first a considerable diminution in the wingbones might have been expected but this is not the case in every specimen after disarticulating and cleaning the bones i carefully compared the relative length of the two main bones of the wing to each other and of the two main bones of the leg to each other with those of g bankiva and it was surprising to see except in the case of the tarsi how exactly the same relative length had been retained this fact is curious from showing how truly the proportions of an organ may be inherited although not fully exercised during many generations i then compared in several breeds the length of the femur and tibia with the humerus and ulna and likewise these same bones with those of g bankiva the result was that the wingbones in all the breeds except the burmese jumper which has unnaturally short legs are slightly shortened relatively to the legbones but the decrease is so slight that it may be due to the standard specimen of g bankiva having accidentally had wings of slightly greater length than usual so that the measurements are not worth giving but it deserves notice that the silk and frizzled fowls which are quite incapable of flight had their wings less reduced relatively to their legs than in almost any other breed we have seen with domesticated pigeons that the bones of the wings are somewhat reduced in length whilst the primary feathers are rather increased in length and it is just possible though not probable that in the silk and frizzled fowls any tendency to decrease in the length of the wingbones from disuse may have been checked through the law of compensation by the decreased growth of the wingfeathers and consequent increased supply of nutriment the wingbones however in both these breeds are found to be slightly reduced in length when judged by the standard of the length of the sternum or head relatively to these same parts in g bankiva  the actual weight of the main bones of the leg and wing in twelve breeds is given in the two first columns in table 7i the calculated weight of the wingbones relatively to the legbones in comparison with the leg and wingbones of g bankiva are given in the third columnthe weight of the wingbones in g bankiva being called a hundred 773 it may be well to explain how the calculation has been made for the third column in g bankiva the legbones are to the wingbones as 86  54 or as neglecting decimals 100  62in cochins as 311  162 or as 100  52in dorkings as 557  248 or as 100  44 and so on for the other breeds we thus get the series of 62 52 44 for the relative weights of the wingbones in g bankiva cochins dorkings etc and now taking 100 instead of 62 for the weight of the wingbones in g bankiva we get by another rule of three 83 as the weight of the wingbones in cochins 70 in the dorkings and so on for the remainder of the third column in the table  table 7i

distinct breeds in this table we see a decided reduction in the weight of the bones of the wing  in the indian frizzled fowl which cannot fly the reduction is carried to the greatest extent namely to thirtythree per cent of their proper proportional weight in the next four birds including the silk hen which is incapable of flight we see that the wings relatively to the legs are slightly increased in weight but it should be observed that if in these birds the legs had become from any cause reduced in weight this would give the false appearance of the wings having increased in relative weight now a reduction of this nature has certainly occurred with the burmese jumper in which the legs are abnormally short and in the two hamburghs and silk fowl the legs though not short are formed of remarkably thin and light bones i make these statements not judging by mere eyesight but after having calculated the weights of the legbones relatively to those of g bankiva according to the only two standards of comparison which i could use namely the relative lengths of the head and sternum for i do not know the weight of the body in g bankiva which would have been a better standard according to these standards the legbones in these four fowls are in a marked manner far lighter than in any other breed it may therefore be concluded that in all cases in which the legs have not been through some unknown cause much reduced in weight the wingbones have become reduced in weight relatively to the legbones in comparison with those of g bankiva and this reduction of weight may i apprehend safely be attributed to disuse  to make table 7i quite satisfactory it ought to have been shown that in the eight first birds the legbones have not actually increased in weight out of due proportion with the rest of the body this i cannot show from not knowing as already remarked the weight of the wild bankiva 774 mr blyth in annals and mag of nat hist 2nd series volume 1 1848 page 456 gives 3 14 pounds as the weight of a fullgrown male g bankiva but from what i have seen of the skins and skeletons of various breeds i cannot believe that my two specimens of g bankiva could have weighed so much i am indeed inclined to suspect that the legbones in the dorking no 2 in the table are proportionally too heavy but this bird was a very large one weighing 7 pounds 2 ounces though very thin its legbones were more than ten times as heavy as those of the burmese jumper i tried to ascertain the length both of the legbones and wingbones relatively to other parts of the body and skeleton but the whole organisation in these birds which have been so long domesticated has become so variable that no certain conclusions could be reached for instance the legs of the above dorking cock were nearly threequarters of an inch too short relatively to the length of the sternum and more than threequarters of an inch too long relatively to the length of the skull in comparison with these same parts in

columns we see in inches and decimals the length of the sternum and the extreme depth of its crest to which the pectoral muscles are attached in the third column we have the calculated depth of the crest relatively to the length of the sternum in comparison with these same parts in g bankiva 775 the third column is calculated on the same principle as explained in footnote 773 above  by looking to the third column we see that in every case the depth of the crest relatively to the length of the sternum in comparison with g bankiva is diminished generally between 10 and 20 per cent but the degree of reduction varies much partly in consequence of the frequently deformed state of the sternum in the silk fowl which cannot fly the crest is 34 per cent less deep than what it ought to have been this reduction of the crest in all the breeds probably accounts for the great variability before referred to in the curvature of the furculum and in the shape of its sternal extremity medical men believe that the abnormal form of the spine so commonly observed in women of the higher ranks results from the attached muscles not being fully exercised so it is with our domestic fowls for they use their pectoral muscles but little and out of twentyfive sternums examined by me three alone were perfectly symmetrical ten were moderately crooked and twelve were deformed to an extreme degree mr romanes however believes that the malformation is due to fowls whilst young resting their sternums on the sticks on which they roost  finally we may conclude with respect to the various breeds of the fowl that the main bones of the wing have probably been shortened in a very slight degree that they have certainly become lighter relatively to the legbones in all the breeds in which these latter bones are not unnaturally short or delicate and that the crest of the sternum to which the pectoral muscles are attached has invariably become less prominent the whole sternum being also extremely liable to deformity these results we may attribute to the lessened use of the wings  correlation of growth  i will here sum up the few facts which i have collected on this obscure but important subject in cochin and game fowls there is perhaps some relation between the colour of the plumage and the darkness of the egg shell in sultans the additional sicklefeathers in the tail are apparently related to the general redundancy of the plumage as shown by the feathered legs large crest and beard in two tailless fowls which i examined the oilgland was aborted a large crest of feathers as mr tegetmeier has remarked seems always accompanied by a great diminution or almost entire absence of the comb a large beard is similarly accompanied by diminished or absent wattles these latter cases apparently come under the law of compensation or balancement of growth a large beard beneath the lower jaw and a large topknot on the skull often go together the comb when of any peculiar shape as with horned spanish and hamburgh fowls affects in a corresponding manner the underlying skull and we have seen how wonderfully this is the case with crested fowls when the crest is largely developed with the protuberance of the frontal bones the shape of the internal surface of the skull and of the brain is greatly modified the presence of a crest influences in some unknown way the development of the ascending branches of the premaxillary bone and of the inner processes of the nasal bones and likewise the shape of the external orifice of the nostrils there is a plain and curious correlation between a crest of feathers and the imperfectly ossified condition of the skull not only does this hold good with nearly all crested fowls but likewise with tufted ducks and as dr gunther informs me with tufted geese in germany  lastly the feathers composing the crest in male polish fowls resemble hackles and differ greatly in shape from those in the crest of the female the neck wingcoverts and loins in the male bird are properly covered with hackles and it would appear that feathers of this shape have spread by correlation to the head of the male this little fact is interesting because though both sexes of some wild gallinaceous birds have their heads similarly ornamented yet there is often a difference in the size and shape of feathers forming their crests furthermore there is in some cases as in the male gold and in the male amherst pheasants p pictus and amherstiae a close relation in colour as well as in structure between the plumes on the head and on the loins it would therefore appear that the same law has regulated the state of the feathers on the head and body both with species living under natural conditions and with birds which have varied under domestication

different races in the egg caterpillar and cocoon states inheritance of characters imperfect wings lost instincts correlated characters  i will as in previous cases first briefly describe the chief domestic breeds of the duck  breed 1 common domestic duck  varies much in colour and in proportions and differs in instincts and disposition from the wild duck there are several subbreeds  1 the aylesbury of great size white with paleyellow beak and legs abdominal dermal sack largely developed  2 the rouen of great size coloured like the wild duck with green or mottled beak dermal sack largely developed  3 tufted duck with a large topknot of fine downy feathers supported on a fleshy mass with the skull perforated beneath the topknot in a duck which i imported from holland was two and a half inches in diameter  4 labrador or canadian or buenos ayres or east indian plumage entirely black beak broader relatively to its length than in the wild duck eggs slightly tinted with black this subbreed perhaps ought to be ranked as a breed it includes two subvarieties one as large as the common domestic duck which i have kept alive and the other smaller and often capable of flight 81 poultry chronicle 1854 volume 2 page 91 and volume 1 page 330 i presume it is this latter subvariety which has been described in france 82 dr turral bull soc dacclimat tome 7 1860 page 541 as flying well being rather wild and when cooked having the flavour of the wild duck nevertheless this subvariety is polygamous like other domesticated ducks and unlike the wild duck these black labrador ducks breed true but a case is given by dr turral of the french subvariety producing young with some white feathers on the head and neck and with an ochrecoloured patch on the breast  breed 2 hookbilled duck  this bird presents an extraordinary appearance from the downward curvature of the beak the head is often tufted the common colour is white but some are coloured like wild ducks it is an ancient breed having been noticed in 1676 83 willughbys ornithology by ray page 381 this breed is also figured by albin in 1734 in his nat hist of birds volume 2 page 86 it shows its prolonged domestication by almost incessantly laying eggs like the fowls which are called everlasting layers 84 f cuvier in annales du museum tome 9 page 128 says that moulting and incubation alone stops these ducks laying mr bp brent makes a similar remark in the poultry chronicle 1855 volume 3 page 512  breed 3 call duck  remarkable from its small size and from the extraordinary loquacity of the female beak short these birds are either white or coloured like the wild duck  breed 4 penguin duck  this is the most remarkable of all the breeds and seems to have originated in the malayan archipelago it walks with its body extremely erect and with its thin neck stretched straight upwards beak rather short tail upturned including only 18 feathers femur and metatarsus elongated  almost all naturalists admit that the several breeds are descended from the common wild duck anas boschas most fanciers on the other hand take as usual a very different view 85 rev es dixon ornamental and domestic poultry 1848 page 117 mr bp brent in poultry chronicle volume 3 1855 page 512 unless we deny that domestication prolonged during centuries can affect even such unimportant characters as colour size and in a slight degree proportional dimensions and mental disposition there is no reason whatever to doubt that the domestic duck is descended from the common wild species for the one differs from the other in no important character we have some historical evidence with respect to the period and progress of the domestication of the duck it was unknown 86 crawfurd on the relation of domesticated animals to civilisation read before the brit assoc at oxford 1860 to the ancient egyptians to the jews of the old testament and to the greeks of the homeric period about eighteen centuries ago columella 87 dureau de la malle in annales des sciences nat tome 17 page 164 and tome 21 page 55 rev es dixon ornamental poultry page 118 tame ducks were not known in aristotles time as remarked by volz in his beitrage zur kulturgeschichte 1852 s 78 and varro speak of the necessity of keeping ducks in netted enclosures like other wild fowl so that at this period there was danger of their flying away moreover the plan recommended by columella to those who wish to increase their stock of ducks namely to collect the eggs of the wild bird and to place them under a hen shows as mr dixon remarks that the duck had not at this time become a naturalised and prolific inmate of the roman poultryyard the origin of the domestic duck from the wild species is recognised in nearly every language of europe as aldrovandi long ago remarked by the same name being applied to both the wild duck has a wide range from the himalayas to north america it crosses readily with the domestic bird and the crossed offspring are perfectly fertile  both in north america and europe the wild duck has been found easy to tame and breed in sweden this experiment was carefully tried by tiburtius he succeeded in rearing wild ducks for three generations but though they were treated like common ducks they did not vary even in a single feather the young birds suffered from being allowed to swim about in cold water 88 i quote this account from die enten und schwanenzucht ulm 1828 s 143 see audubon ornithological biography volume 3 page 168 on the taming of ducks on the mississippi for the same fact in england see mr waterton in loudons mag of nat hist volume 8 1835 page 542 and mr st john wild sports and nat hist of the highlands 1846 page 129 as is known to be the case though the fact is a strange one with the young of the common domestic duck an accurate and wellknown observer in england 89 mr e hewitt in journal of horticulture 1862 page 773 and 1863 page 39 has described in detail his often repeated and successful experiments in domesticating the wild duck young birds are easily reared from eggs hatched under a bantam but to succeed it is indispensable not to place the eggs of both the wild and tame duck under the same hen for in this case the young wild ducks die off leaving their more hardy brethren in undisturbed possession of their fostermothers care the difference of habit at the onset in the newlyhatched ducklings almost entails such a result to a certainty the wild ducklings were from the first quite tame towards those who took care of them as long as they wore the same clothes and likewise to the dogs and cats of the house they would even snap with their beaks at the dogs and drive them away from any spot which they coveted but they were much alarmed at strange men and dogs differently from what occurred in sweden mr hewitt found that his young birds always changed and deteriorated in character in the course of two or three generations notwithstanding that great care was taken to prevent their crossing with tame ducks after the third generation his birds lost the elegant carriage of the wild species and began to acquire the gait of the common duck they increased in size in each generation and their legs became less fine the white collar round the neck of the mallard became broader and less regular and some of the longer primary wingfeathers became more or less white when this occurred mr hewitt destroyed nearly the whole of his stock and procured fresh eggs from wild nests so that he never bred the same family for more than five or six generations his birds continued to pair together and never became polygamous like the common domestic duck i have given these details because no other case as far as i know has been so carefully recorded by a competent observer of the progress of change in wild birds reared for several generations in a domestic condition  from these considerations there can hardly be a doubt that the wild duck is the parent of the common domestic kind nor need we look to other species for the parentage of the more distinct breeds namely penguin call hook billed tufted and labrador ducks i will not repeat the arguments used in the previous chapters on the improbability of man having in ancient times domesticated several species since become unknown or extinct though ducks are not readily exterminated in the wild stateon some of the supposed parentspecies having had abnormal characters in comparison with all the other species of the genus as with hookbilled and penguin duckson all the breeds as far as is known being fertile together 810 i have met with several statements on the fertility of the several breeds when crossed mr yarrell assured me that call and common ducks are perfectly fertile together i crossed hookbilled and common ducks and a penguin and labrador and the crossed ducks were quite fertile though they were not bred inter se so that the experiment was not fully tried some halfbred penguins and labradors were again crossed with penguins and subsequently bred by me inter se and they were extremely fertileon all the breeds having the same general disposition instinct etc but one fact bearing on this question may be noticed in the great duck family one species alone namely the male of a boschas has its four middle tailfeathers curled upwardly now in every one of the abovenamed domestic breeds these curled feathers exist and on the supposition that they are descended from distinct species we must assume that man formerly hit upon species all of which had this now unique character moreover subvarieties of each breed are coloured almost exactly like the wild duck as i have seen with the largest and smallest breeds namely rouens and call ducks and as mr brent states 811 poultry chronicle 1855 volume 3 page 512 is the case with hookbilled ducks this gentleman as he informs me crossed a white aylesbury drake and a black labrador duck and some of the ducklings as they grew up assumed the plumage of the wild duck  with respect to penguins i have not seen many specimens and none were coloured precisely like the wild duck but sir james brooke sent me three skins from lombok and bali in the malayan archipelago the two females were paler and more rufous than the wild duck and the drake differed in having the whole under and upper surface excepting the neck tailcoverts tail and wings silvergrey finely pencilled with dark lines closely like certain parts of the plumage of the wild mallard but i found this drake to be identical in every feather with a variety of the common breed procured from a farmyard in kent and i have occasionally elsewhere seen similar specimens the occurrence of a duck bred under so peculiar a climate as that of the malayan archipelago where the wild species does not exist with exactly the same plumage as may occasionally be seen in our farmyards is a fact worth notice nevertheless the climate of the malayan archipelago apparently tends to cause the duck to vary much for zollinger 812 journal of the indian archipelago volume 5 page 334 speaking of the penguin breed says that in lombok there is an unusual and very wonderful variety of ducks one penguin drake which i kept alive differed from those of which the skins were sent me from lombok in having its breast and back partially coloured with chestnutbrown thus more closely resembling the mallard  from these several facts more especially from the drakes of all the breeds having curled tailfeathers and from certain subvarieties in each breed occasionally resembling in general plumage the wild duck we may conclude with confidence that all the breeds are descended from a boschas  i will now notice some of the peculiarities characteristic of the several breeds the eggs vary in colour some common ducks laying palegreenish and others quite white eggs the eggs which are first laid during each season by the black labrador duck are tinted black as if rubbed with ink a good observer assured me that one year his ducks of this breed laid almost perfectly white eggs another curious case shows what singular variations sometimes occur and are inherited mr hansell 813 the zoologist volumes 7 8 18491850 page 2353 relates that he had a common duck which always laid eggs with the yolk of a darkbrown colour like melted glue and the young ducks hatched from these eggs laid the same kind of eggs so that the breed had to be destroyed  figure 39 skulls viewed laterally reduced to twothirds of the natural size a wild duck b hookbilled duck  the hookbilled duck is highly remarkable see figure 39 of skull and its peculiar beak has been inherited at least since the year 1676 this structure is evidently analogous with that described in the bagadotten carrier pigeon mr brent 814 poultry chronicle 1855 volume 3 page 512 says that when hookbilled ducks are crossed with common ducks many young ones are produced with the upper mandible shorter than the lower which not unfrequently causes the death of the bird with ducks a tuft of feathers on the head is by no means a rare occurrence namely in the truetufted breed the hookbilled the common farmyard kind and in a duck having no other peculiarity which was sent to me from the malayan archipelago the tuft is only so far interesting as it affects the skull which is thus rendered slightly more globular and is perforated by numerous apertures call ducks are remarkable from their extraordinary loquacity the drake only hisses like common drakes nevertheless when paired with the common duck he transmits to his female offspring a strong quacking tendency this loquacity seems at first a surprising character to have been acquired under domestication but the voice varies in the different breeds mr brent 815 poultry chronicle volume 3 1855 page 312 with respect to rouens see ditto volume 1 1854 page 167 says that hookbilled ducks are very loquacious and that rouens utter a dull loud and monotonous cry easily distinguishable by an experienced ear as the loquacity of the call duck is highly serviceable these birds being used in decoys this quality may have been increased by selection for instance colonel hawker says if young wild ducks cannot be got for a decoy by way of makeshift select tame birds which are the most clamorous even if their colour should not be like that of wild ones 816 col hawker instructions to young sportsmen quoted by mr dixon in his ornamental poultry page 125 it has been erroneously asserted that call ducks hatch their eggs in less time than common ducks 817 cottage gardener april 9 1861  the penguin duck is the most remarkable of all the breeds the thin neck and body are carried erect the wings are small the tail is upturned and the thighbones and metatarsi are considerably lengthened in proportion with the same bones in the wild duck in five specimens examined by me there were only eighteen tailfeathers instead of twenty as in the wild duck but i have also found only eighteen and nineteen tailfeathers in two labrador ducks on the middle toe in three specimens there were twenty seven or twentyeight scutellae whereas in two wild ducks there were thirtyone and thirtytwo the penguin when crossed transmits with much power its peculiar form of body and gait to its offspring this was manifest with some hybrids raised in the zoological gardens between one of these birds and the egyptian goose anser aegyptiacus 818 these hybrids have been described by m selyslongchamps in the bulletins tome 12 no 10 acad roy de bruxelles and likewise with some mongrels which i raised between the penguin and labrador duck i am not much surprised that some writers should maintain that this breed must be descended from an unknown and distinct species but from the reasons already assigned it seems to me far more probable that it is the descendant much modified by domestication under an unnatural climate of anas boschas  osteological characters  the skulls of the several breeds differ from each other and from the skull of the wild duck in very little except in the proportional length and curvature of the premaxillaries these latter bones in the call duck are short and a line drawn from their extremities to the summit of the skull is nearly straight instead of being concave as in the common duck so that the skull resembles that of a small goose in the hookbilled duck figure 39 these same bones as well as the lower jaw curve downwards in a most remarkable manner as represented in the labrador duck the premaxillaries are rather broader than in the wild duck and in two skulls of this breed the vertical ridges on each side of the supraoccipital bone are very prominent in the penguin the premaxillaries are relatively shorter than in the wild duck and the inferior points of the paramastoids more prominent in a dutch tufted duck the skull under the enormous tuft was slightly more globular and was perforated by two large apertures in this skull the lachrymal bones were produced much further backwards so as to have a different shape and nearly to touch the post lat processes of the frontal bones thus almost completing the bony orbit of the eye as the quadrate and pterygoid bones are of such complex shape and stand in relation with so many other bones i carefully compared them in all the principal breeds but excepting in size they presented no difference  figure 40cervical vertebra of natural size a eighth cervical vertebra of wild duck viewed on haemal surface b eighth cervical vertebra of call duck viewed as above c twelfth cervical vertebra of wild duck viewed laterally d twelfth cervical vertebra of aylesbury duck viewed laterally  vertebrae and ribs  in one skeleton of the labrador duck there were the usual fifteen cervical vertebrae and the usual nine dorsal vertebrae bearing ribs in the other skeleton there were fifteen cervical and ten dorsal vertebrae with ribs nor as far as could be judged was this owing merely to a rib having been developed on the first lumbar vertebra for in both skeletons the lumbar vertebrae agreed perfectly in number shape and size with those of the wild duck in two skeletons of the call duck there were fifteen cervical and nine dorsal vertebrae in a third skeleton small ribs were attached to the socalled fifteenth cervical vertebra making ten pairs of ribs but these ten ribs do not correspond or arise from the same vertebra with the ten in the abovementioned labrador duck in the call duck which had small ribs attached to the fifteenth cervical vertebra the haemal spines of the thirteenth and fourteenth cervical and of the seventeenth dorsal vertebrae corresponded with the spines on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighteenth vertebrae of the wild duck so that each of these vertebrae had acquired a structure proper to one posterior to it in position in the eighth cervical vertebra of this same call duck figure 40 b the two branches of the haemal spine stand much closer together than in the wild duck a and the descending haemal processes are much shortened in the penguin duck the neck from its thinness and erectness falsely appears as ascertained by measurement to be much elongated but the cervical and dorsal vertebrae present no difference the posterior dorsal vertebrae however are more completely anchylosed to the pelvis than in the wild duck the aylesbury duck has fifteen cervical and ten dorsal vertebrae furnished with ribs but the same number of lumbar sacral and caudal vertebrae as far as could be traced as in the wild duck the cervical vertebrae in this same duck figure 40 d were much broader and thicker relatively to their length than in the wild c so much so that i have thought it worth while to give a sketch of the twelfth cervical vertebra in these two birds from the foregoing statements we see that the fifteenth cervical vertebra occasionally becomes modified into a dorsal vertebra and when this occurs all the adjoining vertebrae are modified we also see that an additional dorsal vertebra bearing a rib is occasionally developed the number of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae apparently remaining the same as usual  i examined the bony enlargement of the trachea in the males of the penguin call hookbilled labrador and aylesbury breeds and in all it was identical in shape  the pelvis is remarkably uniform but in the skeleton of the hookbilled duck the anterior part is much bowed inwards in the aylesbury and some other breeds the ischiadic foramen is less elongated in the sternum furculum coracoids and scapulae the differences are so slight and so variable as not to be worth notice except that in two skeletons of the penguin duck the terminal portion of the scapula was much attenuated  in the bones of the leg and wing no modification in shape could be observed but in the penguin and hookbilled ducks the terminal phalanges of the wing are a little shortened in the former the femur and metatarsus but not the tibia are considerably lengthened relatively to the same bones in the wild duck and to the wingbones in both birds this elongation of the legbones could be seen whilst the bird was alive and is no doubt connected with its peculiar upright manner of walking in a large aylesbury duck on the other hand the tibia was the only bone of the leg which relatively to the other bones was slightly lengthened  on the effects of the increased and decreased use of the limbs  in all the breeds the bones of the wing measured separately after having been cleaned relatively to those of the leg have become slightly shortened in comparison with the same bones in the wild duck as may be seen in table 8i  table 8ia  column 1 length of femur tibia and metatarsus together inches  column 2

the wing relatively to those of the legs though slight is universal the reduction is least in the call duck which has the power and the habit of frequently flying  in weight there is a greater

the entire skeleton have really increased in weight but table 8iiib shows that according to the same standard the wingbones have also really decreased in weight so that the relative disproportion shown in the foregoing tables between the wing and legbones in comparison with those of the wild duck is partly due to the increase in weight and length of the legbones and partly to the decrease in weight and length of the wing bones  with respect to tables 8iiia and b i may first state that i tested them by taking another skeleton of a wild duck and of a common domestic duck and by comparing the weight of all the bones of the leg with all those of the wings and the result was the same in the first of these tables we see that the legbones in each case have increased in actual weight it might have been expected that with the increased or decreased weight of the entire skeleton the legbones would have become proportionally heavier or lighter but their greater weight in all the breeds relatively to the other bones can be accounted for only by these domestic birds having used their legs in walking and standing much more than the wild for they never fly and the more artificial breeds rarely swim in the second table we see with the exception of one case a plain reduction in the weight of the bones of the wing and this no doubt has resulted from their lessened use the one exceptional case namely in one of the call ducks is in truth no exception for this bird was constantly in the habit of flying about and i have seen it day after day rise from my grounds and fly for a long time in circles of more than a mile in diameter in this call duck there is not only no decrease but an actual increase in the weight of the wingbones relatively to those of the wildduck and this probably is consequent on the remarkable lightness and thinness of all the bones of the skeleton  lastly i weighed the furculum coracoids and scapula of a wild duck and of a common domestic duck and i found that their weight relatively to that of the whole skeleton was as one hundred in the former to eightynine in the latter this shows that these bones in the domestic duck have been reduced eleven per cent of their due proportional weight the prominence of the crest of the sternum relatively to its length is also much reduced in all the domestic breeds these changes have evidently been caused by the lessened use of the wings  it is well known that several birds belonging to different orders and inhabiting oceanic islands have their wings greatly reduced in size and are incapable of flight i suggested in my origin of species that as these birds are not persecuted by any enemies the reduction of their wings had probably been caused by gradual disuse hence during the earlier stages of the process of reduction such birds would probably have resembled our domesticated ducks in the state of their organs of flight this is the case with the waterhen gallinula nesiotis of tristan dacunha which can flutter a little but obviously uses its legs and not its wings as a mode of escape now mr sclater 819 proc zoolog soc 1861 page 261 finds in this bird that the wings sternum and coracoids are all reduced in length and the crest of the sternum in depth in comparison with the same bones in the european waterhen g chloropus on the other hand the thighbones and pelvis are increased in length the former by four lines relatively to the same bones in the common waterhen hence in the skeleton of this natural species nearly the same changes have occurred only carried a little further as with our domestic ducks and in this latter case i presume no one will dispute that they have resulted from the lessened use of the wings and the increased use of the legs  the goose  this bird deserves some notice as hardly any other anciently domesticated bird or quadruped has varied so little that geese were anciently domesticated we know from certain verses in homer and from these birds having been kept 388 bc in the capitol at rome as sacred to juno which sacredness implies great antiquity 820 ceylon by sir je tennent 1859 volume 1 page 485 also j crawfurd on the relation of domest animals to civilisation read before brit assoc 1860 see also ornamental poultry by rev es dixon 1848 page 132 the goose figured on the egyptian monuments seems to have been the red goose of egypt that the goose has varied in some degree we may infer from naturalists not being unanimous with respect to its wild parentform though the difficulty is chiefly due to the existence of three or four closely allied wild european species 821 macgillivrays british birds volume 4 page 593 a large majority of capable judges are convinced that our geese are descended from the wild greyleg goose anser ferus the young of which can easily be tamed 822 mr a strickland annals and mag of nat hist 3rd series volume 3 1859 page 122 reared some young wild geese and found them in habits and in all characters identical with the domestic goose this species when crossed with the domestic goose produced in the zoological gardens as i was assured in 1849 perfectly fertile offspring 823 see also hunter essays edited by owen volume 2 page 322 yarrell 824 yarrells british birds volume 3 page 142 has observed that the lower part of the trachea of the domestic goose is sometimes flattened and that a ring of white feathers sometimes surrounds the base of the beak these characters seem at first sight good indications of a cross at some former period with the whitefronted goose a albifrons but the white ring is variable in this latter species and we must not overlook the law of analogous variation that is of one species assuming some of the characters of allied species  as the goose has proved so little flexible in its organisation under long continued domestication the amount of variation which it has undergone may be worth giving it has increased in size and in productiveness 825 l lloyd scandinavian adventures 1854 volume 2 page 413 says that the wild goose lays from five to eight eggs which is a much fewer number than that laid by our domestic goose and varies from white to a dusky colour several observers 826 the rev l jenyns blomefield seems first to have made this observation in his british animals see also yarrell and dixon in his ornamental poultry page 139 and gardeners chronicle 1857 page 45 have stated that the gander is more frequently white than the goose and that when old it almost invariably becomes white but this is not the case with the parentform the a ferus here again the law of analogous variation may have come into play as the almost snowwhite male of the rock goose bernicla antarctica standing on the seashore by his dusky partner is a sight well known to those who have traversed the sounds of tierra del fuego and the falkland islands some geese have topknots and the skull beneath as before stated is perforated a subbreed has lately been formed with the feathers reversed at the back of the head and neck 827 mr bartlet exhibited the head and neck of a bird thus characterised before the zoological soc february 1860 the beak varies a little in size and is of a yellower tint than in the wild species but its colour and that of the legs are both slightly variable 828 w thompson natural hist of ireland 1851 volume 3 page 31 the rev es dixon gave me some information on the varying colour of the beak and legs this latter fact deserves attention because the colour of the legs and beak is highly serviceable in discriminating the several closely allied wild forms 829 mr a strickland in annals and mag of nat hist 3rd series volume 3 1859 page 122 at our shows two breeds are exhibited viz the embden and toulouse but they differ in nothing except colour 830 poultry chronicle volume 1 1854 page 498 volume 3 page 210 recently a smaller and singular variety has been imported from sebastopol 831 the cottage gardener september 4 1860 page 348 with the scapular feathers as i hear from mr tegetmeier who sent me specimens greatly elongated curled and even spirally twisted the margins of these feathers are rendered plumose by the divergence of the barbs and barbules so that they resemble in some degree those on the back of the black australian swan these feathers are likewise remarkable from the central shaft which is excessively thin and transparent being split into fine filaments which after running for a space free sometimes coalesce again it is a curious fact that these filaments are regularly clothed on each side with fine down or barbules precisely like those on the proper barbs of the feather this structure of the feathers is transmitted to halfbred birds in gallus sonneratii the barbs and barbules blend together and form thin horny plates of the same nature with the shaft in this variety of the goose the shaft divides into filaments which acquire barbules and thus resemble true barbs  although the domestic goose certainly differs somewhat from any known wild species yet the amount of variation which it has undergone as compared with that of most domesticated animals is singularly small this fact can be partially accounted for by selection not having come largely into play birds of all kinds which present many distinct races are valued as pets or ornaments no one makes a pet of the goose the name indeed in more languages than one is a term of reproach the goose is valued for its size and flavour for the whiteness of its feathers which adds to their value and for its prolificness and tameness in all these points the goose differs from the wild parentform and these are the points which have been selected even in ancient times the roman gourmands valued the liver of the white goose and pierre belon 832 lhist de la nature des oiseaux par p belon 1555 page 156 with respect to the livers of white geese being preferred by the romans see isid geoffroy sthilaire hist nat gen tome 3 page 58 in 1555 speaks of two varieties one of which was larger more fecund and of a better colour than the other and he expressly states that good managers attended to the colour of their goslings so that they might know which to preserve and select for breeding  the peacock  this is another bird which has hardly varied under domestication except in sometimes being white or piebald mr waterhouse carefully compared as he informs me skins of the wild indian and domestic bird and they were identical in every respect except that the plumage of the latter was perhaps rather thicker whether our birds are descended from those introduced into europe in the time of alexander or have been subsequently imported is doubtful they do not breed very freely with us and are seldom kept in large numberscircumstances which would greatly interfere with the gradual selection and formation of new breeds  there is one strange fact with respect to the peacock namely the occasional appearance in england of the japanned or blackshouldered kind this form has lately been named on the high authority of mr sclater as a distinct species viz pavo nigripennis which he believes will hereafter be found wild in some country but not in india where it is certainly unknown the males of these japanned birds differ conspicuously from the common peacock in the colour of their secondary wingfeathers scapulars wingcoverts and thighs and are i think more beautiful they are rather smaller than the common sort and are always beaten by them in their battles as i hear from the hon asg canning the females are much paler coloured than those of the common kind both sexes as mr canning informs me are white when they leave the egg and they differ from the young of the white variety only in having a peculiar pinkish tinge on their wings these japanned birds though appearing suddenly in flocks of the common kind propagate their kind quite truly although they do not resemble the hybrids which have been raised between p cristatus and muticus nevertheless they are in some respects intermediate in character between these two species and this fact favours as mr sclater believes the view that they form a distinct and natural species 833 mr sclater on the blackshouldered peacock of latham proc zoolog soc april 24 1860 mr swinhoe at one time believed ibis july 1868 that this kind of peafowl was found wild in cochin china but he has since informed me that he feels very doubtful on this head  on the other hand sir h heron states 834 proc zoolog soc april 14 1835 that this breed suddenly appeared within his memory in lord brownlows large stock of pied white and common peacocks the same thing occurred in sir j trevelyans flock composed entirely of the common kind and in mr thorntons stock of common and pied peacocks it is remarkable that in these two latter instances the blackshouldered kind though a smaller and weaker bird increased to the extinction of the previously existing breed i have also received through mr sclater a statement from mr hudson gurney that he reared many years ago a pair of blackshouldered peacocks from the common kind and another ornithologist prof a newton states that five or six years ago a female bird in all respects similar to the female of the blackshouldered kind was produced from a stock of common peacocks in his possession which during more than twenty years had not been crossed with birds of any other strain mr jenner weir informs me that a peacock at blackheath whilst young was white but as it became older gradually assumed the characters of the blackshouldered variety both its parents were common peacocks lastly mr canning has given a case of a female of this same variety appearing in ireland in a flock of the ordinary kind 835 the field may 6 1871 i am much indebted to mr canning for information with respect to his birds here then we have seven well authenticated cases in great britain of japanned birds having suddenly appeared within recent times in flocks of the common peafowl this variety must also have formerly appeared in europe for mr canning has seen an old picture and another is referred to in the field with this variety represented these facts seem to me to indicate that the japanned peacock is a strongly marked variety or sport which tends at all times and in many places to reappear this view is supported by the young being at first white like the young of the white breed which is undoubtedly a variation if on the other hand we believe the japanned peacock to be a distinct species we must suppose that in all the above cases the common breed had at some former period been crossed by it but had lost every trace of the cross yet that the offspring of these birds suddenly and completely reacquired through reversion the characters of p nigripennis i have heard of no other such case in the animal or vegetable kingdom to perceive the full improbability of such an occurrence we may suppose that a breed of dogs had been crossed at some former period with a wolf but had lost every trace of the wolflike character yet that the breed gave birth in seven instances in the same country within no great length of time to a wolf perfect in every character and we must further suppose that in two of the cases the newly produced wolves afterwards spontaneously increased to such an extent as to lead to the extinction of the parent breed of dogs so remarkable a bird as the p nigripennis when first imported would have realised a large price it is therefore improbable that it should have been silently introduced and its history subsequently lost on the whole the evidence seems to me as it did to sir r heron to be decisive in favour of the japanned or blackshouldered breed being a variation induced by some unknown cause on this view the case is the most remarkable one ever recorded of the abrupt appearance of a new form which so closely resembles a true species that it has deceived one of the most experienced of living ornithologists  the turkey  it seems fairly well established by mr gould 836 proc zoolog soc april 8 1856 page 61 prof baird believes as quoted in tegetmeier poultry book 1866 page 269 that our turkeys are descended from a west indian species now extinct but besides the improbability of a bird having long ago become extinct in these large and luxuriant islands it appears as we shall presently see that the turkey degenerates in india and this fact indicates that it was not aboriginally an inhabitant of the lowlands of the tropics that the turkey in accordance with the history of its first introduction is descended from a wild mexican form which had been domesticated by the natives before the discovery of america and which is now generally ranked as a local race and not as a distinct species however this may be the case deserves notice because in the united states wild male turkeys sometimes court the domestic hens which are descended from the mexican form and are generally received by them with great pleasure 837 audubon ornithological biography volume 1 1831 pages 4 13 and naturalists library volume 14 birds page 138 several accounts have likewise been published of young birds reared in the united states from the eggs of the wild species crossing and commingling with the common breed in england also this same species has been kept in several parks from two of which the rev wd fox procured birds and they crossed freely with the common domestic kind and during many years afterwards as he informs me the turkeys in his neighbourhood clearly showed traces of their crossed parentage we here have an instance of a domestic race being modified by a cross with a distinct wild race or species f michaux 838 f michaux travels in n america 1802 english translation page 217 suspected in 1802 that the common domestic turkey was not descended from the united states species alone but likewise from a southern form and he went so far as to believe that english and french turkeys differed from having different proportions of the blood of the two parentforms  english turkeys are smaller than either wild form they have not varied in any great degree but there are some breeds which can be distinguished as norfolks suffolks whites and coppercoloured or cambridge all of which if precluded from crossing with other breeds propagate their kind truly of these kinds the most distinct is the small hardy dullblack norfolk turkey of which the chickens are black occasionally with white patches about the head the other breeds scarcely differ except in colour and their chickens are generally mottled all over with brownishgrey 839 ornamental poetry by the rev es dixon 1848 page 34 the inferior tailcoverts vary in number and according to a german superstition the hen lays as many eggs as the cock has feathers of this kind 840 bechstein naturgesch deutschlands b 3 1793 s 309 albin in 1738 and temminck within a much later period describe a beautiful breed duskyyellowish brown above and white beneath with a large top knot of soft plumose feather the spurs of the male were rudimentary this breed has been for a long time extinct in europe but a living specimen has lately been imported from the east coast of africa which still retains the topknot and the same general colouring and rudimentary spurs 841 mr bartlett in land and water october 31 1868 page 233 and mr tegetmeier in the field july 17 1869 page 46 mr wilmot has described 842 gardeners chronicle 1852 page 699 a white turkeycock having a crest formed of feathers about four inches long with bare quills and a tuft of soft white down growing at the end many of the young birds inherited this kind of crest but afterwards it fell off or was pecked out by the other birds this is an interesting case as with care a new breed might probably have been formed and a topknot of this nature would have been to a certain extent analogous to that borne by the males in several allied genera such as euplocomus lophophorus and pavo  wild turkeys believed in every instance to have been imported from the united states have been kept in the parks of lords powis leicester hill and derby the rev wd fox procured birds from the two firstnamed parks and he informs me that they certainly differed a little from each other in the shape of their bodies and in the barred plumage on their wings these birds likewise differed from lord hills stock some of the latter kept at oulton by sir p egerton though precluded from crossing with common turkeys occasionally produced much palercoloured birds and one that was almost white but not an albino these halfwild turkeys in thus differing slightly from each other present an analogous case with the wild cattle kept in the several british parks we must suppose that such differences have resulted from the prevention of free intercrossing between birds ranging over a wide area and from the changed conditions to which they have been exposed in england in india the climate has apparently wrought a still greater change in the turkey for it is described by mr blyth 843 e blyth annals and mag of nat hist 1847 volume 20 page 391 as being much degenerated in size utterly incapable of rising on the wing of a black colour and with the long pendulous appendages over the beak enormously developed  the guinea fowl  the domesticated guinea fowl is now believed by some naturalists to be descended from the numida ptilorhynca which inhabits very hot and in parts extremely arid districts in eastern africa consequently it has been exposed in this country to extremely different conditions of life nevertheless it has hardly varied at all except in the plumage being either paler or darkercoloured it is a singular fact that this bird varies more in colour in the west indies and on the spanish main under a hot though humid climate than in europe 844 roulin makes this remark in mem de divers savans 1acad des sciences tome 6 1835 page 349 mr hill of spanish town in a letter to me describes five varieties of the guinea fowl in jamaica i have seen singular palecoloured varieties imported from barbadoes and demerara the guinea fowl has become thoroughly feral in jamaica and in st domingo 845 for st domingo see m a salle in proc zoolog soc 1857 page 236 mr hill remarks to me in his letter on the colour of the legs of the feral birds in jamaica and has diminished in size the legs are black whereas the legs of the aboriginal african bird are said to be grey this small change is worth notice on account of the oftenrepeated statement that all feral animals invariably revert in every character to their original type  the canary bird  as this bird has been recently domesticated namely within the last 350 years its variability deserves notice it has been crossed with nine or ten other species of fringillidae and some of the hybrids are almost completely fertile but we have no evidence that any distinct breed has originated from such crosses notwithstanding the modern domestication of the canary many varieties have been produced even before the year 1718 a list of twentyseven varieties was published in france 846 mr bp brent the canary british finches etc pages 21 30 and in 1779 a long schedule of the desired qualities was printed by the london canary society so that methodical selection has been practised during a considerable period the greater number of the varieties differ only in colour and in the markings of their plumage some breeds however differ in shape such as the hooped or bowed canaries and the belgian canaries with their much elongated bodies mr brent 847 cottage gardener december 11 1855 page 184 an account is here given of all the varieties for many measurements of the wild birds see mr e vernon harcourt ibid december 25 1855 page 223 measured one of the latter and found it eight inches in length whilst the wild canary is only five and a quarter inches long there are topknotted canaries and it is a singular fact that if two top knotted birds are matched the young instead of having very fine top knots are generally bald or even have a wound on their heads 848 bechstein naturgesch der stubenvogel 1840 s 243 see s 252 on the inherited song of canarybirds with respect to their baldness see also w kidd treatise on songbirds it would appear as if the topknot were due to some morbid condition which is increased to an injurious degree when two birds in this state are paired there is a featherfooted breed and another with a kind of frill running down the breast one other character deserves notice from being confined to one period of life and from being strictly inherited at the same period namely the wing and tail feathers in prize canaries being black but this colour is retained only until the first moult once moulted the peculiarity ceases 849 w kidd treatise on songbirds page 18 canaries differ much in disposition and character and in some small degree in song they produce eggs three or four times during the year  goldfish  besides mammals and birds only a few animals belonging to the other great classes have been domesticated but to show that it is an almost universal law that animals when removed from their natural conditions of life vary and that races can be formed when selection is applied it is necessary to say a few words on goldfish bees and silkmoths  goldfish cyprinus auratus were introduced into europe only two or three centuries ago but they have been kept in confinement from an ancient period in china mr blyth 850 the indian field 1858 page 255 suspects from the analogous variation of other fishes that golden coloured fish do not occur in a state of nature these fishes frequently live under the most unnatural conditions and their variability in colour size and in some important points of structure is very great m sauvigny has described and given coloured drawings of no less than eightynine varieties 851 yarrell british fishes volume 1 page 319 many of the varieties however such as triple tailfins etc ought to be called monstrosities but it is difficult to draw any distinct line between a variation and a monstrosity as goldfish are kept for ornament or curiosity and as the chinese are just the people to have secluded a chance variety of any kind and to have matched and paired from it 852 mr blyth in the indian field 1858 page 255 it might have been predicted that selection would have been largely practised in the formation of new breeds and this is the case in an old chinese work it is said that fish with vermilion scales were first raised in confinement during the sung dynasty which commenced ad 960 and now they are cultivated in families everywhere for the sake of ornament in another and more ancient work it is said that there is not a household where the goldfish is not cultivated in rivalry as to its colour and as a source of profit etc 853 wf mayers chinese notes and queries august 1868 page 123 although many breeds exist it is a singular fact that the variations are often not inherited sir r heron 854 proc zoolog soc may 25 1842 kept many of these fishes and placed all the deformed ones namely those destitute of dorsal fins and those furnished with a double anal fin or triple tail in a pond by themselves but they did not produce a greater proportion of deformed offspring than the perfect fishes  passing over an almost infinite diversity of colour we meet with the most extraordinary modifications of structure thus out of about two dozen specimens bought in london mr yarrell observed some with the dorsal fin extending along more than half the length of the back others with this fin reduced to only five or six rays and one with no dorsal fin the anal fins are sometimes double and the tail is often triple this latter deviation of structure seems generally to occur at the expense of the whole or part of some other fin 855 yarrell british fishes volume 1 page 319 but bory de saintvincent 856 dict class dhist nat tome 5 page 276 saw at madrid goldfish furnished with a dorsal fin and a triple tail one variety is characterised by a hump on its back near the head and the rev l jenyns blomefield 857 observations in nat hist 1846 page 211 dr gray has described in annals and mag of nat hist 1860 page 151 a nearly similar variety but destitute of a dorsal fin has described a most singular variety imported from china almost globular in form like a diodon with the fleshy part of the tail as if entirely cut away the caudal fin being set on a little behind the dorsal and immediately above the anal in this fish the anal and caudal fins were double the anal fin being attached to the body in a vertical line the eyes also were enormously large and protuberant  hivebees  bees have been domesticated from an ancient period if indeed their state can be considered one of domestication for they search for their own food with the exception of a little generally given to them during the winter their habitation is a hive instead of a hole in a tree bees however have been transported into almost every quarter of the world so that climate ought to have produced whatever direct effect it is capable of producing it is frequently asserted that the bees in different parts of great britain differ in size colour and temper and godron 858 de lespece 1859 page 459 with respect to the bees of burgundy see m gerard art espece in dict univers dhist nat says that they are generally larger in the south than in other parts of france it has also been asserted that the little brown bees of high burgundy when transported to la bresse become large and yellow in the second generation but these statements require confirmation as far as size is concerned it is known that bees produced in very old combs are smaller owing to the cells having become smaller from the successive old cocoons the best authorities 859 see a discussion on this subject in answer to a question of mine in journal of horticulture 1862 pages 225242 also mr bevan fox in ditto 1862 page 284 concur that with the exception of the ligurian race or species presently to be mentioned distinct breeds do not exist in britain or on the continent there is however even in the same stock some variability in colour thus mr woodbury states 860 this excellent observer may be implicitly trusted see journal of horticulture july 14 1863 page 39 that he has several times seen queen bees of the common kind annulated with yellowlike ligurian queens and the latter darkcoloured like common bees he has also observed variations in the colour of the drones without any corresponding difference in the queens or workers of the same hive the great apiarian dzierzon in answer to my queries on this subject says 861 journal of horticulture september 9 1862 page 463 see also herr kleine on same subject november 11 page 643 who sums up that though there is some variability in colour no constant or perceptible differences can be detected in the bees of germany that in germany bees of some stocks are decidedly dark whilst others are remarkable for their yellow colour bees also seem to differ in habits in different districts for dzierzon adds if many stocks with their offspring are more inclined to swarm whilst others are richer in honey so that some beekeepers even distinguish between swarming and honeygathering bees this is a habit which has become second nature caused by the customary mode of keeping the bees and the pasturage of the district for example what a difference in this respect one may perceive to exist between the bees of the luneburg heath and those of this countryremoving an old queen and substituting a young one of the current year is here an infallible mode of keeping the strongest stock from swarming and preventing dronebreeding whilst the same means if adopted in hanover would certainly be of no avail i procured a hive full of dead bees from jamaica where they have long been naturalised and on carefully comparing them under the microscope with my own bees i could detect not a trace of difference  this remarkable uniformity in the hivebee wherever kept may probably be accounted for by the great difficulty or rather impossibility of bringing selection into play by pairing particular queens and drones for these insects unite only during flight nor is there any record with a single partial exception of any person having separated and bred from a hive in which the workers presented some appreciable difference in order to form a new breed seclusion from other bees would as we now know be indispensable for since the introduction of the ligurian bee into germany and england it has been found that the drones wander at least two miles from their own hives and often cross with the queens of the common bee 862 mr woodbury has published several such accounts in journal of horticulture 1861 and 1862 the ligurian bee although perfectly fertile when crossed with the common kind is ranked by most naturalists as a distinct species whilst by others it is ranked as a variety but this form need not here be noticed as there is no reason to believe that it is the product of domestication the egyptian and some other bees are likewise ranked by dr gerstacker 863 annals and mag of nat hist 3rd series volume 11 page 339 but not by other highly competent judges as geographical races he grounds his conclusion in chief part on the fact that in certain districts as in the crimea and rhodes they vary so much in colour that the several geographical races can be closely connected by intermediate forms  i have alluded to a single instance of the separation and preservation of a particular stock of bees mr lowe 864 the cottage gardener may 1860 page 110 and ditto in journal of hort 1862 page 242 procured some bees from a cottager a few miles from edinburgh and perceived that they differed from the common bee in the hairs on the head and thorax being lighter coloured and more profuse in quantity from the date of the introduction of the ligurian bee into great britain we may feel sure that these bees had not been crossed with this form mr lowe propagated this variety but unfortunately did not separate the stock from his other bees and after three generations the new character was almost completely lost nevertheless as he adds a great number of the bees still retain traces though faint of the original colony this case shows us what could probably be effected by careful and longcontinued selection applied exclusively to the workers for as we have seen queens and drones cannot be selected and paired  silkmoths  these insects are in several respects interesting to us more especially because they have varied largely at an early period of life and the variations have been inherited at corresponding periods as the value of the silkmoth depends entirely on the cocoon every change in its structure and qualities has been carefully attended to and races differing much in the cocoon but hardly at all in the adult state have been produced with the races of most other domestic animals the young resemble each other closely whilst the adults differ much  it would be useless even if it were possible to describe all the many kinds of silkworms several distinct species exist in india and china which produce useful silk and some of these are capable of freely crossing with the common silkmoth as has been recently ascertained in france captain hutton 865 transact entomolog soc 3rd series volume 3 pages 143173 and pages 295331 states that throughout the world at least six species have been domesticated and he believes that the silkmoths reared in europe belong to two or three species this however is not the opinion of several capable judges who have particularly attended to the cultivation of this insect in france and hardly accords with some facts presently to be given  the common silkmoth bombyx mori was brought to constantinople in the sixth century whence it was carried into italy and in 1494 into france 866 godron de lespece 1859 tome 1 page 460 the antiquity of the silkworm in china is given on the authority of stanislas julien everything has been favourable for the variation of this insect it is believed to have been domesticated in china as long ago as 2700 bc it has been kept under unnatural and diversified conditions of life and has been transported into many countries there is reason to believe that the nature of the food given to the caterpillar influences to a certain extent the character of the breed 867 see the remarks of prof westwood gen hearsey and others at the meeting of the entomolog soc of london july 1861 disuse has apparently aided in checking the development of the wings but the most important element in the production of the many now existing much modified races no doubt has been the close attention which has long been applied in many countries to every promising variation the care taken in europe in the selection of the best cocoons and moths for breeding is notorious 868 see for instance m a de quatrefages etudes sur les maladies actuelles du ver a soie 1859 page 101 and the production of eggs is followed as a distinct trade in parts of france i have made inquiries through dr falconer and am assured that in india the natives are equally careful in the process of selection in china the production of eggs is confined to certain favourable districts and the raisers are precluded by law from producing silk so that their whole attention may be necessarily given up to this one object 869 my authorities for the statements will be given in the chapter on selection  the following details on the differences between the several breeds are taken when not stated to the contrary from m robinets excellent work 870 manuel de leducateur de vers a soie 1848 which bears every sign of care and large experience the eggs in the different races vary in colour in shape being round elliptic or oval and in size the eggs laid in june in the south of france and in july in the central provinces do not hatch until the following spring and it is in vain says m robinet to expose them to a temperature gradually raised in order that the caterpillar may be quickly developed yet occasionally without any known cause batches of eggs are produced which immediately begin to undergo the proper changes and are hatched in from twenty to thirty days from these and some other analogous facts it may be concluded that the trevoltini silkworms of italy of which the caterpillars are hatched in from fifteen to twenty days do not necessarily form as has been maintained a distinct species although the breeds which live in temperate countries produce eggs which cannot be immediately hatched by artificial heat yet when they are removed to and reared in a hot country they gradually acquire the character of quick development as in the trevoltini races 871 robinet ibid pages 12 318 i may add that the eggs of n american silkworms taken to the sandwich islands produced moths at very irregular periods and the moths thus raised yielded eggs which were even worse in this respect some were hatched in ten days and others not until after the lapse of many months no doubt a regular early character would ultimately have been acquired see review in athenaeum 1844 page 329 of j jarves scenes in the sandwich islands  caterpillars  these vary greatly in size and colour the skin is generally white sometimes mottled with black or grey and occasionally quite black the colour however as m robinet asserts is not constant even in perfectly pure breeds except in the race tigree so called from being marked with transverse black stripes as the general colour of the caterpillar is not correlated with that of the silk 872 the art of rearing silkworms translated from count dandolo 1825 page 23 this character is disregarded by cultivators and has not been fixed by selection captain hutton in the paper before referred to has argued with much force that the dark tiger like marks which so frequently appear during the later moults in the caterpillars of various breeds are due to reversion for the caterpillars of several allied wild species of bombyx are marked and coloured in this manner he separated some caterpillars with the tigerlike marks and in the succeeding spring pages 149 298 nearly all the caterpillars reared from them were darkbrindled and the tints became still darker in the third generation the moths reared from these caterpillars 873 transact ent soc ut supra pages 153 308 also became darker and resembled in colouring the wild b huttoni on this view of the tigerlike marks being due to reversion the persistency with which they are transmitted is intelligible  several years ago mrs whitby took great pains in breeding silkworms on a large scale and she informed me that some of her caterpillars had dark eyebrows this is probably the first step in reversion towards the tiger like marks and i was curious to know whether so trifling a character would be inherited at my request she separated in 1848 twenty of these caterpillars and having kept the moths separate bred from them of the many caterpillars thus reared every one without exception had eyebrows some darker and more decidedly marked than the others but all had eyebrows more or less plainly visible black caterpillars occasionally appear amongst those of the common kind but in so variable a manner that according to m robinet the same race will one year exclusively produce white caterpillars and the next year many black ones nevertheless i have been informed by m a bossi of geneva that if these black caterpillars are separately bred from they reproduce the same colour but the cocoons and moths reared from them do not present any difference  the caterpillar in europe ordinarily moults four times before passing into the cocoon stage but there are races a trois mues and the trevoltini race likewise moults only thrice it might have been thought that so important a physiological difference would not have arisen under domestication but m robinet 874 robinet ibid page 317 states that on the one hand ordinary caterpillars occasionally spin their cocoons after only three moults and on the other hand presque toutes les races a trois mues que nous avons experimentees ont fait quatre mues a la seconde ou a la troisieme annee ce qui semble prouver quil a suffi de les placer dans des conditions favorables pour leur rendre une faculte quelles avaient perdue sous des influences moins favorables  cocoons  the caterpillar in changing into the cocoon loses about 50 per cent of its weight but the amount of loss differs in different breeds and this is of importance to the cultivator the cocoon in the different races presents characteristic differences being large or smallnearly spherical with no constriction as in the race de loriol or cylindrical with either a deep or slight constriction in the middle with the two ends or with one end alone more or less pointed the silk varies in fineness and quality and in being nearly white but of two tints or yellow generally the colour of the silk is not strictly inherited but in the chapter on selection i shall give a curious account how in the course of sixtyfive generations the number of yellow cocoons in one breed has been reduced in france from one hundred to thirtyfive in the thousand according to robinet the white race called sina by careful selection during the last seventyfive years est arrivee a un tel etat de purete quon ne voit pas un seul cocon jaune dans des millions de cocons blancs 875 robinet ibid pages 306317 cocoons are sometimes formed as is well known entirely destitute of silk which yet produce moths unfortunately mrs whitby was prevented by an accident from ascertaining whether this character would prove hereditary  adult stage  i can find no account of any constant difference in the moths of the most distinct races mrs whitby assured me that there was none in the several kinds bred by her and i have received a similar statement from the eminent naturalist m de quatrefages captain hutton also says 876 transact ent soc ut supra page 317 that the moths of all kinds vary much in colour but in nearly the same inconstant manner considering how much the cocoons in the several races differ this fact is of interest and may probably be accounted for on the same principle as the fluctuating variability of colour in the caterpillar namely that there has been no motive for selecting and perpetuating any particular variation  the males of the wild bombycidae fly swiftly in the daytime and evening but the females are usually very sluggish and inactive 877 stephens illustrations haustellata volume 2 page 35 see also capt hutton transact ent soc ibid page 152 in several moths of this family the females have abortive wings but no instance is known of the males being incapable of flight for in this case the species could hardly have been perpetuated in the silkmoth both sexes have imperfect crumpled wings and are incapable of flight but still there is a trace of the characteristic difference in the two sexes for though on comparing a number of males and females i could detect no difference in the development of their wings yet i was assured by mrs whitby that the males of the moths bred by her used their wings more than the females and could flutter downwards though never upwards she also states that when the females first emerge from the cocoon their wings are less expanded than those of the male the degree of imperfection however in the wings varies much in different races and under different circumstances m quatrefages 878 etudes sur les maladies du ver a soie 1859 pages 304 209 says that he has seen a number of moths with their wings reduced to a third fourth or tenth part of their normal dimensions and even to mere short straight stumps il me semble quil y a la un veritable arret de developpement partiel on the other hand he describes the female moths of the andre jean breed as having leurs ailes larges et etalees un seul presente quelques courbures irregulieres et des plis anormaux as moths and butterflies of all kinds reared from wild caterpillars under confinement often have crippled wings the same cause whatever it may be has probably acted on silkmoths but the disuse of their wings during so many generations has it may be suspected likewise come into play  the moths of many breeds fail to glue their eggs to the surface on which they are laid 879 quatrefages etudes etc page 214 but this proceeds according to capt hutton 880 transact ent soc ut supra page 151 merely from the glands of the ovipositor being weakened  as with other longdomesticated animals the instincts of the silkmoth have suffered the caterpillars when placed on a mulberrytree often commit the strange mistake of devouring the base of the leaf on which they are feeding and consequently fall down but they are capable according to m robinet 881 manuel de leducateur etc page 26 of again crawling up the trunk even this capacity sometimes fails for m martins 882 godron de lespece page 462 placed some caterpillars on a tree and those which fell were not able to remount and perished of hunger they were even incapable of passing from leaf to leaf  some of the modifications which the silkmoth has undergone stand in correlation with one another thus the eggs of the moths which produce white cocoons and of those which produce yellow cocoons differ slightly in tint the abdominal feet also of the caterpillars which yield white cocoons are always white whilst those which give yellow cocoons are invariably yellow 883 quatrefages etudes etc pages 12 209 214 we have seen that the caterpillars with dark tigerlike stripes produce moths which are more darkly shaded than other moths it seems well established 884 robinet manuel etc page 303 that in france the caterpillars of the races which produce white silk and certain black caterpillars have resisted better than other races the disease which has recently devastated the silkdistricts lastly the races differ constitutionally for some do not succeed so well under a temperate climate as others and a damp soil does not equally injure all the races 885 robinet ibid page 15  from these various facts we learn that silkmoths like the higher animals vary greatly under longcontinued domestication we learn also the more important fact that variations may occur at various periods of life and be inherited at a corresponding period and finally we see that insects are

have generally neglected cultivated varieties as beneath their notice in several cases the wild prototype is unknown or doubtfully known and in other cases it is hardly possible to distinguish between escaped seedlings and truly wild plants so that there is no safe standard of comparison by which to judge of any supposed amount of change not a few botanists believe that several of our anciently cultivated plants have become so profoundly modified that it is not possible now to recognise their aboriginal parentforms equally perplexing are the doubts whether some of them are descended from one species or from several inextricably commingled by crossing and variation variations often pass into and cannot be distinguished from monstrosities and monstrosities are of little significance for our purpose many varieties are propagated solely by grafts buds layers bulbs etc and frequently it is not known how far their peculiarities can be transmitted by seminal generation nevertheless some facts of value can be gleaned and other facts will hereafter be incidentally given one chief object in the two following chapters is to show how many characters in our cultivated plants have become variable  before entering on details a few general remarks on the origin of cultivated plants may be introduced m alph de candolle 91 geographie botanique raisonnee 1855 pages 810 to 991 in an admirable discussion on this subject in which he displays a wonderful amount of knowledge gives a list of 157 of the most useful cultivated plants of these he believes that 85 are almost certainly known in their wild state but on this head other competent judges 92 review by mr bentham in hort journal volume 9 1855 page 133 entitled historical notes on cultivated plants by dr a targionitozzetti see also edinburgh review 1866 page 510 entertain great doubts of 40 of them the origin is admitted by m de candolle to be doubtful either from a certain amount of dissimilarity which they present when compared with their nearest allies in a wild state or from the probability of the latter not being truly wild plants but seedlings escaped from culture of the entire 157 32 alone are ranked by m de candolle as quite unknown in their aboriginal condition but it should be observed that he does not include in his list several plants which present illdefined characters namely the various forms of pumpkins millet sorghum kidneybean dolichos capsicum and indigo nor does he include flowers and several of the more anciently cultivated flowers such as certain roses the common imperial lily the tuberose and even the lilac are said 93 hist notes as above by targionitozzetti not to be known in the wild state  from the relative numbers above given and from other arguments of much weight m de candolle concludes that plants have rarely been so much modified by culture that they cannot be identified with their wild prototypes but on this view considering that savages probably would not have chosen rare plants for cultivation that useful plants are generally conspicuous and that they could not have been the inhabitants of deserts or of remote and recently discovered islands it appears strange to me that so many of our cultivated plants should be still unknown or only doubtfully known in the wild state if on the other hand many of these plants have been profoundly modified by culture the difficulty disappears the difficulty would also be removed if they have been exterminated during the progress of civilisation but m de candolle has shown that this probably has seldom occurred as soon as a plant was cultivated in any country the halfcivilised inhabitants would no longer have need to search the whole surface of the land for it and thus lead to its extirpation and even if this did occur during a famine dormant seeds would be left in the ground in tropical countries the wild luxuriance of nature as was long ago remarked by humboldt overpowers the feeble efforts of man in anciently civilised temperate countries where the whole face of the land has been greatly changed it can hardly be doubted that some plants have become extinct nevertheless de candolle has shown that all the plants historically known to have been first cultivated in europe still exist here in the wild state  mm loiseleurdeslongchamps 94 considerations sur les cereales 1842 page 37 geographie bot 1855 page 930 plus on suppose lagriculture ancienne et remontant a une epoque dignorance plus il est probable que les cultivateurs avaient choisi des especes offrant a lorigine meme un avantage incontestable and de candolle have remarked that our cultivated plants more especially the cereals must originally have existed in nearly their present state for otherwise they would not have been noticed and valued as objects of food but these authors apparently have not considered the many accounts given by travellers of the wretched food collected by savages i have read an account of the savages of australia cooking during a dearth many vegetables in various ways in the hopes of rendering them innocuous and more nutritious dr hooker found the halfstarved inhabitants of a village in sikhim suffering greatly from having eaten arumroots 95 dr hooker has given me this information see also his himalayan journals 1854 volume 2 page 49 which they had pounded and left for several days to ferment so as partially to destroy their poisonous nature and he adds that they cooked and ate many other deleterious plants sir andrew smith informs me that in south africa a large number of fruits and succulent leaves and especially roots are used in times of scarcity the natives indeed know the properties of a long catalogue of plants some having been found during famines to be eatable others injurious to health or even destructive to life he met a party of baquanas who having been expelled by the conquering zulus had lived for years on any roots or leaves which afforded some little nutriment and distended their stomachs so as to relieve the pangs of hunger they looked like walking skeletons and suffered fearfully from constipation sir andrew smith also informs me that on such occasions the natives observe as a guide for themselves what the wild animals especially baboons and monkeys eat  from innumerable experiments made through dire necessity by the savages of every land with the results handed down by tradition the nutritious stimulating and medicinal properties of the most unpromising plants were probably first discovered it appears for instance at first an inexplicable fact that untutored man in three distant quarters of the world should have discovered amongst a host of native plants that the leaves of the teaplant and mattee and the berries of the coffee all included a stimulating and nutritious essence now known to be chemically the same we can also see that savages suffering from severe constipation would naturally observe whether any of the roots which they devoured acted as aperients we probably owe our knowledge of the uses of almost all plants to man having originally existed in a barbarous state and having been often compelled by severe want to try as food almost everything which he could chew and swallow  from what we know of the habits of savages in many quarters of the world there is no reason to suppose that our cereal plants originally existed in their present state so valuable to man let us look to one continent alone namely africa barth 96 travels in central africa english translation volume 1 pages 529 and 390 volume 2 pages 29 265 270 livingstone travels page 551 states that the slaves over a large part of the central region regularly collect the seeds of a wild grass the pennisetum distichum in another district he saw women collecting the seeds of a poa by swinging a sort of basket through the rich meadowland near tete livingstone observed the natives collecting the seeds of a wild grass and farther south as andersson informs me the natives largely use the seed of a grass of about the size of canaryseed which they boil in water they eat also the roots of certain reeds and every one has read of the bushmen prowling about and digging up with a firehardened stake various roots similar facts with respect to the collection of seeds of wild grasses in other parts of the world could be given 97 for instance in both north and south america mr edgeworth journal proc linn soc vol 6 bot 1862 page 181 states that in the deserts of the punjab poor women sweep up by a whisk into straw baskets the seeds of four genera of grasses namely of agrostis panicum cenchrus and pennisetum as well as the seeds of four other genera belonging to distinct families  accustomed as we are to our excellent vegetables and luscious fruits we can hardly persuade ourselves that the stringy roots of the wild carrot and parsnip or the little shoots of the wild asparagus or crabs sloes etc should ever have been valued yet from what we know of the habits of australian and south african savages we need feel no doubt on this head the inhabitants of switzerland during the stoneperiod largely collected wild crabs sloes bullaces hips of roses elderberries beechmast and other wild berries and fruit 98 prof o heer die pflanzen der pfahlbauten 1866 aus dem neujahr naturforsch geselschaft 1866 and dr h christ in rutimeyers die fauna der pfahlbauten 1861 s 226 jemmy button a fuegian on board the beagle remarked to me that the poor and acid blackcurrants of tierra del fuego were too sweet for his taste  the savage inhabitants of each land having found out by many and hard trials what plants were useful or could be rendered useful by various cooking processes would after a time take the first step in cultivation by planting them near their usual abodes livingstone 99 travels page 535 du chaillu adventures in equatorial africa 1861 page 445 states that the savage batokas sometimes left wild fruittrees standing in their gardens and occasionally even planted them a practice seen nowhere else amongst the natives but du chaillu saw a palm and some other wild fruit trees which had been planted and these trees were considered private property the next step in cultivation and this would require but little forethought would be to sow the seeds of useful plants and as the soil near the hovels of the natives 910 in tierra del fuego the spot where wigwams had formerly stood could be distinguished at a great distance by the bright green tint of the native vegetation would often be in some degree manured improved varieties would sooner or later arise or a wild and unusually good variety of a native plant might attract the attention of some wise old savage and he would transplant it or sow its seed that superior varieties of wild fruittrees occasionally are found is certain as in the case of the american species of hawthorns plums cherries grapes and hickories specified by professor asa gray 911 american acad of arts and sciences april 10th 1860 page 413 downing the fruits of america 1845 page 261 downing also refers to certain wild varieties of the hickory as being of much larger size and finer flavour than the common species i have referred to american fruittrees because we are not in this case troubled with doubts whether or not the varieties are seedlings which have escaped from cultivation transplanting any superior variety or sowing its seeds hardly implies more forethought than might be expected at an early and rude period of civilisation even the australian barbarians have a law that no plant bearing seeds is to be dug up after it has flowered and sir g grey 912 journals of expeditions in australia 1841 volume 2 page 292 never saw this law evidently framed for the preservation of the plant violated we see the same spirit in the superstitious belief of the fuegians that killing waterfowl whilst very young will be followed by much rain snow blow much 913 darwin journal of researches 1845 page 215 i may add as showing forethought in the lowest barbarians that the fuegians when they find a stranded whale bury large portions in the sand and during the oftenrecurrent famines travel from great distances for the remnants of the halfputrid mass  it has often been remarked 914 de candolle has tabulated the facts in the most interesting manner in his geographie bot page 986 that we do not owe a single useful plant to australia or the cape of good hope countries abounding to an unparalleled degree with endemic speciesor to new zealand or to america south of the plata and according to some authors not to america northward of mexico i do not believe that any edible or valuable plant except the canarygrass has been derived from an oceanic or uninhabited island if nearly all our useful plants natives of europe asia and south america had originally existed in their present condition the complete absence of similarly useful plants in the great countries just named would be indeed a surprising fact but if these plants have been so greatly modified and improved by culture as no longer closely to resemble any natural species we can understand why the abovenamed countries have given us no useful plants for they were either inhabited by men who did not cultivate the ground at all as in australia and the cape of good hope or who cultivated it very imperfectly as in some parts of america these countries do yield plants which are useful to savage man and dr hooker 915 flora of australia introduction page 110 enumerates no less than 107 such species in australia alone but these plants have not been improved and consequently cannot compete with those which have been cultivated and improved during thousands of years in the civilised world  the case of new zealand to which fine island we as yet owe no widely cultivated plant may seem opposed to this view for when first discovered the natives cultivated several plants but all inquirers believe in accordance with the traditions of the natives that the early polynesian colonists brought with them seeds and roots as well as the dog which had been wisely preserved during their long voyage the polynesians are so frequently lost on the ocean that this degree of prudence would occur to any wandering party hence the early colonists of new zealand like the later european colonists would not have had any strong inducement to cultivate the aboriginal plants according to de candolle we owe thirty three useful plants to mexico peru and chile nor is this surprising when we remember the civilised state of the inhabitants as shown by the fact of their having practised artificial irrigation and made tunnels through hard rocks without the use of iron or gunpowder and who as we shall see in a future chapter fully recognised as far as animals were concerned and therefore probably in the case of plants the important principle of selection we owe some plants to brazil and the early voyagers namely vespucius and cabral describe the country as thickly peopled and cultivated in north america 916 for canada see j cartiers voyage in 1534 for florida see narvaez and ferdinand de sotos voyages as i have consulted these and other old voyages in more than one general collection of voyages i do not give precise references to the pages see also for several references asa gray in the american journal of science volume 24 november 1857 page 441 for the traditions of the natives of new zealand see crawfurd grammar and dict of the malay language 1852 page 260 the natives cultivated maize pumpkins gourds beans and peas all different from ours and tobacco and we are hardly justified in assuming that none of our present plants are descended from these north american forms had north america been civilised for as long a period and as thickly peopled as asia or europe it is probable that the native vines walnuts mulberries crabs and plums would have given rise after a long course of cultivation to a multitude of varieties some extremely different from their parentstocks and escaped seedlings would have caused in the new as in the old world much perplexity with respect to their specific distinctness and parentage 917 see for example mr hewett c watsons remarks on our wild plums and cherries and crabs cybele britannica volume 1 pages 330 334 etc van mons in his arbres fruitiers 1835 tome 1 page 444 declares that he has found the types of all our cultivated varieties in wild seedlings but then he looks on these seedlings as so many aboriginal stocks  cerealia  i will now enter on details the cereals cultivated in europe consist of four generawheat rye barley and oats of wheat the best modern authorities 918 see a de candolle geograph bot 1855 page 928 et seq godron de lespece 1859 tome 2 page 70 and metzger die getreidearten etc 1841 make four or five or even seven distinct species of rye one of barley three and of oats two three or four species so that altogether our cereals are ranked by different authors under from ten to fifteen distinct species these have given rise to a multitude of varieties it is a remarkable fact that botanists are not universally agreed on the aboriginal parentform of any one cereal plant for instance a high authority writes in 1855 919 mr bentham in his review entitled hist notes on cultivated plants by dr a targioni tozzetti in journal of hort soc volume 9 1855 page 133 he informs me that he still retains the same opinion we ourselves have no hesitation in stating our conviction as the result of all the most reliable evidence that none of these cerealia exist or have existed truly wild in their present state but that all are cultivated varieties of species now growing in great abundance in s europe or w asia on the other hand alph de candolle 920 geograph bot page 928 the whole subject is discussed with admirable fulness and knowledge has adduced abundant evidence that common wheat triticum vulgare has been found wild in various parts of asia where it is not likely to have escaped from cultivation and there is some force in m godrons remark that supposing these plants to be escaped seedlings 921 godron de lespece tome 2 page 72 a few years ago the excellent though misinterpreted observations of m fabre led many persons to believe that wheat was a modified descendant of aegilops but m godron tome 1 page 165 has shown by careful experiments that the first step in the series viz aegilops triticoides is a hybrid between wheat and ae ovata the frequency with which these hybrids spontaneously arise and the gradual manner in which the ae triticoides becomes converted into true wheat alone leave any doubt with respect to m godrons conclusions as they have propagated themselves in a wild state for several generations their continued resemblance to cultivated wheat renders it probable that the latter has retained its aboriginal character but the strong tendency to inheritance which most of the varieties of wheat evince as we shall presently see is here greatly undervalued much weight must also be attributed to a remark by professor hildebrand 922 die verbreitungsmittel der pflanzen 1873 page 129 that when the seeds or fruit of cultivated plants possess qualities disadvantageous to them as a means of distribution we may feel almost sure that they no longer retain their aboriginal condition on the other hand m de candolle insists strongly on the frequent occurrence in the austrian dominions of rye and of one kind of oats in an apparently wild condition with the exception of these two cases which however are rather doubtful and with the exception of two forms of wheat and one of barley which he believes to have been found truly wild m de candolle does not seem fully satisfied with the other reported discoveries of the parentforms of our other cereals with respect to oats according to mr buckmann 923 report to british association for 1857 page 207 the wild english avena fatua can be converted by a few years of careful cultivation and selection into forms almost identical with two very distinct cultivated races the whole subject of the origin and specific distinctness of the various cereal plants is a most difficult one but we shall perhaps be able to judge a little better after considering the amount of variation which wheat has undergone  metzger describes seven species of wheat godron refers to five and de candolle to only four it is not improbable that besides the kinds known in europe other strongly characterised forms exist in the more distant parts of the world for loiseleurdeslongchamps 924 considerations sur les cereales 184243 page 29 speaks of three new species or varieties sent to europe in 1822 from chinese mongolia which he considers as being there indigenous moorcroft 925 travels in the himalayan provinces etc 1841 volume 1 page 224 also speaks of hasora wheat in ladakh as very peculiar if those botanists are right who believe that at least seven species of wheat originally existed then the amount of variation in any important character which wheat has undergone under cultivation has been slight but if only four or a lesser number of species originally existed then it is evident that varieties have arisen so strongly marked that they have been considered by capable judges as specifically distinct but the impossibility of deciding which forms ought to be ranked as species and which as varieties makes it useless to specify in detail the differences between the various kinds of wheat speaking generally the organs of vegetation differ little 926 col j le couteur on the varieties of wheat pages 23 79 but some kinds grow close and upright whilst others spread and trail along the ground the straw differs in being more or less hollow and in quality the ears 927 loiseleurdeslongchamps consid sur les cereales page 11 differ in colour and in shape being quadrangular compressed or nearly cylindrical and the florets differ in their approximation to each other in their pubescence and in being more or less elongated the presence or absence of barbs is a conspicuous difference and in certain gramineae serves even as a generic character 928 see an excellent review in hooker journ of botany volume 8 page 82 note although as remarked by godron 929 de lespece tome 2 page 73 the presence of barbs is variable in certain wild grasses and especially in those such as bromus secalinus and lolium temulentum which habitually grow mingled with our cereal crops and which have thus unintentionally been exposed to culture the grains differ in size weight and colour in being more or less downy at one end in being smooth or wrinkled in being either nearly globular oval or elongated and finally in internal texture being tender or hard or even almost horny and in the proportion of gluten which they contain  nearly all the races or species of wheat vary as godron 930 ibid tome 2 page 75 has remarked in an exactly parallel mannerin the seed being downy or glabrous and in colourand in the florets being barbed or not barbed etc those who believe that all the kinds are descended from a single wild species may account for this parallel variation by the inheritance of a similar constitution and a consequent tendency to vary in the same manner and those who believe in the general theory of descent with modification may extend this view to the several species of wheat if such ever existed in a state of nature  although few of the varieties of wheat present any conspicuous difference their number is great dalbret cultivated during thirty years from 150 to 160 kinds and excepting in the quality of the grain they all kept true colonel le couteur possessed upwards of 150 and philippar 322 varieties 931 for dalbret and philippar see loiseleurdeslongchamps consid sur les cereales pages 45 70 le couteur on wheat pages 6 1417 as wheat is an annual we thus see how strictly many trifling differences in character are inherited through many generations colonel le couteur insists strongly on this same fact in his persevering and successful attempts to raise new varieties he found that there was only one secure mode to ensure the growth of pure sorts namely to grow them from single grains or from single ears and to follow up the plan by afterwards sowing only the produce of the most productive so as to form a stock but major hallett 932 see his essay on pedigree in wheat 1862 also paper read before the british association 1869 and other publications has gone much farther and by the continued selection of plants from the grains of the same ear during successive generations has made his pedigree in wheat and other cereals now famous in many quarters of the world the great amount of variability in the plants of the same variety is another interesting point which would never have been detected except by an eye long practised to the work thus colonel le couteur relates 933 varieties of wheat introduction page 6 marshall in his rural economy of yorkshire volume 2 page 9 remarks that in every field of corn there is as much variety as in a herd of cattle that in a field of his own wheat which he considered at least as pure as that of any of his neighbours professor la gasca found twentythree sorts and professor henslow has observed similar facts besides such individual variations forms sufficiently well marked to be valued and to become widely cultivated sometimes suddenly appear thus mr shirreff has had the good fortune to raise in his lifetime seven new varieties which are now extensively grown in many parts of britain 934 gardeners chronicle and agricult gazette 1862 page 963  as in the case of many other plants some varieties both old and new are far more constant in character than others colonel le couteur was forced to reject some of his new subvarieties which he suspected had been produced from a cross as incorrigibly sportive on the other hand major hallett 935 gardeners chronicle november 1868 page 1199 has shown how wonderfully constant some varieties are although not ancient ones and although cultivated in various countries with respect to the tendency to vary metzger 936 getreidearten 1841 s 66 91 92 116 117 gives from his own experience some interesting facts he describes three spanish subvarieties more especially one known to be constant in spain which in germany assumed their proper character only during hot summers another variety kept true only in good land but after having been cultivated for twentyfive years became more constant he mentions two other subvarieties which were at first inconstant but subsequently became apparently without any selection accustomed to their new homes and retained their proper character these facts show what small changes in the conditions of life cause variability and they further show that a variety may become habituated to new conditions one is at first inclined to conclude with loiseleurdeslongchamps that wheat cultivated in the same country is exposed to remarkably uniform conditions but manures differ seed is taken from one soil to another and what is far more important the plants are exposed as little as possible to struggle with other plants and are thus enabled to exist under diversified conditions in a state of nature each plant is confined to that particular station and kind of nutriment which it can seize from the other plants by which it is surrounded  wheat quickly assumes new habits of life the summer and winter kinds were classed by linnaeus as distinct species but m monnier 937 quoted by godron de lespece volume 2 page 74 so it is according to metzger getreidearten s 18 with summer and winter barley has proved that the difference between them is only temporary he sowed winterwheat in spring and out of one hundred plants four alone produced ripe seeds these were sown and resown and in three years plants were reared which ripened all their seed conversely nearly all the plants raised from summerwheat which was sown in autumn perished from frost but a few were saved and produced seed and in three years this summervariety was converted into a wintervariety hence it is not surprising that wheat soon becomes to a certain extent acclimatised and that seed brought from distant countries and sown in europe vegetates at first or even for a considerable period 938 loiseleurdeslongchamps cereales part 2 page 224 le couteur page 70 many other accounts could be added differently from our european varieties in canada the first settlers according to kalm 939 travels in north america 17531761 english translation volume 3 page 165 found their winters too severe for winterwheat brought from france and their summers often too short for summerwheat and they thought that their country was useless for corn crops until they procured summerwheat from the northern parts of europe which succeeded well it is notorious that the proportion of gluten differs much under different climates the weight of the grain is also quickly affected by climate loiseleurdeslongchamps 940 cereales part 2 pages 179183 sowed near paris 54 varieties obtained from the south of france and from the black sea and 52 of these yielded seed from 10 to 40 per cent heavier than the parentseed he then sent these heavier grains back to the south of france but there they immediately yielded lighter seed  all those who have closely attended to the subject insist on the close adaptation of numerous varieties of wheat to various soils and climates even within the same country thus colonel le couteur 941 on the varieties of wheat introduction page 7 see marshall rural econ of yorkshire volume 2 page 9 with respect to similar cases of adaptation in the varieties of oats see some interesting papers in the gardeners chronicle and agricult gazette 1850 pages 204 219 says it is the suitableness of each sort to each soil that will enable the farmer to pay his rent by sowing one variety where he would be unable to do so by attempting to grow another of a seemingly better sort this may be in part due to each kind becoming habituated to its conditions of life as metzger has shown certainly occurs but it is probably in main part due to innate differences between the several varieties  much has been written on the deterioration of wheat that the quality of the flour size of grain time of flowering and hardness may be modified by climate and soil seems nearly certain but that the whole body of any one subvariety ever becomes changed into another and distinct subvariety there is no reason to believe what apparently does take place according to le couteur 942 on the varieties of wheat page 59 mr shirreff and a higher authority cannot be given gardeners chronicle and agricult gazette 1862 page 963 says i have never seen grain which has either been improved or degenerated by cultivation so as to convey the change to the succeeding crop is that some one subvariety out of the many which may always be detected in the same field is more prolific than the others and gradually supplants the variety which was first sown  with respect to the natural crossing of distinct varieties the evidence is conflicting but preponderates against its frequent occurrence many authors maintain that impregnation takes place in the closed flower but i am sure from my own observation that this is not the case at least with those varieties to which i have attended but as i shall have to discuss this subject in another work it may be here passed over  in conclusion all authors admit that numerous varieties of wheat have arisen but their differences are unimportant unless indeed some of the socalled species are ranked as varieties those who believe that from four to seven wild species of triticum originally existed in nearly the same condition as at present rest their belief chiefly on the great antiquity of the several forms 943 alph de candolle geograph bot page 930  it is an important fact which we have recently learnt from the admirable researches of heer 944 pflanzen der pfahlbauten 1866 that the inhabitants of switzerland even so early as the neolithic period cultivated no less than ten cereal plants namely five kinds of wheat of which at least four are commonly looked at as distinct species three kinds of barley a panicum and a setaria if it could be shown that at the earliest dawn of agriculture five kinds of wheat and three of barley had been cultivated we should of course be compelled to look at these forms as distinct species but as heer has remarked agriculture even at the neolithic period had already made considerable progress for besides the cereals peas poppies flax and apparently apples were cultivated it may also be inferred from one variety of wheat being the so called egyptian and from what is known of the native country of the panicum and setaria as well as from the nature of the weeds which then grew mingled with the crops that the lakeinhabitants either still kept up commercial intercourse with some southern people or had originally proceeded as colonists from the south  loiseleurdeslongchamps 945 les cereales page 94 has argued that if our cereal plants have been greatly modified by cultivation the weeds which habitually grow mingled with them would have been equally modified but this argument shows how completely the principle of selection has been overlooked that such weeds have not varied or at least do not vary now in any extreme degree is the opinion of mr hc watson and professor asa gray as they inform me but who will pretend to say that they do not vary as much as the individual plants of the same subvariety of wheat we have already seen that pure varieties of wheat cultivated in the same field offer many slight variations which can be selected and separately propagated and that occasionally more strongly pronounced variations appear which as mr shirreff has proved are well worthy of extensive cultivation not until equal attention be paid to the variability and selection of weeds can the argument from their constancy under unintentional culture be of any value in accordance with the principles of selection we can understand how it is that in the several cultivated varieties of wheat the organs of vegetation differ so little for if a plant with peculiar leaves appeared it would be neglected unless the grains of corn were at the same time superior in quality or size the selection of seedcorn was strongly recommended 946 quoted by le couteur page 16 in ancient times by columella and celsus and as virgil says  ive seen the largest seeds tho viewd with care degenerate unless th industrious hand did yearly cull the largest  but whether in ancient times selection was methodically pursued we may well doubt when we hear how laborious the work has been found by le coutour and hallett although the principle of selection is so important yet the little which man has effected by incessant efforts 947 a de candolle geograph bot page 932 during thousands of years in rendering the plants more productive or the grains more nutritious than they were in the time of the old egyptians would seem to speak strongly against its efficacy but we must not forget that at each successive period the state of agriculture and the quantity of manure supplied to the land will have determined the maximum degree of productiveness for it would be impossible to cultivate a highly productive variety unless the land contained a sufficient supply of the necessary chemical elements  we now know that man was sufficiently civilised to cultivate the ground at an immensely remote period so that wheat might have been improved long ago up to that standard of excellence which was possible under the then existing state of agriculture one small class of facts supports this view of the slow and gradual improvement of our cereals in the most ancient lakehabitations of switzerland when men employed only flinttools the most extensively cultivated wheat was a peculiar kind with remarkably small ears and grains 948 o heer die pflanzen der pfahlbauten 1866 the following passage is quoted from dr christ in die fauna der pfahlbauten von dr rutimeyer 1861 s 225 whilst the grains of the modern forms are in section from seven to eight millimetres in length the larger grains from the lakehabitations are six seldom seven and the smaller ones only four the ear is thus much narrower and the spikelets stand out more horizontally than in our present forms so again with barley the most ancient and most extensively cultivated kind had small ears and the grains were smaller shorter and nearer to each other than in that now grown without the husk they were 2 12 lines long and scarcely 1 12 broad whilst those now grown have a length of three lines and almost the same in breadth 949 heer as quoted by carl vogt lectures on man english translation page 355 these smallgrained varieties of wheat and barley are believed by heer to be the parentforms of certain existing allied varieties which have supplanted their early progenitors  heer gives an interesting account of the first appearance and final disappearance of the several plants which were cultivated in greater or less abundance in switzerland during former successive periods and which generally differed more or less from our existing varieties the peculiar smalleared and smallgrained wheat already alluded to was the commonest kind during the stone period it lasted down to the helveticoroman age and then became extinct a second kind was rare at first but afterwards became more frequent a third the egyptian wheat t turgidum does not agree exactly with any existing variety and was rare during the stone period a fourth kind t dicoccum differs from all known varieties of this form a fifth kind t monococcum is known to have existed during the stone period only by the presence of a single ear a sixth kind the common t spelta was not introduced into switzerland until the bronze age of barley besides the shorteared and smallgrained kind two others were cultivated one of which was very scarce and resembled our present common h distichum during the bronze age rye and oats were introduced the oat grains being somewhat smaller than those produced by our existing varieties the poppy was largely cultivated during the stone period probably for its oil but the variety which then existed is not now known a peculiar pea with small seeds lasted from the stone to the bronze age and then became extinct whilst a peculiar bean likewise having small seeds came in at the bronze period and lasted to the time of the romans these details sound like the descriptions given by palaeontologists of the first appearance the increasing rarity and final extinction or modification of fossil species embedded in the successive stages of a geological formation  finally every one must judge for himself whether it is more probable that the several forms of wheat barley rye and oats are descended from between ten and fifteen species most of which are now either unknown or extinct or whether they are descended from between four and eight species which may have either closely resembled our present cultivated forms or have been so widely different as to escape identification in this latter case we must conclude that man cultivated the cereals at an enormously remote period and that he formerly practised some degree of selection which in itself is not improbable we may perhaps further believe that when wheat was first cultivated the ears and grains increased quickly in size in the same manner as the roots of the wild carrot and parsnip are known to increase quickly in bulk under cultivation  maize or indian corn zea mays  botanists are nearly unanimous that all the cultivated kinds belong to the same species it is undoubtedly 950 see alph de candolles long discussion in his geograph bot page 942 with respect to new england see sillimans american journal volume 44 page 99 of american origin and was grown by the aborigines throughout the continent from new england to chili its cultivation must have been extremely ancient for tschudi 951 travels in peru english translation page 177 describes two kinds now extinct or not known in peru which were taken from tombs apparently prior to the dynasty of the incas but there is even stronger evidence of antiquity for i found on the coast of peru 952 geolog observ on s america 1846 page 49 heads of maize together with eighteen species of recent seashell embedded in a beach which had been upraised at least 85 feet above the level of the sea in accordance with this ancient cultivation numerous american varieties have arisen the aboriginal form has not as yet been discovered in the wild state a peculiar kind 953 this maize is figured in bonafous magnificent work hist nat du mais 1836 p1 v bis and in the journal of hort soc volume 1 1846 page 115 where an account is given of the result of sowing the seed a young guarany indian on seeing this kind of maize told auguste st hilaire see de candolle geograph bot page 951 that it grew wild in the humid forests of his native land mr teschemacher in proc boston soc hist october 19 1842 gives an account of sowing the seed in which the grains instead of being naked are concealed by husks as much as eleven lines in length has been stated but on insufficient evidence to grow wild in brazil it is almost certain that the aboriginal form would have had its grains thus protected 954 moquintandon elements de teratologie 1841 page 126 but the seeds of the brazilian variety produce as i hear from professor asa gray and as is stated in two published accounts either common or husked maize and it is not credible that a wild species when first cultivated should vary so quickly and in so great a degree  maize has varied in an extraordinary and conspicuous manner metzger 955 die getreidearten 1841 s 208 i have modified a few of metzgers statements in accordance with those made by bonafous in his great work hist nat du mais 1836 who paid particular attention to the cultivation of this plant makes twelve races unterart with numerous subvarieties of the latter some are tolerably constant others quite inconstant the different races vary in height from 1518 feet to only 16 18 inches as in a dwarf variety described by bonafous the whole ear is variable in shape being long and narrow or short and thick or branched the ear in one variety is more than four times as long as in a dwarf kind the seeds are arranged in the ear in from six to even twenty rows or are placed irregularly the seeds are colouredwhite paleyellow orange red violet or elegantly streaked with black 956 godron de lespece tome 2 page 80 al de candolle ibid page 951 and in the same ear there are sometimes seeds of two colours in a small collection i found that a single grain of one variety nearly equalled in weight seven grains of another variety the shape of the seed varies greatly being very flat or nearly globular or oval broader than long or longer than broad without any point or produced into a sharp tooth and this tooth is sometimes recurved one variety the rugosa of bonafous and which is extensively cultivated in the united states as sweet corn has its seeds curiously wrinkled giving to the whole ear a singular appearance another variety the cymosa of bon carries its ears so crowded together that it is called mais a bouquet the seeds of some varieties contain much glucose instead of starch male flowers sometimes appear amongst the female flowers and mr j scott has lately observed the rarer case of female flowers on a true male panicle and likewise hermaphrodite flowers 957 transact bot soc of edinburgh volume 8 page 60 azara describes 958 voyages dans lamerique meridionale tome 1 page 147 a variety in paraguay the grains of which are very tender and he states that several varieties are fitted for being cooked in various ways the varieties also differ greatly in precocity and have different powers of resisting dryness and the action of violent wind 959 bonafous hist nat du mais page 31 some of the foregoing differences would certainly be considered of specific value with plants in a state of nature  le comte re states that the grains of all the varieties which he cultivated ultimately assumed a yellow colour but bonafous 960 ibid page 31 found that most of those which he sowed for ten consecutive years kept true to their proper tints and he adds that in the valleys of the pyrenees and on the plains of piedmont a white maize has been cultivated for more than a century and has undergone no change  the tall kinds grown in southern latitudes and therefore exposed to great heat require from six to seven months to ripen their seed whereas the dwarf kinds grown in northern and colder climates require only from three to four months 961 metzger getreidearten s 206 peter kalm 962 description of maize by p kalm 1752 in swedish acts volume 4 i have consulted an old english ms translation who particularly attended to this plant says that in the united states in proceeding from south to north the plants steadily diminish in bulk seeds brought from lat 37 deg in virginia and sown in lat 4344 deg in new england produce plants which will not ripen their seed or ripen them with the utmost difficulty so it is with seed carried from new england to lat 4547 deg in canada by taking great care at first the southern kinds after some years culture ripen their seed perfectly in their northern homes so that this is an analogous case with that of the conversion of summer into winter wheat and conversely when tall and dwarf maize are planted together the dwarf kinds are in full flower before the others have produced a single flower and in pennsylvania they ripen their seeds six weeks earlier than the tall maize metzger also mentions a european maize which ripens its seed four weeks earlier than another european kind with these facts so plainly showing inherited acclimatisation we may readily believe kalm who states that in north america maize and some other plants have gradually been cultivated further and further northward all writers agree that to keep the varieties of maize pure they must be planted separately so that they shall not cross  the effects of the climate of europe on the american varieties is highly remarkable metzger obtained seed from various parts of america and cultivated several kinds in germany i will give an abstract of the changes observed 963 getreidearten s 208 in one case namely with a tall kind breitkorniger mais zea altissima brought from the warmer parts of america during the first year the plants were twelve feet high and a few seeds were perfected the lower seeds in the ear kept true to their proper form but the upper seeds became slightly changed in the second generation the plants were from nine to ten feet in height and ripened their seed better the depression on the outer side of the seed had almost disappeared and the original beautiful white colour had become duskier some of the seeds had even become yellow and in their now rounded form they approached common european maize in the third generation nearly all resemblance to the original and very distinct american parentform was lost in the sixth generation this maize perfectly resembled a european variety described as the second subvariety of the fifth race when metzger published his book this variety was still cultivated near heidelberg and could be distinguished from the common kind only by a somewhat more vigorous growth analogous results were obtained by the cultivation of another american race the whitetooth corn in which the tooth nearly disappeared even in the second generation a third race the chickencorn did not undergo so great a change but the seeds became less polished and pellucid in the above cases the seeds were carried from a warm to a colder climate but fritz muller informs me that a dwarf variety with small rounded seeds papagaienmais introduced from germany into s brazil produces plants as tall with seeds as flat as those of the kind commonly cultivated there  these facts afford the most remarkable instance known to me of the direct and prompt action of climate on a plant it might have been expected that the tallness of the stem the period of vegetation and the ripening of the seed would have been thus affected but it is a much more surprising fact that the seeds should have undergone so rapid and great a change as however flowers with their product the seed are formed by the metamorphosis of the stem and leaves any modification in these latter organs would be apt to extend through correlation to the organs of fructification  cabbage brassica oleracea  every one knows how greatly the various kinds of cabbage differ in appearance in the island of jersey from the effects of particular culture and of climate a stalk has grown to the height of sixteen feet and had its spring shoots at the top occupied by a magpies nest the woody stems are not unfrequently from ten to twelve feet in height and are there used as rafters 964 cabbage timber gardeners chronicle 1856 page 744 quoted from hooker journal of botany a walkingstick made from a cabbagestalk is exhibited in the museum at kew and as walkingsticks we are thus reminded that in certain countries plants belonging to the generally herbaceous order of the cruciferae are developed into trees every one can appreciate the difference between green or red cabbages with great single heads brusselsprouts with numerous little heads broccolis and cauliflowers with the greater number of their flowers in an aborted condition incapable of producing seed and borne in a dense corymb instead of an open panicle savoys with their blistered and wrinkled leaves and borecoles and kails which come nearest to the wild parentform there are also various frizzled and laciniated kinds some of such beautiful colours that vilmorin in his catalogue of 1851 enumerates ten varieties which are valued solely for ornament some kinds are less commonly known such as the portuguese couve tronchuda with the ribs of its leaves greatly thickened and the kohlrabi or chouxraves with their stems enlarged into great turniplike masses above the ground and the recently formed new race 965 journal de la soc imp dhorticulture 1855 page 254 quoted from gartenflora april 1855 of the chouxraves already including nine sub varieties in which the enlarged part lies beneath the ground like a turnip  although we see such great differences in the shape size colour arrangement and manner of growth of the leaves and stem and of the flowerstems in the broccoli and cauliflower it is remarkable that the flowers themselves the seedpods and seeds present extremely slight differences or none at all 966 godron de lespece tome 2 page 52 metzger syst beschreibung der kult kohlarten 1833 s 6 i compared the flowers of all the principal kinds those of the couve tronchuda are white and rather smaller than in common cabbages those of the portsmouth broccoli have narrower sepals and smaller less elongated petals and in no other cabbage could any difference be detected with respect to the seedpods in the purple kohlrabi alone do they differ being a little longer and narrower than usual i made a collection of the seeds of twenty eight different kinds and most of them were undistinguishable when there was any difference it was excessively slight thus the seeds of various broccolis and cauliflowers when seen in mass are a little redder those of the early green ulm savoy are rather smaller and those of the breda kail slightly larger than usual but not larger than the seeds of the wild cabbage from the coast of wales what a contrast in the amount of difference is presented if on the one hand we compare the leaves and stems of the various kinds of cabbage with their flowers pods and seeds and on the other hand the corresponding parts in the varieties of maize and wheat the explanation is obvious the seeds alone are valued in our cereals and their variations have been selected whereas the seeds seed pods and flowers have been utterly neglected in the cabbage whilst many useful variations in their leaves and stems have been noticed and preserved from an extremely remote period for cabbages were cultivated by the old celts 967 regnier de leconomie publique des celtes 1818 page 438  it would be useless to give a classified description 968 see the elder de candolle in transact of hort soc volume 5 and metzger kohlarten etc of the numerous races subraces and varieties of the cabbage but it may be mentioned that dr lindley has lately proposed 969 gardeners chronicle 1859 page 992 a system founded on the state of development of the terminal and lateral leafbuds thus  i all the leafbuds active and open as in the wildcabbage kail etc  ii all the leafbuds active but forming heads as in brusselsprouts etc  iii terminal leafbud alone active forming a head as in common cabbages savoys etc  iv terminal leafbud alone active and open with most of the flowers abortive and succulent as in the cauliflower and broccoli  v all the leafbuds active and open with most of the flowers abortive and succulent as in the sproutingbroccoli this latter variety is a new one and bears the same relation to common broccoli as brusselsprouts do to common cabbages it suddenly appeared in a bed of common broccoli and was found faithfully to transmit its newlyacquired and remarkable characters  the principal kinds of cabbage existed at least as early as the sixteenth century 970 alph de candolle geograph bot pages 842 and 989 so that numerous modifications of structure have been inherited for a long period this fact is the more remarkable as great care must be taken to prevent the crossing of the different kinds to give proof of this i raised 233 seedlings from cabbages of different kinds which had purposely been planted near each other and of the seedlings no less than 155 were plainly deteriorated and mongrelised nor were the remaining 78 all perfectly true it may be doubted whether many permanent varieties have been formed by intentional or accidental crosses for such crossed plants are found to be very inconstant one kind however called cottagers kail has lately been produced by crossing common kail and brussel sprouts recrossed with purple broccoli 971 gardeners chronicle february 1858 page 128 and is said to be true but plants raised by me were not nearly so constant in character as any common kind of cabbage  although most of the kinds keep true if carefully preserved from crossing yet the seedbeds must be yearly examined and a few seedlings are generally found false but even in this case the force of inheritance is shown for as metzger has remarked 972 kohlarten s 22 when speaking of brusselsprouts the variations generally keep to their unter art or main race but in order that any kind may be truly propagated there must be no great change in the conditions of life thus cabbages will not form heads in hot countries and the same thing has been observed with an english variety grown during an extremely warm and damp autumn near paris 973 godron de lespece tome 2 page 52 metzger kohlarten s 22 extremely poor soil also affects the characters of certain varieties  most authors believe that all the races are descended from the wild cabbage found on the western shores of europe but alph de candolle 974 geograph bot page 840 forcibly argues on historical and other grounds that it is more probable that two or three closely allied forms generally ranked as distinct species still living in the mediterranean region are the parents now all commingled together of the various cultivated kinds in the same manner as we have often seen with domesticated animals the supposed multiple origin of the cabbage throws no light on the characteristic differences between the cultivated forms if our cabbages are the descendants of three or four distinct species every trace of any sterility which may originally have existed between them is now lost for none of the varieties can be kept distinct without scrupulous care to prevent intercrossing  the other cultivated forms of the genus brassica are descended according to the view adopted by godron and metzger 975 godron de lespece tome 2 page 54 metzger kohlarten s 10 from two species b napus and rapa but according to other botanists from three species whilst others again strongly suspect that all these forms both wild and cultivated ought to be ranked as a single species brassica napus has given rise to two large groups namely swedish turnips believed to be of hybrid origin 976 gardeners chronicle and agricult gazette 1856 page 729 see more especially ibid 1868 page 275 the writer asserts that he planted a variety of cabbage b oleracea close to turnips b rapa and raised from the crossed seedlings true swedish turnips these latter plants ought therefore to be classed with cabbages or turnips and not under b napus and colzas the seeds of which yield oil brassica rapa of koch has also given rise to two races namely common turnips and the oilgiving rape the evidence is unusually clear that these latter plants though so different in external appearance belong to the same species for the turnip has been observed by koch and godron to lose its thick roots in uncultivated soil and when rape and turnips are sown together they cross to such a degree that scarcely a single plant comes true 977 gardeners chronicle and agricult gazette 1855 page 730 metzger by culture converted the biennial or winter rape into the annual or summer rapevarieties which have been thought by some authors to be specifically distinct 978 metzger kohlarten s 51  in the production of large fleshy turniplike stems we have a case of analogous variation in three forms which are generally considered as distinct species but scarcely any modification seems so easily acquired as a succulent enlargement of the stem or rootthat is a store of nutriment laid up for the plants own future use we see this in our radishes beet and in the less generally known turniprooted celery and in the finocchio or italian variety of the common fennel mr buckman has lately proved by his interesting experiments bow quickly the roots of the wild parsnip can be enlarged as vilmorin formerly proved in the case of the carrot 979 these experiments by vilmorin have been quoted by many writers an eminent botanist prof decaisne has lately expressed doubts on the subject from his own negative results but these cannot be valued equally with positive results on the other hand m carriere has lately stated gardeners chronicle 1865 page 1154 that he took seed from a wild carrot growing far from any cultivated land and even in the first generation the roots of his seedlings differed in being spindleshaped longer softer and less fibrous than those of the wild plant from these seedlings he raised several distinct varieties  this latter plant in its cultivated state differs in scarcely any character from the wild english carrot except in general luxuriance and in the size and quality of its roots but ten varieties differing in the colour shape and quality of the root are cultivated in england and come true by seed 980 loudons encyclop of gardening page 835 hence with the carrot as in so many other cases for instance with the numerous varieties and subvarieties of the radish that part of the plant which is valued by man falsely appears alone to have varied the truth is that variations in this part alone have been selected and the seedlings inheriting a tendency to vary in the same way analogous modifications have been again and again selected until at last a great amount of change has been effected  with respect to the radish m carriere by sowing the seed of the wild raphanus raphanistrum in rich soil and by continued selection during several generations raised many varieties closely like the cultivated radish r sativus in their roots as well as the wonderful chinese variety r caudatus see journal dagriculture pratique tome 1 1869 page 159 also a separate essay origine des plantes domestiques 1869 raphanus raphanistrum and sativus have often been ranked as distinct species and owing to differences in their fruit even as distinct genera but professor hoffman bot zeitung 1872 page 482 has now shown that these differences remarkable as they are graduate away the fruit of r caudatus being intermediate by cultivating r raphanistrum during several generations ibid 1873 page 9 professor hoffman also obtained plants bearing fruits like those of r sativus  pea pisum sativum  most botanists look at the gardenpea as specifically distinct from the fieldpea p arvense the latter exists in a wild state in southern europe but the aboriginal parent of the gardenpea has been found by one collector alone as he states in the crimea 981 alph de candolle geograph bot 960 mr bentham hort journal volume 9 1855 page 141 believes that garden and field peas belong to the same species and in this respect he differs from dr targioni andrew knight crossed as i am informed by the rev a fitch the fieldpea with a wellknown garden variety the prussian pea and the cross seems to have been perfectly fertile dr alefield has recently studied 982 botanische zeitung 1860 s 204 the genus with care and after having cultivated about fifty varieties concludes that certainly they all belong to the same species it is an interesting fact already alluded to that according to o heer 983 die pflanzen der pfahlbauten 1866 s 23 the peas found in the lakehabitations of switzerland of the stone and bronze ages belong to an extinct variety with exceedingly small seeds allied to p arvense or the fieldpea the varieties of the common gardenpea are numerous and differ considerably from one another for comparison i planted at the same time fortyone english and french varieties they differed greatly in height namely from between 6 and 12 inches to 8 feet 984 a variety called the rounciva attains this height as is stated by mr gordon in transact hort soc 2nd series volume 1 1835 page 374 from which paper i have taken some factsin manner of growth and in period of maturity some differ in general aspect even while only two or three inches in height the stems of the prussian pea are much branched the tall kinds have larger leaves than the dwarf kinds but not in strict proportion to their heighthairs dwarf monmouth has very large leaves and the pois nain hatif and the moderately tall blue prussian have leaves about twothirds of the size of the tallest kind in the danecroft the leaflets are rather small and a little pointed in the queen of dwarfs rather rounded and in the queen of england broad and large in these three peas the slight differences in the shape of the leaves are accompanied by slight differences in colour in the pois geant sans parchemin which bears purple flowers the leaflets in the young plant are edged with red and in all the peas with purple flowers the stipules are marked with red  in the different varieties one two or several flowers in a small cluster are borne on the same peduncle and this is a difference which is considered of specific value in some of the leguminosae in all the varieties the flowers closely resemble each other except in colour and size they are generally white sometimes purple but the colour is inconstant even in the same variety in warners emperor which is a tall kind the flowers are nearly double the size of the pois nain hatif but hairs dwarf monmouth which has large leaves likewise has large flowers the calyx in the victoria marrow is large and in bishops long pod the sepals are rather narrow in no other kind is there any difference in the flower  the pods and seeds which with natural species afford such constant characters differ greatly in the cultivated varieties of the pea and these are the valuable and consequently the selected parts sugar peas or pois sans parchemin are remarkable from their thin pods which whilst young are cooked and eaten whole and in this group which according to mr gordon includes eleven subvarieties it is the pod which differs most thus lewiss negropodded pea has a straight broad smooth and dark purple pod with the husk not so thin as in the other kinds the pod of another variety is extremely bowed that of the pois geant is much pointed at the extremity and in the variety a grands cosses the peas are seen through the husk in so conspicuous a manner that the pod especially when dry can hardly at first be recognised as that of a pea  in the ordinary varieties the pods also differ much in sizein colour that of woodfords green marrow being brightgreen when dry instead of pale brown and that of the purplepodded pea being expressed by its name in smoothness that of danecroft being remarkably glossy whereas that of the ne plus ultra is rugged in being either nearly cylindrical or broad and flatin being pointed at the end as in thurstons reliance or much truncated as in the american dwarf in the auvergne pea the whole end of the pod is bowed upwards in the queen of the dwarfs and in scimitar peas the pod is almost elliptic in shape i here give drawings of the four most distinct pods produced by the plants cultivated by me  figure 41 pods and peas i queen of dwarfs ii american dwarf iii thurstons reliance iv pois geant sans parchemin a dan orourke pea b queen of dwarfs pea c knights tall white marrow a lewiss negro pea  in the pea itself we have every tint between almost pure white brown yellow and intense green in the varieties of the sugar peas we have these same tints together with red passing through fine purple into a dark chocolate tint these colours are either uniform or distributed in dots striae or mosslike marks they depend in some cases on the colour of the cotyledons seen through the skin and in other cases on the outer coats of the pea itself in the different varieties the pods contain according to mr gordon from eleven or twelve to only four or five peas the largest peas are nearly twice as much in diameter as the smallest and the latter are not always borne by the most dwarfed kinds peas differ much in shape being smooth and spherical smooth and oblong nearly oval in the queen of the dwarfs and nearly cubical and crumpled in many of the larger kinds  with respect to the value of the differences between the chief varieties it cannot be doubted that if one of the tall sugarpeas with purple flowers thinskinned pods of an extraordinary shape including large darkpurple peas grew wild by the side of the lowly queen of the dwarfs with white flowers greyishgreen rounded leaves scimitarlike pods containing oblong smooth palecoloured peas which became mature at a different season or by the side of one of the gigantic sorts like the champion of england with leaves of great size pointed pods and large green crumpled almost cubical peasall three kinds would be ranked as distinct species  andrew knight 985 phil tract 1799 page 196 has observed that the varieties of peas keep very true because they are not crossed by insects as far as the fact of keeping true is concerned i hear from mr masters of canterbury well known as the originator of several new kinds that certain varieties have remained constant for a considerable timefor instance knights blue dwarf which came out about the year 1820 986 gardeners magazine volume 1 1826 page 153 but the greater number of varieties have a singularly short existence thus loudon remarks 987 encyclopaedia of gardening page 823 that sorts which were highly approved in 1821 are now in 1833 nowhere to be found and on comparing the lists of 1833 with those of 1855 i find that nearly all the varieties have changed mr masters informs me that the nature of the soil causes some varieties to lose their character as with other plants certain varieties can be propagated truly whilst others show a determined tendency to vary thus two peas differing in shape one round and the other wrinkled were found by mr masters within the same pod but the plants raised from the wrinkled kind always evinced a strong tendency to produce round peas mr masters also raised from a plant of another variety four distinct subvarieties which bore blue and round white and round blue and wrinkled and white and wrinkled peas and although he sowed these four varieties separately during several successive years each kind always reproduced all four kinds mixed together  with respect to the varieties not naturally intercrossing i have ascertained that the pea which in this respect differs from some other leguminosae is perfectly fertile without the aid of insects yet i have seen humblebees whilst sucking the nectar depress the keelpetals and become so thickly dusted with pollen that it could hardly fail to be left on the stigma of the next flower which was visited nevertheless distinct varieties growing closely together rarely cross and i have reason to believe that this is due to their stigmas being prematurely fertilised in this country by pollen from the same flower the horticulturists who raise seedpeas are thus enabled to plant distinct varieties close together without any bad consequences and it is certain as i have myself found that true seed may be saved during at least several generations under these circumstances 988 see dr anderson to the same effect in the bath soc agricultural papers volume 4 page 87 mr fitch raised as he informs me one variety for twenty years and it always came true though grown close to other varieties from the analogy of kidneybeans i should have expected 989 i have published full details of experiments on this subject in the gardeners chronicle 1857 october 25 that varieties thus circumstanced would have occasionally crossed and i shall give in the eleventh chapter two cases of this having occurred as shown in a manner hereafter to be explained by the pollen of the one variety having acted directly on the seeds of the other whether many of the new varieties which incessantly appear are due to such occasional and accidental crosses i do not know nor do i know whether the short existence of almost all the numerous varieties is the result of mere change of fashion or of their having a weak constitution from being the product of longcontinued self fertilisation it may however be noticed that several of andrew knights varieties which have endured longer than most kinds were raised towards the close of the last century by artificial crosses some of them i believe were still vigorous in 1860 but now in 1865 a writer speaking 990 gardeners chronicle 1865 page 387 of knights four kinds of marrows says they have acquired a famous history but their glory has departed  with respect to beans faba vulgaris i will say but little dr alefield has given 991 bonplandia 10 1862 s 348 short diagnostic characters of forty varieties everyone who has seen a collection must have been struck with the great difference in shape thickness proportional length and breadth colour and size which beans present what a contrast between a windsor and horsebean as in the case of the pea our existing varieties were preceded during the bronze age in switzerland 992 heer die pflanzen der pfahlbauten 1866 s 22 by a peculiar and now extinct variety producing very small beans 993 mr bentham informs me that in poitou and the adjoining parts of france varieties of phaseolus vulgaris are extremely numerous and so different that they were described by savi as distinct species mr bentham believes that all are descended from an unknown eastern species although the varieties differ so greatly in stature and in their seeds there is a remarkable sameness in the neglected characters of foliage and flowers and especially in the bracteoles an insignificant character in the eyes even of botanists  potato solanum tuberosum  there is little doubt about the parentage of this plant for the cultivated varieties differ extremely little in general appearance from the wild species which can be recognised in its native land at the first glance 994 darwin journal of researches 1845 page 285 sabine in transact hort soc volume 5 page 249 the varieties cultivated in britain are numerous thus lawson 995 synopsis of the vegetable products of scotland quoted in wilsons british farming page 317 gives a description of 175 kinds i planted eighteen kinds in adjoining rows their stems and leaves differed but little and in several cases there was as great a difference between the individuals of the same variety as between the different varieties the flower varied in size and in colour between white and purple but in no other respect except that in one kind the sepals were somewhat elongated one strange variety has been described which always produces two sorts of flowers the first double and sterile the second single and fertile 996 sir g mackenzie in gardeners chronicle 1845 page 790 the fruit or berries also differ but only in a slight degree 997 putsche und vertuch versuch einer

the principle that the valuable and selected parts of all cultivated productions present the greatest amount of modification they differ much in size and shape being globular oval flattened kidneylike or cylindrical one variety from peru is described 999 gardeners chronicle 1862 page 1052 as being quite straight and at least six inches in length though no thicker than a mans finger the eyes or buds differ in form position and colour the manner in which the tubers are arranged on the socalled roots or rhizomes is different thus in the gurkenkartoffeln they form a pyramid with the apex downwards and in another variety they bury themselves deep in the ground the roots themselves run either near the surface or deep in the ground the tubers also differ in smoothness and colour being externally white red purple or almost black and internally white yellow or almost black they differ in flavour and quality being either waxy or mealy in their period of maturity and in their capacity for long preservation  as with many other plants which have been long propagated by bulbs tubers cuttings etc by which means the same individual is exposed during a length of time to diversified conditions seedling potatoes generally display innumerable slight differences several varieties even when propagated by tubers are far from constant as will be seen in the chapter on budvariation dr anderson 9100 bath society agricult papers volume 5 page 127 and recreations in agriculture volume 5 page 86 procured seed from an irish purple potato which grew far from any other kind so that it could not at least in this generation have been crossed yet the many seedlings varied in almost every possible respect so that scarcely two plants were exactly alike some of the plants which closely resembled each other above ground produced extremely dissimilar tubers and some tubers which externally could hardly be distinguished differed widely in quality when cooked even in this case of extreme variability the parentstock had some influence on the progeny for the greater number of the seedlings resembled in some degree the parent irish potato kidney potatoes must be ranked amongst the most highly cultivated and artificial races nevertheless their peculiarities can often be strictly propagated by seed a great authority mr rivers 9101 gardeners chronicle 1863 page 643 states that seedlings from

vine found by dr g planchon see nat hist review 1865 april page 224 see also the valuable works of m de saporta on the tertiary plants of france some authors however entertain much doubt about the single parentage of our cultivated varieties owing to the number of semiwild forms found in southern europe especially as described by clemente 103 godron de lespece tome 2 page 100 in a forest in spain but as the grape sows itself freely in southern europe and as several of the chief kinds transmit their characters by seed 104 see an account of m viberts experiments by alex jordan in mem de lacad de lyon tome 2 1852 page 108 whilst others are extremely variable the existence of many different escaped forms could hardly fail to occur in countries where this plant has been cultivated from the remotest antiquity that the vine varies much when propagated by seed we may infer from the largely increased number of varieties since the earlier historical records new hothouse varieties are produced almost every year for instance 105 gardeners chronicle 1864 page 488 a goldencoloured variety has been recently raised in england from a black grape without the aid of a cross van mons 106 arbres fruitiers 1836 tome 2 page 290 reared a multitude of varieties from the seed of one vine which was completely separated from all others so that there could not at least in this generation have been any crossing and the seedlings presented les analogues de toutes les sortes and differed in almost every possible character both in the fruits and foliage  the cultivated varieties are extremely numerous count odart says that he will not deny that there may exist throughout the world 700 or 800 perhaps even 1000 varieties but not a third of these have any value in the catalogue of fruit cultivated in the horticultural gardens of london published in 1842 99 varieties are enumerated wherever the grape is grown many varieties occur pallas describes 24 in the crimea and burnes mentions 10 in cabool the classification of the varieties has much perplexed writers and count odart is reduced to a geographical system but i will not enter on this subject nor on the many and great differences between the varieties i will merely specify a few curious and trifling peculiarities all taken from odarts highly esteemed work 107 odart ampelographie universelle 1849 for the sake of showing the diversified variability of this plant simon has classed grapes into two main divisions those with downy leaves and those with smooth leaves but he admits that in one variety namely the rebazo the leaves are either smooth or downy and odart page 70 states that some varieties have the nerves alone and other varieties their young leaves downy whilst the old ones are smooth the pedroximenes grape odart page 397 presents a peculiarity by which it can be at once recognised amongst a host of other varieties namely that when the fruit is nearly ripe the nerves of the leaves or even the whole surface becomes yellow the barbera dasti is well marked by several characters page 426 amongst others by some of the leaves and it is always the lowest on the branches suddenly becoming of a dark red colour several authors in classifying grapes have founded their main divisions on the berries being either round or oblong and odart admits the value of this character yet there is one variety the maccabeo page 71 which often produces small round and large oblong berries in the same bunch certain grapes called nebbiolo page 429 present a constant character sufficient for their recognition namely the slight adherence of that part of the pulp which surrounds the seeds to the rest of the berry when cut through transversely a rhenish variety is mentioned page 228 which likes a dry soil the fruit ripens well but at the moment of maturity if much rain falls the berries are apt to rot on the other hand the fruit of a swiss variety page 243 is valued for well sustaining prolonged humidity this latter variety sprouts late in the spring yet matures its fruit early other varieties page 362 have the fault of being too much excited by the april sun and in consequence suffer from frost a styrian variety page 254 has brittle footstalks so that the clusters of fruit are often blown off this variety is said to be particularly attractive to wasps and bees other varieties have tough stalks which resist the wind many other variable characters could be given but the foregoing facts are sufficient to show in how many small structural and constitutional details the vine varies during the vine disease in france certain old groups of varieties 108 m bouchardat in comptes rendus december 1 1851 quoted in gardeners chronicle 1852 page 435 see also cv riley on the manner in which some few of the varieties of the american labruscan vine escape the attacks of the phylloxera fourth annual report on the insects of missouri 1872 page 63 and fifth report 1873 page 66 have suffered far more from mildew than others thus the group of chasselas so rich in varieties did not afford a single fortunate exception certain other groups suffered much less the true old burgundy for instance was comparatively free from disease and the carminat likewise resisted the attack the american vines which belong to a distinct species entirely escaped the disease in france and we thus see that those european varieties which best resist the disease must have acquired in a slight degree the same constitutional peculiarities as the american species  white mulberry morus alba  i mention this plant because it has varied in certain characters namely in the texture and quality of the leaves fitting them to serve as food for the domesticated silkworm in a manner not observed with other plants but this has arisen simply from such variations in the mulberry having been attended to selected and rendered more or less constant m de quatrefages 109 etudes sur les maladies actuelles du ver a soie 1859 page 321 briefly describes six kinds cultivated in one valley in france of these the amourouso produces excellent leaves but is rapidly being abandoned because it produces much fruit mingled with the leaves the antofino yields deeply cut leaves of the finest quality but not in great quantity the claro is much sought for because the leaves can be easily collected lastly the roso bears strong hardy leaves produced in large quantity but with the one inconvenience that they are best adapted for the worms after their fourth moult mm jacquemetbonnefont of lyon however remark in their catalogue 1862 that two subvarieties have been confounded under the name of the roso one having leaves too thick for the caterpillars the other being valuable because the leaves can easily be gathered from the branches without the bark being torn  in india the mulberry has also given rise to many varieties the indian form is thought by many botanists to be a distinct species but as royle remarks 1010 productive resources of india page 130 so many varieties have been produced by cultivation that it is difficult to ascertain whether they all belong to one species they are as he adds nearly as numerous as those of the silkworm  the orange group  we here meet with great confusion in the specific distinction and parentage of the several kinds gallesio 1011 traite du citrus 1811 teoria della riproduzione vegetale 1816 i quote chiefly from this second work in 1839 gallesio published in folio gli agrumi dei giard bot di firenze in which he gives a curious diagram of the supposed relationship of all the forms who almost devoted his lifetime to the subject considers that there are four species namely sweet and bitter oranges lemons and citrons each of which has given rise to whole groups of varieties monsters and supposed hybrids one high authority 1012 mr bentham review of dr a targionitozzetti journal of hort soc volume 9 page 133 believes that these four reputed species are all varieties of the wild citrus medica but that the shaddock citrus decumana which is not known in a wild state is a distinct species though its distinctness is doubted by another writer of great authority on such matters namely dr buchanan hamilton alph de candolle 1013 geograph bot page 863 on the other handand there cannot be a more capable judgeadvances what he considers sufficient evidence of the orange he doubts whether the bitter and sweet kinds are specifically distinct the lemon and citron having been found wild and consequently that they are distinct he mentions two other forms cultivated in japan and java which he ranks undoubted species he speaks rather more doubtfully about the shaddock which varies much and has not been found wild and finally he considers some forms such as adams apple and the bergamotte as probably hybrids  i have briefly abstracted these opinions for the sake of showing those who have never attended to such subjects how perplexing they are it would therefore be useless for my purpose to give a sketch of the conspicuous differences between the several forms besides the everrecurrent difficulty of determining whether forms found wild are truly aboriginal or are escaped seedlings many of the forms which must be ranked as varieties transmit their characters almost perfectly by seed sweet and bitter oranges differ in no important respect except in the flavour of their fruit but gallesio 1014 teoria della riproduzione pages 5257 is most emphatic that both kinds can be propagated by seed with absolute certainty consequently in accordance with his simple rule he classes them as distinct species as he does sweet and bitter almonds the peach and nectarine etc he admits however that the softshelled pinetree produces not only softshelled but some hardshelled seedlings so that a little greater force in the power of inheritance would according to this rule raise a softshelled pinetree into the dignity of an aboriginally created species the positive assertion made by macfayden 1015 hooker bot misc volume 1 page 302 volume 2 page 111 that the pips of sweet oranges produced in jamaica according to the nature of the soil in which they are sown either sweet or bitter oranges is probably an error for m alph de candolle informs me that since the publication of his great work he has received accounts from guiana the antilles and mauritius that in these countries sweet oranges faithfully transmit their character gallesio found that the willowleafed and the little china oranges reproduced their proper leaves and fruit but the seedlings were not quite equal in merit to their parents the redfleshed orange on the other hand fails to reproduce itself gallesio also observed that the seeds of several other singular varieties all reproduced trees having a peculiar physiognomy partly resembling their parentforms i can adduce another case the myrtle leaved orange is ranked by all authors as a variety but is very distinct in general aspect in my fathers greenhouse during many years it rarely yielded any fruit but at last produced one and a tree thus raised was identical with the parentform  another and more serious difficulty in determining the rank of the several forms is that according to gallesio 1016 teoria della riproduzione page 53 they largely intercross without artificial aid thus he positively states that seeds taken from lemontrees c lemonum growing mingled with the citron c medica which is generally considered as a distinct species produced a graduated series of varieties between these two forms again an adams apple was produced from the seed of a sweet orange which grew close to lemons and citrons but such facts hardly aid us in determining whether to rank these forms as species or varieties for it is now known that undoubted species of verbascum cistus primula salix etc frequently cross in a state of nature if indeed it were proved that plants of the orange tribe raised from these crosses were even partially sterile it would be a strong argument in favour of their rank as species gallesio asserts that this is the case but he does not distinguish between sterility from hybridism and from the effects of culture and he almost destroys the force of this statement by another 1017 gallesio teoria della riproduzione page 69 namely that when he impregnated the flowers of the common orange with the pollen taken from undoubted varieties of the orange monstrous fruits were produced which included little pulp and had no seeds or imperfect seeds  in this tribe of plants we meet with instances of two highly remarkable facts in vegetable physiology gallesio 1018 ibid page 67 impregnated an orange with pollen from a lemon and the fruit borne on the mother tree had a raised stripe of peel like that of a lemon both in colour and taste but the pulp was like that of an orange and included only imperfect seeds the possibility of pollen from one variety or species directly affecting the fruit produced by another variety of species is a subject which i shall fully discuss in the following chapter  the second remarkable fact is that two supposed hybrids 1019 gallesio teoria della riproduzione pages 75 76 for their hybrid nature was not ascertained between an orange and either a lemon or citron produced on the same tree leaves flowers and fruit of both pure parentforms as well as of a mixed or crossed nature a bud taken from any one of the branches and grafted on another tree produces either one of the pure kinds or a capricious tree reproducing the three kinds whether the sweet lemon which includes within the same fruit segments of differently flavoured pulp 1020 gardeners chronicle 1841 page 613 is an analogous case i know not but to this subject i shall have to recur  i will conclude by giving from a risso 1021 annales du museum tome 20 page 188 a short account of a very singular variety of the common orange it is the citrus aurantium fructu variabili which on the young shoots produces roundedoval leaves spotted with yellow borne on petioles with heartshaped wings when these leaves fall off they are succeeded by longer and narrower leaves with undulated margins of a palegreen colour embroidered with yellow borne on footstalks without wings the fruit whilst young is pearshaped yellow longitudinally striated and sweet but as it ripens it becomes spherical of a reddishyellow and bitter  peach and nectarine amygdalus persica  the best authorities are nearly unanimous that the peach has never been found wild it was introduced from persia into europe a little before the christian era and at this period few varieties existed alph de candolle 1022 geograph bot page 882 from the fact of the peach not having spread from persia at an earlier period and from its not having pure sanscrit or hebrew names believes that it is not an aboriginal of western asia but came from the terra incognita of china the supposition however that the peach is a modified almond which acquired its present character at a comparatively late period would i presume account for these facts on the same principle that the nectarine the offspring of the peach has few native names and became known in europe at a still later period  figure 42peach and almond stones of natural size viewed edgeways 1 common english peach 2

yielded fruit quite like that of a peach suspected that the peachtree is a modified almond and in this he has been followed by various authors 1024 gardeners chronicle 1856 page 532 a writer it may be presumed dr lindley remarks on the perfect series which may be formed between the almond and the peach another high authority mr rivers who has had such wide experience strongly suspects gardeners chronicle 1863 page 27 that peaches if left to a state of nature would in the course of time retrograde into thickfleshed almonds a firstrate peach almost globular in shape formed of soft and sweet pulp surrounding a hard much furrowed and slightly flattened stone certainly differs greatly from an almond with its soft slightly furrowed much flattened and elongated stone protected by a tough greenish layer of bitter flesh mr bentham 1025 journal of hort soc volume 9 page 168 has particularly called attention to the stone of the almond being so much more flattened than that of the peach but in the several varieties of the almond the stone differs greatly in the degree to which it is compressed in size shape strength and in the depth of the furrows as may be seen in figure 42 nos 4 to 8 of such kinds as i have been able to collect with peachstones also nos 1 to 3 the degree of compression and elongation is seen to vary so that the stone of the chinese honeypeach no 3 is much more elongated and compressed than that of the no 8 smyrna almond mr rivers of sawbridgeworth to whom i am indebted for some of the specimens above figured and who has had such great horticultural experience has called my attention to several varieties which connect the almond and the peach in france there is a variety called the peachalmond which mr rivers formerly cultivated and which is correctly described in a french catalogue as being oval and swollen with the aspect of a peach including a hard stone surrounded by a fleshy covering which is sometimes eatable 1026 whether this is the same variety as one lately mentioned gardeners chronicle 1865 page 1154 by m carriere under the name of persica intermedia i know not this variety is said to be intermediate in nearly all its characters between the almond and peach it produces during successive years very different kinds of fruit a remarkable statement by m luizet has recently appeared in the revue horticole 1027 quoted in gardeners chronicle 1866 page 800 namely that a peachalmond grafted on a peach bore during 1863 and 1864 almonds alone but in 1865 bore six peaches and no almonds m carriere in commenting on this fact cites the case of a doubleflowered almond which after producing during several years almonds suddenly bore for two years in succession spherical fleshy peachlike fruits but in 1865 reverted to its former state and produced large almonds  again as i hear from mr rivers the doubleflowering chinese peaches resemble almonds in their manner of growth and in their flowers the fruit is much elongated and flattened with the flesh both bitter and sweet but not uneatable and it is said to be of better quality in china from this stage one small step leads us to such inferior peaches as are occasionally raised from seed for instance mr rivers sowed a number of peachstones imported from the united states where they are collected for raising stocks and some of the trees raised by him produced peaches which were very like almonds in appearance being small and hard with the pulp not softening till very late in the autumn van mons 1028 quoted in journal de la soc imp dhorticulture 1855 page 238 also states that he once raised from a peachstone a peach having the aspect of a wild tree with fruit like that of the almond from inferior peaches such as these just described we may pass by small transitions through clingstones of poor quality to our best and most melting kinds from this gradation from the cases of sudden variation above recorded and from the fact that the peach has not been found wild it seems to me by far the most probable view that the peach is the descendant of the almond improved and modified in a marvellous manner  one fact however is opposed to this conclusion a hybrid raised by knight from the sweet almond by the pollen of the peach produced flowers with little or no pollen yet bore fruit having been apparently fertilised by a neighbouring nectarine another hybrid from a sweet almond by the pollen of a nectarine produced during the first three years imperfect blossoms but afterwards perfect flowers with an abundance of pollen if this slight degree of sterility cannot be accounted for by the youth of the trees and this often causes lessened fertility or by the monstrous state of the flowers or by the conditions to which the trees were exposed these two cases would afford a good argument against the peach being the descendant of the almond  whether or not the peach has proceeded from the almond it has certainly given rise to nectarines or smooth peaches as they are called by the french most of the varieties both of the peach and nectarine reproduce themselves truly by seed gallesio 1029 teoria della riproduzione vegetale 1816 page 86 says he has verified this with respect to eight races of the peach mr rivers 1030 gardeners chronicle 1862 page 1195 has given some striking instances from his own experience and it is notorious that good peaches are constantly raised in north america from seed many of the american subvarieties come true or nearly true to their kind such as the whiteblossom several of the yellowfruited freestone peaches the blood clingstone the heath and the lemon clingstone on the other hand a clingstone peach has been known to give rise to a freestone 1031 mr rivers gardeners chronicle 1859 page 774 in england it has been noticed that seedlings inherit from their parents flowers of the same size and colour some characters however contrary to what might have been expected often are not inherited such as the presence and form of the glands on the leaves 1032 downing the fruits of america 1845 pages 475 489 492 494 496 see also f michaux travels in n america english translation page 228 for similar cases in france see godron de lespece tome 2 page 97 with respect to nectarines both cling and freestones are known in north america to reproduce themselves by seed 1033 brickell nat hist of n carolina page 102 and downing fruit trees page 505 in england the new white nectarine was a seedling of the old white and mr rivers 1034 gardeners chronicle 1862 page 1196 has recorded several similar cases from this strong tendency to inheritance which both peach and nectarine trees exhibitfrom certain slight constitutional differences 1035 the peach and nectarine do not succeed equally well in the some soil see lindley horticulture page 351 in their natureand from the great difference in their fruit both in appearance and flavour it is not surprising notwithstanding that the trees differ in no other respects and cannot even be distinguished as i am informed by mr rivers whilst young that they have been ranked by some authors as specifically distinct gallesio does not doubt that they are distinct even alph de candolle does not appear perfectly assured of their specific identity and an eminent botanist has quite recently 1036 godron de lespece tome 2 1859 page 97 maintained that the nectarine probably constitutes a distinct species  hence it may be worth while to give all the evidence on the origin of the nectarine the facts in themselves are curious and will hereafter have to be referred to when the important subject of budvariation is discussed it is asserted 1037 transact hort soc volume 6 page 394 that the boston nectarine was produced from a peachstone and this nectarine reproduced itself by seed 1038 downings fruit trees page 502 mr rivers states 1039 gardeners chronicle 1862 page 1195 that from stones of three distinct varieties of the peach he raised three varieties of nectarine and in one of these cases no nectarine grew near the parent peachtree in another instance mr rivers raised a nectarine from a peach and in the succeeding generation another nectarine from this nectarine 1040 journal of horticulture february 5 1866 page 102 other such instances have been communicated to me but they need not be given of the converse case namely of nectarinestones yielding peachtrees both free and clingstones we have six undoubted instances recorded by mr rivers and in two of these instances the parent nectarines had been seedlings from other nectarines 1041 mr rivers in gardeners chronicle 1859 page 774 1862 page 1195 1865 page 1059 and journal of hort 1866 page 102  with respect to the more curious case of fullgrown peachtrees suddenly producing nectarines by budvariation or sports as they are called by gardeners the evidence is superabundant there is also good evidence of the same tree producing both peaches and nectarines or halfandhalf fruit by this term i mean a fruit with the onehalf a perfect peach and the other half a perfect nectarine  peter collinson in 1741 recorded the first case of a peachtree producing a nectarine 1042 correspondence of linnaeus 1821 pages 7 8 70 and in 1766 he added two other instances in the same work the editor sir je smith describes the more remarkable case of a tree in norfolk which usually bore both perfect nectarines and perfect peaches but during two seasons some of the fruit were half and half in nature  mr salisbury in 1808 1043 transact hort soc volume 1 page 103 records six other cases of peachtrees producing nectarines three of the varieties are named viz the alberge belle chevreuse and royal george this latter tree seldom failed to produce both kinds of fruit he gives another case of a halfandhalf fruit  at radford in devonshire 1044 loudons gardeners mag 1826 volume 1 page 471 a clingstone peach purchased as the chancellor was planted in 1815 and in 1824 after having previously produced peaches alone bore on one branch twelve nectarines in 1825 the same branch yielded twentysix nectarines and in 1826 thirtysix nectarines together with eighteen peaches one of the peaches was almost as smooth on one side as a nectarine the nectarines were as dark as but smaller than the elruge  at beccles a royal

stated 1049 phytologist volume 4 page 299 to have raised in the united states a seedling peach which produced a mixed crop of both peaches and nectarines  near dorking 1050 gardeners chronicle 1856

rather smaller but well formed and quite round  the previous cases all refer to peaches suddenly producing nectarines but at carclew 1052 gardeners chronicle 1856 page 531 the unique case occurred of a nectarinetree raised twenty years before from seed and never grafted producing a fruit half peach and half nectarine subsequently bore a perfect peach  to sum up the foregoing facts we have excellent evidence of peachstones producing nectarinetrees and of nectarinestones producing peachtrees of the same tree bearing peaches and nectarinesof peachtrees suddenly producing by budvariation nectarines such nectarines reproducing nectarines by seed as well as fruit in part nectarine and in part peach and lastly of one nectarinetree first bearing halfandhalf fruit and subsequently true peaches as the peach came into existence before the nectarine it might have been expected from the law of reversion that nectarines would have given birth by budvariation or by seed to peaches oftener than peaches to nectarines but this is by no means the case  two explanations have been suggested to account for these conversions first that the parent trees have been in every case hybrids 1053 alph de candolle geograph bot page 886 between the peach and nectarine and have reverted by budvariation or by seed to one of their pure parent forms this view in itself is not very improbable for the mountaineer peach which was raised by knight from the red nutmegpeach by pollen of the violette hative nectarine 1054 thompson in loudons encyclop of gardening page 911 produces peaches but these are said sometimes to partake of the smoothness and flavour of the nectarine but let it be observed that in the previous list no less than six wellknown varieties and several unnamed varieties of the peach have once suddenly produced perfect nectarines by bud variation and it would be an extremely rash supposition that all these varieties of the peach which have been cultivated for years in many districts and which show not a vestige of a mixed parentage are nevertheless hybrids a second explanation is that the fruit of the peach has been directly affected by the pollen of the nectarine although this certainly is possible it cannot here apply for we have not a shadow of evidence that a branch which has borne fruit directly affected by foreign pollen is so profoundly modified as afterwards to produce buds which continue to yield fruit of the new and modified form now it is known that when a bud on a peachtree has once borne a nectarine the same branch has in several instances gone on during successive years producing nectarines the carclew nectarine on the other hand first produced halfandhalf fruit and subsequently pure peaches hence we may confidently accept the common view that the nectarine is a variety of the peach which may be produced either by budvariation or from seed in the following chapter many analogous cases of budvariation will he given  the varieties of the peach and the nectarine run in parallel lines in both classes the kinds differ from each other in the flesh of the fruit being white red or yellow in being clingstones or freestones in the flowers being large or small with certain other characteristic differences and in the leaves being serrated without glands or crenated and furnished with globose or reniform glands 1055 catalogue of fruit in garden of hort soc 1842 page 105 we can hardly account for this parallelism by supposing that each variety of the nectarine is descended from a corresponding variety of the peach for though our nectarines are certainly the descendants of several kinds of peaches yet a large number are the descendants of other nectarines and they vary so much when thus reproduced that we can scarcely admit the above explanation  the varieties of the peach have largely increased in number since the christian era when from two to five varieties were known 1056 dr a targionitozzetti journal hort soc volume 9 page 167 alph de candolle geograph bot page 885 and the nectarine was unknown at the present time besides many varieties said to exist in china downing describes in the united states seventynine native and imported varieties of the peach and a few years ago lindley 1057 transact hort soc volume 5 page 554 see also carriere description et class des varietes de pechers enumerated one hundred and sixtyfour varieties of the peach and nectarine grown in england i have already indicated the chief points of difference between the several varieties nectarines even when produced from distinct kinds of peaches always possess their own peculiar flavour and are smooth and small clingstone and freestone peaches which differ in the ripe flesh either firmly adhering to the stone or easily separating from it also differ in the character of the stone itself that of the freestones or melters being more deeply fissured with the sides of the fissures smoother than in clingstones in the various kinds the flowers differ not only in size but in the larger flowers the petals are differently shaped more imbricated generally red in the centre and pale towards the margin whereas in the smaller flowers the margin of the petal is usually more darkly coloured one variety has nearly white flowers the leaves are more or less serrated and are either destitute of glands or have globose or reniform glands 1058 loudons encyclop of gardening page 907 and some few peaches such as the brugnen bear on the same tree both globular and kidneyshaped glands 1059 m carriere in gardeners chronicle

trees with glandular leaves are liable to blister but not in any great degree to mildew whilst the nonglandular trees are more subject to curl to mildew and to the attacks of aphides the varieties differ in the period of their maturity in the fruit keeping well and in hardinessthe latter circumstance being especially attended to in the united states certain varieties such as the bellegarde stand forcing in hothouses better than other varieties the flatpeach of china is the most remarkable of all the varieties it is so much depressed towards the summit that the stone is here covered only by roughened skin and not by a fleshy layer 1061 transact hort soc volume 4 page 512 another chinese variety called the honeypeach is remarkable from the fruit terminating in a long sharp point its leaves are glandless and widely dentate 1062 journal of horticulture september 8 1853 page 188 the emperor of russia peach is a third singular variety having deeply doubleserrated leaves the fruit is deeply cleft with onehalf projecting considerably beyond the other it originated in america and its seedlings inherit similar leaves 1063 transact hort soc volume 6 page 412  the peach has also produced in china a small class of trees valued for ornament namely the doubleflowered of these five varieties are now known in england varying from pure white through rose to intense crimson 1064 gardeners chronicle 1857 page 216 one of these varieties called the camelliaflowered bears flowers above 2 14 inches in diameter whilst those of the fruitbearing kinds do not at most exceed 1 14 inch in diameter the flowers of the doubleflowered peaches have the singular property 1065 journal of hort soc volume 2 page 283 of frequently producing double or treble fruit finally there is good reason to believe that the peach is an almond profoundly modified but whatever its origin may have been there can be no doubt that it has yielded during the last eighteen centuries many varieties some of them strongly characterised belonging both to the nectarine and peach form  apricot prunus armeniaca  it is commonly admitted that this tree is descended from a single species now found wild in the caucasian region 1066 alph de candolle geograph bot page 879 on this view the varieties deserve notice because they illustrate differences supposed by some botanists to be of specific value in the almond and plum the best monograph on the apricot is by mr thompson 1067 transact hort soc 2nd series volume 1 1835 page 56 see also cat of fruit in garden of hort soc 3rd edition 1842 who describes seventeen varieties we have seen that peaches and nectarines vary in a strictly parallel manner and in the apricot which forms a closely allied genus we again meet with variations analogous to those of the peach as well as to those of the plum the varieties differ considerably in the shape of their leaves which are either serrated or crenated sometimes with earlike appendages at their bases and sometimes with glands on the petioles the flowers are generally alike but are small in the masculine the fruit varies much in size shape and in having the suture little pronounced or absent in the skin being smooth or downy as in the orangeapricot and in the flesh clinging to the stone as in the lastmentioned kind or in readily separating from it as in the turkey apricot in all these differences we see the closest analogy with the varieties of the peach and nectarine in the stone we have more important differences and these in the case of the plum have been esteemed of specific value in some apricots the stone is almost spherical in others much flattened being either sharp in front or blunt at both ends sometimes channelled along the back or with a sharp ridge along both margins in the moorpark and generally in the hemskirke the stone presents a singular character in being perforated with a bundle of fibres passing through the perforation from end to end the most constant and important character according to thompson is whether the kernel is bitter or sweet yet in this respect we have a graduated difference for the kernel is very bitter in shipleys apricot in the hemskirke less bitter than in some other kinds slightly bitter in the royal and sweet like a hazelnut in the breda angoumois and others in the case of the almond bitterness has been thought by some high authorities to indicate specific difference  in n america the roman apricot endures cold and unfavourable situations where no other sort except the masculine will succeed and its blossoms bear quite a severe frost without injury 1068 downing the fruits of america 1845 page 157 with respect to the alberge apricot in france see page 153 according to mr rivers 1069 gardeners chronicle

naturalised in england 1071 see an excellent discussion on this subject in hewett c watson cybele britannica volume 4 page 80 it is not at all improbable in accordance with some observations made by mr rivers 1072 gardeners chronicle 1865 page 27 that both these forms which some botanists rank as a single species may be the parents of our domesticated plums another supposed parentform the p

descended from two aboriginal stocks namely those with oblong fruit and stones pointed at both ends having narrow separate petals and upright branches and those with rounded fruit with stones blunt at both ends with rounded petals and spreading branches from what we know of the variability of the flowers in the peach and of the diversified manner of growth in our various fruittrees it is difficult to lay much weight on these latter characters with respect to the shape of the fruit we have conclusive evidence that it is extremely variable downing 1074 fruits of america pages 276 278 284 310 314 mr rivers raised gardeners chronicle 1863 page 27 from the prunepeche which bears large round red plums on stout robust shoots a seedling which bears oval smaller fruit on shoots that are so slender as to be almost pendulous gives outlines of the plums of two seedlings namely the red and imperial gages raised from the greengage and the fruit of both is more elongated than that of the greengage the latter has a very blunt broad stone whereas the stone of the imperial gage is oval and pointed at both ends these trees also differ in their manner of growth the greengage is a very short jointed slowgrowing tree of spreading and rather dwarfish habit whilst its offspring the imperial gage grows freely and rises rapidly and has long dark shoots the famous washington plum bears a globular fruit but its offspring the emerald drop is nearly as much elongated as the most elongated plum figured by downing namely mannings prune i have made a small collection of the stones of twentyfive kinds and they graduate in shape from the bluntest into the sharpest kinds as characters derived from seeds are generally of high systematic importance i have thought it worth while to give drawings of the most distinct kinds in my small collection and they may be seen to differ in a surprising manner in size outline thickness prominence of the ridges and state of surface it deserves notice that the shape of the stone is not always strictly correlated with that of the fruit thus the washington plum is spherical and depressed at the pole with a somewhat elongated stone whilst the fruit of the goliath is more elongated but the stone less so than in the washington again denyers victoria and goliath bear fruit closely resembling each other but their stones are widely different on the other hand the harvest and black margate plums are very dissimilar yet include closely similar stones  the varieties of the plum are numerous and differ greatly in size shape quality and colourbeing bright yellow green almost white blue purple or red there are some curious varieties such as the double or siamese and the stoneless plum in the latter the kernel lies in a roomy cavity surrounded only by the pulp the climate of north america appears to be singularly favourable for the production of new and good varieties downing describes no less than forty of which seven of firstrate quality have been recently introduced into england 1075 gardeners chronicle 1855 page 726 varieties occasionally arise having an innate adaptation for certain soils almost as strongly pronounced as with natural species growing on the most distinct geological formations thus in america the imperial gage differently from almost all other kinds is peculiarly fitted for dry light soils where many sorts drop their fruit whereas on rich heavy soils the fruit is often insipid 1076 downing fruit trees page 278 my father could never succeed in making the winesour yield even a moderate crop in a sandy orchard near shrewsbury whilst in some parts of the same county and in its native yorkshire it bears abundantly one of my relations also repeatedly tried in vain to grow this variety in a sandy district in staffordshire  mr rivers has given 1077 gardeners chronicle 1863 page 27 sageret in his pomologie phys page 346 enumerates five kinds which can be propagated in france by seed see also downing fruit trees of america page 305 312 etc a number of interesting facts showing how truly many varieties can be propagated by seed he sowed the stones of twenty bushels of the greengage for the sake of raising stocks and closely observed the seedlings all had the smooth shoots the prominent buds and the glossy leaves of the greengage but the greater number had smaller leaves and thorns there are two kinds of damson one the shropshire with downy shoots and the other the kentish with smooth shoots and these differ but slightly in any other respect mr rivers sowed some bushels of the kentish damson and all the seedlings had smooth shoots but in some the fruit was oval in others round or roundish and in a few the fruit was small and except in being sweet closely resembled that of the wild sloe mr rivers gives several other striking instances of inheritance thus he raised eighty thousand seedlings from the common german quetsche plum and not one could be found varying in the least in foliage or habit similar facts were observed with the petite mirabelle plum yet this latter kind as well as the quetsche is known to have yielded some wellestablished varieties but as mr rivers remarks they all belong to the same group with the mirabelle  cherries prunus cerasus avium etc  botanists believe that our cultivated cherries are descended from one two four or even more wild stocks 1078 compare alph de candolle geograph bot page 877 bentham and targionitozzetti in hort journal volume 9 page 163 godron de lespece tome 2 page 92 that there must be at least two parent species we may infer from the sterility of twenty hybrids raised by mr knight from the morello fertilised by pollen of the elton cherry for these hybrids produced in all only five cherries and one alone of these contained a seed 1079 transact hort soc volume 5 1824 page 295 mr thompson 1080 ibid second series volume 1 1835 page 248 has classified the varieties in an apparently natural method in two main groups by characters taken from the flowers fruit and leaves but some varieties which stand widely separate in this classification are quite fertile when crossed thus knights early black cherries are the product of a cross between two such kinds  mr knight states that seedling cherries are more variable than those of any other fruittree 1081  in the catalogue of the horticultural society for 1842 eighty varieties are enumerated some varieties present singular characters thus the flower of the cluster cherry includes as many as twelve pistils of which the majority abort and they are said generally to produce from two to five or six cherries aggregated together and borne on a single peduncle in the ratafia cherry several flower peduncles arise from a common peduncle upwards of an inch in length the fruit of gascoignes heart has its apex produced into a globule or drop that of the white hungarian gean has almost transparent flesh the flemish cherry is a very oddlooking fruit much flattened at the summit and base with the latter deeply furrowed and borne on a stout very short footstalk in the kentish cherry the stone adheres so firmly to the footstalk that it could be drawn out of the flesh and this renders the fruit well fitted for drying the tobaccoleaved cherry according to sageret and thompson produces gigantic leaves more than a foot and sometimes even eighteen inches in length and half a foot in breadth the weeping cherry on the other hand is valuable only as an ornament and according to downing is a charming little tree with slender weeping branches clothed with small almost myrtlelike foliage there is also a peachleaved variety  sageret describes a remarkable variety le griottier de la toussaint which bears at the same time even as late as september flowers and fruit of all degrees of maturity the fruit which is of inferior quality is borne on long very thin footstalks but the extraordinary statement is made that all the leafbearing shoots spring from old flowerbuds lastly there is an important physiological distinction between those kinds of cherries which bear fruit on young or on old wood but sageret positively asserts that a bigarreau in his garden bore fruit on wood of both ages 1082 these several statements are taken from the four following works which may i believe be trusted thompson in hort transact see above sageret pomologie phys

botanists with respect to the parentage of the apple is whether besides p malus two or three other closely allied wild forms namely p acerba and praecox or paradisiaca do not deserve to be ranked as distinct species the p praecox is supposed by some authors 1083 mr lowe states in his flora of madeira quoted in gardeners chronicle 1862 page 215 that the p malus with its nearly sessile fruit ranges farther south than the longstalked p acerba which is entirely absent in madeira the canaries and apparently in portugal this fact supports the belief that these two forms deserve to be called species but the characters separating them are of slight importance and of a kind known to vary in other cultivated fruittrees to be the parent of the dwarf paradise stock which owing to the fibrous roots not penetrating deeply into the ground is so largely used for grafting but the paradise stocks it is asserted 1084 see journ of hort tour by deputation of the caledonian hort soc 1823 page 459 cannot be propagated true by seed the common wild crab varies considerably in england but many of the varieties are believed to be escaped seedlings 1085 hc watson cybele britannica volume 1 page 334 every one knows the great difference in the manner of growth in the foliage flowers and especially in the fruit between the almost innumerable varieties of the apple the pips or seeds as i know by comparison likewise differ considerably in shape size and colour the fruit is adapted for eating or for cooking in various ways and keeps for only a few weeks or for nearly two years some few kinds have the fruit covered with a powdery secretion called bloom like that on plums and it is extremely remarkable that this occurs almost exclusively among varieties cultivated in russia 1086 loudons gardeners mag volume 6 1830 page 83 another russian apple the white astracan possesses the singular property of becoming transparent when ripe like some sorts of crabs the api etoile has five prominent ridges hence its name the api noir is nearly black the twin cluster pippin often bears fruit joined in pairs 1087 see catalogue of fruit in garden of hort soc 1842 and downing american fruit trees the trees of the several sorts differ greatly in their periods of leafing and flowering in my orchard the court pendu plat produces leaves so late that during several springs i thought that it was dead the tiffin apple scarcely bears a leaf when in full bloom the cornish crab on the other hand bears so many leaves at this period that the flowers can hardly be seen 1088 loudons gardeners magazine volume 4 1828 page 112 in some kinds the fruit ripens in mid summer in others late in the autumn these several differences in leafing flowering and fruiting are not at all necessarily correlated for as andrew knight has remarked 1089 the culture of the apple page 43 van mons makes the same remark on the pear arbres fruitiers tome 2 1836 page 414 no one can judge from the early flowering of a new seedling or from the early shedding or change of colour of the leaves whether it will mature its fruit early in the season  the varieties differ greatly in constitution it is notorious that our summers are not hot enough for the newtown pippin 1090 lindleys horticulture page 116 see also knight on the appletree in transact of hort soc volume 6 page 229 which is the glory of the orchards near new york and so it is with several varieties which we have imported from the continent on the other hand our court of wick succeeds well under the severe climate of canada the caville rouge de micoud occasionally bears two crops during the same year the burr knot is covered with small excrescences which emit roots so readily that a branch with blossombuds may be stuck in the ground and will root

valuable from their roots running near the surface one of these seedlings was remarkable from its extremely dwarfed size forming itself into a bush only a few inches in height many varieties are particularly liable to canker in certain soils but perhaps the strangest constitutional peculiarity is that the winter majetin is not attacked by the mealy bug or coccus lindley 1093 transact hort soc volume 4 page 68 for knights case see volume 6 page 547 when the coccus first appeared in this country it is said volume 2 page 163 that it was more injurious to crabstocks than to the apples grafted on them the majetin apple has been found equally free of the coccus at melbourne in australia gardeners chronicle 1871 page 1065 the wood of this tree has been there analysed and it is said but the fact seems a strange one that its ash contained over 50 per cent of lime while that of the crab exhibited not quite 23 per cent in tasmania mr wade transact new zealand institute volume 4 1871 page 431 raised seedlings of the siberian bitter sweet for stocks and he found barely one per cent of them attacked by the coccus riley shows fifth report on insects of missouri 1873 page 87 that in the united states some varieties of apples are highly attractive to the coccus and others very little so turning to a very different pest namely the caterpillar of a moth carpocapsa pomonella walsh affirms the american entomologist april 1869 page 160 that the maidenblush is entirely exempt from appleworms so it is said are some few other varieties whereas others are peculiarly subject to the attacks of this little pest states that in an orchard in norfolk infested with these insects the majetin was quite free though the stock on which it was grafted was affected knight makes a similar statement with respect to a cider apple and adds that he only once saw these insects just above the stock but that three days afterwards they entirely disappeared this apple however was raised from a cross between the golden harvey and the siberian crab and the latter i believe is considered by some authors as specifically distinct  the famous st valery apple must not be passed over the flower has a double calyx with ten divisions and fourteen styles surmounted by conspicuous oblique stigmas but is destitute of stamens or corolla the fruit is constricted round the middle and is formed of five seedcells surmounted by nine other cells 1094 mem de la soc linn de paris tome 3 1825 page 164 and seringe bulletin bot 1830 page 117 not being provided with stamens the tree requires artificial fertilisation and the girls of st valery annually go to faire ses pommes each marking her own fruit with a ribbon and as different pollen is used the fruit differs and we here have an instance of the direct action of foreign pollen on the mother plant these monstrous apples include as we have seen fourteen seedcells the pigeonapple 1095 gardeners chronicle 1849 page 24 on the other hand has only four instead of as with all common apples five cells and this certainly is a remarkable difference  in the catalogue of apples published in 1842 by the horticultural society 897 varieties are enumerated but the differences between most of them are of comparatively little interest as they are not strictly inherited no one can raise for instance from the seed of the ribston pippin a tree of the same kind and it is said that the sister ribston pippin was a white semitransparent sourfleshed apple or rather large crab 1096 r thompson in gardeners chronicle 1850 page 788 yet it was a mistake to suppose that with most varieties the characters are not to a certain extent inherited in two lots of seedlings raised from two wellmarked kinds many worthless crablike seedlings will appear but it is now known that the two lots not only usually differ from each other but resemble to a certain extent their parents we see this indeed in the several subgroups of russetts sweetings codlins pearmains reinettes etc 1097 sageret pomologie physiologique 1830 page 263 downing fruit trees pages 130 134 139 etc loudons gardeners mag volume 8 p 317 alexis jordan de lorigine des diverses

names  pears pyrus communis  i need say little on this fruit which varies much in the wild state and to an extraordinary degree when cultivated in its fruit flowers and foliage one of the most celebrated botanists in europe m decaisne has carefully studied the many varieties 1098 comptes rendus july 6 1863 although he formerly believed that they were derived from more than one species he now thinks that all belong to one he has arrived at this conclusion from finding in the several varieties a perfect gradation between the most extreme characters so perfect is this gradation that he maintains it to be impossible to classify the varieties by any natural method m decaisne raised many seedlings from four distinct kinds and has carefully recorded the variations in each notwithstanding this extreme degree of variability it is now positively known that many kinds reproduce by seed the leading characters of their race 1099 gardeners chronicle 1856 page 804 1857 page 820 1862 page 1195  strawberries fragaria  this fruit is remarkable on account of the number of species which have been cultivated and from their rapid improvement within the last fifty or sixty years let any one compare the fruit of one of the largest varieties exhibited at our shows with that of the wild wood strawberry or which will be a fairer comparison with the somewhat larger fruit of the wild american virginian strawberry and he will see what prodigies horticulture has effected 10100 most of the largest cultivated strawberries are the descendants of f grandiflora or chiloensis and i have seen no account of these forms in their wild state methuens scarlet downing fruits page 527 has immense fruit of the largest size and belongs to the section descended from f virginiana and the fruit of this species as i hear from prof a gray is only a little larger than that of f vesca or our common woodstrawberry the number of varieties has likewise increased in a surprisingly rapid manner only three kinds were known in france in 1746 where this fruit was early cultivated in 1766 five species had been introduced the same which are now cultivated but only five varieties of fragaria vesca with some subvarieties had been produced at the present day the varieties of the several species are almost innumerable the species consist of firstly the wood or alpine cultivated strawberries descended from f vesca a native of europe and of north america there are eight wild european varieties as ranked by duchesne of f vesca but several of these are considered species by some botanists secondly the green strawberries descended from the european f collina and little cultivated in england thirdly the hautbois from the european f elatior fourthly the scarlets descended from f virginiana a native of the whole breadth of north america fifthly the chili descended from f chiloensis an inhabitant of the west coast of the temperate parts both of north and south america lastly the pines or carolinas including the old blacks which have been ranked by most authors under the name of f grandiflora as a distinct species said to inhabit surinam but this is a manifest error this form is considered by the highest authority m gay to be merely a strongly marked race of f chiloensis 10101 le fraisier par le comte l de lambertye 1864 page 50 these five or six forms have been ranked by most botanists as specifically distinct but this may be doubted for andrew knight 10102 transact hort soc volume 3 1820 page 207 who raised no less than 400 crossed strawberries asserts that the f virginiana chiloensis and grandiflora may be made to breed together indiscriminately and he found in accordance with the principle of analogous variation that similar varieties could be obtained from the seeds of any one of them  since knights time there is abundant and additional evidence 10103 see an account by prof decaisne and by others in gardeners chronicle 1862 page 335 and 1858 page 172 and mr barnets paper in hort soc transact volume 6 1826 page 170 of the extent to which the american forms spontaneously cross we owe indeed to such crosses most of our choicest existing varieties knight did not succeed in crossing the european woodstrawberry with the american scarlet or with the hautbois mr williams of pitmaston however succeeded but the hybrid offspring from the hautbois though fruiting well never produced seed with the exception of a single one which reproduced the parent hybrid form 10104 transact hort soc volume 5 1824 page 294 major r trevor clarke informs me that he crossed two members of the pine class myatts b queen and keens seedling with the wood and hautbois and that in each case he raised only a single seedling one of these fruited but was almost barren mr w smith of york has raised similar hybrids with equally poor success 10105 journal of horticulture december 30 1862 page 779 see also mr prince to the same effect ibid 1863 page 418 we thus see 10106 for additional evidence see journal of horticulture december 9 1862 page 721 that the european and american species can with some difficulty be crossed but it is improbable that hybrids sufficiently fertile to be worth cultivation will ever be thus produced this fact is surprising as these forms structurally are not widely distinct and are sometimes connected in the districts where they grow wild as i hear from professor asa gray by puzzling intermediate forms  the energetic culture of the strawberry is of recent date and the cultivated varieties can in most cases be classed under some one of the above native stocks as the american strawberries cross so freely and spontaneously we can hardly doubt that they will ultimately become inextricably confused we find indeed that horticulturists at present disagree under which class to rank some few of the varieties and a writer in the bon jardinier of 1840 remarks that formerly it was possible to class all of them under some one species but that now this is quite impossible with the american forms the new english varieties having completely filled up the gaps between them 10107 le fraisier par le comte l de lambertye pages 221 230 the blending together of two or more aboriginal forms which there is every reason to believe has occurred with some of our anciently cultivated productions we see now actually occurring with our strawberries  the cultivated species offer some variations worth notice the black prince a seedling from keens imperial this latter being a seedling of a very white strawberry the white carolina is remarkable from its peculiar dark and polished surface and from presenting an appearance entirely unlike that of any other kind 10108 transact hort soc volume 6 page 200 although the fruit in the different varieties differs so greatly in form size colour and quality the socalled seed which corresponds with the whole fruit in the plum with the exception of being more or less deeply embedded in the pulp is according to de jonghe 10109 gardeners chronicle 1858 page 173 absolutely the same in all and this no doubt may be accounted for by the seed being of no value and consequently not having been subjected to selection the strawberry is properly threeleaved but in 1761 duchesne raised a singleleaved variety of the european woodstrawberry which linnaeus doubtfully raised to the rank of a species seedlings of this variety like those of most varieties not fixed by longcontinued selection often revert to the ordinary form or present intermediate states 10110 godron de lespece tome 1 page 161 a variety raised by mr myatt 10111 gardeners chronicle 1851 page 440 apparently belonging to one of the american forms presents a variation of an opposite nature for it has five leaves godron and lambertye also mention a fiveleaved variety of f collina  the red bush alpine strawberry one of the f vesca section does not produce stolons or runners and this remarkable deviation of structure is reproduced truly by seed another subvariety the white bush alpine is similarly characterised but when propagated by seed it often degenerates and produces plants with runners 10112 f gloede in gardeners chronicle 1862 page 1053 a strawberry of the american pine section is also said to make but few runners 10113 downing fruits page 532  much has been written on the sexes of strawberries the true hautbois properly bears the male and female organs on separate plants 10114 barnet in hort transact volume 6 page 210 and was consequently named by duchesne dioica but it frequently produces hermaphrodites and lindley 10115 gardeners chronicle 1847 page 539 by propagating such plants by runners at the same time destroying the males soon raised a self prolific stock the other species often showed a tendency towards an imperfect separation of the sexes as i have noticed with plants forced in a hothouse several english varieties which in this country are free from any such tendency when cultivated in rich soils under the climate of north america 10116 for the several statements with respect to the american strawberries see downing fruits page 524 gardeners chronicle 1843 page 188 1847 page 539 1861 page 717 commonly produce plants with separate sexes thus a whole acre of keens seedlings in the united states has been observed to be almost sterile from the absence of male flowers but the more general rule is that the male plants overrun the females some members of the cincinnati horticultural society especially appointed to investigate this subject report that few varieties have the flowers perfect in both sexual organs etc the most successful cultivators in ohio plant for every seven rows of pistillata or female plants one row of hermaphrodites which afford pollen for both kinds but the hermaphrodites owing to their expenditure in the production of pollen bear less fruit than the female plants  the varieties differ in constitution some of our best english kinds such as keens seedlings are too tender for certain parts of north america where other english and many american varieties succeed perfectly that splendid fruit the british queen can be cultivated but in few places either in england or france but this apparently depends more on the nature of the soil than on the climate a famous gardener says that no mortal could grow the british queen at shrubland park unless the whole nature of the soil was altered 10117 mr d beaton in cottage gardener 1860 page 86 see also cottage gardener 1855 page 88 and many other authorities for the continent see f gloede in gardeners chronicle 1862 page 1053 la constantine is one of the hardiest kinds and can withstand russian winters but it is easily burnt by the sun so that it will not succeed in certain soils either in england or the united states 10118 rev wf radclyffe in journal of hort march 14 1865 page 207 the filbert pine strawberry requires more water than any other variety and if the plants once suffer from drought they will do little or no good afterwards 10119 mr h doubleday in gardeners chronicle 1862 page 1101 cuthills black prince strawberry evinces a singular tendency to mildew no less than six cases have been recorded of this variety suffering severely whilst other varieties growing close by and treated in exactly the same manner were not at all infested by this fungus 10120 gardeners chronicle 1854 page 254 the time of maturity differs much in the different varieties some belonging to the wood or alpine section produce a succession of crops throughout the summer  gooseberry ribes grossularia  no one i believe has hitherto doubted that all the cultivated kinds are sprung from the wild plant bearing this name which is common in central and northern europe therefore it will be desirable briefly to specify all the points though not very important which have varied if it be admitted that these differences are due to culture authors perhaps will not be so ready to assume the existence of a large number of unknown wild parent stocks for our other cultivated plants the gooseberry is not alluded to by writers of the classical period turner mentions it in 1573 and parkinson specifies eight varieties in 1629 the catalogue of the horticultural society for 1842 gives 149 varieties and the lists of the lancashire nurserymen are said to include above 300 names 10121 loudons encyclop of gardening page 930 and alph de candolle geograph bot page 910 in the gooseberry growers register for 1862 i find that 243 distinct varieties have won prizes at various periods so that a vast number must have been exhibited no doubt the difference between many of the varieties is very small but mr thompson in classifying the fruit for the horticultural society found less confusion in the nomenclature of the gooseberry than of any other fruit and he attributes this to the great interest which the prizegrowers have taken in detecting sorts with wrong names and this shows that all the kinds numerous as they are can be recognised with certainty  the bushes differ in their manner of growth being erect or spreading or pendulous the periods of leafing and flowering differ both absolutely and relatively to each other thus the whitesmith produces early flowers which from not being protected by the foliage as it is believed continually fail to produce fruit 10122 loudons gardeners magazine volume 4 1828 page 112 the leaves vary in size tint and in depth of lobes they are smooth downy or hairy on the upper surface the branches are more or less downy or spinose the hedgehog has probably derived its name from the singular bristly condition of its shoots and fruit the branches of the wild gooseberry i may remark are smooth with the exception of thorns at the bases of the buds the thorns themselves are either very small few and single or very large and triple they are sometimes reflexed and much dilated at their bases in the different varieties the fruit varies in abundance in the period of maturity in hanging until shrivelled and greatly in size some sorts having their fruit large during a very early period of growth whilst others are small until nearly ripe the fruit varies also much in colour being red yellow green and whitethe pulp of one darkred gooseberry being tinged with yellow in flavour in being smooth or downyfew however of the red gooseberries whilst many of the socalled whites are downy or in being so spinose that one kind is called hendersons porcupine two kinds acquire when mature a powdery bloom on their fruit the fruit varies in the thickness and veining of the skin and lastly in shape being spherical oblong oval or obovate 10123 the fullest account of the gooseberry is given by mr thompson in transact hort soc volume 1 2nd series 1835 page 218 from which most of the foregoing facts are taken  i cultivated fiftyfour varieties and considering how greatly the fruit differs it was curious how closely similar the flowers were in all these kinds in only a few i detected a trace of difference in the size or colour of the corolla the calyx differed in a rather greater degree for in some kinds it was much redder than in others and in one smooth white gooseberry it was unusually red the calyx also differed in the basal part being smooth or woolly or covered with glandular hairs it deserves notice as being contrary to what might have been expected from the law of correlation that a smooth red gooseberry had a remarkably hairy calyx the flowers of the sportsman are furnished with very large coloured bracteae and this is the most singular deviation of structure which i have observed these same flowers also varied much in the number of the petals and occasionally in the number of the stamens and pistils so that they were semimonstrous in structure yet they produced plenty of fruit mr thompson remarks that in the pastime gooseberry extra bracts are often attached to the sides of the fruit 10124 catalogue of fruits of hort soc garden 3rd edition 1842  the most interesting point in the history of the gooseberry is the steady increase in the size of the fruit manchester is the metropolis of the fanciers and prizes from five shillings to five or ten pounds are yearly given for the heaviest fruit the gooseberry growers register is published annually the earliest known copy is dated 1786 but it is certain that meetings for the adjudication of prizes were held some years previously 10125 mr clarkson of manchester on the culture of the gooseberry in loudons gardeners magazine volume 4 1828 page 482 the register for 1845 gives an account of 171 gooseberry shows held in different places during that year and this fact shows on how large a scale the culture has been carried on the fruit of the wild gooseberry is said 10126 downing fruits of america page 213 to weigh about a quarter of an ounce or 5 dwts that is 120 grains about the year 1786 gooseberries were exhibited weighing 10 dwts so that the weight was then doubled in 1817 26 dwts 17 grs was attained there was no advance till 1825 when 31 dwts 16 grs was reached in 1830 teazer weighed 32 dwts 13 grs in 1841 wonderful weighed 32 dwts 16 grs in 1844 london weighed 35 dwts 12 grs and in the following year 36 dwts 16 grs and in 1852 in staffordshire the fruit of the same variety reached the astonishing weight of 37 dwts 7 grs 10127 gardeners chronicle 1844 page 811 where a table is given and 1845 page 819 for the extreme weights gained see journal of horticulture july 26 1864 page 61 or 896 grs that is between seven or eight times the weight of the wild fruit i find that a small apple 6 12 inches in circumference has exactly this same weight the london gooseberry which in 1852 had altogether gained 333 prizes has up to the present year of 1875 never reached a greater weight than that attained in 1852 perhaps the fruit of the gooseberry has now reached the greatest possible weight unless in the course of time some new and distinct variety shall arise  this gradual and on the whole steady increase of weight from the latter part of the last century to the year 1852 is probably in large part due to improved methods of cultivation for extreme care is now taken the branches and roots are trained composts are made the soil is mulched and only a few berries are left on each bush 10128 mr saul of lancaster in loudons gardeners mag volume 3 1828 page 421 and volume 10 1834 page 42 but the increase no doubt is in main part due to the continued selection of seedlings which have been found to be more and more capable of yielding such extraordinary fruit assuredly the highwayman in 1817 could not have produced fruit like that of the roaring lion in 1825 nor could the roaring lion though it was grown by many persons in many places gain the supreme triumph achieved in 1852 by the london gooseberry  walnut juglans regia  this tree and the common nut belong to a widely different order from the foregoing fruits and are therefore here noticed the walnut grows wild on the caucasus and in the himalaya where dr hooker 10129 himalayan journals 1854 volume 2 page 334 moorcroft travels volume 2 page 146 describes four varieties cultivated in kashmir found the fruit of full size but as hard as a hickorynut it has been found fossil as m de saporta informs me in the tertiary formation of france  in england the walnut presents considerable differences in the shape and size of the fruit in the thickness of the husk and in the thinness of the shell this latter quality has given rise to a variety called the thin shelled which is valuable but suffers from the attacks of titmice 10130 gardeners chronicle 1850 page 723 the degree to which the kernel fills the shell varies much in france there is a variety called the grape or clusterwalnut in which the nuts grow in bunches of ten fifteen or even twenty together there is another variety which bears on the same tree differently shaped leaves like the heterophyllous hornbeam this tree is also remarkable from having pendulous branches and bearing elongated large thinshelled nuts 10131 paper translated in loudons gardeners mag 1829 volume 5 page 202 m cardan has minutely described 10132 quoted in gardeners chronicle 1849 page 101 some singular physiological peculiarities in the juneleafing variety which produces its leaves and flowers four or five weeks later than the common varieties and although in august it is apparently in exactly the same state of forwardness as the other kinds it retains its leaves and fruit much later in the autumn these constitutional peculiarities are strictly inherited lastly walnuttrees which are properly monoicous sometimes entirely fail to produce male flowers 10133 gardeners chronicle 1847 pages 541 and 558  nuts corylus avellana  most botanists rank all the varieties under the same species the common wild nut 10134 the following details are taken from the catalogue of fruits 1842 in garden of hort soc page 103 and from loudons encyclop of gardening page 943 the husk or involucre differs greatly being extremely short in barrs spanish and extremely long in filberts in which it is contracted so as to prevent the nut falling out this kind of husk also protects the nut from birds for titmice parus have been observed 10135

size and shape being ovate and compressed in filberts nearly round and of great size in cobs and spanish nuts oblong and longitudinally striated in cosfords and obtusely foursided in the downton square nut  cucurbitaceous plants  these plants have been for a long period the opprobrium of botanists numerous varieties have been ranked as species and what happens more rarely forms which now must be considered as species have been classed as varieties owing to the admirable experimental researches of a distinguished botanist m naudin 10136 annales des sc nat bot 4th series volume 6 1856 page 5 a flood of light has recently been thrown on this group of plants m naudin during many years observed and experimented on above 1200 living specimens collected from all quarters of the world six species are now recognised in the genus cucurbita but three alone have been cultivated and concern us namely c maxima and pepo which include all pumpkins gourds squashes and the vegetable marrow and c moschata these three species are not known in a wild state but asa gray 10137 american journ of science 2nd series volume 24 1857 page 442 gives good reason for believing that some pumpkins are natives of n america  these three species are closely allied and have the same general habit but their innumerable varieties can always be distinguished according to naudin by certain almost fixed characters and what is still more important when crossed they yield no seed or only sterile seed whilst the varieties spontaneously intercross with the utmost freedom naudin insists strongly page 15 that though these three species have varied greatly in many characters yet it has been in so closely an analogous manner that the varieties can he arranged in almost parallel series as we have seen with the forms of wheat with the two main races of the peach and in other cases though some of the varieties are inconstant in character yet others when grown separately under uniform conditions of life are as naudin repeatedly pages 6 16 35 urges douees dune stabilite presque comparable a celle des especes les mieux caracterisees one variety lorangin pages 43 63 has such prepotency in transmitting its character that when crossed with other varieties a vast majority of the seedlings come true naudin referring page 47 to c pepo says that its races ne different des especes veritables quen ce quelles peuvent sallier les unes aux autres par voie dhybridite sans que leur descendance perde la faculte de se perpetuer if we were to trust to external differences alone and give up the test of sterility a multitude of species would have to be formed out of the varieties of these three species of cucurbita many naturalists at the present day lay far too little stress in my opinion on the test of sterility yet it is not improbable that distinct species of plants after a long course of cultivation and variation may have their mutual sterility eliminated as we have every reason to believe has occurred with domesticated animals nor in the case of plants under cultivation should we be justified in assuming that varieties never acquire a slight degree of mutual sterility as we shall more fully see in a future chapter when certain facts are given on the high authority of gartner and kolreuter 10138 gartner bastarderzeugung 1849 s 87 and s 169 with respect to maize on verbascum ibid s 92 and 181 also his kenntniss der befruchtung s 137 with respect to nicotiana see kolreuter zweite forts 1764 s 53 though this is a somewhat different case  the forms of c pepo are classed by naudin under seven sections each including subordinate varieties he considers this plant as probably the most variable in the world the fruit of one variety pages 33 46 exceeds in value that of another by more than two thousand fold when the fruit is of very large size the number produced is few page 45 when of small size many are produced no less astonishing page 33 is the variation in the shape of the fruit the typical form apparently is egglike but this becomes either drawn out into a cylinder or shortened into a flat disc we have also an almost infinite diversity in the colour and state of surface of the fruit in the hardness both of the shell and of the flesh and in the taste of the flesh which is either extremely sweet farinaceous or slightly bitter the seeds also differ in a slight degree in shape and wonderfully in size page 34 namely from six or seven to more than twentyfive millimetres in length  in the varieties which grow upright or do not run and climb the tendrils though useless page 31 are either present or are represented by various semimonstrous organs or are quite absent the tendrils are even absent in some running varieties in which the stems are much elongated it is a singular fact that page 31 in all the varieties with dwarfed stems the leaves closely resemble each other in shape  those naturalists who believe in the immutability of species often maintain that even in the most variable forms the characters which they consider of specific value are unchangeable to give an example from a conscientious writer 10139 godron de lespece tome 2 page 64 who relying on the labours of m naudin and referring to the species of cucurbita says au milieu de toutes les variations du fruit les tiges les feuilles les calices les corolles les etamines restent invariables dans chacune delles yet m naudin in describing cucurbita pepo page 30 says ici dailleurs ce ne sont pas seulement les fruits qui varient cest aussi le feuillage et tout le port de la plante neanmoins je crois quon la distinguera toujours facilement des deux autres especes si lon veut ne pas perdre de vue les caracteres differentiels que je mefforce de faire ressortir ces caracteres sont quelquefois peu marques il arrive meme que plusieurs dentre eux seffacent presque entierement mais ii en reste toujours quelquesuns qui remettent lobservateur sur la voie now let it be noted what a difference with regard to the immutability of the so called specific characters this paragraph produces on the mind from that above quoted from m godron  i will add another remark naturalists continually assert that no important organ varies but in saying this they unconsciously argue in a vicious circle for if an organ let it be what it may is highly variable it is regarded as unimportant and under a systematic point of view this is quite correct but as long as constancy is thus taken as the criterion of importance it will indeed be long before an important organ can be shown to be inconstant the enlarged form of the stigmas and their sessile position on the summit of the ovary must be considered as important characters and were used by gasparini to separate certain pumpkins as a distinct genus but naudin says page 20 these parts have no constancy and in the flowers of the turban varieties of c maxima they sometimes resume their ordinary structure again in c maxima the carpels page 19 which form the turban project even as much as twothirds of their length out of the receptacle and this latter part is thus reduced to a sort of platform but this remarkable structure occurs only in certain varieties and graduates into the common form in which the carpels are almost entirely enveloped within the receptacle in c moschata the ovarium page 50 varies greatly in shape being oval nearly spherical or cylindrical more or less swollen in the upper part or constricted round the middle and either straight or curved when the ovarium is short and oval the interior structure does not differ from that of c maxima and pepo but when it is elongated the carpels occupy only the terminal and swollen portion i may add that in one variety of the cucumber cucumis sativus the fruit regularly contains five carpels instead of three 10140 naudin annal des sc nat 4th series bot tome 11 1859 page 28 i presume that it will not be disputed that we here have instances of great variability in organs of the highest physiological importance and with most plants of the highest classificatory importance  sageret 10141 memoire sur les cucurbitacees 1826 pages 6 24 and naudin found that the cucumber c sativus could not be crossed with any other species of the genus therefore no doubt it is specifically distinct from the melon this will appear to most persons a superfluous statement yet we hear from naudin 10142 flore des serres october 1861 quoted in gardeners chronicle 1861 page 1135 i have often consulted and taken some facts from m naudins memoir on cucumis in annal des sc nat 4th series bot tome 11 1859 page 5 that there is a race of melons in which the fruit is so like that of the cucumber both externally and internally that it is hardly possible to distinguish the one from the other except by the leaves the varieties of the melon seem to be endless for naudin after six years study had not come to the end of them he divides them into ten sections including numerous subvarieties which all intercross with perfect ease 10143 see also sageret memoire page 7 of the forms considered by naudin to be varieties botanists have made thirty distinct species and they had not the slightest acquaintance with the multitude of new forms which have appeared since their time nor is the creation of so many species at all surprising when we consider how strictly their characters are transmitted by seed and how wonderfully they differ in appearance mira est quidem foliorum et habitus diversitas sed multo magis fructuum says naudin the fruit is the valuable part and this in accordance with the common rule is the most modified part some melons are only as large as small plums others weigh as much as sixtysix pounds one variety has a scarlet fruit another is not more than an inch in diameter but sometimes more than a yard in length twisting about in all directions like a serpent it is a singular fact that in this latter variety many parts of the plant namely the stems the footstalks of the female flowers the middle lobe of the leaves and especially the ovarium as well as the mature fruit all show a strong tendency to become elongated several varieties of the melon are interesting from assuming the characteristic features of distinct species and even of distinct though allied genera thus the serpentmelon has some resemblance to the fruit of trichosanthes anguina we have seen that other varieties closely resemble cucumbers some egyptian varieties have their seeds attached to a portion of the pulp and this is characteristic of certain wild forms lastly a variety of melon from algiers is remarkable from announcing its maturity by a spontaneous and almost sudden dislocation when deep cracks suddenly appear and the fruit falls to pieces and this occurs with the wild c momordica finally m naudin well remarks that this extraordinary production of races and varieties by a single species and their permanence when not interfered with by crossing are phenomena well calculated to cause reflection  useful and ornamental trees  trees deserve a passing notice on account of the numerous varieties which they present differing in their precocity in their manner of growth their foliage and bark thus of the common ash fraxinus excelsior the catalogue of messrs lawson of edinburgh includes twentyone varieties some of which differ much in their bark there is a yellow a streaked reddishwhite a purple a wartbarked and a fungousbarked variety 10144 loudons arboretum et fruticetum volume 2 page 1217 of hollies no less than eightyfour varieties are grown alongside each other in mr pauls nursery 10145 gardeners chronicle 1866 page 1096 in the case of trees all the recorded varieties as far as i can find out have been suddenly produced by one single act of variation the length of time required to raise many generations and the little value set on the fanciful varieties explains how it is that successive modifications have not been accumulated by selection hence also it follows that we do not here meet with subvarieties subordinate to varieties and these again subordinate to higher groups on the continent however where the forests are more carefully attended to than in england alph de candolle 10146 geograph bot page 1096 says that there is not a forester who does not search for seeds from that variety which he esteems the most valuable  our useful trees have seldom been exposed to any great change of conditions they have not been richly manured and the english kinds grow under their proper climate yet in examining extensive beds of seedlings in nurserygardens considerable differences may be generally observed in them and whilst touring in england i have been surprised at the amount of difference in the appearance of the same species in our hedgerows and woods but as plants vary so much in a truly wild state it would be difficult for even a skilful botanist to pronounce whether as i believe to be the case hedgerow trees vary more than those growing in a primeval forest trees when planted by man in woods or hedges do not grow where they would naturally be able to hold their place against a host of competitors and are therefore exposed to conditions not strictly natural even this slight change would probably suffice to cause seedlings raised from such trees to be variable whether or not our halfwild english trees as a general rule are more variable than trees growing in their native forests there can hardly be a doubt that they have yielded a greater number of stronglymarked and singular variations of structure  in manner of growth we have weeping or pendulous varieties of the willow ash elm oak and yew and other trees and this weeping habit is sometimes inherited though in a singularly capricious manner in the lombardy poplar and in certain fastigiate or pyramidal varieties of thorns junipers oaks etc we have an opposite kind of growth the hessian oak 10147 gardeners chronicle 1842 page 36 which is famous from its fastigiate habit and size bears hardly any resemblance in general appearance to a common oak its acorns are not sure to produce plants of the same habit some however turn out the same as the parenttree another fastigiate oak is said to have been found wild in the pyrenees and this is a surprising circumstance it generally comes so true by seed that de candolle considered it as specifically distinct 10148 loudons arboretum et fruticetum volume 3 page 1731 the fastigiate juniper j suecica likewise transmits its character by seed 10149 ibid volume 4 page 2489 dr falconer informs me that in the botanic gardens at calcutta the great heat caused appletrees to become fastigiate and we thus see the same result following from the effects of climate and from some unknown cause 10150 godron de lespece tome 2 page 91 describes four varieties of robinia remarkable from their manner of growth  in foliage we have variegated leaves which are often inherited dark purple or red leaves as in the hazel barberry and beech the colour in these two latter trees being sometimes strongly and sometimes weakly inherited 10151 journal of a horticultural tour by caledonian hort soc 1823 page 107 alph de candolle geograph bot page 1083 verlot sur la production des varietes 1865 page 55 for the barberry deeplycut leaves and leaves covered with prickles as in the variety of the holly well called ferox which is said to reproduce itself by seed 10152 loudons arboretum et fruticetum volume 2 page 508 in fact nearly all the peculiar varieties evince a tendency more or less strongly marked to reproduce themselves by seed 10153 verlot des varietes 1865 page 92 this is to a certain extent the case according to bosc 10154 loudons arboretum et fruticetum volume 3 page 1376 with three varieties of the elm namely the broadleafed limeleafed and twisted elm in which latter the fibres of the wood are twisted even with the heterophyllous hornbeam carpinus betulus which bears on each twig leaves of two shapes several plants raised from seed all retained the same peculiarity 10155 gardeners chronicle 1841 page 687 i will add only one other remarkable case of variation in foliage namely the occurrence of two sub varieties of the ash with simple instead of pinnated leaves and which generally transmit their character by seed 10156 godron de lespece tome 2 page 89 in loudons gardeners mag volume 12 1836 page 371 a variegated bushy ash is described and figured as having simple leaves it originated in ireland the occurrence in trees belonging to widely different orders of weeping and fastigiate varieties and of trees bearing deeply cut variegated and purple leaves shows that these deviations of structure must result from some very general physiological laws  differences in general appearance and foliage not more strongly marked than those above indicated have led good observers to rank as distinct species certain forms which are now known to be mere varieties thus a planetree long cultivated in england was considered by almost every one as a north american species but is now ascertained by old records as i am informed by dr hooker to be a variety so again the thuja pendula or filiformis was ranked by such good observers as lambert wallich and others as a true species but it is now known that the original plants five in number suddenly appeared in a bed of seedlings raised at mr loddiges nursery from t orientalis and dr hooker has adduced excellent evidence that at turin seeds of t pendula have reproduced the parent form t orientalis 10157 gardeners chronicle 1863 page 575  every one must have noticed how certain individual trees regularly put forth and shed their leaves earlier or later than others of the same species there is a famous horsechestnut in the tuileries which is named from leafing so much earlier than the others there is also an oak near edinburgh which retains its leaves to a very late period these differences have been attributed by some authors to the nature of the soil in which the trees grow but archbishop whately grafted an early thorn on a late one and vice versa and both grafts kept to their proper periods which differed by about a fortnight as if they still grew on their own stocks 10158 quoted from royal irish academy in gardeners chronicle 1841 page 767 there is a cornish variety of the elm which is almost an evergreen and is so tender that the shoots are often killed by the frost and the varieties of the turkish oak q cerris may be arranged as deciduous subevergreen and evergreen 10159 loudon arboretum et fruticetum for elm see volume 3 page 1376 for oak page 1846  scotch fir pinus sylvestris  i allude to this tree as it bears on the question of the greater variability of our hedgerow trees compared with those under strictly natural conditions a wellinformed writer 10160 gardeners chronicle 1849 page 822 states that the scotch fir presents few varieties in its native scotch forests but that it varies much in figure and foliage and in the size shape and colour of its cones when several generations have been produced away from its native locality there is little doubt that the highland and lowland varieties differ in the value of their timber and that they can be propagated truly by seed thus justifying loudons remark that a variety is often of as much importance as a species and sometimes far more so 10161 arboretum et fruticetum volume 4 page 2150 i may mention one rather important point in which this tree occasionally varies in the classification of the coniferae sections are founded on whether two three or five leaves are included in the same sheath the scotch fir has properly only two leaves thus enclosed but specimens have been observed with groups of three leaves in a sheath 10162 gardeners chronicle 1852 page 693 besides these differences in the semicultivated scotch fir there are in several parts of europe natural or geographical races which have been ranked by some authors as distinct species 10163 see beitrage zur kenntniss europaischer pinusarten von dr christ flora 1864 he

varieties as mughus nana etc which differ much when planted in different soils and only come tolerably true from seed as alpine varieties of the scotch fir if this were proved to be the case it would be an interesting fact as showing that dwarfing from long exposure to a severe climate is to a certain extent inherited  the hawthorn crataegus oxyacantha  the hawthorn has varied much besides endless slighter variations in the form of the leaves and in the size hardness fleshiness and shape of the berries loudon 10165 ibid volume 2 page 830 loudons gardeners mag volume 6 1830 page 714 enumerates twentynine wellmarked varieties besides those cultivated for their pretty flowers there are others with goldenyellow black and whitish berries others with woolly berries and others with recurved thorns loudon truly remarks that the chief reason why the hawthorn has yielded more varieties than most other trees is that nurserymen select any remarkable variety out of the immense beds of seedlings which are annually raised for making hedges the flowers of the hawthorn usually include from one to three pistils but in two varieties named monogyna and sibirica there is only a single pistil and dasso states that the common thorn in spain is constantly in this state 10166 loudons arboretum et fruticetum volume 2 page 834 there is also a variety which is apetalous or has its petals reduced to mere rudiments the famous glastonbury thorn flowers and leafs towards the end of december at which time it bears berries produced from an earlier crop of flowers 10167 loudons gardeners mag volume 9 1833 page 123 it is worth notice that several varieties of the hawthorn as well as of the lime and juniper are very distinct in their foliage and habit whilst young but in the course of thirty or forty years become extremely like each other 10168 ibid volume 11 1835 page 503 thus reminding us of the wellknown fact that the deodar the cedar of lebanon and that of the atlas are distinguished with the greatest ease whilst young but with difficulty when old  flowers  i shall not for several reasons treat the variability of plants which are cultivated for their flowers alone at any great length many of our favourite kinds in their present state are the descendants of two or more species crossed and commingled together and this circumstance alone would render it difficult to detect the difference due to variation for instance our roses petunias calceolarias fuchsias verbenas gladioli pelargoniums etc certainly have had a multiple origin a botanist well acquainted with the parentforms would probably detect some curious structural differences in their crossed and cultivated descendant and he would certainly observe many new and remarkable constitutional peculiarities i will give a few instances all relating to the pelargonium and taken chiefly from mr beck 10169 gardeners chronicle 1845 page 623 a famous cultivator of this plant some varieties require more water than others some are very impatient of the knife if too greedily used in making cuttings some when potted scarcely show a root at the outside of the ball of the earth one variety requires a certain amount of confinement in the pot to make it throw up a flower stem some varieties bloom well at the commencement of the season others at the close one variety is known 10170 d beaton in cottage gardener 1860 page 377 see also mr beck on the habits of queen mab in gardeners chronicle 1845 page 226 which will stand even pineapple top and bottom heat without looking any more drawn than if it had stood in a common greenhouse and blanche fleur seems as if made on purpose for growing in winter like many bulbs and to rest all summer these odd constitutional peculiarities would enable a plant in a state of nature to become adapted to widely different circumstances and climates  flowers possess little interest under our present point of view because they have been almost exclusively attended to and selected for their beautiful colour size perfect outline and manner of growth in these particulars hardly one longcultivated flower can be named which has not varied greatly what does a florist care for the shape and structure of the organs of fructification unless indeed they add to the beauty of the flower when this is the case flowers become modified in important points stamens and pistils may be converted into petals and additional petals may be developed as in all double flowers the process of gradual selection by which flowers have been rendered more and more double each step in the process of conversion being inherited has been recorded in several instances in the socalled double flowers of the compositae the corollas of the central florets are greatly modified and the modifications are likewise inherited in the columbine aquilegia vulgaris some of the stamens are converted into petals having the shape of nectaries one neatly fitting into the other but in one variety they are converted into simple petals 10171 moquintandon elements de teratologie 1841 page 213 in the hose in hose primulae the calyx becomes brightly coloured and enlarged so as to resemble a corolla and mr w wooler informs me that this peculiarity is transmitted for he crossed a common polyanthus with one having a coloured calyx 10172 see also cottage gardener 1860 page 133 and some of the seedlings inherited the coloured calyx during at least six generations in the henandchicken daisy the main flower is surrounded by a brood of small flowers developed from buds in the axils of the scales of the involucre a wonderful poppy has been described in which the stamens are converted into pistils and so strictly was this peculiarity inherited that out of 154 seedlings one alone reverted to the ordinary and common type 10173 quoted by alph de candolle bibl univ november 1862 page 58 of the cockscomb celosia cristata which is an annual there are several races in which the flowerstem is wonderfully fasciated or compressed and one has been exhibited 10174 knight transact hort soc volume 4 page 322 actually eighteen inches in breadth peloric races of gloxinia speciosa and antirrhinum majus can be propagated by seed and they differ in a wonderful manner from the typical form both in structure and appearance  a much more remarkable modification has been recorded by sir william and dr hooker 10175 botanical magazine tab 5160 figure 4 dr hooker in gardeners chronicle 1860 page 190 prof harvey in gardeners chronicle 1860 page 145 mr crocker in gardeners chron 1861 page 1092 in begonia frigida this plant properly produces male and female flowers on the same fascicles and in the female flowers the perianth is superior but a plant at kew produced besides the ordinary flowers others which graduated towards a perfect hermaphrodite structure and in these flowers the perianth was inferior to show the importance of this modification under a classificatory point of view i may quote what prof harvey says namely that had it occurred in a state of nature and had a botanist collected a plant with such flowers he would not only have placed it in a distinct genus from begonia but would probably have considered it as the type of a new natural order this modification cannot in one sense be considered as a monstrosity for analogous structures naturally occur in other orders as with saxifragae and aristolochiaceae the interest of the case is largely added to by mr cw crockers observation that seedlings from the normal flowers produced plants which bore in about the same proportion as the parentplant hermaphrodite flowers having inferior perianths the hermaphrodite flowers fertilised with their own pollen were sterile  if florists had attended to selected and propagated by seed other modifications of structure besides those which are beautiful a host of curious varieties would certainly have been raised and they would probably have transmitted their characters so truly that the cultivator would have felt aggrieved as in the case of culinary vegetables if his whole bed had not presented a uniform appearance florists have attended in some instances to the leaves of their plant and have thus produced the most elegant and symmetrical patterns of white red and green which as in the case of the pelargonium are sometimes strictly inherited 10176 alph de candolle geograph bot page 1083 gardeners chronicle 1861 page 433 the inheritance of the white and golden zones in pelargonium largely depends on the nature of the soil see d beaton in journal of horticulture 1861 page 64 any one who will habitually examine highly cultivated flowers in gardens and greenhouses will observe numerous deviations in structure but most of these must be ranked as mere monstrosities and are only so far interesting as showing how plastic the organisation becomes under high cultivation from this point of view such works as professor moquintandons teratologie are highly instructive  roses  these flowers offer an instance of a number of forms generally ranked as species namely r centifolia gallica alba damascena spinosissima bracteata indica semperflorens moschata etc which have largely varied and been intercrossed the genus rosa is a notoriously difficult one and though some of the above forms are admitted by all botanists to be distinct species others are doubtful thus with respect to the british forms babington makes seventeen and bentham only five species the hybrids from some of the most distinct formsfor instance from r indica fertilised by the pollen of r centifoliaproduce an abundance of seed i state this on the authority of mr rivers 10177 rose amateurs guide t rivers 1837 page 21 from whose work i have drawn most of the following statements as almost all the aboriginal forms brought from different countries have been crossed and recrossed it is no wonder that targioni tozzetti in speaking of the common roses of the italian gardens remarks that the native country and precise form of the wild type of most of them are involved in much uncertainty 10178 journal hort soc volume 9 1855 page 182 nevertheless mr rivers in referring to r indica page 68 says that the descendants of each group may generally be recognised by a close observer the same author often speaks of roses as having been a little hybridised but it is evident that in very many cases the differences due to variation and to hybridisation can now only be conjecturally distinguished  the species have varied both by seed and by bud such modified buds being often called by gardeners sports in the following chapter i shall fully discuss this latter subject and shall show that budvariations can be propagated not only by grafting and budding but often by seed whenever a new rose appears with any peculiar character however produced if it yields seed mr rivers page 4 fully expects it to become the parenttype of a new family the tendency to vary is so strong in some kinds as in the village maid rivers page 16 that when grown in different soils it varies so much in colour that it has been thought to form several distinct kinds altogether the number of kinds is very great thus m desportes in his catalogue for 1829 enumerates 2562 as cultivated in france but no doubt a large proportion of these are merely nominal  it would be useless to specify the many points of difference between the various kinds but some constitutional peculiarities may be mentioned several french roses rivers page 12 will not succeed in england and an excellent horticulturist 10179 the rev wf radclyffe in journal of horticulture march 14 1865 page 207 remarks that even in the same garden you will find that a rose that will do nothing under a south wall will do well under a north one that is the case with paul joseph here it grows strongly and blooms beautifully close to a north wall for three years seven plants have done nothing under a south wall many roses can be forced many are totally unfit for forcing among which is general jacqueminot 10180 gardeners chronicle 1831 page 46 from the effects of crossing and variation mr rivers enthusiastically anticipates page 87 that the day will come when all our roses even mossroses will have evergreen foliage brilliant and fragrant flowers and the habit of blooming from june till november a distant view this seems but perseverance in gardening will yet achieve wonders as assuredly it has already achieved wonders  it may be worth while briefly to give the wellknown history of one class of roses in 1793 some wild scotch roses r spinosissima were transplanted into a garden 10181 mr sabine in transact hort soc volume 4 page 285 and one of these bore flowers slightly tinged with red from which a plant was raised with semimonstrous flowers also tinged with red seedlings from this flower were semidouble and by continued selection in about nine or ten years eight subvarieties were raised in the course of less than twenty years these double scotch roses had so much increased in number and kind that twentysix wellmarked varieties classed in eight sections were described by mr sabine in 1841 10182 an encyclop of plants by jc loudon 1841 page 443 it is said that three hundred varieties could be procured in the nurserygardens near glasgow and these are described as blush crimson purple red marbled twocoloured white and yellow and as differing much in the size and shape of the flower  pansy or heartsease viola tricolor etc  the history of this flower seems to be pretty well known it was grown in evelyns garden in 1687 but the varieties were not attended to till 1810 1812 when lady monke together with mr lee the wellknown nurseryman energetically commenced their culture and in the course of a few years twenty varieties could be purchased 10183 loudons gardeners magazine volume 11 1835 page 427 also journal of horticulture april 14 1863 page 275 at about the same period namely in 1813 or 1814 lord gambier collected some wild plants and his gardener mr thomson cultivated them together with some common garden varieties and soon effected a great improvement the first great change was the conversion of the dark lines in the centre of the flower into a dark eye or centre which at that period had never been seen but is now considered one of the chief requisites of a firstrate flower in 1835 a book entirely devoted to this flower was published and four hundred named varieties were on sale from these circumstances this plant seemed to me worth studying more especially from the great contrast between the small dull elongated irregular flowers of the wild pansy and the beautiful flat symmetrical circular velvetlike flowers more than two inches in diameter magnificently and variously coloured which are exhibited at our shows but when i came to enquire more closely i found that though the varieties were so modern yet that much confusion and doubt prevailed about their parentage florists believe that the varieties 10184 loudons gardeners magazine volume 8 page 575 volume 9 page 689 are descended from several wild stocks namely v tricolor lutea grandiflora amoena and altaica more or less intercrossed and when i looked to botanical works to ascertain whether these forms ought to be ranked as species i found equal doubt and confusion viola altaica seems to be a distinct form but what part it has played in the origin of our varieties i know not it is said to have been crossed with v lutea viola amoena 10185 sir je smith english flora volume 1 page 306 hc watson cybele britannica volume 1 1847 page 181 is now looked at by all botanists as a natural variety of v grandiflora and this and v sudetica have been proved to be identical with v lutea the latter and v tricolor including its admitted variety v arvensis are ranked as distinct species by babington and likewise by m gay 10186 quoted from annales des sciences in the companion to the bot mag volume 1 1835 page 159 who has paid particular attention to the genus but the specific distinction between v lutea and tricolor is chiefly grounded on the one being strictly and the other not strictly perennial as well as on some other slight and unimportant differences in the form of the stem and stipules bentham unites these two forms and a high authority on such matters mr hc watson 10187 cybele britannica volume 1 page 173 see also dr herbert on the changes of colour in transplanted specimens and on the natural variations of v grandiflora in transact hort soc volume 4 page 19 says that while v tricolor passes into v arvensis on the one side it approximates so much towards v lutea and v curtisii on the other side that a distinction becomes scarcely more easy between them  hence after having carefully compared numerous varieties i gave up the attempt as too difficult for any one except a professed botanist most of the varieties present such inconstant characters that when grown in poor soil or when flowering out of their proper season they produced differently coloured and much smaller flowers cultivators speak of this or that kind as being remarkably constant or true but by this they do not mean as in other cases that the kind transmits its character by seed but that the individual plant does not change much under culture the principle of inheritance however does hold good to a certain extent even with the fleeting varieties of the heartsease for to gain good sorts it is indispensable to sow the seed of good sorts nevertheless in almost every large seedbed a few almost wild seedlings reappear through reversion on comparing the choicest varieties with the nearest allied wild forms besides the difference in the size outline and colour of the flowers the leaves sometimes differ in shape as does the calyx occasionally in the length and breadth of the sepals the differences in the form of the nectary more especially deserve notice because characters derived from this organ have been much used in the discrimination of most of the species of viola in a large number of flowers compared in 1842 i found that in the greater number the nectary was straight in others the extremity was a little turned upwards or downwards or inwards so as to be completely hooked in others instead of being hooked it was first turned rectangularly downwards and then backwards and upwards in others the extremity was considerably enlarged and lastly in some the basal part was depressed becoming as usual laterally compressed towards the extremity in a large number of flowers on the other hand examined by me in 1856 from a nurserygarden in a different part of england the nectary hardly varied at all now m gay says that in certain districts especially in auvergne the nectary of the wild v grandiflora varies in the manner just described must we conclude from this that the cultivated varieties first mentioned were all descended from v grandiflora and that the second lot though having the same general appearance were descended from v tricolor of which the nectary according to m gay is subject to little variation or is it not more probable that both these wild forms would be found under other conditions to vary in the same manner and degree thus showing that they ought not to be ranked as specifically distinct  the dahlia  the dahlia has been referred to by almost every author who has written on the variation of plants because it is believed that all the varieties are descended from a single species and because all have arisen since 1802 in france and since 1804 in england 10188 salisbury in transact hort soc volume 1 1812 pages 84 92 a semidouble variety was produced in madrid in 1790 mr sabine remarks that it seems as if some period of cultivation had been required before the fixed qualities of the native plant gave way and began to sport into those changes which now so delight us 10189 transact hort soc volume 3 1820 page 225 the flowers have been greatly modified in shape from a flat to a globular form anemone and ranunculuslike races 10190 loudons gardeners mag volume 6 1830 page 77 which differ in the form and arrangement of the florets have arisen also dwarfed races one of which is only eighteen inches in height the seeds vary much in size the petals are uniformly coloured or tipped or striped and present an almost infinite diversity of tints seedlings of fourteen different colours 10191 loudons encyclop of gardening page 1035 have been raised from the same plant yet as mr sabine has remarked many of the seedlings follow their parents in colour the period of flowering has been considerably hastened and this has probably been effected by continued selection salisbury writing 1808 says that they then flowered from september to november in 1828 some new dwarf varieties began flowering in june 10192 transact hort soc volume 1 page 91 and loudons gardeners mag volume 3 1828 page 179 and mr grieve informs me that the dwarf purple zelinda in his garden is in full bloom by the middle of june and sometimes even earlier slight constitutional differences have been observed between certain varieties thus some kinds succeed much better in one part of england than in another 10193 mr wildman in gardeners chronicle 1843 page 87 cottage gardener april 8 1856 page 33 and it has been noticed that some varieties require much more moisture than others 10194 m faivre has given an interesting account of the successive variations of the chinese primrose since its introduction into europe about the year 1820 revue des cours scientifiques june 1869 page 428  such flowers as the carnation common tulip and hyacinth which are believed to be descended each from a single wild form present innumerable varieties differing almost exclusively in the size form and colour of the flowers these and some other anciently cultivated plants which have been long propagated by offsets pipings bulbs etc become so excessively variable that almost each new plant raised from seed forms a new variety all of which to describe particularly as old gerarde wrote in 1597 were to roll sisyphuss stone or to number the sands  hyacinth hyacinthus orientalis  it may however be worth while to give a short account of this plant which was introduced into england in 1596 from the levant 10195 the best and fullest account of this plant which i have met with is by a famous horticulturist mr paul of waltham in the gardeners chronicle 1864 page 342 the petals of the original flower says mr paul were narrow wrinkled pointed and of a flimsy texture now they are broad smooth solid and rounded the erectness breadth and length of the whole spike and the size of the flowers have all increased the colours have been intensified and diversified gerarde in 1597 enumerates four and parkinson in 1629 eight varieties now the varieties are very numerous and they were still more numerous a century ago mr paul remarks that it is interesting to compare the hyacinths of 1629 with those of 1864 and to mark the improvement two hundred and thirtyfive years have elapsed since then and this simple flower serves well to illustrate the great fact that the original forms of nature do not remain fixed and stationary at least when brought under cultivation while looking at the extremes we must not however forget that there are intermediate stages which are for the most part lost to us nature will sometimes indulge herself with a leap but as a rule her march is slow and gradual he adds that the cultivator should have in his mind an ideal of beauty for the realisation of which he works with head and hand we thus see how clearly mr paul an eminently successful cultivator of this flower appreciates the action of methodical selection  in a curious and apparently trustworthy treatise published at amsterdam 10196 des jacinthes de leur anatomie reproduction et culture amsterdam 1768 in 1768 it is stated that nearly 2000 sorts were then known but in 1864 mr paul found only 700 in the largest garden at haarlem in this treatise it is said that not an instance is known of any one variety reproducing itself truly by seed the white kinds however now 10197 alph de candolle geograph bot page 1082 almost always yield white hyacinths and the yellow kinds come nearly true the hyacinth is remarkable from having given rise to varieties with bright blue pink and distinctly yellow flowers these three primary colours do not occur in the varieties of any other species nor do they often all occur even in the distinct species of the same genus although the several kinds of hyacinths differ but slightly from each other except in colour yet each kind has its own individual character which can be recognised by a highly educated eye thus the writer of the amsterdam treatise asserts page 43 that some experienced florists such as the famous g voorhelm seldom failed in a collection of above twelve hundred sorts to recognise each variety by the bulb alone this same writer mentions some few singular variations for instance the hyacinth commonly produces six leaves but there is one kind page 35 which scarcely ever has more than three leaves another never more than five whilst others regularly produce either seven or eight leaves a variety called la coryphee invariably produces page 116 two flowerstems united together and covered by one skin the flowerstem in another kind page 128 comes out of the ground in a coloured sheath before the appearance of the leaves and is consequently liable to suffer from frost another variety always pushes a second flowerstem after the first has begun to develop itself lastly white hyacinths with red purple or violet centres page 129 are the most liable to rot thus the hyacinth like so many previous plants when long cultivated and closely watched is found to offer many singular variations  in the two last chapters i have given in some detail the range of variation and the history as far as known of a considerable number of plants which have been cultivated for various purposes but some of the most variable plants such as kidneybeans capsicum millets sorghum etc have been passed over for botanists are not at all agreed which kinds ought to rank as species and which as varieties and the wild parent species are unknown 10198 alph de candolle geograph bot page 983 many plants long cultivated in tropical countries such as the banana have produced numerous varieties but as these have never been described with even moderate care they are here also passed over nevertheless a sufficient and perhaps more than sufficient number of cases have been given so that the reader may be enabled to judge for himself on the nature and great amount of variation which cultivated plants have undergone   chapter 1xi  on budvariation and on certain anomalous modes of reproduction and variation  budvariation in the peach plum cherry vine gooseberry

and bulbs on the breaking of tulips budvariations graduate into changes consequent on changed conditions of life grafthybrids on the segregation of the parental characters in seminal hybrids by bud variation on the direct or immediate action of foreign pollen on the motherplant on the effects in female animals of a previous impregnation on the subsequent offspring conclusion and summary  this chapter will be chiefly devoted to a subject in many respects important namely budvariation by this term i include all those sudden changes in structure or appearance which occasionally occur in fullgrown plants in their flowerbuds or leafbuds gardeners call such changes sports but this as previously remarked is an illdefined expression as it has often been applied to strongly marked variations in seedling plants the difference between seminal and bud reproduction is not so great as it at first appears for each bud is in one sense a new and distinct individual but such individuals are produced through the formation of various kinds of buds without the aid of any special apparatus whilst fertile seeds are produced by the concourse of the two sexual elements the modifications which arise through budvariation can generally be propagated to any extent by grafting budding cuttings bulbs etc and occasionally even by seed some few of our most beautiful and useful productions have arisen by budvariation  budvariations have as yet been observed only in the vegetable kingdom but it is probable that if compound animals such as corals etc had been subjected to a long course of domestication they would have varied by buds for they resemble plants in many respects for instance any new or peculiar character presented by a compound animal is propagated by budding as occurs with differently coloured hydras and as mr gosse has shown to be the case with a singular variety of a true coral varieties of the hydra have also been grafted on other varieties and have retained their character  i will in the first place give all the cases of bud variations which i have been able to collect and afterwards show their importance 111 since the publication of the first edition of this work i have found that m carriere chef des pepinieres au mus dhist nat in his excellent essay production et fixation des varietes 1865 has given a list of bud variations far more extensive than mine but as these relate chiefly to cases occurring in france i have left my list as it stood adding a few facts from m carriere and others any one who wishes to study the subject fully should refer to m carrieres essay these cases prove that those authors who like pallas attribute all variability to the crossing either of distinct races or of distinct individuals belonging to the same race but somewhat different from each other are in error as are those authors who attribute all variability to the mere act of sexual union nor can we account in all cases for the appearance through budvariation of new characters by the principle of reversion to longlost characters he who wishes to judge how far the conditions of life directly cause each particular variation ought to reflect well on the cases immediately to be given i will commence with budvariations as exhibited in the fruit and then pass on to flowers and finally to leaves  peach amygdalus persica  in the last chapter i gave two cases of a peachalmond and a double flowered almond which suddenly produced fruit closely resembling true peaches i have also given many cases of peachtrees producing buds which when developed into branches have yielded nectarines we have seen that no less than six named and several unnamed varieties of the peach have thus produced several varieties of nectarine i have shown that it is highly improbable that all these peachtrees some of which are old varieties and have been propagated by the million are hybrids from the peach and nectarine and that it is opposed to all analogy to attribute the occasional production of nectarines on peachtrees to the direct action of pollen from some neighbouring nectarinetree several of the cases are highly remarkable because firstly the fruit thus produced has sometimes been in part a nectarine and in part a peach secondly because nectarines thus suddenly produced have reproduced themselves by seed and thirdly because nectarines are produced from peachtrees from seed as well as from buds the seed of the nectarine on the other hand occasionally produces peaches and we have seen in one instance that a nectarinetree yielded peaches by budvariation as the peach is certainly the oldest or primary variety the production of peaches from nectarines either by seeds or buds may perhaps be considered as a case of reversion certain trees have also been described as indifferently bearing peaches or nectarines and this may be considered as budvariation carried to an extreme degree  the grosse mignonne peach at montreuil produced from a sporting branch the grosse mignonne tardive a most excellent variety which ripens its fruit a fortnight later than the parent tree and is equally good 112 gardeners chronicle 1854 page 821 this same peach has likewise produced by budvariation the early grosse mignonne hunts large tawny nectarine originated from hunts small tawny nectarine but not through seminal reproduction 113 lindley guide to orchard as quoted in gardeners chronicle 1852 page 821 for the early mignonne peach see gardeners chronicle 1864 page 1251  plums  mr knight states that a tree of the yellow magnum bonum plum forty years old which had always borne ordinary fruit produced a branch which yielded red magnum bonums 114 transact hort soc volume 2 page 160 mr rivers of sawbridgeworth informs me january 1863 that a single tree out of 400 or 500 trees of the early prolific plum which is a purple kind descended from an old french variety bearing purple fruit produced when about ten years old bright yellow plums these differed in no respect except colour from those on the other trees but were unlike any other known kind of yellow plum 115 see also gardeners chronicle 1863 page 27  cherry prunus cerasus  mr knight has recorded ibid the case of a branch of a mayduke cherry which though certainly never grafted always produced fruit ripening later and more oblong than the fruit on the other branches another account has been given of two mayduke cherrytrees in scotland with branches bearing oblong and very fine fruit which invariably ripened as in knights case a fortnight later than the other cherries 116 gardeners chronicle 1852 page 821 m carriere gives page 37 numerous analogous cases and one of the same tree bearing three kinds of fruit  grapes vitis vinifera  the black or purple frontignan in one case produced during two successive years and no doubt permanently spurs which bore white frontignan grapes in another case on the same footstalk the lower berries were well coloured black frontignans those next the stalk were white with the exception of one black and one streaked berry and altogether there were fifteen black and twelve white berries on the same stalk in another kind of grape black and ambercoloured berries were produced in the same cluster 117 gardeners chronicle 1852 page 629 1856 page 648 1864 page 986 other cases are given by braun rejuvenescence in ray soc bot mem 1853 page 314 count odart describes a variety which often bears on the same stalk small round and large oblong berries though the shape of the berry is generally a fixed character 118 ampelographie etc 1849 page 71 here is another striking case given on the excellent authority of m carriere 119 gardeners chronicle 1866 page 970 a black hamburg grape frankenthal was cut down and produced three suckers one of these was layered and after a time produced much smaller berries which always ripened at least a fortnight earlier than the others of the remaining two suckers one produced every year fine grapes whilst the other although it set an abundance of fruit matured only a few and these of inferior quality  gooseberry ribes grossularia  a remarkable case has been described by dr lindley 1110 gardeners chronicle 1855 pages 597 612 of a bush which bore at the same time no less than four kinds of berries namely hairy and redsmooth small and redgreenand yellow tinged with buff the two latter kinds had a different flavour from the red berries and their seeds were coloured red three twigs on this bush grew close together the first bore three yellow berries and one red the second twig bore four yellow and one red and the third four red and one yellow mr laxton also informs me that he has seen a red warrington gooseberry bearing both red and yellow fruit on the same branch  currant ribes rubrum  a bush purchased as the champagne which is a variety that bears blush coloured fruit intermediate between red and white produced during fourteen years on separate branches and mingled on the same branch berries of the red white and champagne kinds 1111 gardeners chronicle 1842 page 873 1855 page 646 in the chronicle page 876 mr p mackenzie states that the bush still continues to bear the three kinds of fruit although they have not been every year alike the suspicion naturally arises that this variety may have originated from a cross between a red and white variety and that the above transformation may be accounted for by reversion to both parentforms but from the foregoing complex case of the gooseberry this view is doubtful in france a branch of a redcurrant bush about ten years old produced near the summit five white berries and lower down amongst the red berries one berry half red and half white 1112 revue horticole quoted in gardeners chronicle 1844 page 87 alexander braun 1113 rejuvenescence in nature bot memoirs ray soc 1853 page 314 also has often seen branches on white curranttrees bearing red berries  pear pyrus communis  dureau de la malle states that the flowers on some trees of an ancient variety the doyenne galeux were destroyed by frost other flowers appeared in july which produced six pears these exactly resembled in their skin and taste the fruit of a

branches the flowers were identical except in being largest in the greenstemmed variety and smallest in that with variegated foliage these three varieties were subsequently propagated and distributed many branches and some whole plants of a variety called compactum which bears orangescarlet flowers have been seen to produce pink flowers 1125 wp ayres gardeners chronicle 1842 page 791 hills hector

distinct varieties which were undistinguishable from plants known to have been at some time ancestors of the plant in question 1127 dr maxwell masters pop science review july 1872 page 250 of all pelargoniums rollissons unique seems to be the most sportive its origin is not positively known but is believed to be from a cross mr salter of hammersmith states 1128 gardeners chronicle 1861 page 968 that he has himself known this purple variety to produce the lilac the rosecrimson or conspicuum and the red or coccineum varieties the latter has also produced the rose damour so that altogether four varieties have originated by bud variation from rollissons unique mr salter remarks that these four varieties may now be considered as fixed although they occasionally produce flowers of the original colour this year coccineum has pushed flowers of three different colours red rose and lilac upon the same truss and upon other trusses are flowers half red and half lilac besides these four varieties two other scarlet uniques are known to exist both of which occasionally produce lilac flowers identical with rollissons unique 1129 ibid 1861 page 945 but one at least of these did not arise through budvariation but is believed to be a seedling from rollissons unique 1130 w paul gardeners chronicle 1861 page 968 there are also in the trade 1131 ibid page 945 two other slightly different varieties of unknown origin of rollissons unique so that altogether we have a curiously complex case of variation both by buds and seeds 1132 for other cases of budvariation in this same variety see gardeners chronicle 1861 pages 578 600 925 for other distinct cases of budvariation in the genus pelargonium see cottage gardener 1860 page 194 here is a still more complex case m rafarin states that a pale rosecoloured variety produced a branch bearing deep red flowers cuttings were taken from this sport from which 20 plants were raised which flowered in 1867 when it was found that scarcely two were alike some resembled the parentform some resembled the sport some bore both kinds of flowers and even some of the petals on the same flower were rosecoloured and others red 1133 dr maxwell

raised by mr salter has produced by budvariation six distinct sorts five different in colour and one in foliage all of which are now fixed 1135 the chrysanthemum its history and culture by j salter 1865 page 41 etc a variety called cedo nulli bears small yellow flowers but habitually produces branches with white flowers and a specimen was exhibited which prof t dyer saw before the horticultural society the varieties which were first introduced from china were so excessively variable that it was extremely difficult to tell which was the original colour of the variety and which was the sport the same plant would produce one year only buffcoloured and next year only rose coloured flowers and then would change again or produce at the same time flowers of both colours these fluctuating varieties are now all lost and when a branch sports into a new variety it can generally be propagated and kept true but as mr salter remarks every sport should be thoroughly tested in different soils before it can be really considered as fixed as many have been known to run back when planted in rich compost but when sufficient care and time are expended in proving there will exist little danger of subsequent disappointment mr salter informs me that with all the varieties the commonest kind of budvariation is the production of yellow flowers and as this is the primordial colour these cases may be attributed to reversion mr salter has given me a list of seven differently coloured chrysanthemums which have all produced branches with yellow flowers but three of them have also sported into other colours with any change of colour in the flower the foliage generally changes in a corresponding manner in lightness or darkness  another compositous plant namely centauria cyanus when cultivated in a garden not unfrequently produces on the same root flowers of four different colours viz blue white darkpurple and particoloured 1136 bree in loudons gardeners mag volume 8 1832 page 93

rivers rose amateurs guide 1837 page 4 the common double mossrose was imported into england from italy about the year 1735 1139 mr shailer quoted in gardeners chronicle 1848 page 759 its origin is unknown but from analogy it probably arose from the provence rose r centifolia by budvariation for the branches of the common moss rose have several times been known to produce provence roses wholly or partially destitute of moss i have seen one such instance and several others have been recorded 1140 transact hort soc volume 4 1822 page 137 gardeners chronicle 1842 page 422 mr rivers also informs me that he raised two or three roses of the provence class from seed of the old single mossrose 1141 see also loudons arboretum volume 2 page 780 and this latter kind was produced in 1807 by budvariation from the common mossrose the white mossrose was also produced in 1788 by an offset from the common red mossrose it was at first pale blushcoloured but became white by continued budding on cutting down the shoots which had produced this white mossrose two weak shoots were thrown up and buds from these yielded the beautiful striped mossrose the common mossrose has yielded by budvariation besides the old single red mossrose the old scarlet semidouble mossrose and the sageleaf mossrose which has a delicate shelllike form and is of a beautiful blush colour it is now 1852 nearly extinct 1142 all these statements on the origin of the several varieties of the mossrose are given on the authority of mr shailer who together with his father was concerned in their original propagation see gard chronicle 1852 page 759 a white mossrose has been seen to bear a flower half white and half pink 1143 gardeners chronicle 1845 page 564 although several mossroses have thus certainly arisen by budvariation the greater number probably owe their origin to seed of mossroses for mr rivers informs me that his seedlings from the old single mossrose almost always produced mossroses and the old single mossrose was as we have seen the product by budvariation of the double mossrose originally imported from italy that the original mossrose was the product of budvariation is probable from the facts above given and from the de meaux mossrose also a variety of r centifolia 1144 transact hort soc volume 2 page 242 having appeared as a sporting branch on the common rose de meaux prof caspary has carefully described 1145 shriften der phys oekon gesell zu konigsberg february 3 1865 s 4 see also dr casparys paper in transactions of the hort congress of amsterdam 1865 the case of a sixyearold white mossrose which sent up several suckers one of which was thorny and produced red flowers destitute of moss exactly like those of the provence rose r centifolia another shoot bore both kinds of flowers and in addition longitudinally striped flowers as this white mossrose had been grafted on the provence rose prof caspary attributes the above changes to the influence of the stock but from the facts already given and from others to be given bud variation with reversion is probably a sufficient explanation  many other instances could be added of roses varying by buds the white provence rose apparently originated in this way 1146 gardeners chronicle 1852 page 759 m carriere states page 36 that he himself knows of five varieties thus produced by the baronne prevost the double and highlycoloured belladonna rose has produced by suckers both semi double and almost single white roses 1147 transact hort soc volume 2 page 242 whilst suckers from one of these semidouble white roses

carnations and pinks d caryophyllus etc occasionally vary by layers and some kinds are so little certain in character that they are called by floriculturists catch flowers 1153 gardeners chronicle 1843 page 135 mr dickson has ably discussed the running of particoloured or striped carnations and says it cannot be accounted for by the compost in which they are grown layers from the same clean flower would come part of them clean and part foul even when subjected to precisely the same treatment and frequently one flower alone appears influenced by the taint the remainder coming perfectly clean 1154 ibid 1842 page 55 this running of the parti coloured flowers apparently is a case of reversion by buds to the original uniform tint of the species  i will briefly mention some other cases of budvariation to show how many plants belonging to many orders have varied in their flowers and many others might be added i have seen on a snapdragon antirrhinum majus white pink and striped flowers on the same plant and branches with striped flowers on a redcoloured variety on a double stock matthiola incana i have seen a branch bearing single flowers and on a dingypurple double variety of the wallflower cheiranthus cheiri a branch which had reverted to the ordinary copper colour on other branches of the same plant some flowers were exactly divided across the middle one half being purple and the other coppery but some of the smaller petals towards the centre of these same flowers were purple longitudinally streaked with coppery colour or coppery streaked with purple a cyclamen

most probably in all cases owe their origin as shown by prof lecoq to crosses between differently coloured varieties  leaves and shoots  changes through budvariation in fruits and flowers have hitherto been treated of incidentally some remarkable modifications in the leaves and shoots of the rose and paritium and in a lesser degree in the foliage of the pelargonium and chrysanthemum have been noticed i will now add a few more cases of variation in leafbuds verlot 1160 des varietes 1865 page 5 states that on aralia trifoliata which properly has leaves with three leaflets branches frequently appear bearing simple leaves of various forms these can be propagated by buds or by grafting and have given rise as he states to several nominal species  with respect to trees the history of but few of the many varieties with curious or ornamental foliage is known but several probably have originated by budvariation here is one casean old ashtree fraxinus excelsior in the grounds of necton as mr mason states for many years has had one bough of a totally different character to the rest of the tree or of any other ashtree which i have seen being shortjointed and densely covered with foliage it was ascertained that this variety could be propagated by grafts 1161 w mason in gardeners chronicle 1843 page 878 the varieties of some trees with cut leaves as the oakleaved laburnum the parsleyleaved vine and especially the fernleaved beech are apt to revert by buds to the common forms 1162 alex braun ray soc bot mem 1853 page 315 gardeners chron 1841 page 329 the fernlike leaves of the beech sometimes revert only partially and the branches display here and there sprouts bearing common leaves fernlike and variously shaped leaves such cases differ but little from the so called heterophyllus varieties in which the tree habitually bears leaves of various forms but it is probable that most heterophyllous trees have originated as seedlings there is a subvariety of the weeping willow with leaves rolled up into a spiral coil and mr masters states that a tree of this kind kept true in his garden for twentyfive years and then threw out a single upright shoot bearing flat leaves 1163 dr mt masters royal institution lecture march 16 1860  i have often noticed single twigs and branches on beech and other trees with their leaves fully expanded before those on the other branches had opened and as there was nothing in their exposure or character to account for this difference i presume that they had appeared as budvariations like the early and late fruitmaturing varieties of the peach and nectarine  cryptogamic plants are liable to budvariation for fronds on the same fern often display remarkable deviations of structure spores which are of the nature of buds taken from such abnormal fronds reproduce with remarkable fidelity the same variety after passing through the sexual stage 1164 see mr wk bridgemans curious paper in annals and mag of nat hist december 1861 also mr j scott bot soc edinburgh june 12 1862  with respect to colour leaves often become by budvariation zoned blotched or spotted with white yellow and red and this occasionally occurs even with plants in a state of nature variegation however appears still more frequently in plants produced from seed even the cotyledons or seedleaves being thus affected 1165 journal of horticulture 1861 page 336 verlot des varietes page 76 there have been endless disputes whether variegation should be considered as a disease in a future chapter we shall see that it is much influenced both in the case of seedlings and of mature plants by the nature of the soil plants which have become variegated as seedlings generally transmit their character by seed to a large proportion of their progeny and mr salter has given me a list of eight genera in which this occurred 1166 see also verlot des varietes page 74 sir f pollock has given me more precise information he sowed seed from a variegated plant of ballota nigra which was found growing wild and thirty per cent of the seedlings were variegated seed from these latter being sown sixty per cent came up variegated when branches become variegated by budvariation and the variety is attempted to be propagated by seed the seedlings are rarely variegated mr salter found this to be the case with plants belonging to eleven genera in which the greater number of the seedlings proved to be greenleaved yet a few were slightly variegated or were quite white but none were worth keeping variegated plants whether originally produced from seeds or buds can generally be propagated by budding grafting etc but all are apt to revert by bud variation to their ordinary foliage this tendency however differs much in the varieties of even the same species for instance the goldenstriped variety of euonymus japonicus is very liable to run back to the green leaved while the silverstriped variety hardly ever changes 1167 gardeners chron 1844 page 86 i have seen a variety of the holly with its leaves having a central yellow patch which had everywhere partially reverted to the ordinary foliage so that on the same small branch there were many twigs of both kinds in the pelargonium and in some other plants variegation is generally accompanied by some degree of dwarfing as is well exemplified in the dandy pelargonium when such dwarf varieties sport back by buds or suckers to the ordinary foliage the dwarfed stature still remains 1168 ibid 1861 page 963 it is remarkable that plants propagated from branches which have reverted from variegated to plain leaves 1169 ibid 1861 page 433 cottage gardener 1860 page 2 do not always or never as one observer asserts perfectly resemble the original plainleaved plant from which the variegated branch arose it seems that a plant in passing by budvariation from plain leaves to variegated and back again from variegated to plain is generally in some degree affected so as to assume a slightly different aspect  budvariation by suckers tubers and bulbs  all the cases hitherto given of budvariation in fruits flowers leaves and shoots have been confined to buds on the stems or branches with the exception of a few cases incidentally noticed of varying suckers in the rose pelargonium and chrysanthemum i will now give a few instances of variation in subterranean buds that is by suckers tubers and bulbs not that there is any essential difference between buds above and beneath the ground mr salter informs me that two variegated varieties of phlox originated as suckers but i should not have thought these worth mentioning had not mr salter found after repeated trials that he could not propagate them by rootjoints whereas the variegated tussilago farfara can thus be safely propagated 1170 m lemoine quoted in gardeners chronicle 1867 page 74 has lately observed that the symphytum with variegated leaves cannot be propagated by division of the roots he also found that out of 500 plants of a phlox with striped flowers which had been propagated by rootdivision only seven or eight produced striped flowers see also on striped pelargoniums gardeners chronicle 1867 page 1000 but this latter plant may have originated as a variegated seedling which would account for its greater fixedness of character the barberry berberis vulgaris offers an analogous case there is a wellknown variety with seedless fruit which can be propagated by cuttings or layers but suckers always revert to the common form which produces fruit containing seeds 1171 anderson recreations in agriculture volume 5 page 152 my father repeatedly tried this experiment and always with the same result i may here mention that maize and wheat sometimes produce new varieties from the stock or root as does the sugarcane 1172 for wheat see improvement of the cereals by p shirreff 1873 page 47 for maize and sugarcane carriere ibid pages 40 42 with respect to the sugarcane mr j caldwell of mauritius says gardeners chronicle 1874 page 316 the ribbon cane has here sported into a perfectly green cane and a perfectly red cane from the same head i verified this myself and saw at least 200 instances in the same plantation and the fact has completely upset all our preconceived ideas of the difference of colour being permanent the conversion of a striped cane into a green cane was not uncommon but the change into a red cane universally disbelieved and that both events should occur in the same plant incredible i find however in fleischmans report on sugar cultivation in louisiana for 1848 by the american patent office the circumstance is mentioned but he says he never saw it himself  turning now to tubers in the common potato solanum tuberosum a single bud or eye sometimes varies and produces a new variety or occasionally and this is a much more remarkable circumstance all the eyes in a tuber vary in the same manner and at the same time so that the whole tuber assumes a new character for instance a single eye in a tuber of the old fortyfold potato which is a purple variety was observed 1173 gardeners chronicle 1857 page 662 to become white this eye was cut out and planted separately and the kind has since been largely propagated kemps potato is properly white but a plant in lancashire produced two tubers which were red and two which were white the red kind was propagated in the usual manner by eyes and kept true to its new colour and being found a more productive variety soon became widely known under the name of taylors fortyfold 1174 gard chronicle 1841 page 814 the old fortyfold potato as already stated is a purple variety but a plant long cultivated on the same ground produced not as in the case above given a single white eye but a whole white tuber which has since been propagated and keeps true 1175 ibid 1857 page 613 several cases have been recorded of large portions of whole rows of potatoes slightly changing their character 1176 ibid 1857 page 679 see also philips hist of vegetables volume 2 page 91 for other and similar accounts  dahlias propagated by tubers under the hot climate of st domingo vary much sir r schomburgk gives the case of the butterfly variety which the second year produced on the same plant double and single flowers here white petals edged with maroon there of a uniform deep maroon 1177 journal of proc linn soc volume 2 botany page 132 mr bree also mentions a plant which bore two different kinds of selfcoloured flowers as well as a third kind which partook of both colours beautifully intermixed 1178 loudons gardeners mag volume 8 1832 page 94 another case is described of a dahlia with purple flowers which bore a white flower streaked with purple 1179 gard chronicle 1850 page 536 and 1842 page 729  considering how long and extensively many bulbous plants have been cultivated and how numerous are the varieties produced from seed these plants have not perhaps varied so much by offsetsthat is by the production of new bulbsas might have been expected with the hyacinth however several instances have been given by m carriere a case also has been recorded of a blue variety which for three successive years gave offsets producing white flowers with a red centre 1180 des jacinthes etc amsterdam 1768 page 122 another hyacinth bore 1181 gardeners chronicle 1845 page 212 on the same truss a perfectly pink and a perfectly blue flower i have seen a bulb producing at the same time one stalk or truss with fine blue flowers another with fine red flowers and a third with blue flowers on one side and red on the other several of the flowers being also longitudinally striped red and blue  mr john scott informs me that in 1862 imatophyllum miniatum in the botanic gardens of edinburgh threw up a sucker which differed from the normal form in the leaves being tworanked instead of fourranked the leaves were also smaller with the upper surface raised instead of being channelled  in the propagation of tulips seedlings are raised called selfs or breeders which consist of one plain colour on a white or yellow bottom these being cultivated on a dry and rather poor soil become broken or variegated and produce new varieties the time that elapses before they break varies from one to twenty years or more and sometimes this change never takes place 1182 loudons encyclopaedia of gardening page 1024 the broken or variegated colours which give value to all tulips are due to budvariation for although the bybloemens and some other kinds have been raised from several distinct breeders yet all the baguets are said to have come from a single breeder or seedling this budvariation in accordance with the views of mm vilmorin and verlot 1183 production des varietes 1865 p 63 is probably an attempt to revert to that uniform colour which is natural to the species a tulip however which has already become broken when treated with too strong manure is liable to flush or lose by a second act of reversion its variegated colours some kinds as imperatrix florum are much more liable than others to flushing and mr dickson maintains 1184 gardeners chronicle 1841 page 782 1842 page 55 that this can no more be accounted for than the variation of any other plant he believes that english growers from care in choosing seed from broken flowers instead of from plain flowers have to a certain extent diminished the tendency in flowers already broken to flushing or secondary reversion iris xiphium according to m carriere page 65 behaves in nearly the same manner as do so many tulips  during two consecutive years all the early flowers in a bed of tigridia conchiflora 1185 gardeners chron 1849 page 565 resembled those of the old t pavonia but the later flowers assumed their proper colour of fine yellow spotted with crimson an apparently authentic account has been published 1186 transact lin soc volume 2 page 354 of two forms of hemerocallis which have been universally considered as distinct species changing into each other for the roots of the largeflowered tawny h fulva being divided and planted in a different soil and place produced the smallflowered h flava as well as some intermediate forms it is doubtful whether such cases as these latter as well as the flushing of broken tulips and the running of particoloured carnationsthat is their more or less complete return to a uniform tintought to be classed under budvariation or ought to be retained for the chapter in which i treat of the direct action of the conditions of life on organic beings these cases however have this much in budvariation that the change is effected through buds and not through seminal reproduction but on the other hand there is this differencethat in ordinary cases of bud variation one bud alone changes whilst in the foregoing cases all the buds on the same plant were modified together with the potato we have seen an intermediate case for all the eyes in one tuber simultaneously changed their character  i will conclude with a few allied cases which may be ranked either under budvariation or under the direct action of the conditions of life when the common hepatica is transplanted from its native woods the flowers change colour even during the first year 1187 godron de lespece tome 2 page 84 it is notorious that the improved varieties of the heartsease viola tricolor when transplanted often produce flowers widely different in size form and colour for instance i transplanted a large uniformlycoloured dark purple variety whilst in full flower and it then produced much smaller more elongated flowers with the lower petals yellow these were succeeded by flowers marked with large purple spots and ultimately towards the end of the same summer by the original large dark purple flowers the slight changes which some fruittrees undergo from being grafted and regrafted on various stocks 1188 m carriere has lately described in the revue horticole december 1 1866 page 457 an extraordinary case he twice inserted grafts of the aria vestita on thorn trees epines growing in pots and the grafts as they grew produced shoots with bark buds leaves petioles petals and flowerstalks all widely different from those of the aria the grafted shoots were also much hardier and flowered earlier than those on the ungrafted aria were considered by andrew knight 1189 transact hort soc volume 2 page 160 as closely allied to sporting branches or budvariations again we have the case of young fruittrees changing their character as they grow old seedling pears for instance lose with age their spines and improve in the flavour of their fruit weeping birchtrees when grafted on the common variety do not acquire a perfect pendulous habit until they grow old on the other hand i shall hereafter give the case of some weeping ashes which slowly and gradually assumed an upright habit of growth all such changes dependent on age may be compared with the changes alluded to in the last chapter which many trees naturally undergo as in the case of the deodar and cedar of lebanon which are unlike in youth whilst they closely resemble each other in old age and as with certain oaks and with some varieties of the lime and hawthorn 1190 for the cases of oaks see alph de candolle in bibl univers geneva november 1862 for limes etc loudons gard mag volume 11 1835 page 503  grafthybrids  before giving a summary on budvariation i will discuss some singular and anomalous cases which are more or less closely related to this same subject i will begin with the famous case of adams laburnum or cytisus adami a form or hybrid intermediate between two very distinct species namely c laburnum and purpureus the common and purple laburnum but as this tree has often been described i will be as brief as i can  throughout europe in different soils and under different climates branches on this tree have repeatedly and suddenly reverted to the two parent species in their flowers and leaves to behold mingled on the same tree tufts of dingyred bright yellow and purple flowers borne on branches having widely different leaves and manner of growth is a surprising sight the same raceme sometimes bears two kinds of flowers and i have seen a single flower exactly divided into halves one side being bright yellow and the other purple so that one half of the standardpetal was yellow and of larger size and the other half purple and smaller in another flower the whole corolla was bright yellow but exactly half the calyx was purple in another one of the dingyred wingpetals had a narrow bright yellow stripe on it and lastly in another flower one of the stamens which had become slightly foliaceous was half yellow and half purple so that the tendency to segregation of character or reversion affects even single parts and organs 1191 for analogous facts see braun rejuvenescence in ray soc bot mem 1853 page 320 and gardeners chronicle 1842 page 397 also braun in sitzungsberichte der ges naturforschender freunde june 1873 page 63 the most remarkable fact about this tree is that in its intermediate state even when growing near both parentspecies it is quite sterile but when the flowers become pure yellow or pure purple they yield seed i believe that the pods from the yellow flowers yield a full complement of seed they certainly yield a larger number two seedlings raised by mr herbert from such seed 1192 journal of hort soc volume 2 1847 page 100 exhibited a purple tinge on the stalks of their flowers but several seedlings raised by myself resembled in every character the common laburnum with the exception that some of them had remarkably long racemes these seedlings were perfectly fertile that such purity of character and fertility should be suddenly reacquired from so hybridised and sterile a form is an astonishing phenomenon the branches with purple flowers appear at first sight exactly to resemble those of c purpureus but on careful comparison i found that they differed from the pure species in the shoots being thicker the leaves a little broader and the flowers slightly shorter with the corolla and calyx less brightly purple the basal part of the standardpetal also plainly showed a trace of the yellow stain so that the flowers at least in this instance had not perfectly recovered their true character and in accordance with this they were not perfectly fertile for many of the pods contained no seed some produced one and very few contained as many as two seeds whilst numerous pods on a tree of the pure c purpureus in my garden contained three four and five fine seeds the pollen moreover was very imperfect a multitude of grains being small and shrivelled and this is a singular fact for as we shall immediately see the pollengrains in the dingyred and sterile flowers on the parenttree were in external appearance in a much better state and included very few shrivelled grains although the pollen of the reverted purple flowers was in so poor a condition the ovules were well formed and the seeds when mature germinated freely with me mr herbert raised plants from seeds of the reverted purple flowers and they differed a very little from the usual state of c purpureus some which i raised in the same manner did not differ at all either in the character of their flowers or of the whole bush from the pure c purpureus prof caspary has examined the ovules of the dingyred and sterile flowers in several plants of c adami on the continent 1193 see transact of hort congress of amsterdam 1865 but i owe most of the following information to prof casparys letters and finds them generally monstrous in three plants examined by me in england the ovules were likewise monstrous the nucleus varying much in shape and projecting irregularly beyond the proper coats the pollen grains on the other hand judging from their external appearance were remarkably good and readily protruded their tubes by repeatedly counting under the microscope the proportional number of bad grains prof caspary ascertained that only 25 per cent were bad which is a less proportion than in the pollen of three pure species of cytisus in their cultivated state viz c purpureus laburnum and alpinus although the pollen of c adami is thus in appearance good it does not follow according to m naudins observation 1194 nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 143 on mirabilis that it would be functionally effective the fact of the ovules of c adami being monstrous and the pollen apparently sound is all the more remarkable because it is opposed to what usually occurs not only with most hybrids 1195 see on this head naudin ibid page 141 but with two hybrids in the same genus namely in c purpureoelongatus and c alpinolaburnum in both these hybrids the ovules as observed by prof caspary and myself were wellformed whilst many of the pollengrains were illformed in the latter hybrid 203 per cent and in the former no less than 848 per cent of the grains were ascertained by prof caspary to be bad this unusual condition of the male and female reproductive elements in c adami has been used by prof caspary as an argument against this plant being considered as an ordinary hybrid produced from seed but we should remember that with hybrids the ovules have not been examined nearly so frequently as the pollen and they may be much oftener imperfect than is generally supposed dr e bornet of antibes informs me through mr j traherne moggridge that with hybrid cisti the ovarium is frequently deformed the ovules being in some cases quite absent and in other cases incapable of fertilisation  several theories have been propounded to account for the origin of c adami and for the transformations which it undergoes the whole case has been attributed by some authors to budvariation but considering the wide difference between c laburnum and purpureus both of which are natural species and considering the sterility of the intermediate form this view may be summarily rejected we shall presently see that with hybrid plants two embryos differing in their characters may be developed within the same seed and cohere and it has been supposed that c adami thus originated many botanists maintain that c adami is a hybrid produced in the common way by seed and that it has reverted by buds to its two parentforms negative results are not of much value but reisseck caspary and myself tried in vain to cross c laburnum and purpureus when i fertilised the former with pollen of the latter i had the nearest approach to success for pods were formed but in sixteen days after the withering of the flowers they fell off nevertheless the belief that c adami is a spontaneously produced hybrid between these two species is supported by the fact that such hybrids have arisen in this genus in a bed of seedlings from c elongatus which grew near to c purpureus and was probably fertilised by it through the agency of insects for these as i know by experiment play an important part in the fertilisation of the laburnum the sterile hybrid c purpureoelongatus appeared 1196 braun in bot mem ray soc 1853 page 23 thus also waterers laburnum the c alpinolaburnum 1197 this hybrid has never been described it is exactly intermediate in foliage time of flowering dark striae at the base of the standard petal hairiness of the ovarium and in almost every other character between c laburnum and alpinus but it approaches the former species more nearly in colour and exceeds it in the length of the racemes we have before seen that 203 per cent of its pollengrains are illformed and worthless my plant though growing not above thirty or forty yards from both parentspecies during some seasons yielded no good seeds but in 1866 it was unusually fertile and its long racemes produced from one to occasionally even four pods many of the pods contained no good seeds but generally they contained a single apparently good seed sometimes two and in one case three seeds some of these seeds germinated and i raised two trees from them one resembles the present form the other has a remarkable dwarf character with small leaves but has not yet flowered spontaneously appeared as i am informed by mr waterer in a bed of seedlings  on the other hand we have a clear and distinct account given to poiteau 1198 annales de la soc de lhort de paris tome 7 1830 page 93 by m adam who raised the plant showing that c adami is not an ordinary hybrid but is what may be called a grafthybrid that is one produced from the united cellular tissue of two distinct species m adam inserted in the usual manner a shield of the bark of c purpureus into a stock of c laburnum and the bud lay dormant as often happens for a year the shield then produced many buds and shoots one of which grew more upright and vigorous with larger leaves than the shoots of c purpureus and was consequently propagated now it deserves especial notice that these plants were sold by m adam as a variety of c purpureus before they had flowered and the account was published by poiteau after the plants had flowered but before they had exhibited their remarkable tendency to revert into the two parent species so that there was no conceivable motive for falsification and it is difficult to see how there could have been any error 1199 an account was given in the gardeners chronicle 1857 pages 382 400 of a common laburnum on which grafts of c purpureus had been inserted and which gradually assumed the character of c adami but i have little doubt that c adami had been sold to the purchaser who was not a botanist in the place of c purpureus i have ascertained that this occurred in another instance if we admit as true m adams account we must admit the extraordinary fact that two distinct species can unite by their cellular tissue and subsequently produce a plant bearing leaves and sterile flowers intermediate in character between the scion and stock and producing buds liable to reversion in short resembling in every important respect a hybrid formed in the ordinary way by seminal reproduction  i will therefore give all the facts which i have been able to collect on the formation of hybrids between distinct species or varieties without the intervention of the sexual organs for if as i am now convinced this is possible it is a most important fact which will sooner or later change the views held by physiologists with respect to sexual reproduction a sufficient body of facts will afterwards be adduced showing that the segregation or separation of the characters of the two parentforms by bud variation as in the case of cytisus adami is not an unusual though a striking phenomenon we shall further see that a whole bud may thus revert or only half or some smaller segment  the famous bizzarria orange offers a strictly parallel case to that of cytisus adami the gardener who in 1644 in florence raised this tree declared that it was a seedling which had been grafted and after the graft had perished the stock sprouted and produced the bizzarria gallesio who carefully examined several living specimens and compared them with the description given by the original describer p nato 11100 gallesio gli agrumi dei giard bot agrar di firenze 1839 page 11 in his traite du citrus 1811 page 146 he speaks as if the compound fruit consisted in part of a lemon but this apparently was a mistake states that the tree produces at the same time leaves flowers and fruit identical with the bitter orange and with the citron of florence and likewise compound fruit with the two kinds either blended together both externally and internally or segregated in various ways this tree can be propagated by cuttings and retains its diversified character the socalled trifacial orange of alexandria and smyrna 11101 gardeners chron 1855 page 628 see also prof caspary in transact hort congress of amsterdam 1865 resembles in its general nature the bizzarria and differs only in the orange being of the sweet kind this and the citron are blended together in the same fruit or are separately produced on the same tree nothing is known of its origin in regard to the bizzarria many authors believe that it is a grafthybrid gallesio on the other hand thinks that it is an ordinary hybrid with the habit of partially reverting by buds to the two parent forms and we have seen that the species in this genus often cross spontaneously  it is notorious that when the variegated jessamine is budded on the common kind the stock sometimes produces buds bearing variegated leaves mr rivers as he informs me has seen instances of this the same thing occurs with the oleander 11102 gartner bastarderzeugung s 611 gives many references on this subject mr rivers on the authority of a trustworthy friend states that some buds of a goldenvariegated ash which were inserted into common ashes all died except one but the ashstocks were affected 11103 a nearly similar account was given by brabley in 1724 in his treatise on husbandry volume 1 page 199 and produced both above and below the points of insertion of the plates of bark bearing the dead buds shoots which bore variegated leaves mr j anderson henry has communicated to me a nearly similar case mr brown of perth observed many years ago in a highland glen an ashtree with yellow leaves and buds taken from this tree were inserted into common ashes which in consequence were affected and produced the blotched breadalbane ash this variety has been propagated and has preserved its character during the last fifty years weeping ashes also were budded on the affected stocks and became similarly variegated it has been repeatedly proved that several species of abutilon on which the variegated a thompsonii has been grafted become variegated 11104 morren bull de lacad r des sciences de belgique 2de series tome 28 1869 page 434 also magnus gesellschaft naturforschender freunde berlin february 21 1871 page 13 ibid june 21 1870 and october 17 1871 also bot zeitung february 24 1871  many authors consider variegation as the result of disease and the foregoing cases may be looked at as the direct result of the inoculation of a disease or some weakness this has been almost proved to be the case by morren in the excellent paper just referred to who shows that even a leaf inserted by its footstalk into the bark of the stock is sufficient to communicate variegation to it though the leaf soon perishes even fully formed leaves on the stock of abutilon are sometimes affected by the graft and become variegated variegation is much influenced as we shall hereafter see by the nature of the soil in which the plants are grown and it does not seem improbable that whatever change in the sap or tissues certain soils induce whether or not called a disease might spread from the inserted piece of bark to the stock but a change of this kind cannot be considered to be of the nature of a grafthybrid  there is a variety of the hazel with darkpurple leaves like those of the copperbeech no one has attributed this colour to disease and it apparently is only an exaggeration of a tint which may often be seen on the leaves of the common hazel when this variety is grafted on the common hazel 11105 loudons arboretum volume 4 page 2595 it sometimes colours as has been asserted the leaves below the graft although negative evidence is not of much value i may add that mr rivers who has possessed hundreds of such grafted trees has never seen an instance  gartner 11106 bastarderzeugung s 619 quotes two separate accounts of branches of dark and whitefruited vines which had been united in various ways such as being split longitudinally and then joined etc and these branches produced distinct bunches of grapes of the two colours and other bunches with berries either striped or of an intermediate and new tint even the leaves in one case were variegated these facts are the more remarkable because andrew knight never succeeded in raising variegated grapes by fertilising white kinds by pollen of dark kinds though as we have seen he obtained seedlings with variegated fruits and leaves by fertilising a white variety by the already variegated dark aleppo grape gartner attributes the abovequoted cases merely to budvariation but it is a strange coincidence that the branches which had been grafted in a peculiar manner should alone thus have varied and h adorne de tscharner positively asserts that he produced the described result more than once and could do so at will by splitting and uniting the branches in the manner described by him  i should not have quoted the following case had not the author of des jacinthes 11107 amsterdam 1768 page 124 impressed me with the belief not only of his extensive knowledge but of his truthfulness he says that bulbs of blue and red hyacinths may be cut in two and that they will grow together and throw up a united stem and this i have myself seen with flowers of the two colours on the opposite sides but the remarkable point is that flowers are sometimes produced with the two colours blended together which makes the case closely analogous with that of the blended colours of the grapes on the united vine branches  in the case of roses it is supposed that several grafthybrids have been formed but there is much doubt about these cases owing to the frequency of ordinary budvariations the most trustworthy instance known to me is one recorded by mr poynter 11108 gardeners chron 1860 page 672 with a woodcut who assures me in a letter of the entire accuracy of the statement rosa devoniensis had been budded some years previously on a white banksian rose and from the much enlarged point of junction whence the devoniensis and banksian still continued to grow a third branch issued which was neither pure banksian nor pure devoniensis but partook of the character of both the flowers resembled but were superior in character to those of the variety called lamarque one of the noisettes while the shoots were similar in their manner of growth to those of the banksian rose with the exception that the longer and more robust shoots were furnished with prickles this rose was exhibited before the floral committee of the horticultural society of london dr lindley examined it and concluded that it had certainly been produced by the mingling of r banksiae with some rose like r devoniensis for while it was very greatly increased in vigour and in size of all the parts the leaves were halfway between a banksian and teascented rose it appears that rosegrowers were previously aware that the banksian rose sometimes affects other roses as mr poynters new variety is intermediate in its fruit and foliage between the stock and scion and as it arose from the point of junction between the two it is very improbable that it owes its origin to mere budvariation independently of the mutual influence of the stock and scion  lastly with respect to potatoes mr r trail stated in 1867 before the botanical society of edinburgh and has since given me fuller information that several years ago he cut about sixty blue and white potatoes into halves through the eyes or buds and then carefully joined them destroying at the same time the other eyes some of these united tubers produced white and others blue tubers some however produced tubers partly white and partly blue and the tubers from about four or five were regularly mottled with the two colours in these latter cases we may conclude that a stem had been formed by the union of the bisected buds that is by graft hybridisation  in the botanische zeitung may 16 1868 professor hildebrand gives an account with a coloured figure of his experiments on two varieties which were found during the same season to be constant in character namely a somewhat elongated roughskinned red potato and a rounded smooth white one he inserted buds reciprocally into both kinds destroying the other buds he thus raised two plants and each of these produced a tuber intermediate in character between the two parentforms that from the red bud grafted into the white tuber was at one end red and rough as the whole tuber ought to have been if not affected in the middle it was smooth with red stripes and at the other end smooth and altogether white like that of the stock  mr taylor who had received several accounts of potatoes having been grafted by wedgeshaped pieces of one variety inserted into another though sceptical on the subject made twentyfour experiments which he described in detail before the horticultural society 11109 gardeners chronicle 1869 page 220 he thus raised many new varieties some like the graft or like the stock others having an intermediate character several persons witnessed the digging up of the tubers from these grafthybrids and one of them mr jameson a large dealer in potatoes writes thus they were such a mixed lot as i have never before or since seen they were of all colours and shapes some very ugly and some very handsome another witness says some were round some kidney pinkeyed kidney piebald and mottled red and purple of all shapes and sizes some of these varieties have been found valuable and have been extensively propagated mr jameson took away a large piebald potato which he cut into five sets and propagated these yielded round white red and piebald potatoes  mr fitzpatrick followed a different plan 11110 gard chronicle 1869 page 335 he grafted together not the tubers but the young stems of varieties producing black white and red potatoes the tubers borne by three of these twin or united plants were coloured in an extraordinary manner one was almost exactly half black and half white so that some persons on seeing it thought that two potatoes had been divided and rejoined other tubers were half red and half white or curiously mottled with red and white or with red and black according to the colours of the graft and stock  the testimony of mr fenn is of much value as he is a well known potato grower who has raised many new varieties by crossing different kinds in the ordinary manner he considers it demonstrated that new intermediate varieties can be produced by grafting the tubers though he doubts whether such will prove valuable 11111 gardeners chronicle 1869 page 1018 with remarks by dr masters on the adhesion of the united wedges see also ibid 1870 pages 1277 1283 he made many trials and laid the results exhibiting specimens before the horticultural society not only were the tubers affected some being smooth and white at one end and rough and red at the other but the stems and leaves were modified in their manner of growth colour and precocity some of these grafthybrids after being propagated for three years still showed in their haulms their new character different from that of the kind from which the eyes had been taken mr fenn gave twelve of the tubers of the third generation to mr alex dean who grew them and was thus converted into a believer in graft hybridisation having previously been a complete sceptic for comparison he planted the pure parentforms alongside the twelve tubers and found that many of the plants from the latter 11112 gard chronicle 1871 page 837 were intermediate between the two parentforms in precocity in the tallness uprightness jointing and robustness of the stems and in the size and colour of the leaves  another experimentalist mr rintoul grafted no less than fiftynine tubers which differed in shape some being kidneys in smoothness and colour 11113 gardeners chronicle 1870 page 1506 and many of the plants thus raised were intermediate in the tubers as well as in the haulms he describes the more striking cases  in 1871 i received a letter from mr merrick of boston usa who states that mr fearing burr a very careful experimenter and author of a much valued book the garden vegetables of america has succeeded in producing distinctly mottled and most curious potatoesevidently grafthybrids by inserting eyes from blue or red potatoes into the substance of white ones after removing the eyes of the latter i have seen the potatoes and they are very curious  we will now turn to the experiments made in germany since the publication of prof hildebrands paper herr magnus relates 11114 sitzungsberichte der gesellschaft naturforschender freunde zu berlin october 17 1871 the results of numerous trials made by herren reuter and lindemuth both attached to the royal gardens of berlin they inserted the eyes of red potatoes into white ones and vice versa many different forms partaking of the characters of the inserted bud and of the stock were thus obtained for instance some of the tubers were white with red eyes  herr magnus also exhibited in the following year before the same society november 19 1872 the produce of grafts between black white and red potatoes made by dr neubert these were made by uniting not the tubers but the young stems as was done by mr fitzpatrick the result was remarkable inasmuch as all the tubers thus produced were intermediate in character though in a variable degree those between the black and the white or the red were the most striking in appearance some from between the white and red had one half of one colour and the other half of the other colour  at the next meeting of the society herr magnus communicated the results of dr heimanns experiments in grafting together the tubers of red saxon blue and elongated white potatoes the eyes were removed by a cylindrical instrument and inserted into corresponding holes in other varieties the plants thus produced yielded a great number of tubers which were intermediate between the two parentforms in shape and in the colour both of the flesh and skin  herr reuter experimented 11115 ibid november 17 1874 see also excellent remarks by herr magnus by inserting wedges of the elongated white mexican potato into a black kidney potato both sorts are known to be very constant and differ much not only in form and colour but in the eyes of the black kidney being deeply sunk whereas those of the white mexican are superficial and of a different shape the tubers produced by these hybrids were intermediate in colour and form and some which resembled in form the graft ie the mexican had eyes deeply sunk and of the same shape as in the stock or black kidney  any one who will attentively consider the abstract now given of the experiments made by many observers in several countries will i think be convinced that by grafting two varieties of the potato together in various ways hybridised plants can be produced it should be observed that several of the experimentalists are scientific horticulturists and some of them potatogrowers on a large scale who though beforehand sceptical have been fully convinced of the possibility even of the ease of making graft hybrids the only way of escaping from this conclusion is to attribute all the many recorded cases to simple budvariation undoubtedly the potato as we have seen in this chapter does sometimes though not often vary by buds but it should be especially noted that it is experienced potato growers whose business it is to look out for new varieties who have expressed unbounded astonishment at the number of new forms produced by grafthybridisation it may be argued that it is merely the operation of grafting and not the union of two kinds which causes so extraordinary an amount of budvariation but this objection is at once answered by the fact that potatoes are habitually propagated by the tubers being cut into pieces and the sole difference in the case of grafthybrids is that either a half or a smaller segment or a cylinder is placed in close opposition with the tissue of another variety moreover in two cases the young stems were grafted together and the plants thus united yielded the same results as when the tubers were united it is an argument of the greatest weight that when varieties are produced by simple budvariation they frequently present quite new characters whereas in all the numerous cases above given as herr magnus likewise insists the grafthybrids are intermediate in character between the two forms employed that such a result should follow if the one kind did not affect the other is incredible  characters of all kinds are affected by graft hybridisation in whatever way the grafting may have been effected the plants thus raised yield tubers which partake of the widely different colours form state of surface position and shape of the eye of the parents and according to two careful observers they are also intermediate in certain constitutional peculiarities but we should bear in mind that in all the varieties of the potato the tubers differ much more than any other part  the potato affords the best evidence of the possibility of the formation of grafthybrids but we must not overlook the account given of the origin of the famous cytisus adami by m adam who had no conceivable motive for deception and the exactly parallel account of the origin of the bizzarria orange namely by grafthybridisation nor must the cases be undervalued in which different varieties or species of vines hyacinths and roses have been grafted together and have yielded intermediate forms it is evident that grafthybrids can be made much more easily with some plants as the potato than with others for instance our common fruit trees for these latter have been grafted by the million during many centuries and though the graft is often slightly affected it is very doubtful whether this may not be accounted for merely by a more or less free supply of nutriment nevertheless the cases above given seem to me to prove that under certain unknown conditions grafthybridisation can be effected  herr magnus asserts with much truth that grafthybrids resemble in all respects seminal hybrids including their great diversity of character there is however a partial exception inasmuch as the characters of the two parent forms are not often homogeneously blended together in graft hybrids they much more commonly appear in a segregated conditionthat is in segments either at first or subsequently through reversion it would seem that the reproductive elements are not so completely blended by grafting as by sexual generation but segregation of this kind occurs by no means rarely as will be immediately shown in seminal hybrids finally it must i think be admitted that we learn from the foregoing cases a highly important physiological fact namely that the elements that go to the production of a new being are not necessarily formed by the male and female organs they are present in the cellular tissue in such a state that they can unite without the aid of the sexual organs and thus give rise to a new bud partaking of the characters of the two parentforms  on the segregation of the parental characters in seminal hybrids by bud variation  i will now give a sufficient number of cases to show that segregation of this kind namely by buds may occur in ordinary hybrids raised from seed  hybrids were raised by gartner between tropaeolum minus and majus 11116 bastarderzeugung s 549 it is however doubtful whether these plants should be ranked as species or varieties which at first produced flowers intermediate in size colour and structure between their two parents but later in the season some of these plants produced flowers in all respects like those of the motherform mingled with flowers still retaining the usual intermediate condition a hybrid cereus between c speciosissimus and phyllanthus 11117 gartner ibid s 550 plants which are widely different in appearance produced for the first three years angular five sided stems and then some flat stems like those of c phyllanthus kolreuter also gives cases of hybrid lobelias and verbascums which at first produced flowers of one colour and later in the season flowers of a different colour 11118 journal de physique tome 23 1873 page 100 act acad st petersburgh 1781 part 1

or quarter or lesser segment was smooth and of small size like the capsule of the pure d laevis the remaining part being spinose and of larger size like the capsule of the pure d stramonium from one of these composite capsules plants perfectly resembling both parentforms were raised  turning now to varieties a seedling apple conjectured to be of crossed parentage has been described in france 11120 lhermes january 14 1837 quoted in loudons gardeners mag volume 13 page 230 which bears fruit with one half larger than the other of a red colour acid taste and peculiar odour the other side being greenishyellow and very sweet it is said scarcely ever to include perfectly developed seed i suppose that this is not the same tree as that which gaudichaud 11121 comptes rendus tome 34 1852 page 746 exhibited before the french institute bearing on the same branch two distinct kinds of apples one a reinette rouge and the other like a reinette canada jaunatre this doublebearing variety can be propagated by grafts and continues to produce both kinds its origin is unknown the rev jd la touche sent me a coloured drawing of an apple which he brought from canada of which half surrounding and including the whole of the calyx and the insertion of the footstalk is green the other half being brown and of the nature of the pomme gris apple with the line of separation between the two halves exactly defined the tree was a grafted one and mr la touche thinks that the branches which bore this curious apple sprung from the point of junction of the graft and stock had this fact been ascertained the case would probably have come into the class of grafthybrids already given but the branch may have sprung from the stock which no doubt was a seedling  prof h lecoq who has made a great number of crossings between the differently coloured varieties of mirabilis jalapa 11122 geograph bot de leurope tome 3 1854 page 405 and de la fecondation 1862 page 302 finds that in the seedlings the colours rarely combine but form distinct stripes or half the flower is of one colour and half of a different colour some varieties regularly bear flowers striped with yellow white and red but plants of such varieties occasionally produce on the same root branches with uniformly coloured flowers of all three tints and other branches with halfandhalf coloured flowers and others with marbled flowers gallesio 11123 traite du citrus 1811 page 45 crossed reciprocally white and red carnations and the seedlings were striped but some of the striped plants also bore entirely white and entirely red flowers some of these plants produced one year red flowers alone and in the following year striped flowers or conversely some plants after having borne for two or three years striped flowers would revert and bear exclusively red flowers it may be worth mentioning that i fertilised the purple sweetpea lathyrus odoratus with pollen from the lightcoloured painted lady seedlings raised from the same pod were not intermediate in character but perfectly resembled either parent later in the summer the plants which had at first borne flowers identical with those of the painted lady produced flowers streaked and blotched with purple showing in these darker marks a tendency to reversion to the mothervariety andrew knight 11124 transact linn soc volume 9 page 268 fertilised two white grapes with pollen of the aleppo grape which is darkly variegated both in its leaves and fruit the result was that the young seedlings were not at first variegated but all became variegated during the succeeding summer besides this many produced on the same plant bunches of grapes which were all black or all white or leadcoloured striped with white or white dotted with minute black stripes and grapes of all these shades could frequently be found on the same footstalk  i will append a very curious case not of budvariation but of two cohering embryos different in character and contained within the same seed a distinguished botanist mr gh thwaites 11125 annals and mag of nat hist march 1848 states that a seed from fuchsia coccinea fertilised by f fulgens contained two embryos and was a true vegetable twin the two plants produced from the two embryos were extremely different in appearance and character though both resembled other hybrids of the same parentage produced at the same time these twin plants were closely coherent below the two pairs of cotyledonleaves into a single cylindrical stem so that they had subsequently the appearance of being branches on one trunk had the two united stems grown up to their full height instead of dying a curiously mixed hybrid would have been produced a mongrel melon described by sageret 11126 pomologie physiolog 1830 page 126 may perhaps have thus originated for the two main branches which arose from two cotyledonbuds produced very different fruiton the one branch like that of the paternal variety and on the other branch like to a certain extent that of the maternal variety the melon of china  in most of these cases of crossed varieties and in some of the cases of crossed species the colours proper to both parents appeared in the seedlings as soon as they first flowered in the form of stripes or larger segments or as whole flowers or fruit of different kinds borne on the same plant and in this case the appearance of the two colours cannot strictly be said to be due to reversion but to some incapacity of fusion when however the later flowers or fruit produced during the same season or during a succeeding year or generation become striped or halfandhalf etc the segregation of the two colours is strictly a case of reversion by budvariation whether all the many recorded cases of striped flowers and fruit are due to previous hybridisation and reversion is by no means clear for instance with peaches and nectarines mossroses etc in a future chapter i shall show that with animals of crossed parentage the same individual has been known to change its character during growth and to revert to one of its parents which it did not at first resemble finally from the various facts now given there can be no doubt that the same individual plant whether a hybrid or a mongrel sometimes returns in its leaves flowers and fruit either wholly or by segments to both parent forms  on the direct or immediate action of the male element on the mother form  another remarkable class of facts must be here considered firstly because they have a high physiological importance and secondly because they have been supposed to account for some cases of budvariation i refer to the direct action of the male element not in the ordinary way on the ovules but on certain parts of the female plant or in case of animals on the subsequent progeny of the female by a second male i may premise that with plants the ovarium and the coats of the ovules are obviously parts of the female and it could not have been anticipated that they would have been affected by the pollen of a foreign variety or species although the development of the embryo inside the embryonic sack inside the ovule and ovarium of course depends on the male element  even as long ago as 1729 it was observed 11127 philosophical transact volume 43 174445 page 525 that white and blue varieties of the pea when planted near each other mutually crossed no doubt through the agency of bees and in the autumn blue and white peas were found within the same pods wiegmann made an exactly similar observation in the present century the same result has followed several times when a variety with peas of one colour has been artificially crossed by a differentlycoloured variety 11128 mr goss transact hort soc volume 5 page 234 and gartner bastarderzeugung 1849 ss 81 and 499 these statements led gartner who was highly sceptical on the subject carefully to try a long series of experiments he selected the most constant varieties and the result conclusively showed that the colour of the skin of the pea is modified when pollen of a differently coloured variety is used this conclusion has since been confirmed by experiments made by the rev jm berkeley 11129 gardeners chronicle 1854 page 404  mr laxton of stamford whilst making experiments on peas for the express purpose of ascertaining the influence of foreign pollen on the mother plant has recently 11130 ibid 1866 page 900 observed an important additional fact he fertilised the tall sugarpea which bears very thin green pods becoming brownishwhite when dry with pollen of the purple podded pea which as its name expresses has darkpurple pods with very thick skin becoming pale reddish purple when dry mr laxton has cultivated the tall sugarpea during twenty years and has never seen or heard of it producing a purple pod nevertheless a flower fertilised by pollen from the purplepod yielded a pod clouded with purplishred which mr laxton kindly gave to me a space of about two inches in length towards the extremity of the pod and a smaller space near the stalk were thus coloured on comparing the colour with that of the purple pod both pods having been first dried and then soaked in water it was found to be identically the same and in both the colour was confined to the cells lying immediately beneath the outer skin of the pod the valves of the crossed pod were also decidedly thicker and stronger than those of the pods of the motherplant but this may possibly have been an accidental circumstance for i know not how far their thickness is a variable character in the tall sugarpea  the peas of the tall sugarpea when dry are pale greenishbrown thickly covered with dots of dark purple so minute as to be visible only through a lens and mr laxton has never seen or heard of this variety producing a purple pea but in the crossed pod one of the peas was of a uniform beautiful violetpurple tint and a second was irregularly clouded with pale purple the colour lies in the outer of the two coats which surround the pea as the peas of the purplepodded variety when dry are of a pale greenishbuff it would at first appear that this remarkable change of colour in the peas in the crossed pod could not have been caused by the direct action of the pollen of the purplepod but when we bear in mind that this latter variety has purple flowers purple marks on its stipules and purple pods and that the tall sugarpea likewise has purple flowers and stipules and microscopically minute purple dots on the peas we can hardly doubt that the tendency to the production of purple in both parents has in combination modified the colour of the peas in the crossed pod after having examined these specimens i crossed the same two varieties and the peas in one pod but not the pods themselves were clouded and tinted with purplishred in a much more conspicuous manner than the peas in the uncrossed pods produced at the same time by the same plants i may notice as a caution that mr laxton sent me various other crossed peas slightly or even greatly modified in colour but the change in these cases was due as had been suspected by mr laxton to the altered colour of the cotyledons seen through the transparent coats of the peas and as the cotyledons are parts of the embryo these cases are not in any way remarkable  turning now to the genus matthiola the pollen of one kind of stock sometimes affects the colour of the seeds of another kind used as the motherplant i give the following case the more readily as gartner doubted similar statements previously made with respect to the stock by other observers a wellknown horticulturist major trevor clarke informs me 11131 see also a paper by this observer read before the international hort and bot congress of london 1866 that the seeds of the large red flowered biennial stock matthiola annua cocardeau of the french are light brown and those of the purple branching queen stock m incana are violetblack and he found that when flowers of the red stock were fertilised by pollen from the purple stock they yielded about fifty per cent of black seeds he sent me four pods from a red flowered plant two of which had been fertilised by their own pollen and they included pale brown seed and two which had been crossed by pollen from the purple kind and they included seeds all deeply tinged with black these latter seeds yielded purpleflowered plants like their father whilst the pale brown seeds yielded normal redflowered plants and major clarke by sowing similar seeds has observed on a greater scale the same result the evidence in this case of the direct action of the pollen of one species on the colour of the seeds of another species appears to me conclusive  gallesio 11132

in the united states where cucurbitaceae are largely cultivated it is the popular belief 11134 prof asa gray proc acad sc boston volume 4 1860 page 21 i have received statements to the same effect from other persons in the united states that the fruit is thus directly affected hy foreign pollen and i have received a similar statement with respect to the cucumber in england it is believed that grapes have been thus affected in colour size and shape in france a palecoloured grape had its juice tinted by the pollen of the darkcoloured teinturier in germany a variety bore berries which were affected by the pollen of two adjoining kinds some of the berries being only partially affected or mottled 11135 for the french case see journ hort soc volume 1 new series 1866 page 50 for germany see

popular belief in the united states dr savi 11137 gallesio teoria della riproduzione 1816 page 95 tried the experiment with care he sowed yellow and blackseeded maize together and on the same ear some of the seeds were yellow some black and some mottled the differently coloured seeds being arranged irregularly or in rows prof hildebrand has repeated the experiment 11138 bot zeitung may 1868 page 326 with the precaution of ascertaining that the motherplant was true a kind bearing yellow grains was fertilised with pollen of a kind having brown grains and two ears produced yellow grains mingled with others of a dirty violet tint a third ear had only yellow grains but one side of the spindle was tinted of a reddishbrown so that here we have the important fact of the influence of the foreign pollen extending to the axis mr arnold in canada varied the experiment in an interesting manner a female flower was subjected first to the action of pollen from a yellow variety and then to that from a white variety the result was an ear each grain of which was yellow below and white above 11139 see dr j stocktonhough american naturalist january 1874 page 29 with other plants it has occasionally been observed that the crossed offspring showed the influence of two kinds of pollen but in this case the two kinds affected the motherplant  mr sabine states 11140 transact hort soc volume 5 page 69 that he has seen the form of the nearly globular seedcapsule of amaryllis vittata altered by the application of the pollen of another species of which the capsule has gibbous angles with an allied genus a wellknown botanist maximowicz has described in detail the striking results of reciprocally fertilising lilium bulbiferum and davuricum with each others pollen each species produced fruit not like its own but almost identical with that of the pollenbearing species but from an accident only the fruit of the latter species was carefully examined the seeds were intermediate in the development of their wings 11141 bull de lacad imp de st petersburg tome 17 page 275 1872 the author gives references to those cases in the so1anaceae of fruit affected by foreign pollen but as it does not appear that the motherplant was artificially fertilised i have not entered into details  fritz muller fertilised cattleya leopoldi with pollen of epidendron cinnabarinum and the capsules contained very few seeds but these presented a most wonderful appearance which from the description given two botanists hildebrand and maximowicz attribute to the direct action of the pollen of the epidendron 11142 bot zeitung september 1868 page 631 for maximowiczs judgment see the paper last referred to  mr j anderson henry 11143 journal of horticulture january 20 1863 page 46 crossed rhododendron dalhousiae with the pollen of r nuttallii which is one of the largestflowered and noblest species of the genus the largest pod produced by the former species when fertilised with its own pollen measured 1 28 inch in length and 1 12 in girth whilst three of the pods which had been fertilised by pollen of r nuttallii measured 1 58 inch in length and no less than 2 inches in girth here the effect of the foreign pollen was apparently confined to increasing the size of the ovarium but we must be cautious in assuming as the following case shows that size had been transferred from the male parent to the capsule of the female plant mr henry fertilised arabis blepharophylla with pollen of a soyeri and the pods thus produced of which he was so kind as to send me detailed measurements and sketches were much larger in all their dimensions than those naturally produced by either the male or female parentspecies in a future chapter we shall see that the organs of vegetation in hybrid plants independently of the character of either parent are sometimes developed to a monstrous size and the increased size of the pods in the foregoing cases may be an analogous fact on the other hand m de saporta informs me that an isolated female plant of pistacia vera is very apt to be fertilised by the pollen of neighbouring plants of p terebinthus and in this case the fruits are only half their proper size which he attributes to the influence of the pollen of p terebinthus  no case of the direct action of the pollen of one variety on another is better authenticated or more remarkable than that of the common apple the fruit here consists of the lower part of the calyx and of the upper part of the flowerpeduncle 11144 see on this head the high authority of prof decaisne in a paper translated in journ hort soc volume 1 new series 1866 page 48 in a metamorphosed condition so that the effect of the foreign pollen has extended even beyond the limits of the ovarium cases of apples thus affected were recorded by bradley in the early part of the last century and other cases are given in old volumes of the philosophical transactions 11145 volume 43 174445 page 525 volume 45 174748 page 602 in one of these a russeting apple and an adjoining kind mutually affected each others fruit and in another case a smooth apple affected a roughcoated kind another instance has been given 11146 transact hort soc volume 5 pages 65 and 68 see also prof hildebrand with a coloured figure in bot zeitung may 15 1868 page 327 puvis also has collected de la degeneration 1837 page 36 several other instances but it is not in all cases possible to distinguish between the direct action of foreign pollen and budvariations of two very different appletrees growing close to each other which bore fruit resembling each other but only on the adjoining branches it is however almost superfluous to adduce these or other cases after that of the st valery apple the flowers which from the abortion of the stamens do not produce pollen but are fertilised by the girls of the neighbourhood with pollen of many kinds and they bear fruit differing from one another in size flavour and colour but resembling in character the hermaphrodite kinds by which they have been fertilised 11147 t de clermonttonnerre in mem de la soc linn de paris tome 3 1825 page 164  i have now shown on the authority of several excellent observers in the case of plants belonging to widely different orders that the pollen of one species or variety when applied to the female of a distinct form occasionally causes the coats of the seeds the ovarium or fruit including even the calyx and upper part of the peduncle of the apple and the axis of the ear in maize to be modified sometimes the whole ovarium or all the seeds are thus affected sometimes only a certain number of the seeds as in the case of the pea or only a part of the ovarium as with the striped orange mottled grapes and maize is thus affected it must not be supposed that any direct or immediate effect invariably follows the use of foreign pollen this is far from being the case nor is it known on what conditions the result depends mr knight 11148 transact of hort soc volume 5 page 68 expressly states that he has never seen the fruit thus affected though he crossed thousands of apple and other fruittrees  there is not the least reason to believe that a branch which has borne seed or fruit directly modified by foreign pollen is itself affected so as afterwards to produce modified buds such an occurrence from the temporary connection of the flower with the stem would be hardly possible hence but very few if any of the cases of budvariation in the fruit of trees given in the early part of this chapter can be accounted for by the action of foreign pollen for such fruits have commonly been propagated by budding or grafting it is also obvious that changes of colour in flowers which necessarily supervene long before they are ready for fertilisation and changes in the shape or colour of leaves when due to the appearance of modified buds can have no relation to the action of foreign pollen  the proofs of the action of foreign pollen on the motherplant have been given in considerable detail because this action as we shall see in a future chapter is of the highest theoretical importance and because it is in itself a remarkable and apparently anomalous circumstance that it is remarkable under a physiological point of view is clear for the male element not only affects in accordance with its proper function the germ but at the same time various parts of the motherplant in the same manner as it affects the same part in the seminal offspring from the same two parents we thus learn that an ovule is not indispensable for the reception of the influence of the male element but this direct action of the male element is not so anomalous as it at first appears for it comes into play in the ordinary fertilisation of many flowers gartner gradually increased the number of pollen grains until he succeeded in fertilising a malva and has 11149 beitrage zur kenntniss der befruchtung 1844 s 347351 proved that many grains are first expended in the development or as he expresses it in the satiation of the pistil and ovarium again when one plant is fertilised by a widely distinct species it often happens that the ovarium is fully and quickly developed without any seeds being formed or the coats of the seeds are formed without any embryo being developed within prof hildebrand also has lately shown 11150 die fruchtbildung der orchideen ein beweis fur die doppelte wirkung des pollens botanische zeitung no 44 et seq october 30 1865 and august 4 1865 s 249 that in the normal fertilisation of several orchideae the action of the plants own pollen is necessary for the development of the ovarium and that this development takes place not only long before the pollentubes have reached the ovules but even before the placentae and ovules have been formed so that with these orchids the pollen acts directly on the ovarium on the other hand we must not overrate the efficacy of pollen in the case of hybridised plants for an embryo may be formed and its influence excite the surrounding tissues of the mother plant and then perish at a very early age and be thus overlooked again it is well known that with many plants the ovarium may be fully developed though pollen be wholly excluded lastly mr smith the late curator at kew as i hear through dr hooker observed with an orchid the bonatea speciosa the singular fact that the development of the ovarium could be effected by the mechanical irritation of the stigma nevertheless from the number of the pollengrains expended in the satiation of the ovarium and pistilfrom the generality of the formation of the ovarium and seed coats in hybridised plants which produce no seedsand from dr hildebrands observations on orchids we may admit that in most cases the swelling of the ovarium and the formation of the seedcoats are at least aided if not wholly caused by the direct action of the pollen independently of the intervention of the fertilised germ therefore in the previously given cases we have only to believe in the further power of pollen when applied to a distinct species or variety to influence the shape size colour texture etc of certain parts of the motherplant  turning now to the animal kingdom if we could imagine the same flower to yield seeds during successive years then it would not be very surprising that a flower of which the ovarium had been modified by foreign pollen should next year produce when selffertilised offspring modified by the previous male influence closely analogous cases have actually occurred with animals in the case often quoted from lord morton 11151 philos transact 1821 page 20 a nearly purelybred arabian chestnut mare bore a hybrid to a quagga she was subsequently sent to sir gore ouseley and produced two colts by a black arabian horse these colts were partially duncoloured and were striped on the legs more plainly than the real hybrid or even than the quagga one of the two colts had its neck and some other parts of its body plainly marked with stripes stripes on the body not to mention those on the legs are extremely rarei speak after having long attended to the subjectwith horses of all kinds in europe and are almost unknown in the case of arabians but what makes the case still more striking is that in these colts the hair of the mane resembled that of the quagga being short stiff and upright hence there can be no doubt that the quagga affected the character of the offspring subsequently begot by the black arabian horse mr jenner weir informs me of a strictly parallel case his neighbour mr lethbridge of blackheath has a horse bred by lord mostyn which had previously borne a foal by a quagga this horse is dun with a dark stripe down the back faint stripes on the forehead between the eyes plain stripes on the inner side of the forelegs and rather more faint ones on the hindlegs with no shoulderstripe the mane grows much lower on the forehead than in the horse but not so low as in the quagga or zebra the hoofs are proportionally longer than in the horseso much so that the farrier who first shod this animal and knew nothing of its origin said had i not seen i was shoeing a horse i should have thought i was shoeing a donkey  with respect to the varieties of our domesticated animals many similar and wellauthenticated facts have been published 11152 dr alex harvey on a remarkable effect of crossbreeding 1851 on the physiology of breeding by mr reginald orton 1855 intermarriage by alex walker 1837 lheredite naturelle by dr prosper lucas tome 2 page 58 mr w sedgwick in british and foreign medicochirurgical review 1863 july page 183 bronn in his geschichte der natur 1843 b 2 s 127 has collected several cases with respect to mares sows and dogs mr wcl martin history of the dog 1845 page 104 says he can personally vouch for the influence of the male parent on subsequent litters by other dogs a french poet jacques savary who wrote in 1665 on dogs was aware of this singular fact dr bowerbank has given us the following striking casea black hairless barbary bitch was first accidentally impregnated by a mongrel spaniel with long brown hair and she produced five puppies three of which were hairless and two covered with short brown hair the next time she was put to a black hairless barbary dog but the mischief had been implanted in the mother and again about half the litter looked like pure barbarys and the other half like the shorthaired progeny of the first father i have given in the text one case with pigs an equally striking one has been recently published in germany illust landwirth zeitung 1868 november 17 page 143 it is worth notice that farmers in s brazil as i hear from fritz muller and at the c of good hope as i have heard from two trustworthy persons are convinced that mares which have once borne mules when subsequently put to horses are extremely liable to produce colts striped like a mule dr wilckens of pogarth gives jahrbuch landwirthschaft 2 1869 page 325 a striking and analogous case a merino ram having two small lappets or flaps of skin on the neck was in the winter of 186162 put to several merino ewes all of whom bore lambs with similar flaps on their necks the ram was killed in the spring of 1862 and subsequently to his death the ewes were put to other merino rams and in 1863 to southdown rams none of whom ever have neck lappets nevertheless even as long afterwards as 1867 several of these ewes produced lambs bearing these appendages and others have been communicated to me plainly showing the influence of the first male on the progeny subsequently borne by the mother to other males it will suffice to give a single instance recorded in the philosophical transactions in a paper following that by lord morton mr giles put a sow of lord westerns black and white essex breed to a wild boar of a deep chestnut colour and the pigs produced partook in appearance of both boar and sow but in some the chestnut colour of the boar strongly prevailed after the boar had long been dead the sow was put to a boar of her own black and white breeda kind which is well known to breed very true and never to show any chestnut colouryet from this union the sow produced some young pigs which were plainly marked with the same chestnut tint as in the first litter similar cases have so frequently occurred that careful breeders avoid putting a choice female of any animal to an inferior male on account of the injury to her subsequent progeny which may be expected to follow  some physiologists have attempted to account for these remarkable results from a previous impregnation by the imagination of the mother having been strongly affected but it will hereafter be seen that there are very slight grounds for any such belief other physiologists attribute the result to the close attachment and freely intercommunicating bloodvessels between the modified embryo and mother but the analogy from the action of foreign pollen on the ovarium seedcoats and other parts of the motherplant strongly supports the belief that with animals the male element acts directly on the female and not through the crossed embryo with birds there is no close connection between the embryo and mother yet a careful observer dr chapuis states 11153 le pigeon voyageur belge 1865 page 59 that with pigeons the influence of a first male sometimes makes itself perceived in the succeeding broods but this statement requires confirmation  conclusion and summary of the chapter  the facts given in the latter half of this chapter are well worthy of consideration as they show us in how many extraordinary modes the union of one form with another may lead to the modification of the seminal offspring or of the buds afterwards produced  there is nothing surprising in the offspring of species or varieties crossed in the ordinary manner being modified but the case of two plants within the same seed which cohere and differ from each other is curious when a bud is formed after the cellular tissue of two species or two varieties have been united and it partakes of the characters of both parents the case is wonderful but i need not here repeat what has been so lately said on this subject we have also seen that in the case of plants the male element may affect in a direct manner the tissues of the mother and with animals may lead to the modification of her future progeny in the vegetable kingdom the offspring from a cross between two species or varieties whether effected by seminal generation or by grafting often revert to a greater or less degree in the first or in a succeeding generation to the two parentforms and this reversion may affect the whole flower fruit or leafbud or only the half or a smaller segment of a single organ in some cases however such segregation of character apparently depends on an incapacity for union rather than on reversion for the flowers or fruit which are first produced display by segments the characters of both parents the various facts here given ought to be well considered by any one who wishes to embrace under a single point of view the many modes of reproduction by gemmation division and sexual union the reparation of lost parts variation inheritance reversion and other such phenomena towards the close of the second volume i shall attempt to connect these facts together by the hypothesis of pangenesis  in the early half of the present chapter i have given a long list of plants in which through budvariation that is independently of reproduction by seed the fruit has suddenly become modified in size colour flavour hairiness shape and time of maturity flowers have similarly changed in shape colour in being double and greatly in the character of the calyx young branches or shoots have changed in colour in bearing spines and in habit of growth as in climbing or in weeping leaves have changed in becoming variegated in shape period of unfolding and in their arrangement on the axis buds of all kinds whether produced on ordinary branches or on subterranean stems whether simple or much modified and supplied with a stock of nutriment as in tubers and bulbs are all liable to sudden variations of the same general nature  in the list many of the cases are certainly due to reversion to characters not acquired from a cross but which were formerly present and have since been lost for a longer or shorter timeas when a bud on a variegated plant produces plain leaves or when the variouslycoloured flowers of the chrysanthemum revert to the aboriginal yellow tint many other cases included in the list are probably due to the plants being of crossed parentage and to the buds reverting either completely or by segments to one of the two parentforms 11154 it may be worth while to call attention to the several means by which flowers and fruit become striped or mottled firstly by the direct action of the pollen of another variety or species as in the cases given of oranges and maize secondly in crosses of the first generation when the colours of the two parents do not readily unite as with mirabilis and dianthus thirdly in crossed plants of a subsequent generation by reversion through either bud or seminal generation fourthly by reversion to a character not originally gained by a cross but which had long been lost as with whiteflowered varieties which we shall hereafter see often become striped with some other colour lastly there are cases as when peaches are produced with a half or quarter of the fruit like a nectarine in which the change is apparently due to mere variation through either bud or seminal generation  we may suspect that the strong tendency in the chrysanthemum to produce by budvariation differentlycoloured flowers results from the varieties having been at some time intentionally or accidentally crossed and this is certainly the case with some kinds of pelargonium so it may be to a large extent with the budvarieties of the dahlia and with the broken colours of tulips when however a plant reverts by budvariation to its two parent forms or to one of them it sometimes does not revert perfectly but assumes a somewhat new characterof which fact instances have been given and carriere gives 11155 production des varietes page 37 another in the cherry  many cases of budvariation however cannot be attributed to reversion but to socalled spontaneous variability as is so common with cultivated plants raised from seed as a single variety of the chrysanthemum has produced by buds six other varieties and as one variety of the gooseberry has borne at the same time four distinct kinds of fruit it is scarcely possible to believe that all these variations are due to reversion we can hardly believe as remarked in a previous chapter that all the many peaches which have yielded nectarinebuds are of crossed parentage lastly in such cases as that of the mossrose with its peculiar calyx and of the rose which bears opposite leaves in that of the imatophyllum etc there is no known natural species or variety from which the characters in question could have been derived by a cross we must attribute all such cases to the appearance of absolutely new characters in the buds the varieties which have thus arisen cannot be distinguished by any external character from seedlings this is notoriously the case with the varieties of the rose azalea and many other plants it deserves notice that all the plants which have yielded budvariations have likewise varied greatly by seed  the plants which have varied by buds belong to so many orders that we may infer that almost every plant would be liable to variation if placed under the proper exciting conditions these conditions as far as we can judge mainly depend on longcontinued and high cultivation for almost all the plants in the foregoing list are perennials and have been largely propagated in many soils under different climates by cuttings offsets bulbs tubers and especially by budding or grafting the instances of annuals varying by buds or producing on the same plant differently coloured flowers are comparatively rare hopkirk 11156 flora anomala page 164 has seen this with convolvulus tricolor and it is not uncommon with the balsam and annual delphinium according to sir r schomburgk plants from the warmer temperate regions when cultivated under the hot climate of st domingo are eminently liable to budvariation i am informed by mr sedgwick that mossroses which have often been taken to calcutta always there lose their mossiness but change of climate is by no means a necessary contingent as we see with the gooseberry currant and in many other cases plants living under their natural conditions are very rarely subject to budvariation variegated leaves have however been observed under such circumstances and i have given an instance of variation by buds on an ashtree planted in ornamental grounds but it is doubtful whether such a tree can be considered as living under strictly natural conditions gartner has seen white and darkred flowers produced from the same root of the wild achillea millefolium and prof caspary has seen a completely wild viola lutea bearing flowers of two different colours and sizes 11157 schriften der physischokon gesell zu konigsberg b 6 february 3 1865 s 4  as wild plants are so rarely liable to budvariation whilst highly cultivated plants long propagated by artificial means have yielded many varieties by this form of reproduction we are led through a series such as the followingnamely all the eyes in the same tuber of the potato varying in the same mannerall the fruit on a purple plumtree suddenly becoming yellowall the fruit on a doubleflowered almond suddenly becoming peach likeall the buds on grafted trees being in a very slight degree affected by the stock on which they have been workedall the flowers on a transplanted heartsease changing for a time in colour size and shapewe are led by such a series to look at every case of bud variation as the direct result of the conditions of life to which the plant has been exposed on the other hand plants of the same variety may be cultivated in two adjoining beds apparently under exactly the same conditions and those in the one bed as carriere insists 11158 production des varietes pages 58 70 will produce many budvariations and those in the other not a single one again if we look to such cases as that of a peachtree which after having been cultivated by tens of thousands during many years in many countries and after having annually produced millions of buds all of which have apparently been exposed to precisely the same conditions yet at last suddenly produces a single bud with its whole character greatly transformed we are driven to the conclusion that the transformation stands in no direct relation to the conditions of life  we have seen that varieties produced from seeds and from buds resemble each other so closely in general appearance that they cannot be distinguished just as certain species and groups of species when propagated by seed are more variable than other species or genera so it is in the case of certain budvarieties thus the queen of england chrysanthemum has produced by this latter process no less than six and rollissons unique pelargonium four distinct varieties mossroses have also produced several other moss roses the rosaceae have varied by buds more than any other group of plants but this may be in large part due to so many members having been long cultivated but within this same group the peach has often varied by buds whilst the apple and pear both grafted trees extensively cultivated have afforded as far as i can ascertain extremely few instances of bud variation  the law of analogous variation holds good with varieties produced by buds as with those produced from seed more than one kind of rose has sported into a mossrose more than one kind of camellia has assumed an hexagonal form and at least seven or eight varieties of the peach have produced nectarines  the laws of inheritance seem to be nearly the same with seminal and bud varieties we know how commonly reversion comes into play with both and it may affect the whole or only segments of a leaf flower or fruit when the tendency to reversion affects many buds on the same tree it becomes covered with different kinds of leaves flowers or fruit but there is reason to believe that such fluctuating varieties have generally arisen from seed it is well known that out of a number of seedling varieties some transmit their character much more truly by seed than others so with budvarieties some retain their character by successive buds more truly than others of which instances have been given with two kinds of variegated euonymus and with certain kinds of tulips and pelargoniums notwithstanding the sudden production of budvarieties the characters thus acquired are sometimes capable of transmission by seminal reproduction mr rivers has found that mossroses generally reproduce themselves by seed and the mossy character has been transferred by crossing from one species of rose to another the boston nectarine which appeared as a bud variation produced by seed a closely allied nectarine on the other hand seedlings from some budvariations have proved variable to an extreme degree 11159 carriere production des varietes page 39 we have also heard on the authority of mr salter that seeds taken from a branch with leaves variegated through budvariation transmit this character very feebly whilst many plants which were variegated as seedlings transmit variegation to a large proportion of their progeny  although i have been able to collect a good many cases of budvariation as shown in the previous lists and might probably by searching foreign horticultural works have collected very many more cases yet their total number is as nothing in comparison with that of seminal varieties with seedlings raised from the more variable cultivated plants the variations are almost infinitely numerous but their differences are generally slight only at long intervals of time a strongly marked modification appears on the other hand it is a singular and inexplicable fact that when plants vary by buds the variations though they occur with comparative rarity are often or even generally strongly pronounced it struck me that this might perhaps be a delusion and that slight changes often occurred in buds but were overlooked or not recorded from being of no value accordingly i applied to two great authorities on this subject namely to mr rivers with respect to fruittrees and to mr salter with respect to flowers mr rivers is doubtful but does not remember having noticed very slight variations in fruitbuds mr salter informs me that with flowers such do occur but if propagated they generally lose their new character in the following year yet he concurs with me that budvariations usually at once assume a decided and permanent character we can hardly doubt that this is the rule when we reflect on such cases as that of the peach which has been so carefully observed and of which such trifling seminal varieties have been propagated yet this tree has repeatedly produced by budvariation nectarines and only twice as far as i can learn any other variety namely the early and late grosse mignonne peaches and these differ from the parenttree in hardly any character except the period of maturity  to my surprise i hear from mr salter that he brings the principle of selection to bear on variegated plants propagated by buds and has thus greatly improved and fixed several varieties he informs me that at first a branch often produces variegated leaves on one side alone and that the leaves are marked only with an irregular edging or with a few lines of white and yellow to improve and fix such varieties he finds it necessary to encourage the buds at the bases of the most distinctly marked leaves and to propagate from them alone by following with perseverance this plan during three or four successive seasons a distinct and fixed variety can generally be secured  finally the facts given in this chapter prove in how close and remarkable a manner the germ of a fertilised seed and the small cellular mass forming a bud resemble each other in all their functionsin their power of inheritance with occasional reversionand in their capacity for variation of the same general nature in obedience to the same laws this resemblance or rather identity of character is shown in the most striking manner by the fact that the cellular tissue of one species or variety when budded or grafted on another may give rise to a bud having an intermediate character we have seen that variability does not depend on sexual generation though much more frequently its concomitant than of bud reproduction we have seen that budvariability is not solely dependent on reversion or atavism to longlost characters or to those formerly acquired from a cross but appears often to be spontaneous but when we ask ourselves what is the cause of any particular budvariation we are lost in doubt being driven in some cases to look to the direct action of the external conditions of life as sufficient and in other cases to feel a profound conviction that these have played a quite subordinate part of not more importance than the nature of the spark which ignites a mass of combustible matter   chapter 1xii  inheritance  wonderful nature of inheritance pedigrees of our domesticated animals inheritance not due to chance trifling characters inherited diseases inherited peculiarities in the eye inherited diseases in the horse longevity and vigour asymmetrical deviations of structure polydactylism and regrowth of supernumerary digits after amputation cases of several children similarly affected from nonaffected parents weak and fluctuating inheritance in weeping trees in dwarfness colour of fruit and flowers colour of horses noninheritance in certain cases inheritance of structure and habits overborne by hostile conditions of life by incessantly recurring variability and by reversion conclusion  the subject of inheritance is an immense one and has been treated by many authors one work alone de lheredite naturelle by dr prosper lucas runs to the length of 1562 pages we must confine ourselves to certain points which have an important bearing on the general subject of variation both with domestic and natural productions it is obvious that a variation which is not inherited throws no light on the derivation of species nor is of any service to man except in the case of perennial plants which can be propagated by buds  if animals and plants had never been domesticated and wild ones alone had been observed we should probably never have heard the saying that like begets like the proposition would have been as selfevident as that all the buds on the same tree are alike though neither proposition is strictly true for as has often been remarked probably no two individuals are identically the same all wild animals recognise each other which shows that there is some difference between them and when the eye is well practised the shepherd knows each sheep and man can distinguish a fellow man out of millions on millions of other men some authors have gone so far as to maintain that the production of slight differences is as much a necessary function of the powers of generation as the production of offspring like their parents this view as we shall see in a future chapter is not theoretically probable though practically it holds good the saying that like begets like has in fact arisen from the perfect confidence felt by breeders that a superior or inferior animal will generally reproduce its kind but this very superiority or inferiority shows that the individual in question has departed slightly from its type  the whole subject of inheritance is wonderful when a new character arises whatever its nature may be it generally tends to be inherited at least in a temporary and sometimes in a most persistent manner what can be more wonderful than that some trifling peculiarity not primordially attached to the species should be transmitted through the male or female sexual cells which are so minute as not to be visible to the naked eye and afterwards through the incessant changes of a long course of development undergone either in the womb or in the egg and ultimately appear in the offspring when mature or even when quite old as in the case of certain diseases or again what can be more wonderful than the wellascertained fact that the minute ovule of a good milking cow will produce a male from whom a cell in union with an ovule will produce a female and she when mature will have large mammary glands yielding an abundant supply of milk and even milk of a particular quality nevertheless the real subject of surprise is as sir h holland has well remarked 121 medical notes and reflections 3rd edition 1855 page 267 not that a character should be inherited but that any should ever fail to be inherited in a future chapter devoted to an hypothesis which i have termed pangenesis an attempt will be made to show the means by which characters of all kinds are transmitted from generation to generation  some writers 122 mr buckle in his history of civilisation expresses doubts on the subject owing to the want of statistics see also mr bowen professor of moral philosophy in proc american acad of sciences volume 5 page 102 who have not attended to natural history have attempted to show that the force of inheritance has been much exaggerated the breeders of animals would smile at such simplicity and if they condescended to make any answer might ask what would be the chance of winning a prize if two inferior animals were paired together they might ask whether the halfwild arabs were led by theoretical notions to keep pedigrees of their horses why have pedigrees been scrupulously kept and published of the shorthorn cattle and more recently of the hereford breed is it an illusion that these recently improved animals safely transmit their excellent qualities even when crossed with other breeds have the shorthorns without good reason been purchased at immense prices and exported to almost every quarter of the globe a thousand guineas having been given for a bull with greyhounds pedigrees have likewise been kept and the names of such dogs as snowball major etc are as well known to coursers as those of eclipse and herod on the turf even with the gamecock pedigrees of famous strains were formerly kept and extended back for a century with pigs the yorkshire and cumberland breeders preserve and print pedigrees and to show how such highlybred animals are valued i may mention that mr brown who won all the first prizes for small breeds at birmingham in 1850 sold a young sow and boar of his breed to lord ducie for 43 guineas the sow alone was afterwards sold to the rev f thursby for 65 guineas who writes she paid me very well having sold her produce for 300 pounds and having now four breeding sows from her 123 for greyhounds see low domestic animals of the british islands 1845 page 721 for gamefowls see the poultry book by mr tegetmeier 1866 page 123 for pigs see mr sidneys edition of youatt on the pig 1860 pages 11 22 hard cash paid down over and over again is an excellent test of inherited superiority in fact the whole art of breeding from which such great results have been attained during the present century depends on the inheritance of each small detail of structure but inheritance is not certain for if it were the breeders art 124 the stud farm by cecil page 39 would be reduced to a certainty and there would be little scope left for that wonderful skill and perseverance shown by the men who have left an enduring monument of their success in the present state of our domesticated animals  it is hardly possible within a moderate compass to impress on the mind of those who have not attended to the subject the full conviction of the force of inheritance which is slowly acquired by rearing animals by studying the many treatises which have been published on the various domestic animals and by conversing with breeders i will select a few facts of the kind which as far as i can judge have most influenced my own mind with man and the domestic animals certain peculiarities have appeared in an individual at rare intervals or only once or twice in the history of the world but have reappeared in several of the children and grandchildren thus lambert the porcupineman whose skin was thickly covered with warty projections which were periodically moulted had all his six children and two grandsons similarly affected 125 philosophical transactions 1755 page 23 i have seen only secondhand accounts of the two grandsons mr sedgwick in a paper to which i shall hereafter often refer states that four generations were affected and in each the males alone the face and body being covered with long hair accompanied by deficient teeth to which i shall hereafter refer occurred in three successive generations in a siamese family but this case is not unique as a woman 126 barbara van beck figured as i am informed by the rev wd fox in woodburns gallery of rare portraits 1816 volume 2 with a completely hairy face who was exhibited in london in 1663 and another instance has recently occurred colonel hallam 127 proc zoolog soc 1833 page 16 has described a race of twolegged pigs the hinder extremities being entirely wanting and this deficiency was transmitted through three generations in fact all races presenting any remarkable peculiarity such as solidhoofed swine mauchamp sheep niata cattle etc are instances of the longcontinued inheritance of rare deviations of structure  when we reflect that certain extraordinary peculiarities have thus appeared in a single individual out of many millions all exposed in the same country to the same general conditions of life and again that the same extraordinary peculiarity has sometimes appeared in individuals living under widely different conditions of life we are driven to conclude that such peculiarities are not directly due to the action of the surrounding conditions but to unknown laws acting on the organisation or constitution of the individualthat their production stands in hardly closer relation to the conditions of life than does life itself if this be so and the occurrence of the same unusual character in the child and parent cannot be attributed to both having been exposed to the same unusual conditions then the following problem is worth consideration as showing that the result cannot be due as some authors have supposed to mere coincidence but must be consequent on the members of the same family inheriting something in common in their constitution let it be assumed that in a large population a particular affection occurs on an average in one out of a million so that the a priori chance that an individual taken at random will be so affected is only one in a million let the population consist of sixty millions composed we will assume of ten million families each containing six members on these data professor stokes has calculated for me that the odds will be no less than 8333 millions to 1 that in the ten million families there will not be even a single family in which one parent and two children will be affected by the peculiarity in question but numerous instances could be given in which several children have been affected by the same rare peculiarity with one of their parents and in this case more especially if the grandchildren be included in the calculation the odds against mere coincidence become something prodigious almost beyond enumeration  in some respects the evidence of inheritance is more striking when we consider the reappearance of trifling peculiarities dr hodgkin formerly told me of an english family in which for many generations some members had a single lock differently coloured from the rest of the hair i knew an irish gentleman who on the right side of his head had a small white lock in the midst of his dark hair he assured me that his grandmother had a similar lock on the same side and his mother on the opposite side but it is superfluous to give instances every shade of expression which may often be seen alike in parents and children tells the same story on what a curious combination of corporeal structure mental character and training handwriting depends yet every one must have noted the occasional close similarity of the handwriting in father and son although the father had not taught his son a great collector of autographs assured me that in his collection there were several signatures of father and son hardly distinguishable except by their dates hofacker in germany remarks on the inheritance of handwriting and it has even been asserted that english boys when taught to write in france naturally cling to their english manner of writing but for so extraordinary a statement more evidence is requisite 128 hofacker ueber die eigenschaften etc 1828 s 34 with respect to france report by pariset in comptes rendus 1847 page 592 gait gestures voice and general bearing are all inherited as the illustrious hunter and sir a carlisle have insisted 129 hunter as quoted in harlans med researches page 530 sir a carlisle phil transact 1814 page 94 my father communicated to me some striking instances in one of which a man died during the early infancy of his son and my father who did not see this son until grown up and out of health declared that it seemed to him as if his old friend had risen from the grave with all his highly peculiar habits and manners peculiar manners pass into tricks and several instances could be given of their inheritance as in the case often quoted of the father who generally slept on his back with his right leg crossed over the left and whose daughter whilst an infant in the cradle followed exactly the same habit though an attempt was made to cure her 1210 girou de buzareingues de la generation page 282 i have given an analogous case in my book on the expression of the emotions i will give one instance which has fallen under my own observation and which is curious from being a trick associated with a peculiar state of mind namely pleasureable emotion a boy had the singular habit when pleased of rapidly moving his fingers parallel to each other and when much excited of raising both hands with the fingers still moving to the sides of his face on a level with the eyes when this boy was almost an old man he could still hardly resist this trick when much pleased but from its absurdity concealed it he had eight children of these a girl when pleased at the age of four and a half years moved her fingers in exactly the same way and what is still odder when much excited she raised both her hands with her fingers still moving to the sides of her face in exactly the same manner as her father had done and sometimes even still continued to do so when alone i never heard of any one excepting this one man and his little daughter who had this strange habit and certainly imitation was in this instance out of the question  some writers have doubted whether those complex mental attributes on which genius and talent depend are inherited even when both parents are thus endowed but he who will study mr galtons able work on hereditary genius will have its doubts allayed  unfortunately it matters not as far as inheritance is concerned how injurious a quality or structure may be if compatible with life no one can read the many treatises 1211 the works which i have read and found most useful are dr prosper lucass great work traite de lheredite naturelle 1847 mr w sedgwick in british and foreign medicochirurg review april and july 1861 and april and july 1863 dr garrod on gout is quoted in these articles

hereditary bleeding in four generations harlan medical researches page 593 on hereditary disease and doubt this the ancients were strongly of this opinion or as ranchin expresses it omnes graeci arabes et latini in eo consentiunt a long catalogue could be given of all sorts of inherited malformations and of predisposition to various diseases with gout fifty per cent of the cases observed in hospital practice are according to dr garrod inherited and a greater percentage in private practice every one knows how often insanity runs in families and some of the cases given by mr sedgwick are awfulas of a surgeon whose brother father and four paternal uncles were all insane the latter dying by suicide of a jew whose father mother and six brothers and sisters were all mad and in some other cases several members of the same family during three or four successive generations have committed suicide striking instances have been recorded of epilepsy consumption asthma stone in the bladder cancer profuse bleeding from the slightest injuries of the mother not giving milk and of bad parturition being inherited in this latter respect i may mention an odd case given by a good observer 1212 marshall quoted by youatt in his work on cattle page 284 in which the fault lay in the offspring and not in the mother in a part of yorkshire the farmers continued to select cattle with large hindquarters until they made a strain called dutchbuttocked and the monstrous size of the buttocks of the calf was frequently fatal to the cow and numbers of cows were annually lost in calving  instead of giving numerous details on various inherited malformations and diseases i will confine myself to one organ that which is the most complex delicate and probably bestknown in the human frame namely the eye with its accessory parts 1213 almost any other organ might have been selected for instance mr j tomes system of dental surgery 2nd edition 1873 page 114 gives many instances with teeth and others have been communicated to me to begin with the latter i have received an account of a family in which one parent and the children are affected by drooping eyelids in so peculiar a manner that they cannot see without throwing their heads backwards mr wade of wakefield has given me an analogous case of a man who had not his eyelids thus affected at birth nor owed their state as far as was known to inheritance but they began to droop whilst he was an infant after suffering from fits and he has transmitted the affection to two out of his three children as was evident in the photographs of the whole family sent to me together with this account sir a carlisle 1214 philosoph transact 1814 page 94 specifies a pendulous fold to the eyelids as inherited in a family says sir h holland 1215 medical notes and reflections 3rd edition page 33 where the father had a singular elongation of the upper eyelid seven or eight children were born with the same deformity two or three other children having it not many persons as i hear from sir j paget have two or three hairs in their eyebrows much longer than the others and even so trifling a peculiarity as this certainly runs in families  with respect to the eye itself the highest authority in england mr bowman has been so kind as to give me the following remarks on certain inherited imperfections first hypermetropia or morbidly long sight in this affection the organ instead of being spherical is too flat from front to back and is often altogether too small so that the retina is brought too forward for the focus of the humours consequently a convex glass is required for clear vision of near objects and frequently even of distant ones this state occurs congenitally or at a very early age often in several children of the same family where one of the parents has presented it 1216 this affection as i hear from mr bowman has been ably described and spoken of as hereditary by dr donders of utrecht whose work was published in english by the sydenham society in 1864 secondly myopia or shortsight in which the eye is eggshaped and too long from front to back the retina in this case lies behind the focus and is therefore fitted to see distinctly only very near objects this condition is not commonly congenital but comes on in youth the liability to it being well known to be transmissible from parent to child the change from the spherical to the ovoidal shape seems the immediate consequence of something like inflammation of the coats under which they yield and there is ground for believing that it may often originate in causes acting on the individual affected 1217 m giraudteulon has recently collected abundant statistical evidence revue des cours scientifiques september 1870 page 625 showing that short sight is due to the habit of viewing objects from a short distance cest le travail assidu de pres and may thenceforward become transmissible when both parents are myopic mr bowman has observed the hereditary tendency in this direction to be heightened and some of the children to be myopic at an earlier age or in a higher degree than their parents thirdly squinting is a familiar example of hereditary transmission it is frequently a result of such optical defects as have been above mentioned but the more primary and uncomplicated forms of it are also sometimes in a marked degree transmitted in a family fourthly cataract or opacity of the crystalline lens is commonly observed in persons whose parents have been similarly affected and often at an earlier age in the children than in the parents occasionally more than one child in a family is thus afflicted one of whose parents or other relations presents the senile form of the complaint when cataract affects several members of a family in the same generation it is often seen to commence at about the same age in each eg in one family several infants or young persons may suffer from it in another several persons of middle age mr bowman also informs me that he has occasionally seen in several members of the same family various defects in either the right or left eye and mr white cooper has often seen peculiarities of vision confined to one eye reappearing in the same eye in the offspring 1218 quoted by mr herbert spencer principles of biology volume 1 page 244  the following cases are taken from an able paper by mr w sedgwick and from dr prosper lucas 1219 british and foreign medicochirurg review april 1861 pages 4826 lhered nat tome 1 pages 391408 amaurosis either congenital or coming on late in life and causing total blindness is often inherited it has been observed in three successive generations congenital absence of the iris has likewise been transmitted for three generations a cleftiris for four generations being limited in this latter case to the males of the family opacity of the cornea and congenital smallness of the eyes have been inherited portal records a curious case in which a father and two sons were rendered blind whenever the head was bent downwards apparently owing to the crystalline lens with its capsule slipping through an unusually large pupil into the anterior chamber of the eye dayblindness or imperfect vision under a bright light is inherited as is nightblindness or an incapacity to see except under a strong light a case has been recorded by m cunier of this latter defect having affected eightyfive members of the same family during six generations the singular incapacity of distinguishing colours which has been called daltonism is notoriously hereditary and has been traced through five generations in which it was confined to the female sex  with respect to the colour of the iris deficiency of colouring matter is well known to be hereditary in albinoes the iris of one eye being of different colour from that of the other and the iris being spotted are cases which have been inherited mr sedgwick gives in addition on the authority of dr osborne 1220 dr osborne pres of royal college of phys in ireland published this case in the dublin medical journal for 1835 the following curious instance of strong inheritance a family of sixteen sons and five daughters all had eyes resembling in miniature the markings on the back of a tortoiseshell cat the mother of this large family had three sisters and a brother all similarly marked and they derived this peculiarity from their mother who belonged to a family notorious for transmitting it to their posterity  finally dr lucas emphatically remarks that there is not one single faculty of the eye which is not subject to anomalies and not one which is not subjected to the principle of inheritance mr bowman agrees with the general truth of this proposition which of course does not imply that all malformations are necessarily inherited this would not even follow if both parents were affected by an anomaly which in most cases was transmissible  even if no single fact had been known with respect to the inheritance of disease and malformations by man the evidence would have been ample in the case of the horse and this might have been expected as horses breed much quicker than man are matched with care and are highly valued i have consulted many works and the unanimity of the belief by veterinaries of all nations in the transmission of various morbid tendencies is surprising authors who have had wide experience give in detail many singular cases and assert that contracted feet with the numerous contingent evils of ringbones curbs splints spavin founder and weakness of the front legs roaring or broken and thick wind melanosis specific ophthalmia and blindness the great french veterinary huzard going so far as to say that a blind race could soon be formed cribbiting jibbing and illtemper are all plainly hereditary youatt sums up by saying there is scarcely a malady to which the horse is subject which is not hereditary and m bernard adds that the doctrine that there is scarcely a disease which does not run in the stock is gaining new advocates every day 1221 these various statements are taken from the following works and papersyouatt on the horse pages 35 220

cattle with consumption good and bad teeth fine skin etc etc but enough and more than enough has been said on disease andrew knight from his own experience asserts that disease is hereditary with plants and this assertion is endorsed by lindley 1222 knight on the culture of the apple and pear page 34 lindleys horticulture page 180  seeing how hereditary evil qualities are it is fortunate that good health vigour and longevity are equally inherited it was formerly a wellknown practice when annuities were purchased to be received during the lifetime of a nominee to search out a person belonging to a family of which many members had lived to extreme old age as to the inheritance of vigour and endurance the english racehorse offers an excellent instance eclipse begot 334 and king herod 497 winners a cocktail is a horse not purely bred but with only oneeighth or onesixteenth impure blood in his veins yet very few instances have ever occurred of such horses having won a great race they are sometimes as fleet for short distances as thoroughbreds but as mr robson the great trainer asserts they are deficient in wind and cannot keep up the pace mr lawrence also remarks perhaps no instance has ever occurred of a threepartbred horse saving his distance in running two miles with thoroughbred racers it has been stated by cecil that when unknown horses whose parents were not celebrated have unexpectedly won great races as in the case of priam they can always be proved to be descended on both sides through many generations from firstrate ancestors on the continent baron cameronn challenges in a german veterinary periodical the opponents of the english racehorse to name one good horse on the continent which has not some english raceblood in his veins 1223 these statements are taken from the following works in orderyouatt on the horse page 48 mr darvill in the veterinary volume 8 page 50 with respect to robson see the veterinary volume 3 page 580 mr lawrence on the horse 1829 page 9 the stud farm by cecil 1851 baron cameronn quoted in the veterinary volume 10 page 500  with respect to the transmission of the many slight but infinitely diversified characters by which the domestic races of animals and plants are distinguished nothing need be said for the very existence of persistent races proclaims the power of inheritance  a few special cases however deserve some consideration it might have been anticipated that deviations from the law of symmetry would not have been inherited but anderson 1224 recreations in agriculture and nat hist volume 1 page 68 states that a rabbit produced in a litter a young animal having only one ear and from this animal a breed was formed which steadily produced oneeared rabbits he also mentions a bitch with a single leg deficient and she produced several puppies with the same deficiency from hofackers account 1225 ueber die eigenschaften etc 1828 s 107 it appears that a onehorned stag was seen in 1781 in a forest in germany in 1788 two and afterwards from year to year many were observed with only one horn on the right side of the head a cow lost a horn by suppuration 1226 bronn geschichte der natur b 2 s 132 and she produced three calves which had on the same side of the head instead of a horn a small bony lump attached merely to the skin but we here encroach on the subject of inherited mutilations a man who is lefthanded and a shell in which the spire turns in the wrong directions are departures from the normal asymmetrical condition and they are wellknown to be inherited  polydactylism  supernumerary fingers and toes are eminently liable as various authors have insisted to be inherited polydactylism graduates 1227 vrolik has discussed this point at full length in a work published in dutch from which sir j paget has kindly translated for me passages see also isidore geoffroy st hilaire hist des anomalies 1832 tome 1 page 684 by multifarious steps from a mere cutaneous appendage not including any bone to a double hand but an additional digit supported on a metacarpal bone and furnished with all the proper muscles nerves and vessels is sometimes so perfect that it escapes detection unless the fingers are actually counted occasionally there are several supernumerary digits but usually only one making the total number six this one may be attached to the inner or outer margin of the hand representing either a thumb or little finger the latter being the more frequent generally through the law of correlation both hands and both feet are similarly affected dr burt wilder has tabulated 1228 massachusetts medical society volume 2 no 3 and proc boston soc of nat hist volume 14 1871 page 154 a large number of cases and finds that supernumerary digits are more common on the hands than on the feet and that men are affected oftener than women both these facts can be explained on two principles which seem generally to hold good firstly that of two parts the more specialised one is the more variable and the arm is more highly specialised than the leg and secondly that male animals are more variable than females  the presence of a greater number of digits than five is a great anomaly for this number is not normally exceeded by any existing mammal bird or reptile nevertheless supernumerary digits are strongly inherited they have been transmitted through five generations and in some cases after disappearing for one two or even three generations have reappeared through reversion these facts are rendered as professor huxley has observed more remarkable from its being known in most cases that the affected person has not married one similarly affected in such cases the child of the fifth generation would have only 132nd part of the blood of his first sedigitated ancestor other cases are rendered remarkable by the affection gathering force as dr struthers has shown in each generation though in each the affected person married one not affected moreover such additional digits are often amputated soon after birth and can seldom have been strengthened by use dr struthers gives the following instance in the first generation an additional digit appeared on one hand in the second on both hands in the third three brothers had both hands and one of the brothers a foot affected and in the fourth generation all four limbs were affected yet we must not overestimate the force of inheritance dr struthers asserts that cases of noninheritance and of the first appearance of additional digits in unaffected families are much more frequent than cases of inheritance many other deviations of structure of a nature almost as anomalous as supernumerary digits such as deficient phalanges 1229 dr jw ogle gives a case of the inheritance of deficient phalanges during four generations he adds references to various recent papers on inheritance brit and for medchirurg review april 1872 thickened joints crooked fingers etc are in like manner strongly inherited and are equally subject to intermission together with reversion though in such cases there is no reason to suppose that both parents had been similarly affected 1230

have occurred with the frog it deserves notice that the sixtoed newt though adult preserved some of its larval characters for part of the hyoidal apparatus which is properly absorbed during the act of metamorphosis was retained it is also remarkable that in the case of man various structures in an embryonic or arrested state of development such as a cleftpalate bifid uterus etc are often accompanied by polydactylism 1231 meckel and isid g st hilaire insist on this fact see also m a roujou sur quelques analogies du type humain page 61 published i believe in the journal of the anthropolog soc of paris january 1872 six toes on the hinder feet are known to have been inherited for three generations of cats in several breeds of the fowl the hinder toe is double and is generally transmitted truly as is well shown when dorkings are crossed with common fourtoed breeds 1232 the poultry chronicle 1854 page 559 with animals which have properly less than five digits the number is sometimes increased to five especially on the front legs though rarely carried beyond that number but this is due to the development of a digit already existing in a more or less rudimentary state thus the dog has properly four toes behind but in the larger breeds a fifth toe is commonly though not perfectly developed horses which properly have one toe alone fully developed with rudiments of the others have been described with each foot bearing two or three small separate hoofs analogous facts have been noticed with cows sheep goats and pigs 1233 the statements in this paragraph are taken from isidore geoffroy st hilaire hist des anomalies tome 1 pages 688693 mr goodman gives phil soc of cambridge november 25 1872 the case of a cow with three well developed toes on each hind limb besides the ordinary rudiments and her calf by an ordinary bull had extra digits this calf also bore two calves having extra digits  there is a famous case described by mr white of a child three years old with a thumb double from the first joint he removed the lesser thumb which was furnished with a nail but to his astonishment it grew again and reproduced a nail the child was then taken to an eminent london surgeon and the newlygrown thumb was removed by its socketjoint but again it grew and reproduced a nail dr struthers mentions a case of the partial regrowth of an additional thumb amputated when a child was three months old and the late dr falconer communicated to me an analogous instance in the last edition of this work i also gave a case of the regrowth of a supernumerary littlefinger after amputation but having been informed by dr bachmaier that several eminent surgeons expressed at a meeting of the anthropological society of munich great doubt about my statements i have made more particular inquiries the full information thus gained together with a tracing of the hand in its present state has been laid before sir j paget and he has come to the conclusion that the degree of regrowth in this case is not greater than sometimes occurs with normal bones especially with the humerus when amputated at an early age he further does not feel fully satisfied about the facts recorded by mr white this being so it is necessary for me to withdraw the view which i formerly advanced with much hesitation chiefly on the ground of the supposed regrowth of additional digits namely that their occasional development in man is a case of reversion to a lowly organised progenitor provided with more than five digits  i may here allude to a class of facts closely allied to but somewhat different from ordinary cases of inheritance sir h holland 1234 medical notes and reflections 1839 pages 24 34 see also dr p lucas lhered nat tome 2 page 33 states that brothers and sisters of the same family are frequently affected often at about the same age by the same peculiar disease not known to have previously occurred in the family he specifies the occurrence of diabetes in three brothers under ten years old he also remarks that children of the same family often exhibit in common infantile diseases the same peculiar symptoms my father mentioned to me the case of four brothers who died between the ages of sixty and seventy in the same highly peculiar comatose state an instance has already been given of supernumerary digits appearing in four children out of six in a previously unaffected family dr devay states 1235 du danger des mariages consanguins 2nd edition 1862 page 103 that two brothers married two sisters their firstcousins none of the four nor any relation being an albino but the seven children produced from this double marriage were all perfect albinoes some of these cases as mr sedgwick 1236 british and foreign medicochirurg review july 1863 pages 183 189 has shown are probably the result of reversion to a remote ancestor of whom no record had been preserved and all these cases are so far directly connected with inheritance that no doubt the children inherited a similar constitution from their parents and from being exposed to nearly similar conditions of life it is not surprising that they should be affected in the same manner and at the same period of life  most of the facts hitherto given have served to illustrate the force of inheritance but we must now consider cases grouped as well as the subject allows into classes showing how feeble capricious or deficient the power of inheritance sometimes is when a new peculiarity first appears we can never predict whether it will be inherited if both parents from their birth present the same peculiarity the probability is strong that it will be transmitted to at least some of their offspring we have seen that variegation is transmitted much more feebly by seed taken from a branch which had become variegated through budvariation than from plants which were variegated as seedlings with most plants the power of transmission notoriously depends on some innate capacity in the individual thus vilmorin 1237 verlot la product des varietes 1865 page 32 raised from a peculiarly coloured balsam some seedlings which all resembled their parent but of these seedlings some failed to transmit the new character whilst others transmitted it to all their descendants during several successive generations so again with a variety of the rose two plants alone out of six were found by vilmorin to be capable of transmitting the desired character numerous analogous cases could be given  the weeping or pendulous growth of trees is strongly inherited in some cases and without any assignable reason feebly in other cases i have selected this character as an instance of capricious inheritance because it is certainly not proper to the parentspecies and because both sexes being borne on the same tree both tend to transmit the same character even supposing that there may have been in some instances crossing with adjoining trees of the same species it is not probable that all the seedlings would have been thus affected at moccas court there is a famous weeping oak many of its branches are 30 feet long and no thicker in any part of this length than a common rope this tree transmits its weeping character in a greater or less degree to all its seedlings some of the young oaks being so flexible that they have to be supported by props others not showing the weeping tendency till about twenty years old 1238 loudons gardeners mag volume 12 1836 page 368 mr rivers fertilised as he informs me the flowers of a new belgian weeping thorn crataegus oxyacantha with pollen from a crimson notweeping variety and three young trees now six or seven years old show a decided tendency to be pendulous but as yet are not so much so as the motherplant according to mr macnab 1239 verlot la product des varietes 1865 page 94 seedlings from a magnificent weeping birch betula alba in the botanic garden at edinburgh grew for the first ten or fifteen years upright but then all became weepers like their parent a peach with pendulous branches like those of the weeping willow has been found capable of propagation by seed 1240 bronn geschichte der natur b 2 s 121 mr meehan makes a similar statement in proc nat of philadelphia 1872 page 235 lastly a weeping or rather a prostrate yew taxus baccata was found in a hedge in shropshire it was a male but one branch bore female flowers and produced berries these being sown produced seventeen trees all of which had exactly the same peculiar habit with the parenttree 1241 rev wa leighton flora of shropshire page 497 and charlesworth mag of nat hist volume 1 1837 page 30 i possess prostrate trees produced from these seeds  these facts it might have been thought would have been sufficient to render it probable that a pendulous habit would in all cases be strictly inherited but let us look to the other side mr macnab 1242 verlot op cit page 93 sowed seeds of the weeping beech fagus sylvatica but succeeded in raising only common beeches mr rivers at my request raised a number of seedlings from three distinct varieties of weeping elm and at least one of the parenttrees was so situated that it could not have been crossed by any other elm but none of the young trees now about a foot or two in height show the least signs of weeping mr rivers formerly sowed above twenty thousand seeds of the weeping ash fraxinus excelsior and not a single seedling was in the least degree pendulous in germany m borchmeyer raised a thousand seedlings with the same result nevertheless mr anderson of the chelsea botanic garden by sowing seed from a weeping ash which was found before the year 1780 in cambridgeshire raised several pendulous trees 1243 for these several statements see loudons gard magazine volume 10 1834 pages 408 180 and volume 9 1833 page 597 professor henslow also informs me that some seedlings from a female weeping ash in the botanic garden at cambridge were at first a little pendulous but afterwards became quite upright it is probable that this latter tree which transmits to a certain extent its pendulous habit was derived by a bud from the same original cambridgeshire stock whilst other weeping ashes may have had a distinct origin but the crowning case communicated to me by mr rivers which shows how capricious is the inheritance of a pendulous habit is that a variety of another species of ash f lentiscifolia now about twenty years old which was formerly pendulous has long lost this habit every shoot being remarkably erect but seedlings formerly raised from it were perfectly prostrate the stems not rising more than two inches above the ground thus the weeping variety of the common ash which has been extensively propagated by buds during a long period did not with mr rivers transmit its character to one seedling out of above twenty thousand whereas the weeping variety of a second species of ash which could not whilst grown in the same garden retain its own weeping character transmitted to its character the pendulous habit in excess  many analogous facts could be given showing how apparently capricious is the principle of inheritance all the seedlings from a variety of the barberry b vulgaris with red leaves inherited the same character only about onethird of the seedlings of the copper beech fagus sylvatica had purple leaves not one out of a hundred seedlings of a variety of the cerasus padus with yellow fruit bore yellow fruit onetwelfth of the seedlings of the variety of cornus mascula with yellow fruit came true 1244 these statements are taken from alph de candolle bot geograph page 1083 and lastly all the trees raised by my father from a yellow berried holly ilex aquifolium found wild produced yellow berries vilmorin 1245 verlot op cit page 38 observed in a bed of saponaria calabrica an extremely dwarf variety and raised from it a large number of seedlings some of these partially resembled their parent and he selected their seed but the grandchildren were not in the least dwarfed on the other hand he observed a stunted and bushy variety of tagetes signata growing in the midst of the common varieties by which it was probably crossed for most of the seedlings raised from this plant were intermediate in character only two perfectly resembling their parent but seed saved from these two plants reproduced the new variety so truly that hardly any selection has since been necessary  flowers transmit their colour truly or most capriciously many annuals come true thus i purchased german seeds of thirtyfour named subvarieties of one race of tenweek stocks matthiola annua and raised a hundred and forty plants all of which with the exception of a single plant came true in saying this however it must be understood that i could distinguish only twenty kinds out of the thirtyfour named subvarieties nor did the colour of the flower always correspond with the name affixed to the packet but i say that they came true because in each of the thirty six short rows every plant was absolutely alike with the one single exception again i procured packets of german seed of twentyfive named varieties of common and quilled asters and raised a hundred and twenty four plants of these all except ten were true in the above limited sense and i considered even a wrong shade of colour as false  it is a singular circumstance that white varieties generally transmit their colour much more truly than any other variety this fact probably stands in close relation with one observed by verlot 1246 op cit page 59 namely that flowers which are normally white rarely vary into any other colour i have found that the white varieties of delphinium consolida and of the stock are the truest it is indeed sufficient to look through a nurserymans seedlist to see the large number of white varieties which can be propagated by seed the several coloured varieties of the sweetpea lathyrus odoratus are very true but i hear from mr masters of canterbury who has particularly attended to this plant that the white variety is the truest the hyacinth when propagated by seed is extremely inconstant in colour but white hyacinths almost always give by seed whiteflowered plants 1247 alph de candolle geograph bot page 1082 and mr masters informs me that the yellow varieties also reproduce their colour but of different shades on the other hand pink and blue varieties the latter being the natural colour are not nearly so true hence as mr masters has remarked to me we see that a garden variety may acquire a more permanent habit than a natural species but it should have been added that this occurs under cultivation and therefore under changed conditions  with many flowers especially perennials nothing can be more fluctuating than the colour of the seedlings as is notoriously the case with verbenas carnations dahlias cinerarias and others 1248 see cottage gardener april 10 1860 page 18 and september 10 1861 page 456 gardeners chronicle 1845 page 102 i sowed seed of twelve named varieties of snapdragon antirrhinum majus and utter confusion was the result in most cases the extremely fluctuating colour of seedling plants is probably in chief part due to crosses between differentlycoloured varieties during previous generations it is almost certain that this is the case with the polyanthus and coloured primrose primula veris and vulgaris from their reciprocally dimorphic structure 1249 darwin in journal of proc linn soc bot 1862 page 94 and these are plants which florists speak of as never coming true by seed but if care be taken to prevent crossing neither species is by any means very inconstant in colour thus i raised twentythree plants from a purple primrose fertilised by mr j scott with its pollen and eighteen came up purple of different shades and only five reverted to the ordinary yellow colour again i raised twenty plants from a brightred cowslip similarly treated by mr scott and every one perfectly resembled its parent in colour as likewise did with the exception of a single plant 72 grandchildren even with the most variable flowers it is probable that each delicate shade of colour might be permanently fixed so as to be transmitted by seed by cultivation in the same soil by longcontinued selection and especially by the prevention of crosses i infer this from certain annual larkspurs delphinium consolida and ajacis of which common seedlings present a greater diversity of colour than any other plant known to me yet on procuring seed of five named german varieties of d consolida only nine plants out of ninetyfour were false and the seedlings of six varieties of d ajacis were true in the same manner and degree as with the stocks above described a distinguished botanist maintains that the annual species of delphinium are always selffertilised therefore i may mention that thirtytwo flowers on a branch of d consolida enclosed in a net yielded twentyseven capsules with an average of 172 seed in each whilst five flowers under the same net which were artificially fertilised in the same manner as must be effected by bees during their incessant visits yielded five capsules with an average of 352 fine seed and this shows that the agency of insects is necessary for the full fertility of this plant analogous facts could be given with respect to the crossing of many other flowers such as carnations etc of which the varieties fluctuate much in colour  as with flowers so with our domesticated animals no character is more variable than colour and probably in no animal more so than with the horse yet with a little care in breeding it appears that races of any colour might soon be formed hofacker gives the result of matching two hundred and sixteen mares of four different colours with likecoloured stallions without regard to the colour of their ancestors and of the two hundred and sixteen colts born eleven alone failed to inherit the colour of their parents autenrieth and ammon assert that after two generations colts of a uniform colour are produced with certainty 1250 hofacker ueber die eigenschaften etc s 10  in a few rare cases peculiarities fail to be inherited apparently from the force of inheritance being too strong i have been assured by breeders of the canarybird that to get a good jonquilcoloured bird it does not answer to pair two jonquils as the colour then comes out too strong or is even brown but this statement is disputed by other breeders so again if two crested canaries are paired the young birds rarely inherit this character 1251 bechstein naturgesch deutschlands b 4 s 462 mr brent a great breeder of canaries informs me that he believes that these statements are correct for in crested birds a narrow space of bare skin is left on the back of the head where the feathers are upturned to form the crest and when both parents are thus characterised the bareness becomes excessive and the crest itself fails to be developed mr hewitt speaking of laced sebright bantams says 1252 the poultry book by wb tegetmeier 1866 page 245 that why this should be so i know not but i am confident that those that are best laced frequently produce offspring very far from perfect in their markings whilst those exhibited by myself which have so often proved successful were bred from the union of heavily laced birds with those that were scarcely sufficiently laced  it is a singular fact that although several deafmutes often occur in the same family and though their cousins and other relations are often in the same condition yet their parents are rarely deafmutes to give a single instance not one scholar out of 148 who were at the same time in the london institution was the child of parents similarly affected so again when a male or female deafmute marries a sound person their children are most rarely affected in ireland out of 203 children thus produced one alone was mute even when both parents have been deafmutes as in the case of fortyone marriages in the united states and of six in ireland only two deaf and dumb children were produced mr sedgwick 1253 british and foreign medchirurg review july 1861 pages 200204 mr sedgwick has given such full details on this subject with ample references that i need refer to no other authorities in commenting on this remarkable and fortunate failure in the power of transmission in the direct line remarks that it may possibly be owing to excess having reversed the action of some natural law in development but it is safer in the present state of our knowledge to look at the whole case as simply unintelligible  although many congenital monstrosities are inherited of which examples have already been given and to which may be added the lately recorded case of the transmission during a century of harelip with a cleftpalate in the writers own family 1254 mr sproule in british medical journal april 18 1863 yet other malformations are rarely or never inherited of these latter cases many are probably due to injuries in the womb or egg and would come under the head of noninherited injuries or mutilations with plants a long catalogue of inherited monstrosities of the most serious and diversified nature could easily be given and with plants there is no reason to suppose that monstrosities are caused by direct injuries to the seed or embryo  with respect to the inheritance of structures mutilated by injuries or altered by disease it was until lately difficult to come to any definite conclusion some mutilations have been practised for a vast number of generations without any inherited result godron remarks 1255 de lespece tome 2 1859 page 299 that different races of man have from time immemorial knocked out their upper incisors cut off joints of their fingers made holes of immense size through the lobes of their ears or through their nostrils tatooed themselves made deep gashes in various parts of their bodies and there is no reason to suppose that these mutilations have ever been inherited 1256 nevertheless mr wetherell states nature december 1870 page 168 that when he visited fifteen years ago the sioux indians he was informed by a physician who has passed much of his time with these tribes that some times a child was born with these marks this was confirmed by the us government indian agent adhesions due to inflammation and pits from the smallpox and formerly many consecutive generations must have been thus pitted are not inherited with respect to jews i have been assured by three medical men of the jewish faith that circumcision which has been practised for so many ages has produced no inherited effect blumenbach however asserts 1257 philosoph mag volume 4 1799 page 5 that jews are often born in germany in a condition rendering circumcision difficult so that a name is given them signifying born circumcised and professor preyer informs me that this is the case in bonn such children being considered the special favourites of jehovah i have also heard from dr a newman of guys hospital of the grandson of a circumcised jew the father not having been circumcised in a similar condition but it is possible that all these cases may be accidental coincidence for sir j paget has seen five sons of a lady and one son of her sister with adherent prepuces and one of these boys was affected in a manner which might be considered like that commonly produced by circumcision yet there was no suspicion of jewish blood in the family of these two sisters circumcision is practised by mahomedans but at a much later age than by jews and dr riedel assistant resident in north celebes writes to me that the boys there go naked until from six to ten years old and he has observed that many of them though not all have their prepuces much reduced in length and this he attributes to the inherited effects of the operation in the vegetable kingdom oaks and other trees have borne galls from primeval times yet they do not produce inherited excrescences and many other such facts could be adduced  notwithstanding the above several negative cases we now possess conclusive evidence that the effects of operations are sometimes inherited dr brown sequard 1258 proc royal soc volume 10 page 297 communication to the brit assoc 1870 the lancet january 1875 page 7 the extracts are from this last paper it appears that obersteiner strickers med jahrbucher 1875 no 2 has confirmed brownsequards observations gives the following summary of his observations on guineapigs and this summary is so important that i will quote the whole  1st appearance of epilepsy in animals born of parents having been rendered epileptic by an injury to the spinal cord  2nd appearance of epilepsy also in animals born of parents having been rendered epileptic by the section of the sciatic nerve  3rd a change in the shape of the ear in animals born of parents in which such a change was the effect of a division of the cervical sympathetic nerve  4th partial closure of the eyelids in animals born of parents in which that state of the eyelids had been caused either by the section of the cervical sympathetic nerve or the removal of the superior cervical ganglion  5th exophthalmia in animals born of parents in which an injury to the restiform body had produced that protrusion of the eyeball this interesting fact i have witnessed a good many times and i have seen the transmission of the morbid state of the eye continue through four generations in these animals modified by heredity the two eyes generally protruded although in the parents usually only one showed exophthalmia the lesion having been made in most cases only on one of the corpora restiformia  6th haematoma and dry gangrene of the ears in animals born of parents in which these earalterations had been caused by an injury to the restiform body near the nib of the calamus  7th absence of two toes out of the three of the hind leg and sometimes of the three in animals whose parents had eaten up their hindleg toes which had become anaesthetic from a section of the sciatic nerve alone or of that nerve and also of the crural sometimes instead of complete absence of the toes only a part of one or two or three was missing in the young although in the parent not only the toes but the whole foot was absent partly eaten off partly destroyed by inflammation ulceration or gangrene  8th appearance of various morbid states of the skin and hair of the neck and face in animals born of parents having had similar alterations in the same parts as effects of an injury to the sciatic nerve  it should be especially observed that brownsequard has bred during thirty years many thousand guineapigs from animals which had not been operated upon and not one of these manifested the epileptic tendency nor has he ever seen a guineapig born without toes which was not the offspring of parents which had gnawed off their own toes owing to the sciatic nerve having been divided of this latter fact thirteen instances were carefully recorded and a greater number were seen yet brownsequard speaks of such cases as one of the rarer forms of inheritance it is a still more interesting fact  that the sciatic nerve in the congenitally toeless animal has inherited the power of passing through all the different morbid states which have occurred in one of its parents from the time of the division till after its reunion with the peripheric end it is not therefore simply the power of performing an action which is inherited but the power of performing a whole series of actions in a certain order  in most of the cases of inheritance recorded by brownsequard only one of the two parents had been operated upon and was affected he concludes by expressing his belief that what is transmitted is the morbid state of the nervous system due to the operation performed on the parents  with the lower animals dr prosper lucas has collected a long list of inherited injuries a few instances will suffice a cow lost a horn from an accident with consequent suppuration and she produced three calves which were hornless on the same side of the head with the horse there seems hardly a doubt that exostoses on the legs caused by too much travelling on hard roads are inherited blumenbach records the case of a man who had his little finger on the right hand almost cut off and which in consequence grew crooked and his sons had the same finger on the same hand similarly crooked a soldier fifteen years before his marriage lost his left eye from purulent ophthalmia and his two sons were microphthalmic on the same side 1259 this last case is quoted by mr sedgwick in british and foreign medicochirurg review april 1861 page 484 for blumenbach see abovecited paper see also dr p lucas traite de lhered nat tome 2 page 492 also transact linn soc volume 9 page 323 some curious cases are given by mr baker in the veterinary volume 13 page 723 another curious case is given in the annales des scienc nat 1st series tome 11 page 324 in all cases in which a parent has had an organ injured on one side and two or more of the offspring are born with the same organ affected on the same side the chances against mere coincidence are almost infinitely great even when only a single child is born having exactly the same part of the body affected as that of his injured parent the chances against coincidence are great and professor rolleston has given me two such cases which have fallen under his own observationnamely of two men one of whom had his knee and the other his cheek severely cut and both had children born with exactly the same spot marked or scarred many instances have been recorded of cats dogs and horses which have had their tails legs etc amputated or injured producing offspring with the same parts illformed but as it is not very rare for similar malformations to appear spontaneously all such cases may be due to coincidence it is however an argument on the other side that under the old excise laws the shepherddog was only exempt from tax when without a tail and for this reason it was always removed 1260 the dog by stonehenge 1867 page 118 and there still exist breeds of the shepherddog which are always born destitute of a tail finally it must be admitted more especially since the publication of brownsequards observations that the effects of injuries especially when followed by disease or perhaps exclusively when thus followed are occasionally inherited 1261 the motmot habitually bites the barbs off the middle part of the two central tailfeathers and as the barbs are congenitally somewhat reduced on the same part of these feathers it seems extremely probable as mr salvin remarks proc zoolog soc 1873 page 429 that this is due to the inherited effects of longcontinued mutilation  causes of noninheritance  a large number of cases of noninheritance are intelligible on the principle that a strong tendency to inheritance does exist but that it is overborne by hostile or unfavourable conditions of life no one would expect that our improved pigs if forced during several generations to travel about and root in the ground for their own subsistence would transmit as truly as they now do their short muzzles and legs and their tendency to fatten drayhorses assuredly would not long transmit their great size and massive limbs if compelled to live on a cold damp mountainous region we have indeed evidence of such deterioration in the horses which have run wild on the falkland islands european dogs in india often fail to transmit their true character our sheep in tropical countries lose their wool in a few generations there seems also to be a close relation between certain peculiar pastures and the inheritance of an enlarged tail in fattailed sheep which form one of the most ancient breeds in the world with plants we have seen that tropical varieties of maize lose their proper character in the course of two or three generations when cultivated in europe and conversely so it is with european varieties cultivated in brazil our cabbages which here come so true by seed cannot form heads in hot countries according to carriere 1262 production et fixation des varietes 1865 page 72 the purple leafed beech and barberry transmit their character by seed far less truly in certain districts than in others under changed circumstances periodical habits of life soon fail to be transmitted as the period of maturity in summer and winter wheat barley and vetches so it is with animals for instance a person whose statement i can trust procured eggs of aylesbury ducks from that town where they are kept in houses and are reared as early as possible for the london market the ducks bred from these eggs in a distant part of england hatched their first brood on january 24th whilst common ducks kept in the same yard and treated in the same manner did not hatch till the end of march and this shows that the period of hatching was inherited but the grandchildren of these aylesbury ducks completely lost their habit of early incubation and hatched their eggs at the same time with the common ducks of the same place  many cases of noninheritance apparently result from the conditions of life continually inducing fresh variability we have seen that when the seeds of pears plums apples etc are sown the seedlings generally inherit some degree of family likeness mingled with these seedlings a few and sometimes many worthless wildlooking plants commonly appear and their appearance may be attributed to the principle of reversion but scarcely a single seedling will be found perfectly to resemble the parentform and thus may be accounted for by constantly recurring variability induced by the conditions of life i believe in this because it has been observed that certain fruittrees truly propagate their kind whilst growing on their own roots but when grafted on other stocks and by this process their natural state is manifestly affected they produce seedlings which vary greatly departing from the parental type in many characters 1263 downing fruits of america page 5 sageret pom phys pages 43 72 metzger as stated in the ninth chapter found that certain kinds of wheat brought from spain and cultivated in germany failed during many years to reproduce themselves truly but at last when accustomed to their new conditions they ceased to be variablethat is they became amenable to the power of inheritance nearly all the plants which cannot be propagated with any approach to certainty by seed are kinds which have been long propagated by buds cuttings offsets tubers etc and have in consequence been frequently exposed during what may be called their individual lives to widely diversified conditions of life plants thus propagated become so variable that they are subject as we have seen in the last chapter even to budvariation our domesticated animals on the other hand are not commonly exposed during the life of the individual to such extremely diversified conditions and are not liable to such extreme variability therefore they do not lose the power of transmitting most of their characteristic features in the foregoing remarks on noninheritance crossed breeds are of course excluded as their diversity mainly depends on the unequal development of character derived from either parent or their ancestors  conclusion  it has been shown in the early part of this chapter how commonly new characters of the most diversified nature whether normal or abnormal injurious or beneficial whether affecting organs of the highest or most trifling importance are inherited it is often sufficient for the inheritance of some peculiar character that one parent alone should possess it as in most cases in which the rarer anomalies have been transmitted but the power of transmission is extremely variable in a number of individuals descended from the same parents and treated in the same manner some display this power in a perfect manner and in some it is quite deficient and for this difference no reason can be assigned the effects of injuries or mutilations are occasionally inherited and we shall see in a future chapter that the longcontinued use and disuse of parts produces an inherited effect even those characters which are considered the most fluctuating such as colour are with rare exceptions transmitted much more forcibly than is generally supposed the wonder indeed in all cases is not that any character should be transmitted but that the power of inheritance should ever fail the checks to inheritance as far as we know them are firstly circumstances hostile to the particular character in question secondly conditions of life incessantly inducing fresh variability and lastly the crossing of distinct varieties during some previous generation together with reversion or atavismthat is the tendency in the child to resemble its grandparents or more remote ancestors instead of its immediate parents this latter subject will be discussed in the following chapter   end of volume i
