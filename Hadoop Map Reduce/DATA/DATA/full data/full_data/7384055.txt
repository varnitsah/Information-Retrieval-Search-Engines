7384055	the seven poor travellersin three chapters   chapter iin the old city of rochester   strictly speaking there were only six poor travellers but being a traveller myself though an idle one and being withal as poor as i hope to be i brought the number up to seven  this word of explanation is due at once for what says the inscription over the quaint old door     richard watts esq    by his will dated 22 aug 1579    founded this charity    for six poor travellers    who not being rogues or proctors    may receive gratis for one night    lodging entertainment    and fourpence each  it was in the ancient little city of rochester in kent of all the good days in the year upon a christmaseve that i stood reading this inscription over the quaint old door in question  i had been wandering about the neighbouring cathedral and had seen the tomb of richard watts with the effigy of worthy master richard starting out of it like a ships figurehead and i had felt that i could do no less as i gave the verger his fee than inquire the way to wattss charity  the way being very short and very plain i had come prosperously to the inscription and the quaint old door  now said i to myself as i looked at the knocker i know i am not a proctor i wonder whether i am a rogue  upon the whole though conscience reproduced two or three pretty faces which might have had smaller attraction for a moral goliath than they had had for me who am but a tom thumb in that way i came to the conclusion that i was not a rogue  so beginning to regard the establishment as in some sort my property bequeathed to me and divers colegatees share and share alike by the worshipful master richard watts i stepped backward into the road to survey my inheritance  i found it to be a clean white house of a staid and venerable air with the quaint old door already three times mentioned an arched door choice little long low latticewindows and a roof of three gables  the silent high street of rochester is full of gables with old beams and timbers carved into strange faces  it is oddly garnished with a queer old clock that projects over the pavement out of a grave redbrick building as if time carried on business there and hung out his sign sooth to say he did an active stroke of work in rochester in the old days of the romans and the saxons and the normans and down to the times of king john when the rugged castlei will not undertake to say how many hundreds of years old thenwas abandoned to the centuries of weather which have so defaced the dark apertures in its walls that the ruin looks as if the rooks and daws had pecked its eyes out  i was very well pleased both with my property and its situation  while i was yet surveying it with growing content i espied at one of the upper lattices which stood open a decent body of a wholesome matronly appearance whose eyes i caught inquiringly addressed to mine  they said so plainly do you wish to see the house that i answered aloud yes if you please  and within a minute the old door opened and i bent my head and went down two steps into the entry  this said the matronly presence ushering me into a low room on the right is where the travellers sit by the fire and cook what bits of suppers they buy with their fourpences  o  then they have no entertainment said i  for the inscription over the outer door was still running in my head and i was mentally repeating in a kind of tune lodging entertainment and fourpence each  they have a fire provided for em returned the matrona mighty civil person not as i could make out overpaid and these cooking utensils and this whats painted on a board is the rules for their behaviour  they have their fourpences when they get their tickets from the steward over the wayfor i dont admit em myself they must get their tickets firstand sometimes one buys a rasher of bacon and another a herring and another a pound of potatoes or what not  sometimes two or three of em will club their fourpences together and make a supper that way  but not much of anything is to be got for fourpence at present when provisions is so dear  true indeed i remarked  i had been looking about the room admiring its snug fireside at the upper end its glimpse of the street through the low mullioned window and its beams overhead  it is very comfortable said i  illconwenient observed the matronly presence  i liked to hear her say so for it showed a commendable anxiety to execute in no niggardly spirit the intentions of master richard watts but the room was really so well adapted to its purpose that i protested quite enthusiastically against her disparagement  nay maam said i i am sure it is warm in winter and cool in summer it has a look of homely welcome and soothing rest  it has a remarkably cosey fireside the very blink of which gleaming out into the street upon a winter night is enough to warm all rochesters heart  and as to the convenience of the six poor travellers  i dont mean them returned the presence  i speak of its being an ill conwenience to myself and my daughter having no other room to sit in of a night  this was true enough but there was another quaint room of corresponding dimensions on the opposite side of the entry so i stepped across to it through the open doors of both rooms and asked what this chamber was for  this returned the presence is the board room  where the gentlemen meet when they come here  let me see  i had counted from the street six upper windows besides these on the groundstory  making a perplexed calculation in my mind i rejoined then the six poor travellers sleep upstairs  my new friend shook her head  they sleep she answered in two little outer galleries at the back where their beds has always been ever since the charity was founded  it being so very illconwenient to me as things is at present the gentlemen are going to take off a bit of the backyard and make a slip of a room for em there to sit in before they go to bed  and then the six poor travellers said i will be entirely out of the house  entirely out of the house assented the presence comfortably smoothing her hands  which is considered much better for all parties and much more conwenient  i had been a little startled in the cathedral by the emphasis with which the effigy of master richard watts was bursting out of his tomb but i began to think now that it might be expected to come across the high street some stormy night and make a disturbance here  howbeit i kept my thoughts to myself and accompanied the presence to the little galleries at the back  i found them on a tiny scale like the galleries in old innyards and they were very clean  while i was looking at them the matron gave me to understand that the prescribed number of poor travellers were forthcoming every night from years end to years end and that the beds were always occupied  my questions upon this and her replies brought us back to the board room so essential to the dignity of the gentlemen where she showed me the printed accounts of the charity hanging up by the window  from them i gathered that the greater part of the property bequeathed by the worshipful master richard watts for the maintenance of this foundation was at the period of his death mere marshland but that in course of time it had been reclaimed and built upon and was very considerably increased in value  i found too that about a thirtieth part of the annual revenue was now expended on the purposes commemorated in the inscription over the door the rest being handsomely laid out in chancery law expenses collectorship receivership poundage and other appendages of management highly complimentary to the importance of the six poor travellers  in short i made the not entirely new discovery that it may be said of an establishment like this in dear old england as of the fat oyster in the american story that it takes a good many men to swallow it whole  and pray maam said i sensible that the blankness of my face began to brighten as the thought occurred to me could one see these travellers  well she returned dubiously no  not tonight for instance said i  well she returned more positively no  nobody ever asked to see them and nobody ever did see them  as i am not easily balked in a design when i am set upon it i urged to the good lady that this was christmaseve that christmas comes but once a yearwhich is unhappily too true for when it begins to stay with us the whole year round we shall make this earth a very different place that i was possessed by the desire to treat the travellers to a supper and a temperate glass of hot wassail that the voice of fame had been heard in that land declaring my ability to make hot wassail that if i were permitted to hold the feast i should be found conformable to reason sobriety and good hours in a word that i could be merry and wise myself and had been even known at a pinch to keep others so although i was decorated with no badge or medal and was not a brother orator apostle saint or prophet of any denomination whatever  in the end i prevailed to my great joy  it was settled that at nine oclock that night a turkey and a piece of roast beef should smoke upon the board and that i faint and unworthy minister for once of master richard watts should preside as the christmassupper host of the six poor travellers  i went back to my inn to give the necessary directions for the turkey and roast beef and during the remainder of the day could settle to nothing for thinking of the poor travellers  when the wind blew hard against the windowsit was a cold day with dark gusts of sleet alternating with periods of wild brightness as if the year were dying fitfullyi pictured them advancing towards their restingplace along various cold roads and felt delighted to think how little they foresaw the supper that awaited them  i painted their portraits in my mind and indulged in little heightening touches  i made them footsore i made them weary i made them carry packs and bundles i made them stop by fingerposts and milestones leaning on their bent sticks and looking wistfully at what was written there i made them lose their way and filled their five wits with apprehensions of lying out all night and being frozen to death  i took up my hat and went out climbed to the top of the old castle and looked over the windy hills that slope down to the medway almost believing that i could descry some of my travellers in the distance after it fell dark and the cathedral bell was heard in the invisible steeplequite a bower of frosty rime when i had last seen itstriking five six seven i became so full of my travellers that i could eat no dinner and felt constrained to watch them still in the red coals of my fire  they were all arrived by this time i thought had got their tickets and were gone inthere my pleasure was dashed by the reflection that probably some travellers had come too late and were shut out  after the cathedral bell had struck eight i could smell a delicious savour of turkey and roast beef rising to the window of my adjoining bedroom which looked down into the innyard just where the lights of the kitchen reddened a massive fragment of the castle wall  it was high time to make the wassail now therefore i had up the materials which together with their proportions and combinations i must decline to impart as the only secret of my own i was ever known to keep and made a glorious jorum  not in a bowl for a bowl anywhere but on a shelf is a low superstition fraught with cooling and slopping but in a brown earthenware pitcher tenderly suffocated when full with a coarse cloth it being now upon the stroke of nine i set out for wattss charity carrying my brown beauty in my arms  i would trust ben the waiter with untold gold but there are strings in the human heart which must never be sounded by another and drinks that i make myself are those strings in mine  the travellers were all assembled the cloth was laid and ben had brought a great billet of wood and had laid it artfully on the top of the fire so that a touch or two of the poker after supper should make a roaring blaze  having deposited my brown beauty in a red nook of the hearth inside the fender where she soon began to sing like an ethereal cricket diffusing at the same time odours as of ripe vineyards spice forests and orange grovesi say having stationed my beauty in a place of security and improvement i introduced myself to my guests by shaking hands all round and giving them a hearty welcome  i found the party to be thus composed  firstly myself  secondly a very decent man indeed with his right arm in a sling who had a certain clean agreeable smell of wood about him from which i judged him to have something to do with shipbuilding  thirdly a little sailorboy a mere child with a profusion of rich dark brown hair and deep womanlylooking eyes  fourthly a shabbygenteel personage in a threadbare black suit and apparently in very bad circumstances with a dry suspicious look the absent buttons on his waistcoat eked out with red tape and a bundle of extraordinarily tattered papers sticking out of an inner breastpocket fifthly a foreigner by birth but an englishman in speech who carried his pipe in the band of his hat and lost no time in telling me in an easy simple engaging way that he was a watchmaker from geneva and travelled all about the continent mostly on foot working as a journeyman and seeing new countriespossibly i thought also smuggling a watch or so now and then  sixthly a little widow who had been very pretty and was still very young but whose beauty had been wrecked in some great misfortune and whose manner was remarkably timid scared and solitary  seventhly and lastly a traveller of a kind familiar to my boyhood but now almost obsoletea bookpedler who had a quantity of pamphlets and numbers with him and who presently boasted that he could repeat more verses in an evening than he could sell in a twelvemonth  all these i have mentioned in the order in which they sat at table  i presided and the matronly presence faced me  we were not long in taking our places for the supper had arrived with me in the following procession     myself with the pitcher    ben with beer    inattentive boy with hot plates  inattentive boy with hot plates    the turkey    female carrying sauces to be heated on the spot    the beef    man with tray on his head containing vegetables and sundries    volunteer hostler from hotel grinning    and rendering no assistance  as we passed along the high street cometlike we left a long tail of fragrance behind us which caused the public to stop sniffing in wonder we had previously left at the corner of the innyard a walleyed young man connected with the fly department and well accustomed to the sound of a railway whistle which ben always carries in his pocket whose instructions were so soon as he should hear the whistle blown to dash into the kitchen seize the hot plumpudding and mincepies and speed with them to wattss charity where they would be received he was further instructed by the saucefemale who would be provided with brandy in a blue state of combustion  all these arrangements were executed in the most exact and punctual manner  i never saw a finer turkey finer beef or greater prodigality of sauce and gravyand my travellers did wonderful justice to everything set before them  it made my heart rejoice to observe how their wind and frost hardened faces softened in the clatter of plates and knives and forks and mellowed in the fire and supper heat  while their hats and caps and wrappers hanging up a few small bundles on the ground in a corner and in another corner three or four old walkingsticks worn down at the end to mere fringe linked this smug interior with the bleak outside in a golden chain  when supper was done and my brown beauty had been elevated on the table there was a general requisition to me to take the corner which suggested to me comfortably enough how much my friends here made of a firefor when had i ever thought so highly of the corner since the days when i connected it with jack horner  however as i declined ben whose touch on all convivial instruments is perfect drew the table apart and instructing my travellers to open right and left on either side of me and form round the fire closed up the centre with myself and my chair and preserved the order we had kept at table  he had already in a tranquil manner boxed the ears of the inattentive boys until they had been by imperceptible degrees boxed out of the room and he now rapidly skirmished the saucefemale into the high street disappeared and softly closed the door  this was the time for bringing the poker to bear on the billet of wood  i tapped it three times like an enchanted talisman and a brilliant host of merrymakers burst out of it and sported off by the chimneyrushing up the middle in a fiery country dance and never coming down again meanwhile by their sparkling light which threw our lamp into the shade i filled the glasses and gave my travellers christmaschristmaseve my friends when the shepherds who were poor travellers too in their way heard the angels sing on earth peace  goodwill towards men  i dont know who was the first among us to think that we ought to take hands as we sat in deference to the toast or whether any one of us anticipated the others but at any rate we all did it  we then drank to the memory of the good master richard watts  and i wish his ghost may never have had worse usage under that roof than it had from us  it was the witching time for storytelling  our whole life travellers said i is a story more or less intelligiblegenerally less but we shall read it by a clearer light when it is ended  i for one am so divided this night between fact and fiction that i scarce know which is which  shall i beguile the time by telling you a story as we sit here  they all answered yes  i had little to tell them but i was bound by my own proposal  therefore after looking for awhile at the spiral column of smoke wreathing up from my brown beauty through which i could have almost sworn i saw the effigy of master richard watts less startled than usual i fired away     chapter iithe story of richard doubledick   in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninetynine a relative of mine came limping down on foot to this town of chatham  i call it this town because if anybody present knows to a nicety where rochester ends and chatham begins it is more than i do  he was a poor traveller with not a farthing in his pocket  he sat by the fire in this very room and he slept one night in a bed that will be occupied tonight by some one here  my relative came down to chatham to enlist in a cavalry regiment if a cavalry regiment would have him if not to take king georges shilling from any corporal or sergeant who would put a bunch of ribbons in his hat  his object was to get shot but he thought he might as well ride to death as be at the trouble of walking  my relatives christian name was richard but he was better known as dick  he dropped his own surname on the road down and took up that of doubledick  he was passed as richard doubledick age twentytwo height five foot ten native place exmouth which he had never been near in his life  there was no cavalry in chatham when he limped over the bridge here with half a shoe to his dusty feet so he enlisted into a regiment of the line and was glad to get drunk and forget all about it  you are to know that this relative of mine had gone wrong and run wild his heart was in the right place but it was sealed up  he had been betrothed to a good and beautiful girl whom he had loved better than sheor perhaps even hebelieved but in an evil hour he had given her cause to say to him solemnly richard i will never marry another man  i will live single for your sake but mary marshalls lipsher name was mary marshallnever address another word to you on earth  go richard heaven forgive you  this finished him  this brought him down to chatham  this made him private richard doubledick with a determination to be shot  there was not a more dissipated and reckless soldier in chatham barracks in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninetynine than private richard doubledick  he associated with the dregs of every regiment he was as seldom sober as he could be and was constantly under punishment it became clear to the whole barracks that private richard doubledick would very soon be flogged  now the captain of richard doubledicks company was a young gentleman not above five years his senior whose eyes had an expression in them which affected private richard doubledick in a very remarkable way  they were bright handsome dark eyeswhat are called laughing eyes generally and when serious rather steady than severebut they were the only eyes now left in his narrowed world that private richard doubledick could not stand  unabashed by evil report and punishment defiant of everything else and everybody else he had but to know that those eyes looked at him for a moment and he felt ashamed  he could not so much as salute captain taunton in the street like any other officer  he was reproached and confusedtroubled by the mere possibility of the captains looking at him  in his worst moments he would rather turn back and go any distance out of his way than encounter those two handsome dark bright eyes  one day when private richard doubledick came out of the black hole where he had been passing the last eightandforty hours and in which retreat he spent a good deal of his time he was ordered to betake himself to captain tauntons quarters  in the stale and squalid state of a man just out of the black hole he had less fancy than ever for being seen by the captain but he was not so mad yet as to disobey orders and consequently went up to the terrace overlooking the paradeground where the officers quarters were twisting and breaking in his hands as he went along a bit of the straw that had formed the decorative furniture of the black hole  come in cried the captain when he had knocked with his knuckles at the door  private richard doubledick pulled off his cap took a stride forward and felt very conscious that he stood in the light of the dark bright eyes  there was a silent pause  private richard doubledick had put the straw in his mouth and was gradually doubling it up into his windpipe and choking himself  doubledick said the captain do you know where you are going to  to the devil sir faltered doubledick  yes returned the captain  and very fast  private richard doubledick turned the straw of the black hole in his month and made a miserable salute of acquiescence  doubledick said the captain since i entered his majestys service a boy of seventeen i have been pained to see many men of promise going that road but i have never been so pained to see a man make the shameful journey as i have been ever since you joined the regiment to see you  private richard doubledick began to find a film stealing over the floor at which he looked also to find the legs of the captains breakfasttable turning crooked as if he saw them through water  i am only a common soldier sir said he  it signifies very little what such a poor brute comes to  you are a man returned the captain with grave indignation of education and superior advantages and if you say that meaning what you say you have sunk lower than i had believed  how low that must be i leave you to consider knowing what i know of your disgrace and seeing what i see  i hope to get shot soon sir said private richard doubledick and then the regiment and the world together will be rid of me  the legs of the table were becoming very crooked  doubledick looking up to steady his vision met the eyes that had so strong an influence over him  he put his hand before his own eyes and the breast of his disgrace jacket swelled as if it would fly asunder  i would rather said the young captain see this in you doubledick than i would see five thousand guineas counted out upon this table for a gift to my good mother  have you a mother  i am thankful to say she is dead sir  if your praises returned the captain were sounded from mouth to mouth through the whole regiment through the whole army through the whole country you would wish she had lived to say with pride and joy he is my son  spare me sir said doubledick  she would never have heard any good of me  she would never have had any pride and joy in owning herself my mother  love and compassion she might have had and would have always had i know but notspare me sir  i am a broken wretch quite at your mercy  and he turned his face to the wall and stretched out his imploring hand  my friend began the captain  god bless you sir sobbed private richard doubledick  you are at the crisis of your fate  hold your course unchanged a little longer and you know what must happen  i know even better than you can imagine that after that has happened you are lost  no man who could shed those tears could bear those marks  i fully believe it sir in a low shivering voice said private richard doubledick  but a man in any station can do his duty said the young captain and in doing it can earn his own respect even if his case should be so very unfortunate and so very rare that he can earn no other mans  a common soldier poor brute though you called him just now has this advantage in the stormy times we live in that he always does his duty before a host of sympathising witnesses  do you doubt that he may so do it as to be extolled through a whole regiment through a whole army through a whole country  turn while you may yet retrieve the past and try  i will  i ask for only one witness sir cried richard with a bursting heart  i understand you  i will be a watchful and a faithful one  i have heard from private richard doubledicks own lips that he dropped down upon his knee kissed that officers hand arose and went out of the light of the dark bright eyes an altered man  in that year one thousand seven hundred and ninetynine the french were in egypt in italy in germany where not  napoleon bonaparte had likewise begun to stir against us in india and most men could read the signs of the great troubles that were coming on  in the very next year when we formed an alliance with austria against him captain tauntons regiment was on service in india  and there was not a finer noncommissioned officer in itno nor in the whole linethan corporal richard doubledick  in eighteen hundred and one the indian army were on the coast of egypt next year was the year of the proclamation of the short peace and they were recalled  it had then become well known to thousands of men that wherever captain taunton with the dark bright eyes led there close to him ever at his side firm as a rock true as the sun and brave as mars would be certain to be found while life beat in their hearts that famous soldier sergeant richard doubledick  eighteen hundred and five besides being the great year of trafalgar was a year of hard fighting in india  that year saw such wonders done by a sergeantmajor who cut his way singlehanded through a solid mass of men recovered the colours of his regiment which had been seized from the hand of a poor boy shot through the heart and rescued his wounded captain who was down and in a very jungle of horses hoofs and sabressaw such wonders done i say by this brave sergeantmajor that he was specially made the bearer of the colours he had won and ensign richard doubledick had risen from the ranks  sorely cut up in every battle but always reinforced by the bravest of menfor the fame of following the old colours shot through and through which ensign richard doubledick had saved inspired all breaststhis regiment fought its way through the peninsular war up to the investment of badajos in eighteen hundred and twelve  again and again it had been cheered through the british ranks until the tears had sprung into mens eyes at the mere hearing of the mighty british voice so exultant in their valour and there was not a drummerboy but knew the legend that wherever the two friends major taunton with the dark bright eyes and ensign richard doubledick who was devoted to him were seen to go there the boldest spirits in the english army became wild to follow  one day at badajosnot in the great storming but in repelling a hot sally of the besieged upon our men at work in the trenches who had given waythe two officers found themselves hurrying forward face to face against a party of french infantry who made a stand  there was an officer at their head encouraging his mena courageous handsome gallant officer of fiveandthirty whom doubledick saw hurriedly almost momentarily but saw well  he particularly noticed this officer waving his sword and rallying his men with an eager and excited cry when they fired in obedience to his gesture and major taunton dropped  it was over in ten minutes more and doubledick returned to the spot where he had laid the best friend man ever had on a coat spread upon the wet clay  major tauntons uniform was opened at the breast and on his shirt were three little spots of blood  dear doubledick said he i am dying  for the love of heaven no exclaimed the other kneeling down beside him and passing his arm round his neck to raise his head  taunton  my preserver my guardian angel my witness  dearest truest kindest of human beings  taunton  for gods sake  the bright dark eyesso very very dark now in the pale facesmiled upon him and the hand he had kissed thirteen years ago laid itself fondly on his breast  write to my mother  you will see home again  tell her how we became friends  it will comfort her as it comforts me  he spoke no more but faintly signed for a moment towards his hair as it fluttered in the wind  the ensign understood him  he smiled again when he saw that and gently turning his face over on the supporting arm as if for rest died with his hand upon the breast in which he had revived a soul  no dry eye looked on ensign richard doubledick that melancholy day  he buried his friend on the field and became a lone bereaved man  beyond his duty he appeared to have but two remaining cares in lifeone to preserve the little packet of hair he was to give to tauntons mother the other to encounter that french officer who had rallied the men under whose fire taunton fell  a new legend now began to circulate among our troops and it was that when he and the french officer came face to face once more there would be weeping in france  the war went onand through it went the exact picture of the french officer on the one side and the bodily reality upon the otheruntil the battle of toulouse was fought  in the returns sent home appeared these words severely wounded but not dangerously lieutenant richard doubledick  at midsummertime in the year eighteen hundred and fourteen lieutenant richard doubledick now a browned soldier sevenandthirty years of age came home to england invalided  he brought the hair with him near his heart  many a french officer had he seen since that day many a dreadful night in searching with men and lanterns for his wounded had he relieved french officers lying disabled but the mental picture and the reality had never come together  though he was weak and suffered pain he lost not an hour in getting down to frome in somersetshire where tauntons mother lived  in the sweet compassionate words that naturally present themselves to the mind tonight he was the only son of his mother and she was a widow  it was a sunday evening and the lady sat at her quiet gardenwindow reading the bible reading to herself in a trembling voice that very passage in it as i have heard him tell  he heard the words young man i say unto thee arise  he had to pass the window and the bright dark eyes of his debased time seemed to look at him  her heart told her who he was she came to the door quickly and fell upon his neck  he saved me from ruin made me a human creature won me from infamy and shame  o god for ever bless him  as he will he will  he will the lady answered  i know he is in heaven  then she piteously cried but o my darling boy my darling boy  never from the hour when private richard doubledick enlisted at chatham had the private corporal sergeant sergeantmajor ensign or lieutenant breathed his right name or the name of mary marshall or a word of the story of his life into any ear except his reclaimers  that previous scene in his existence was closed  he had firmly resolved that his expiation should be to live unknown to disturb no more the peace that had long grown over his old offences to let it be revealed when he was dead that he had striven and suffered and had never forgotten and then if they could forgive him and believe himwell it would be time enoughtime enough  but that night remembering the words he had cherished for two years tell her how we became friends  it will comfort her as it comforts me he related everything  it gradually seemed to him as if in his maturity he had recovered a mother it gradually seemed to her as if in her bereavement she had found a son  during his stay in england the quiet garden into which he had slowly and painfully crept a stranger became the boundary of his home when he was able to rejoin his regiment in the spring he left the garden thinking was this indeed the first time he had ever turned his face towards the old colours with a womans blessing  he followed themso ragged so scarred and pierced now that they would scarcely hold togetherto quatre bras and ligny  he stood beside them in an awful stillness of many men shadowy through the mist and drizzle of a wet june forenoon on the field of waterloo  and down to that hour the picture in his mind of the french officer had never been compared with the reality  the famous regiment was in action early in the battle and received its first check in many an eventful year when he was seen to fall  but it swept on to avenge him and left behind it no such creature in the world of consciousness as lieutenant richard doubledick  through pits of mire and pools of rain along deep ditches once roads that were pounded and ploughed to pieces by artillery heavy waggons tramp of men and horses and the struggle of every wheeled thing that could carry wounded soldiers jolted among the dying and the dead so disfigured by blood and mud as to be hardly recognisable for humanity undisturbed by the moaning of men and the shrieking of horses which newly taken from the peaceful pursuits of life could not endure the sight of the stragglers lying by the wayside never to resume their toilsome journey dead as to any sentient life that was in it and yet alivethe form that had been lieutenant richard doubledick with whose praises england rang was conveyed to brussels  there it was tenderly laid down in hospital and there it lay week after week through the long bright summer days until the harvest spared by war had ripened and was gathered in  over and over again the sun rose and set upon the crowded city over and over again the moonlight nights were quiet on the plains of waterloo and all that time was a blank to what had been lieutenant richard doubledick rejoicing troops marched into brussels and marched out brothers and fathers sisters mothers and wives came thronging thither drew their lots of joy or agony and departed so many times a day the bells rang so many times the shadows of the great buildings changed so many lights sprang up at dusk so many feet passed here and there upon the pavements so many hours of sleep and cooler air of night succeeded indifferent to all a marble face lay on a bed like the face of a recumbent statue on the tomb of lieutenant richard doubledick  slowly labouring at last through a long heavy dream of confused time and place presenting faint glimpses of army surgeons whom he knew and of faces that had been familiar to his youthdearest and kindest among them mary marshalls with a solicitude upon it more like reality than anything he could discernlieutenant richard doubledick came back to life  to the beautiful life of a calm autumn evening sunset to the peaceful life of a fresh quiet room with a large window standing open a balcony beyond in which were moving leaves and sweetsmelling flowers beyond again the clear sky with the sun full in his sight pouring its golden radiance on his bed  it was so tranquil and so lovely that he thought he had passed into another world  and he said in a faint voice taunton are you near me  a face bent over him  not his his mothers  i came to nurse you  we have nursed you many weeks  you were moved here long ago  do you remember nothing  nothing  the lady kissed his cheek and held his hand soothing him  where is the regiment  what has happened  let me call you mother  what has happened mother  a great victory dear  the war is over and the regiment was the bravest in the field  his eyes kindled his lips trembled he sobbed and the tears ran down his face  he was very weak too weak to move his hand  was it dark just now he asked presently  no  it was only dark to me  something passed away like a black shadow  but as it went and the suno the blessed sun how beautiful it istouched my face i thought i saw a light white cloud pass out at the door  was there nothing that went out  she shook her head and in a little while he fell asleep she still holding his hand and soothing him  from that time he recovered  slowly for he had been desperately wounded in the head and had been shot in the body but making some little advance every day  when he had gained sufficient strength to converse as he lay in bed he soon began to remark that mrs taunton always brought him back to his own history  then he recalled his preservers dying words and thought it comforts her  one day he awoke out of a sleep refreshed and asked her to read to him but the curtain of the bed softening the light which she always drew back when he awoke that she might see him from her table at the bedside where she sat at work was held undrawn and a womans voice spoke which was not hers  can you bear to see a stranger it said softly  will you like to see a stranger  stranger he repeated  the voice awoke old memories before the days of private richard doubledick  a stranger now but not a stranger once it said in tones that thrilled him  richard dear richard lost through so many years my name  he cried out her name mary and she held him in her arms and his head lay on her bosom  i am not breaking a rash vow richard  these are not mary marshalls lips that speak  i have another name  she was married  i have another name richard  did you ever hear it  never  he looked into her face so pensively beautiful and wondered at the smile upon it through her tears  think again richard  are you sure you never heard my altered name  never  dont move your head to look at me dear richard  let it lie here while i tell my story  i loved a generous noble man loved him with my whole heart loved him for years and years loved him faithfully devotedly loved him without hope of return loved him knowing nothing of his highest qualitiesnot even knowing that he was alive  he was a brave soldier  he was honoured and beloved by thousands of thousands when the mother of his dear friend found me and showed me that in all his triumphs he had never forgotten me  he was wounded in a great battle  he was brought dying here into brussels  i came to watch and tend him as i would have joyfully gone with such a purpose to the dreariest ends of the earth  when he knew no one else he knew me  when he suffered most he bore his sufferings barely murmuring content to rest his head where your rests now  when he lay at the point of death he married me that he might call me wife before he died  and the name my dear love that i took on that forgotten night  i know it now he sobbed  the shadowy remembrance strengthens  it is come back  i thank heaven that my mind is quite restored  my mary kiss me lull this weary head to rest or i shall die of gratitude  his parting words were fulfilled  i see home again  well  they were happy  it was a long recovery but they were happy through it all  the snow had melted on the ground and the birds were singing in the leafless thickets of the early spring when those three were first able to ride out together and when people flocked about the open carriage to cheer and congratulate captain richard doubledick  but even then it became necessary for the captain instead of returning to england to complete his recovery in the climate of southern france they found a spot upon the rhone within a ride of the old town of avignon and within view of its broken bridge which was all they could desire they lived there together six months then returned to england mrs taunton growing old after three yearsthough not so old as that her bright dark eyes were dimmedand remembering that her strength had been benefited by the change resolved to go back for a year to those parts  so she went with a faithful servant who had often carried her son in his arms and she was to be rejoined and escorted home at the years end by captain richard doubledick  she wrote regularly to her children as she called them now and they to her  she went to the neighbourhood of aix and there in their own chateau near the farmers house she rented she grew into intimacy with a family belonging to that part of france  the intimacy began in her often meeting among the vineyards a pretty child a girl with a most compassionate heart who was never tired of listening to the solitary english ladys stories of her poor son and the cruel wars  the family were as gentle as the child and at length she came to know them so well that she accepted their invitation to pass the last month of her residence abroad under their roof  all this intelligence she wrote home piecemeal as it came about from time to time and at last enclosed a polite note from the head of the chateau soliciting on the occasion of his approaching mission to that neighbourhood the honour of the company of cet homme si justement celebre monsieur le capitaine richard doubledick  captain doubledick now a hardy handsome man in the full vigour of life broader across the chest and shoulders than he had ever been before dispatched a courteous reply and followed it in person  travelling through all that extent of country after three years of peace he blessed the better days on which the world had fallen  the corn was golden not drenched in unnatural red was bound in sheaves for food not trodden underfoot by men in mortal fight  the smoke rose up from peaceful hearths not blazing ruins  the carts were laden with the fair fruits of the earth not with wounds and death  to him who had so often seen the terrible reverse these things were beautiful indeed and they brought him in a softened spirit to the old chateau near aix upon a deep blue evening  it was a large chateau of the genuine old ghostly kind with round towers and extinguishers and a high leaden roof and more windows than aladdins palace  the lattice blinds were all thrown open after the heat of the day and there were glimpses of rambling walls and corridors within  then there were immense outbuildings fallen into partial decay masses of dark trees terracegardens balustrades tanks of water too weak to play and too dirty to work statues weeds and thickets of iron railing that seemed to have overgrown themselves like the shrubberies and to have branched out in all manner of wild shapes  the entrance doors stood open as doors often do in that country when the heat of the day is past and the captain saw no bell or knocker and walked in  he walked into a lofty stone hall refreshingly cool and gloomy after the glare of a southern days travel  extending along the four sides of this hall was a gallery leading to suites of rooms and it was lighted from the top  still no bell was to be seen  faith said the captain halting ashamed of the clanking of his boots this is a ghostly beginning  he started back and felt his face turn white  in the gallery looking down at him stood the french officerthe officer whose picture he had carried in his mind so long and so far  compared with the original at lastin every lineament how like it was  he moved and disappeared and captain richard doubledick heard his steps coming quickly down own into the hall  he entered through an archway there was a bright sudden look upon his face much such a look as it had worn in that fatal moment  monsieur le capitaine richard doubledick  enchanted to receive him  a thousand apologies  the servants were all out in the air  there was a little fete among them in the garden  in effect it was the fete day of my daughter the little cherished and protected of madame taunton  he was so gracious and so frank that monsieur le capitaine richard doubledick could not withhold his hand  it is the hand of a brave englishman said the french officer retaining it while he spoke  i could respect a brave englishman even as my foe how much more as my friend  i also am a soldier  he has not remembered me as i have remembered him he did not take such note of my face that day as i took of his thought captain richard doubledick  how shall i tell him  the french officer conducted his guest into a garden and presented him to his wife an engaging and beautiful woman sitting with mrs taunton in a whimsical oldfashioned pavilion  his daughter her fair young face beaming with joy came running to embrace him and there was a boybaby to tumble down among the orange trees on the broad steps in making for his fathers legs  a multitude of children visitors were dancing to sprightly music and all the servants and peasants about the chateau were dancing too  it was a scene of innocent happiness that might have been invented for the climax of the scenes of peace which had soothed the captains journey  he looked on greatly troubled in his mind until a resounding bell rang and the french officer begged to show him his rooms  they went upstairs into the gallery from which the officer had looked down and monsieur le capitaine richard doubledick was cordially welcomed to a grand outer chamber and a smaller one within all clocks and draperies and hearths and brazen dogs and tiles and cool devices and elegance and vastness  you were at waterloo said the french officer  i was said captain richard doubledick  and at badajos  left alone with the sound of his own stern voice in his ears he sat down to consider what shall i do and how shall i tell him  at that time unhappily many deplorable duels had been fought between english and french officers arising out of the recent war and these duels and how to avoid this officers hospitality were the uppermost thought in captain richard doubledicks mind  he was thinking and letting the time run out in which he should have dressed for dinner when mrs taunton spoke to him outside the door asking if he could give her the letter he had brought from mary  his mother above all the captain thought  how shall i tell her  you will form a friendship with your host i hope said mrs taunton whom he hurriedly admitted that will last for life  he is so truehearted and so generous richard that you can hardly fail to esteem one another  if he had been spared she kissed not without tears the locket in which she wore his hair he would have appreciated him with his own magnanimity and would have been truly happy that the evil days were past which made such a man his enemy  she left the room and the captain walked first to one window whence he could see the dancing in the garden then to another window whence he could see the smiling prospect and the peaceful vineyards  spirit of my departed friend said he is it through thee these better thoughts are rising in my mind  is it thou who hast shown me all the way i have been drawn to meet this man the blessings of the altered time  is it thou who hast sent thy stricken mother to me to stay my angry hand  is it from thee the whisper comes that this man did his duty as thou didstand as i did through thy guidance which has wholly saved me here on earthand that he did no more  he sat down with his head buried in his hands and when he rose up made the second strong resolution of his lifethat neither to the french officer nor to the mother of his departed friend nor to any soul while either of the two was living would he breathe what only he knew  and when he touched that french officers glass with his own that day at dinner he secretly forgave him in the name of the divine forgiver of injuries        here i ended my story as the first poor traveller  but if i had told it now i could have added that the time has since come when the son of major richard doubledick and the son of that french officer friends as their fathers were before them fought side by side in one cause with their respective nations like longdivided brothers whom the better times have brought together fast united     chapter iiithe road   my story being finished and the wassail too we broke up as the cathedral bell struck twelve  i did not take leave of my travellers that night for it had come into my head to reappear in conjunction with some hot coffee at seven in the morning  as i passed along the high street i heard the waits at a distance and struck off to find them  they were playing near one of the old gates of the city at the corner of a wonderfully quaint row of redbrick tenements which the clarionet obligingly informed me were inhabited by the minorcanons  they had odd little porches over the doors like soundingboards over old pulpits and i thought i should like to see one of the minorcanons come out upon his top stop and favour us with a little christmas discourse about the poor scholars of rochester taking for his text the words of his master relative to the devouring of widows houses  the clarionet was so communicative and my inclinations were as they generally are of so vagabond a tendency that i accompanied the waits across an open green called the vines and assistedin the french senseat the performance of two waltzes two polkas and three irish melodies before i thought of my inn any more  however i returned to it then and found a fiddle in the kitchen and ben the walleyed young man and two chambermaids circling round the great deal table with the utmost animation  i had a very bad night  it cannot have been owing to the turkey or the beefand the wassail is out of the questionbut in every endeavour that i made to get to sleep i failed most dismally  i was never asleep and in whatsoever unreasonable direction my mind rambled the effigy of master richard watts perpetually embarrassed it  in a word i only got out of the worshipful master richard wattss way by getting out of bed in the dark at six oclock and tumbling as my custom is into all the cold water that could be accumulated for the purpose the outer air was dull and cold enough in the street when i came down there and the one candle in our supperroom at wattss charity looked as pale in the burning as if it had had a bad night too  but my travellers had all slept soundly and they took to the hot coffee and the piles of breadandbutter which ben had arranged like deals in a timberyard as kindly as i could desire  while it was yet scarcely daylight we all came out into the street together and there shook hands  the widow took the little sailor towards chatham where he was to find a steamboat for sheerness the lawyer with an extremely knowing look went his own way without committing himself by announcing his intentions two more struck off by the cathedral and old castle for maidstone and the bookpedler accompanied me over the bridge  as for me i was going to walk by cobham woods as far upon my way to london as i fancied  when i came to the stile and footpath by which i was to diverge from the main road i bade farewell to my last remaining poor traveller and pursued my way alone  and now the mists began to rise in the most beautiful manner and the sun to shine and as i went on through the bracing air seeing the hoarfrost sparkle everywhere i felt as if all nature shared in the joy of the great birthday  going through the woods the softness of my tread upon the mossy ground and among the brown leaves enhanced the christmas sacredness by which i felt surrounded  as the whitened stems environed me i thought how the founder of the time had never raised his benignant hand save to bless and heal except in the case of one unconscious tree  by cobham hall i came to the village and the churchyard where the dead had been quietly buried in the sure and certain hope which christmas time inspired what children could i see at play and not be loving of recalling who had loved them  no garden that i passed was out of unison with the day for i remembered that the tomb was in a garden and that she supposing him to be the gardener had said sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away  in time the distant river with the ships came full in view and with it pictures of the poor fishermen mending their nets who arose and followed himof the teaching of the people from a ship pushed off a little way from shore by reason of the multitudeof a majestic figure walking on the water in the loneliness of night  my very shadow on the ground was eloquent of christmas for did not the people lay their sick where the more shadows of the men who had heard and seen him might fall as they passed along  thus christmas begirt me far and near until i had come to blackheath and had walked down the long vista of gnarled old trees in greenwich park and was being steamrattled through the mists now closing in once more towards the lights of london  brightly they shone but not so brightly as my own fire and the brighter faces around it when we came together to celebrate the day  and there i told of worthy master richard watts and of my supper with the six poor travellers who were neither rogues nor proctors and from that hour to this i have never seen one of them again
