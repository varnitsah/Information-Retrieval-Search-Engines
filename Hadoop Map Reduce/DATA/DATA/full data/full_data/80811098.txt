delay no longer incongruous and full of skips and jumps as is that huddle of diaryjottings warmemoranda of 186265 naturenotes of 187781 with western and canadian observations afterwards all bundled up and tied by a big string the resolution and indeed mandate comes to me this day this hourand what a day what an hour just passing the luxury of riant grass and blowing breeze with all the shows of sun and sky and perfect temperature never before so filling me body and soulto go home untie the bundle reel out diaryscraps and memoranda just as they are large or small one after another into printpages1 and let the melanges lackings and wants of connection take care of themselves it will illustrate one phase of humanity anyhow how few of lifes days and hours and they not by relative value or proportion but by chance are ever noted probably another point too how we give long preparations for some object planning and delving and fashioning and then when the actual hour for doing arrives find ourselves still quite unprepared and tumble the thing together letting hurry and crudeness tell the story better than fine work at any rate i obey my happy hours command which seems curiously imperative may be if i dont do anything else i shall send out the most wayward spontaneous fragmentary book ever printed   note  1 the pages from 1 to 15 are nearly verbatim an offhand letter of mine in january 1882 to an insisting friend following i give some gloomy experiences the war of attempted secession has of course been the distinguishing event of my time i commenced at the close of 1862 and continued steadily through 63 64 and 65 to visit the sick and wounded of the army both on the field and in the hospitals in and around washington city from the first i kept little notebooks for impromptu jottings in pencil to refresh my memory of names and circumstances and what was specially wanted c in these i briefd cases persons sights occurrences in camp by the bedside and not seldom by the corpses of the dead some were scratchd down from narratives i heard and itemized while watching or waiting or tending somebody amid those scenes i have dozens of such little notebooks left forming a special history of those years for myself alone full of associations never to be possibly said or sung i wish i could convey to the reader the associations that attach to these soild and creasd livraisons each composed of a sheet or two of paper folded small to carry in the pocket and fastend with a pin i leave them just as i threw them by after the war blotchd here and there with more than one bloodstain hurriedly written sometimes at the clinique not seldom amid the excitement of uncertainty or defeat or of action or getting ready for it or a march most of the pages from 20 to 75 are verbatim copies of those lurid and bloodsmuchd little notebooks  very different are most of the memoranda that follow some time after the war ended i had a paralytic stroke which prostrated me for several years in 1876 i began to get over the worst of it from this date portions of several seasons especially summers i spent at a secluded haunt down in camden county new jerseytimber creek quite a little river it enters from the great delaware twelve miles awaywith primitive solitudes winding stream recluse and woody banks sweetfeeding springs and all the charms that birds grass wildflowers rabbits and squirrels old oaks walnut trees c can bring through these times and on these spots the diary from page 76 onward was mostly written  the collect afterwards gathers up the odds and ends of whatever pieces i can now lay hands on written at various times past and swoops all together like fish in a net  i suppose i publish and leave the whole gathering first from that eternal tendency to perpetuate and preserve which is behind all nature authors included second to symbolize two or three specimen interiors personal and other out of the myriads of my time the middle range of the nineteenth century in the new world a strange unloosend wondrous time but the book is probably without any definite purpose that can be told in a statement   answer to an insisting friend  you ask for items details of my early lifeof genealogy and parentage particularly of the women of my ancestry and of its farback netherlands stock on the maternal sideof the region where i was born and raised and my mother and father before me and theirs before themwith a word about brooklyn and new york cities the times i lived there as lad and young man you say you want to get at these details mainly as the gobefores and embryons of leaves of grass very good you shall have at least some specimens of them all i have often thought of the meaning of such thingsthat one can only encompass and complete matters of that kind by exploring behind perhaps very far behind themselves directly and so into their genesis antecedents and cumulative stages then as luck would have it i lately whiled away the tedium of a weeks halfsickness and confinement by collating these very items for another yet unfulfilled probably abandond purpose and if you will be satisfied with them authentic in dateoccurrence and fact simply and told my own way garrulouslike here they are i shall not hesitate to make extracts for i catch at anything to save labor but those will be the best versions of what i want to convey   genealogyvan velsor and whitman  the later years of the last century found the van velsor family my mothers side living on their own farm at cold spring long island new york state near the eastern edge of queens county about a mile from the harbor2 my fathers sideprobably the fifth generation from the first english arrivals in new englandwere at the same time farmers on their own landand a fine domain it was 500 acres all good soil gently sloping east and south about onetenth woods plenty of grand old trees two or three miles off at west hills suffolk county the whitman name in the eastern states and so branch and south starts undoubtedly from one john whitman born 1602 in old england where he grew up married and his eldest son was born in 1629 he came over in the true love in 1640 to america and lived in weymouth mass which place became the motherhive of the newenglanders of the name he died in 1692 his brother rev zechariah whitman also came over in the true love either at that time or soon after and lived at milford conn a son of this zechariah named joseph migrated to huntington long island and permanently settled there savages genealogical dictionary vol iv p 524 gets the whitman family establishd at huntington per this joseph before 1664 it is quite certain that from that beginning and from joseph the west hill whitmans and all others in suffolk county have since radiated myself among the number john and zechariah both went to england and back again divers times they had large families and several of their children were born in the old country we hear of the father of john and zechariah abijah whitman who goes over into the 1500s but we know little about him except that he also was for some time in america  these old pedigreereminiscences come up to me vividly from a visit i made not long since in my 63d year to west hills and to the burial grounds of my ancestry both sides i extract from notes of that visit written there and then   note  2 long island was settled first on the west end by the dutch from holland then on the east end by the englishthe dividing line of the two nationalities being a little west of huntington where my fathers folks lived and where i was born   the old whitman and van velsor cemeteries  july 29 1881after more than forty years absence except a brief visit to take my father there once more two years before he died went down long island on a week s jaunt to the place where i was born thirty miles from new york city rode around the old familiar spots viewing and pondering and dwelling long upon them everything coming back to me went to the old whitman homestead on the upland and took a view eastward inclining south over the broad and beautiful farm lands of my grandfather 1780 and my father there was the new house 1810 the big oak a hundred and fifty or two hundred years old there the well the sloping kitchengarden and a little way off even the wellkept remains of the dwelling of my greatgrandfather 175060 still standing with its mighty timbers and low ceilings near by a stately grove of tall vigorous blackwalnuts beautiful apollolike the sons or grandsons no doubt of blackwalnuts during or before 1776 on the other side of the road spread the famous apple orchard over twenty acres the trees planted by hands long mouldering in the grave my uncle jesses but quite many of them evidently capable of throwing out their annual blossoms and fruit yet  i now write these lines seated on an old grave doubtless of a century since at least on the burial hill of the whitmans of many generations fifty or more graves are quite plainly traceable and as many more decayd out of all formdepressd mounds crumbled and broken stones coverd with mossthe gray and sterile hill the clumps of chestnuts outside the silence just varied by the soughing wind there is always the deepest eloquence of sermon or poem in any of these ancient graveyards of which long island has so many so what must this one have been to me my whole family history with its succession of links from the first settlement down to date told herethree centuries concentrate on this sterile acre  the next day july 30 i devoted to the maternal locality and if possible was still more penetrated and impressd i write this paragraph on the burial hul of the van velsors near cold spring the most significant depository of the dead that could be imagind without the slightest help from art but far ahead of it soil sterile a mostly bare plateauflat of half an acre the top of a hill brush and well grown trees and dense woods bordering all around very primitive secluded no visitors no road you cannot drive here you have to bring the dead on foot and follow on foot two or threescore graves quite plain as many more almost rubbd out my grandfather cornelius and my grandmother amy naomi and numerous relatives nearer or remoter on my mothers side lie buried here the scene as i stood or sat the delicate and wild odor of the woods a slightly drizzling rain the emotional atmosphere of the place and the inferrd reminiscences were fitting accompaniments   the maternal homestead  i went down from this ancient grave place eighty or ninety rods to the site of the van velsor homestead where my mother was born 1795 and where every spot had been familiar to me as a child and youth 182540 then stood there a long rambling darkgray shinglesided house with sheds pens a great barn and much open roadspace now of all those not a vestige left all had been pulld down erased and the plough and harrow passd over foundations roadspaces and everything for many summers fenced in at present and grain and clover growing like any other fine fields only a big hole from the cellar with some little heaps of broken stone green with grass and weeds identified the place even the copious old brook and spring seemd to have mostly dwindled away the whole scene with what it arousd memories of my young days there half a century ago the vast kitchen and ample fireplace and the sittingroom adjoining the plain furniture the meals the house full of merry people my grandmother amys sweet old face in its quaker cap my grandfather the major jovial red stout with sonorous voice and characteristic physiognomy with the actual sights themselves made the most pronouncd halfdays experience of my whole jaunt  for there with all those wooded hilly healthy surroundings my dearest mother louisa van velsor grew upher mother amy williams of the friends or quakers denominationthe williams family seven sisters and one brotherthe father and brother sailors both of whom met their deaths at sea the van velsor people were noted for fine horses which the men bred and traind from blooded stock my mother as a young woman was a daily and daring rider as to the head of the family himself the old race of the netherlands so deeply grafted on manhattan island and in kings and queens counties never yielded a more markd and full americanized specimen than major cornelius van velsor   two old family interiors  of the domestic and inside life of the middle of long island at and just before that time here are two samples  the whitmans at the beginning of the present century lived in a long storyandahalf farmhouse hugely timberd which is still standing a great smokecanopied kitchen with vast hearth and chimney formd one end of the house the existence of slavery in new york at that time and the possession by the family of some twelve or fifteen slaves house and field servants gave things quite a patriarchial look the very young darkies could be seen a swarm of them toward sundown in this kitchen squatted in a circle on the floor eating their supper of indian pudding and milk in the house and in food and furniture all was rude but substantial no carpets or stoves were known and no coffee and tea or sugar only for the women rousing wood fires gave both warmth and light on winter nights pork poultry beef and all the ordinary vegetables and grains were plentiful cider was the mens common drink and used at meals the clothes were mainly homespun journeys were made by both men and women on horseback both sexes labord with their own handsthe men on the farmthe women in the house and around it books were scarce the annual copy of the almanac was a treat and was pored over through the long winter evenings i must not forget to mention that both these families were near enough to the sea to behold it from the high places and to hear in still hours the roar of the surf the latter after a storm giving a peculiar sound at night then all hands male and female went down frequently on beach and bathing parties and the men on practical expeditions for cutting salt hay and for clamming and fishingjohn burroughss notes  the ancestors of walt whitman on both the paternal and maternal sides kept a good table sustained the hospitalities decorums and an excellent social reputation in the county and they were often of markd individuality if space permitted i should consider some of the men worthy special description and still more some of the women his greatgrandmother on the paternal side for instance was a large swarthy woman who lived to a very old age she smoked tobacco rode on horseback like a man managed the most vicious horse and becoming a widow in later life went forth every day over her farmlands frequently in the saddle directing the labor of her slaves in language in which on exciting occasions oaths were not spared the two immediate grandmothers were in the best sense superior women the maternal one amy williams before marriage was a friend or quakeress of sweet sensible character housewifely proclivities and deeply intuitive and spiritual the other hannah brush was an equally noble perhaps stronger character lived to be very old had quite a family of sons was a natural lady was in early life a schoolmistress and had great solidity of mind w w himself makes much of the women of his ancestrythe same  out from these arrieres of persons and scenes i was born may 31 1819 and now to dwell awhile on the locality itselfas the successive growthstages of my infancy childhood youth and manhood were all passd on long island which i sometimes feel as if i had incorporated i roamd as boy and man and have lived in nearly all parts from brooklyn to montauk point   paumanok and my life on it as child and young man  worth fully and particularly investigating indeed this paumanok to give the spot its aboriginal name3 stretching east through kings queens and suffolk counties 120 miles altogetheron the north long island sound a beautiful varied and picturesque series of inlets necks and sealike expansions for a hundred miles to orient point on the ocean side the great south bay dotted with countless hummocks mostly small some quite large occasionally long bars of sand out two hundred rods to a mileandahalf from the shore while now and then as at rockaway and far east along the hamptons the beach makes right on the island the sea dashing up without intervention several lighthouses on the shores east a long history of wrecks tragedies some even of late years as a youngster i was in the atmosphere and traditions of many of these wrecksof one or two almost an observer off hempstead beach for example was the loss of the ship mexico in 1840 alluded to in the sleepers in l of g and at hampton some years later the destruction of the brig elizabeth a fearful affair in one of the worst winter gales where margaret fuller went down with her husband and child  inside the outer bars or beach this south bay is everywhere comparatively shallow of cold winters all thick ice on the surface as a boy i often went forth with a chum or two on those frozen fields with handsled axe and eelspear after messes of eels we would cut holes in the ice sometimes striking quite an eelbonanza and filling our baskets with great fat sweet whitemeated fellows the scenes the ice drawing the handsled cutting holes spearing the eels c were of course just such fun as is dearest to boyhood the shores of this bay winter and summer and my doings there in early life are woven all through l of g one sport i was very fond of was to go on a bayparty in summer to gather seagulls eggs the gulls lay two or three eggs more than half the size of hens eggs right on the sand and leave the suns heat to hatch them  the eastern end of long island the peconic bay region i knew quite well toosaild more than once around shelter island and down to montaukspent many an hour on turtle hill by the old lighthouse on the extreme point looking out over the ceaseless roll of the atlantic i used to like to go down there and fraternize with the bluefishers or the annual squads of seabass takers sometimes along montauk peninsula it is some 15 miles long and good grazing met the strange unkempt halfbarbarous herdsmen at that time living there entirely aloof from society or civilization in charge on those rich pasturages of vast droves of horses kine or sheep ownd by farmers of the eastern towns sometimes too the few remaining indians or halfbreeds at that period left on montauk peninsula but now i believe altogether extinct  more in the middle of the island were the spreading hempstead plains then 183040 quite prairielike open uninhabited rather sterile coverd with killcalf and huckleberry bushes yet plenty of fair pasture for the cattle mostly milchcows who fed there by hundreds even thousands and at evening the plains too were ownd by the towns and this was the use of them in common might be seen taking their way home branching off regularly in the right places i have often been out on the edges of these plains toward sundown and can yet recall in fancy the interminable cowprocessions and hear the music of the tin or copper bells clanking far or near and breathe the cool of the sweet and slightly aromatic evening air and note the sunset  through the same region of the island but further east extended wide central tracts of pine and scruboak charcoal was largely made here monotonous and sterile but many a good day or halfday did i have wandering through those solitary crossroads inhaling the peculiar and wild aroma here and all along the island and its shores i spent intervals many years all seasons sometimes riding sometimes boating but generally afoot i was always then a good walker absorbing fields shores marine incidents characters the baymen farmers pilotsalways had a plentiful acquaintance with the latter and with fishermenwent every summer on sailing tripsalways liked the bare seabeach south side and have some of my happiest hours on it to this day  as i write the whole experience comes back to me after the lapse of forty and more yearsthe soothing rustle of the waves and the saline smellboyhoods times the clamdigging barefoot and with trowsers rolld uphauling down the creekthe perfume of the sedgemeadowsthe hayboat and the chowder and fishing excursionsor of later years little voyages down and out new york bay in the pilot boats those same later years also while living in brooklyn 183650 i went regularly every week in the mild seasons down to coney island at that time a long bare unfrequented shore which i had all to myself and where i loved after bathing to race up and down the hard sand and declaim homer or shakspere to the surf and sea gulls by the hour but i am getting ahead too rapidly and must keep more in my traces    note  3 paumanok or paumanake or paumanack the indian name of long island over a hundred miles long shaped like a fishplenty of sea shore sandy stormy uninviting the horizon boundless the air too strong for invalids the bays a wonderful resort for aquatic birds the southside meadows coverd with salt hay the soil of the island generally tough but good for the locusttree the apple orchard and the blackberry and with numberless springs of the sweetest water in the world years ago among the baymena strong wild race now extinct or rather entirely changeda native of long island was called a paumanacker or creolepaumanackerjohn burroughs   my first readinglafayette  from 1824 to 28 our family lived in brooklyn in front cranberry and johnson streets in the latter my father built a nice house for a home and afterwards another in tillary street we occupied them one after the other but they were mortgaged and we lost them i yet remember lafayettes visit4 most of these years i went to the public schools it must have been about 1829 or 30 that i went with my father and mother to hear elias hicks preach in a ballroom on brooklyn heights at about the same time employd as a boy in an office lawyers father and two sons clarkes fulton street near orange i had a nice desk and windownook to myself edward c kindly helpd me at my handwriting and composition and the signal event of my life up to that time subscribed for me to a big circulating library for a time i now reveld in romancereading of all kinds first the arabian nights all the volumes an amazing treat then with sorties in very many other directions took in walter scotts novels one after another and his poetry and continue to enjoy novels and poetry to this day   note  4 on the visit of general lafayette to this country in 1824 he came over to brooklyn in state and rode through the city the children of the schools turnd out to join in the welcome an edifice for a free public library for youths was just then commencing and lafayette consented to stop on his way and lay the cornerstone numerous children arriving on the ground where a huge irregular excavation for the building was already dug surrounded with heaps of rough stone several gentlemen assisted in lifting the children to safe or convenient spots to see the ceremony among the rest lafayette also helping the children took up the fiveyearold walt whitman and pressing the child a moment to his breast and giving him a kiss handed him down to a safe spot in the excavationjohn burroughs   printing officeold brooklyn  after about two years went to work in a weekly newspaper and printing office to learn the trade the paper was the long island patriot owned by s e clements who was also postmaster an old printer in the office william hartshorne a revolutionary character who had seen washington was a special friend of mine and i had many a talk with him about long past times the apprentices including myself boarded with his granddaughter i used occasionally to go out riding with the boss who was very kind to us boys sundays he took us all to a great old rough fortresslooking stone church on joralemon street near where the brooklyn city hall now isat that time broad fields and country roads everywhere around5 afterward i workd on the long island star alden spooners paper my father all these years pursuing his trade as carpenter and builder with varying fortune there was a growing

1835 and always badly crippled as i am myself of late years   note  5 of the brooklyn of that time 183040 hardly anything remains except the lines of the old streets the population was then between ten and twelve thousand for a mile fulton street was lined with magnificent elm trees the character of the place was thoroughly rural as a sample of comparative values it may be mentiond that twentyfive acres in what is now the most costly part of the city bounded by flatbush and fulton avenues were then bought by mr parmentier a french emigre for 4000 who remembers the old places as they were who remembers the old citizens of that time among the former were smith  woods coe downings and other public houses at the ferry the old ferry itself love lane the heights as then the wallabout

growthhealthwork  i developd 183345 into a healthy strong youth grew too fast though was nearly as big as a man at 15 or 16 our family at this period moved back to the country my dear mother very ill for a long time but recoverd all these years i was down long island more or less every summer now east now west sometimes months at a stretch at 16 17 and so on was fond of debating societies and had an active membership with them off and on in brooklyn and one or two country towns on the island a most omnivorous novelreader these and later years devourd everything i could get fond of the theatre also in new york went whenever i couldsometimes witnessing fine performances  18367 workd as compositor in printing offices in new york city then when little more than 18 and for a while afterwards went to teaching country schools down in queens and suffolk counties long island and boarded round this latter i consider one of my best experiences and deepest lessons in human nature behind the scenes and in the masses in 39 40 i started and publishd a weekly paper in my native town huntington then returning to new york city and brooklyn workd on as printer and writer mostly prose but an occasional shy at poetry   my passion for ferries  living in brooklyn or new york city from this time forward my life then and still more the following years was curiously identified with fulton ferry already becoming the greatest of its sort in the world for general importance volume variety rapidity and picturesqueness almost daily later 50 to 60 i crossd on the boats often up in the pilothouses where i could get a full sweep absorbing shows accompaniments surroundings what oceanic currents eddies underneaththe great tides of humanity also with evershifting movements indeed i have always had a passion for ferries to me they afford inimitable streaming neverfailing living poems the river and bay scenery all about new york island any time of a fine daythe hurrying splashing seatidesthe changing panorama of steamers all sizes often a string of big ones outward bound to distant portsthe myriads of whitesaild schooners sloops skiffs and the marvellously beautiful yachtsthe majestic sound boats as they rounded the battery and came along towards 5 afternoon eastward boundthe prospect off towards staten island or down the narrows or the other way up the hudsonwhat refreshment of spirit such sights and experiences gave me years ago and many a time since my old pilot friends the balsirs johnny cole ira smith william white and my young ferry friend tom gerehow well i remember them all   broadway sights  besides fulton ferry off and on for years i knew and frequented broadwaythat noted avenue of new yorks crowded and mixed humanity and of so many notables here i saw during those times andrew jackson webster clay seward martin van buren filibuster walker kossuth fitz greene halleck bryant the prince of wales charles dickens the first japanese ambassadors and lots of other celebrities of the time always something novel or inspiriting yet mostly to me the hurrying and vast amplitude of those neverending human currents i remember seeing james fenimore cooper in a courtroom in chambers street back of the city hall where he was carrying on a law casei think it was a charge of libel he had brought against some one i also remember seeing edgar a poe and having a short interview with him it must have been in 1845 or 6 in his office second story of a corner building duane or pearl street he was editor and owner or part owner of the broadway journal the visit was about a piece of mine he had publishd poe was very cordial in a quiet way appeard well in person dress c i have a distinct and pleasing remembrance of his looks voice manner and matter very kindly and human but subdued perhaps a little jaded for another of my reminiscences here on the west side just below houston street i once saw it must have been about 1832 of a sharp bright january day a bent feeble but stoutbuilt very old man bearded swathed in rich furs with a great ermine cap on his head led and assisted almost carried down the steps of his high front stoop a dozen friends and servants emulous carefully holding guiding him and then lifted and tuckd in a gorgeous sleigh envelopd in other furs for a ride the sleigh was drawn by as fine a team of horses as i ever saw you neednt think all the best animals are brought up nowadays never was such horseflesh as fifty years ago on long island or south or in new york city folks lookd for spirit and mettle in a nag not tame speed merely well i a boy of perhaps 13 or 14 stoppd and gazed long at the spectacle of that furswathed old man surrounded by friends and servants and the careful seating of him in the sleigh i remember the spirited champing horses the driver with his whip and a fellowdriver by his side for extra prudence the old man the subject of so much attention i can almost see now it was john jacob astor  the years 1846 47 and there along see me still in new york city working as writer and printer having my usual good health and a good time generally   omnibus jaunts and drivers  one phase of those days must by no means go unrecordednamely the broadway omnibuses with their drivers  the vehicles still i write this paragraph in 1881 give a portion of the character of broadwaythe fifth avenue madison avenue and twentythird street lines yet running but the flush days of the old broadway stages characteristic and copious are over the yellowbirds the redbirds the original broadway the fourth avenue the knickerbocker and a dozen others of twenty or thirty years ago are all gone and the men specially identified with them and giving vitality and meaning to themthe driversa strange natural quickeyed and wondrous racenot only rabelais and cervantes would have gloated upon them but homer and shakspere wouldhow well i remember them and must here give a word about them how many hours forenoons and afternoonshow many exhilarating nighttimes i have hadperhaps june or july in cooler airriding the whole length of broadway listening to some yarn and the most vivid yarns ever spun and the rarest mimicryor perhaps i declaiming some stormy passage from julius caesar or richard you could roar as loudly as you chose in that heavy dense uninterrupted streetbass yes i knew all the drivers then broadway jack dressmaker balky bill george storms old elephant his brother young elephant who came afterward tippy pop rice big frank yellow joe pete callahan patsey dee and dozens more for there were hundreds they had immense qualities largely animaleating drinking womengreat personal pride in their wayperhaps a few slouches here and there but i should have trusted the general run of them in their simple goodwill and honor under all circumstances not only for comradeship and sometimes affectiongreat studies i found them also i suppose the critics will laugh heartily but the influence of those broadway omnibus jaunts and drivers and declamations and escapades undoubtedly enterd into the gestation of leaves of grass   plays and operas too  and certain actors and singers had a good deal to do with the business all through these years off and on i frequented the old park the bowery broadway and chathamsquare theatres and the italian operas at chambersstreet astorplace or the batterymany seasons was on the free list writing for papers even as quite a youth the old park theatrewhat names reminiscences the words bring back placide clarke mrs vernon fisher clara f mrs

nations said so and my boyish heart and head felt it in every minute cell the lady was just matured strong better than merely beautiful born from the footlights had had three years practice in london and through the british towns and then she came to give america that young maturity and roseate power in all their noon or rather forenoon flush it was my good luck to see her nearly every night she playd at the old parkcertainly in all her principal characters i heard these years well renderd all the italian and other operas in vogue sonnambula the puritans der freischutz huguenots fille dregiment faust etoile du nord poliuto and others verdis ernani rigoletto and trovatore with donnizettis lucia or favorita or lucrezia and aubers massaniello or rossinis william tell and gazza ladra were among my special enjoyments i heard alboni every time she sang in new york and vicinityalso grisi the tenor mario and the baritone badiali the finest in the world  this musical passion followd my theatrical one as a boy or young man i had seen reading them carefully the day beforehand quite all shaksperes acting dramas playd wonderfully well even yet i cannot conceive anything finer than old

cool seabreezes the unsurpassd vocalismsteffanone bosio truffi marini in marino faliero don pasquale or favorita no better playing or singing ever in new york it was here too i afterward heard jenny lind the batteryits past associationswhat tales those old trees and walks and seawalls could tell   through eight years  in 1848 49 i was occupied as editor of the daily eagle newspaper in brooklyn the latter year went off on a leisurely journey and working expedition my brother jeff with me through all the middle states and down the ohio and mississippi rivers lived awhile in new orleans and workd there on the editorial staff of daily crescent newspaper after a time plodded back northward up the mississippi and around to and by way of the great lakes michigan huron and erie to niagara falls and lower canada finally returning through central new york and down the hudson traveling altogether probably 8000 miles this trip to and fro 51 53 occupied in housebuilding in brooklyn for a little of the first part of that time in printing a daily and weekly paper the freeman 55 lost my dear father this year by death commenced putting leaves of grass to press for good at the job printing office of my friends the brothers rome in brooklyn after many ms doings and undoingsi had great trouble in leaving out the stock poetical touches but succeeded at last i am now 18567 passing through my 37th year   sources of characterresults1860  to sum up the foregoing from the outset and of course far far more unrecorded i estimate three leading sources and formative stamps to my own character now solidified for good or bad and its subsequent literary and other outgrowththe maternal nativitystock brought hither from faraway netherlands for one doubtless the bestthe subterranean tenacity and central bony structure obstinacy wilfulness which i get from my paternal english elements for anotherand the combination of my long island birthspot seashores childhoods scenes absorptions with teeming brooklyn and new york with i suppose my experiences afterward in the secession outbreak for the third  for in 1862 startled by news that my brother george an officer in the 51st new york volunteers had been seriously wounded first fredericksburg battle december 13th i hurriedly went down to the field of war in virginia but i must go back a little   opening of the secession war  news of the attack on fort sumter and the flag at charleston harbor s c was receivd in new york city late at night 13th april 1861 and was immediately sent out in extras of the newspapers i had been to the opera in fourteenth street that night and after the performance was walking down broadway toward twelve oclock on my way to brooklyn when i heard in the distance the loud cries of the newsboys who came presently tearing and yelling up the street rushing from side to side even more furiously than usual i bought an extra and crossd to the metropolitan hotel niblos where the great lamps were still brightly blazing and with a crowd of others who gatherd impromptu read the news which was evidently authentic for the benefit of some who had no papers one of us read the telegram aloud while all listend silently and attentively no remark was made by any of the crowd which had increasd to thirty or forty but all stood a minute or two i remember before they dispersd i can almost see them there now under the lamps at midnight again   national uprising and volunteering  i have said somewhere that the three presidentiads preceding 1861 showd how the weakness and wickedness of rulers are just as eligible here in america under republican as in europe under dynastic influences but what can i say of that prompt and splendid wrestling with secession slavery the archenemy personified the instant he unmistakably showd his face the volcanic upheaval of the nation after that firing on the flag at charleston proved for certain something which had been previously in great doubt and at once substantially settled the question of disunion in my judgment it will remain as the grandest and most encouraging spectacle yet vouchsafed in any age old or new to political progress and democracy it was not for what came to the surface merelythough that was importantbut what it indicated below which was of eternal importance down in the abysms of new world humanity there had formd and hardend a primal hardpan of national union will determind and in the majority refusing to be tamperd with or argued against confronting all emergencies and capable at any time of bursting all surface bonds and breaking out like an earthquake it is indeed the best lesson of the century or of america and it is a mighty privilege to have been part of it two great spectacles immortal proofs of democracy unequalld in all the history of the past are furnishd by the secession warone at the beginning the other at its close those are the general voluntary armd upheaval and the peaceful and harmonious disbanding of the armies in the summer of 1865   contemptuous feeling  even after the bombardment of sumter however the gravity of the revolt and the power and will of the slave states for a strong and continued military resistance to national authority were not at all realized at the north except by a few ninetenths of the people of the free states lookd upon the rebellion as started in south carolina from a feeling onehalf of contempt and the other half composed of anger and incredulity it was not thought it would be joind in by virginia north carolina or georgia a great and cautious national official predicted that it would blow over in sixty days and folks generally believd the prediction i remember talking about it on a fulton ferryboat with the brooklyn mayor who said he only hoped the southern fireeaters would commit some overt act of resistance as they would then be at once so effectually squelchd we would never hear of secession againbut he was afraid they never would have the pluck to really do anything  i remember too that a couple of companies of the thirteenth brooklyn who rendezvoud at the city armory and started thence as thirty days men were all provided with pieces of rope conspicuously tied to their musketbarrels with which to bring back each man a prisoner from the audacious south to be led in a noose on our mens early and triumphant return   battle of bull run july 1861  all this sort of feeling was destind to be arrested and reversd by a terrible shockthe battle of first bull runcertainly as we now know it one of the most singular fights on record all battles and their results are far more matters of accident than is generally thought but this was throughout a casualty a chance each side supposed it had won till the last moment one had in point of fact just the same right to be routed as the other by a fiction or series of fictions the national forces at the last moment exploded in a panic and fled from the field the defeated troops commenced pouring into washington over the long bridge at daylight on monday 22dday drizzling all through with rain the saturday and sunday of the battle 20th 21st had been parchd and hot to an extremethe dust the grime and smoke in layers sweated in followd by other layers again sweated in absorbd by those excited soulstheir clothes all saturated with the claypowder filling the airstirrd up everywhere on the dry roads and trodden fields by the regiments swarming wagons artillery call the men with this coating of murk and sweat and rain now recoiling back pouring over the long bridgea horrible march of twenty miles returning to washington baffed humiliated panicstruck where are the vaunts and the proud boasts with which you went forth where are your banners and your bands of music and your ropes to bring back your prisoners well there isnt a band playingand there isnt a flag but clings ashamed and lank to its staff  the sun rises but shines not the men appear at first sparsely and shamefaced enough then thicker in the streets of washington appear in pennsylvania avenue and on the steps and basement entrances they come along in disorderly mobs some in squads stragglers companies occasionally a rare regiment in perfect order with its officers some gaps dead the true braves marching in silence with lowering faces stern weary to sinking all black and dirty but every man with his musket and stepping alive but these are the exceptions sidewalks of pennsylvania avenue fourteenth street c crowded jammd with citizens darkies clerks everybody lookerson women in the windows curious expressions from faces as those swarms of dirtcoverd returnd soldiers there will they never end move by but nothing said no comments half our lookerson secesh of the most venomous kindthey say nothing but the devil snickers in their faces during the forenoon washington gets all over motley with these defeated soldiersqueerlooking objects strange eyes and faces drenchd the steady rain drizzles on all day and fearfully worn hungry haggard blisterd in the feet good people but not overmany of them either hurry up something for their grub they put washkettles on the fire for soup for coffee they set tables on the sidewalkswagonloads of bread are purchasd swiftly cut in stout chunks here are two aged ladies beautiful the first in the city for culture and charm they stand with store of eating and drink at an improvisd table of rough plank and give food and have the store replenished from their house every halfhour all that day and there in the rain they stand active silent whitehaird and give food though the tears stream down their cheeks almost without intermission the whole time amid the deep excitement crowds and motion and desperate eagerness it seems strange to see many very many of the soldiers sleepingin the midst of all sleeping sound they drop down anywhere on the steps of houses up close by the basements or fences on the sidewalk aside on some vacant lot and deeply sleep a poor 17 or 18 year old boy lies there on the stoop of a grand house he sleeps so calmly so profoundly some clutch their muskets firmly even in sleep some in squads comrades brothers close togetherand on them as they lay sulkily drips the rain  as afternoon passd and evening came the streets the barrooms knots everywhere listeners questioners terrible yarns bugaboo maskd batteries our regiment all cut up cstories and storytellers windy bragging vain centres of streetcrowds resolution manliness seem to have abandond washington the principal hotel willards is full of shoulderstrapsthick crushd creeping with shoulderstraps i see them and must have a word with them there you are shoulderstrapsbut where are your companies where are your men incompetents never tell me of chances of battle of getting strayd and the like i think this is your work this retreat after all sneak blow put on airs there in willards sumptuous parlors and barrooms or anywhereno explanation shall save you bull run is your work had you been half or onetenth worthy your men this would never have happend  meantime in washington among the great persons and their entourage a mixture of awful consternation uncertainty rage shame helplessness and stupefying disappointment the worst is not only imminent but already here in a few hoursperhaps before the next mealthe secesh generals with their victorious hordes will be upon us the dream of humanity the vaunted union we thought so strong so impregnablelo it seems already smashd like a china plate one bitter bitter hourperhaps proud america will never again know such an hour she must pack and flyno time to spare those white palacesthe domecrownd capitol there on the hill so stately over the treesshall they be leftor destroyd first for it is certain that the talk among certain of the magnates and officers and clerks and officials everywhere for twentyfour hours in and around washington after bull run was loud and undisguised for yielding out and out and substituting the southern rule and lincoln promptly abdicating and departing if the secesh officers and forces had immediately followd and by a bold napoleonic movement had enterd washington the first day or even the second they could have had things their own way and a powerful faction north to back them one of our returning colonels expressd in public that night amid a swarm of officers and gentlemen in a crowded room the opinion that it was useless to fight that the southerners had made their title clear and that the best course for the national government to pursue was to desist from any further attempt at stopping them and admit them again to the lead on the best terms they were willing to grant not a voice was raisd against this judgment amid that large crowd of officers and gentlemen the fact is the hour was one of the three or four of those crises we had then and afterward during the fluctuations of four years when human eyes appeard at least just as likely to see the last breath of the union as to see it continue   the stupor passessomething else begins  but the hour the day the night passd and whatever returns an hour a day a night like that can never again return the president recovering himself begins that very nightsternly rapidly sets about the task of reorganizing his forces and placing himself in positions for future and surer work if there were nothing else of abraham lincoln for history to stamp him with it is enough to send him with his wreath to the memory of all future time that he endured that hour that day bitterer than gallindeed a crucifixion daythat it did not conquer himthat he unflinchingly stemmd it and resolvd to lift himself and the union out of it  then the great new york papers at once appeard commencing that evening and following it up the next morning and incessantly through many days afterwards with leaders that rang out over the land with the loudest most reverberating ring of clearest bugles full of encouragement hope inspiration unfaltering defiance those magnificent editorials they never flaggd for a fortnight the herald commenced themi remember the articles well the tribune was equally cogent and inspiritingand the times evening post and other principal papers were not a whit behind they came in good time for they were needed for in the humiliation of bull run the popular feeling north from its extreme of superciliousness recoild to the depth of gloom and apprehension  of all the days of the war there are two especially i can never forget those were the day following the news in new york and brooklyn of that first bull run defeat and the day of abraham lincolns death i was home in brooklyn on both occasions the day of the murder we heard the news very early in the morning mother prepared breakfastand other meals afterwardas usual but not a mouthful was eaten all day by either of us we each drank half a cup of coffee that was all little was said we got every newspaper morning and evening and the frequent extras of that period and passd them silently to each other   down at the front  falmouth va opposite fredericksburgh december 21 1862begin my visits among the camp hospitals in the army of the potomac spend a good part of the day in a large brick mansion on the banks of the rappahannock used as a hospital since the battleseems to have receivd only the worst cases out doors at the foot of a tree within ten yards of the front of the house i notice a heap of amputated feet legs arms hands c a full load for a onehorse cart several dead bodies lie near each coverd with its brown woolen blanket in the dooryard towards the river are fresh graves mostly of officers their names on pieces of arrelstaves or broken boards stuck in the dirt most of these bodies were subsequently taken up and transported north to their friends the large mansion is quite crowded upstairs and down everything impromptu no system all bad enough but i have no doubt the best that can be done all the wounds pretty bad some frightful the men in their old clothes unclean and bloody some of the wounded are rebel soldiers and officers prisoners one a mississippian a captain hit badly in leg i talkd with some time he askd me for papers which i gave him i saw him three months afterward in washington with his leg amputated doing well i went through the rooms downstairs and up some of the men were dying i had nothing to give at that visit but wrote a few letters to folks home mothers c also talkd to three or four who seemd most susceptible to it and needing it   after first fredericksburg  december 23 to 31the results of the late battle are exhibited everywhere about here in thousands of cases hundreds die every day in the camp brigade and division hospitals these are merely tents and sometimes very poor ones the wounded lying on the ground lucky if their blankets are spread on layers of pine or hemlock twigs or small leaves no cots seldom even a mattress it is pretty cold the ground is frozen hard and there is occasional snow i go around from one case to another i do not see that i do much good to these wounded and dying but i cannot leave them once in a while some youngster holds on to me convulsively and i do what i can for him at any rate stop with him and sit near him for hours if he wishes it  besides the hospitals i also go occasionally on long tours through the camps talking with the men c sometimes at night among the groups around the fires in their shebang enclosures of bushes these are curious shows full of characters and groups i soon get acquainted anywhere in camp with officers or men and am always well used sometimes i go down on picket with the regiments i know best as to rations the army here at present seems to be tolerably well supplied and the men have enough such as it is mainly salt pork and hard tack most of the regiments lodge in the flimsy little sheltertents a few have built themselves huts of logs and mud with fireplaces   back to washington  january 63left camp at falmouth with some wounded a few days since and came here by aquia creek railroad and so on government steamer up the potomac many wounded were with us on the cars and boat the cars were just common platform ones the railroad journey of ten or twelve miles was made mostly before sunrise the soldiers guarding the road came out from their tents or shebangs of bushes with rumpled hair and halfawake look those on duty were walking their posts some on banks over us others down far below the level of the track i saw large cavalry camps off the road at aquia creek landing were numbers of wounded going north while i waited some three hours i went around among them several wanted word sent home to parents brothers wives c which i did for them by mail the next day from washington on the boat i had my hands full one poor fellow died going up  i am now remaining in and around washington daily visiting the hospitals am much in patentoffice eighth street h street armorysquare and others am now able to do a little good having money as almoner of others home and getting experience today sunday afternoon and till nine in the evening visited campbell hospital attended specially to one case in ward i very sick with pleurisy and typhoid fever young man farmers son d f russell company e 60th new york downhearted and feeble a long time before he would take any interest wrote a letter home to his mother in malone franklin county n y at his request gave him some fruit and one or two other gifts envelopd and directed his letter c then went thoroughly through ward 6 observd every case in the ward without i think missing one gave perhaps from twenty to thirty persons each one some little gift such as oranges apples sweet crackers figs c  thursday jan 21devoted the main part of the day to armorysquare hospital went pretty thoroughly through wards f g h and i some fifty cases in each ward in ward f supplied the men throughout with writing paper and stampd envelope each distributed in small portions to proper subjects a large jar of firstrate preservd berries which had been donated to me by a ladyher own cooking found several cases i thought good subjects for small sums of money which i furnishd the wounded men often come up broke and it helps their spirits to have even the small sum i give them my paper and envelopes all gone but distributed a good lot of amusing reading matter also as i thought judicious tobacco oranges apples c interesting cases in ward i charles miller bed 19 company d 53d pennsylvania is only 16 years of age very bright courageous boy left leg amputated below the knee next bed to him another young lad very sick gave each appropriate gifts in the bed above also amputation of the left leg gave him a little jar of raspberries bed j this ward gave a small sum also to a soldier on crutches sitting on his bed near i am more and more surprised at the very great proportion of youngsters from fifteen to twentyone in the army i afterwards found a still greater proportion among the southerners  evening same day went to see d f r before alluded to found him remarkably changed for the better up and dressdquite a triumph he afterwards got well and went back to his regiment  distributed in the wards a quantity of notepaper and forty or fifty stampd envelopes of which i had recruited my stock and the men were much in need   fifty hours left wounded on the field  here is a case of a soldier i found among the crowded cots in the patentoffice he likes to have some one to talk to and we will listen to him he got badly hit in his leg and side at fredericksburgh that eventful saturday 13th of december he lay the succeeding two days and nights helpless on the field between the city and those grim terraces of batteries his company and regiment had been compelld to leave him to his fate to make matters worse it happend he lay with his head slightly down hill and could not help himself at the end of some fifty hours he was brought off with other wounded under a flag of truce i ask him how the rebels treated him as he lay during those two days and nights within reach of themwhether they came to himwhether they abused him he answers that several of the rebels soldiers and others came to him at one time and another a couple of them who were together spoke roughly and sarcastically but nothing worse one middleaged man however who seemd to be moving around the field among the dead and wounded for benevolent purposes came to him in a way he will never forget treated our soldier kindly bound up his wounds cheerd him gave him a couple of biscuits and a drink of whiskey and water asked him if he could eat some beef this good secesh however did not change our soldiers position for it might have caused the blood to burst from the wounds clotted and stagnated our soldier is from pennsylvania has had a pretty severe time the wounds proved to be bad ones but he retains a good heart and is at present on the gain it is not uncommon for the men to remain on the field this way one two or even four or five days   hospital scenes and persons  letter writingwhen eligible i encourage the men to write and myself when called upon write all sorts of letters for them including love letters very tender

painyet after it was well commenced the soldier bore it in silence he sat up proppdwas much wastedhad lain a long time quiet in one position not for days only but weeks a bloodless brownskinnd face

stick of horehound candy i gave him with one or two other trifles   patentoffice hospital  february 23i must not let the great hospital at the patentoffice pass away without some mention a few weeks ago the vast area of the second story of that noblest of washington buildings was crowded close with rows of sick badly wounded and dying soldiers they were placed in three very large apartments i went there many times it was a strange solemn and with all its features of suffering and death a sort of fascinating sight i go sometimes at night to soothe and relieve particular cases two of the immense apartments are filld with high and ponderous glass cases crowded with models in miniature of every kind of utensil machine or invention it ever enterd into the mind of man to conceive and with curiosities and foreign presents between these cases are lateral openings perhaps eight feet wide and quite deep and in these were placed the sick besides a great long double row of them up and down through the middle of the hall many of them were very bad cases wounds and amputations then there was a gallery running above the hall in which there were beds also it was indeed a curious scene especially at night when lit up the glass cases the beds the forms lying there the gallery above and the marble pavement under footthe suffering and the fortitude to bear it in various degreesoccasionally from some the groan that could not be repressdsometimes a poor fellow dying with emaciated face and glassy eye the nurse by his side the doctor also there but no friend no relativesuch were the sights but lately in the patentoffice the wounded have since been removed from there and it is now vacant again   the white house by moonlight  february 24tha spell of fine soft weather i wander about a good deal sometimes at night under the moon tonight took a long look at the presidents house the white porticothe palacelike tall round columns spotless as snowthe walls alsothe tender and soft moonlight flooding the pale marble and making peculiar faint languishing shades not shadowseverywhere a soft transparent hazy thin blue moonlace hanging in the airthe brilliant and extraplentiful clusters of gas on and around the facade columns portico ceverything so white so marbly pure and dazzling yet softthe white house of future poems and of dreams and dramas there in the soft and copious moonthe gorgeous front in the trees under the lustrous flooding moon full of realty full of illusionthe forms of the trees leafless silent in trunk and myriadangles of branches under the stars and skythe white house of the land and of beauty and nightsentries at the gates and by the portico silent pacing there in blue overcoatsstopping you not at all but eyeing you with sharp eyes whichever way you move   an army hospital ward  let me specialize a visit i made to the collection of barracklike onestory edifices campbell hospital out on the flats at the end of the then horse railway route on seventh street there is a long building appropriated to each ward let us go into ward 6 it contains today i should judge eighty or a hundred patients half sick half wounded the edifice is nothing but boards well whitewashd inside and the usual slenderframed iron bedsteads narrow and plain you walk down the central passage with a row on either side their feet towards you and their heads to the wall there are fires in large stoves and the prevailing white of the walls is relievd by some ornaments stars circles c made of evergreens the view of the whole edifice and occupants can be taken at once for there is no partition you may hear groans or other sounds of unendurable suffering from two or three of the cots but in the main there is quietalmost a painful absence of demonstration but the pallid face the dulld eye and the moisture of the lip are demonstration enough most of these sick or hurt are evidently young fellows from the country farmers sons and such like look at the fine large frames the bright and broad countenances and the many yet lingering proofs of strong constitution and physique look at the patient and mute manner of our american wounded as they lie in such a sad collection representatives from all new england and from new york and new jersey and pennsylvaniaindeed from all the states and all the citieslargely from the west most of them are entirely without friends or acquaintances hereno familiar face and hardly a word of judicious sympathy or cheer through their sometimes long and tedious sickness or the pangs of aggravated wounds   a connecticut case  this young man in bed 25 is h d b of the 27th connecticut company b his folks live at northford near new haven though not more than twentyone or thereabouts he has knockd much around the world on sea and land and has seen some fighting on both when i first saw him he was very sick with no appetite he declined offers of moneysaid he did not need anything as i was quite anxious to do something he confessd that he had a hankering for a good homemade rice puddingthought he could relish it better than anything at this time his stomach was very weak the doctor whom i consulted said nourishment would do him more good than anything but things in the hospital though better than usual revolted him i soon procured b his rice pudding a washington lady mrs oc hearing his wish made the pudding herself and i took it up to him the next day he subsequently told me he lived upon it for three or four days this b is a good sample of the american eastern young manthe typical yankee i took a fancy to him and gave him a nice pipe for a keepsake he receivd afterwards a box of things from home and nothing would do but i must take dinner with him which i did and a very good one it was   two brooklyn boys  here in this same ward are two young men from brooklyn members of the 51st new york i had known both the two as young lads at home so they seem near to me one of them j l lies there with an amputated arm the stump healing pretty well i saw him lying on the ground at fredericksburgh last december all bloody just after the arm was taken off he was very phlegmatic about it munching away at a cracker in the remaining handmade no fuss he will recover and thinks and talks yet of meeting johnny rebs   a secesh brave  the grand soldiers are not comprised in those of one side any more than the other here is a sample of an unknown southerner a lad of seventeen at the war department a few days ago i witnessd a presentation of captured flags to the secretary among others a soldier named gant of the 104th ohio volunteers presented a rebel battleflag which one of the officers stated to me was borne to the mouth of our cannon and planted there by a boy but seventeen years of age who actually endeavord to stop the muzzle of the gun with fencerails he was killd in the effort and the flagstaff was severd by a shot from one of our men   the wounded from chancellorsville  may 63as i write this the wounded have begun to arrive from hookers command from bloody chancellorsville i was down among the first arrivals the men in charge told me the bad cases were yet to come if that is so i pity them for these are bad enough you ought to see the scene of the wounded arriving at the landing here at the foot of sixth street at night two boat loads came about halfpast seven last night a little after eight it raind a long and violent shower the pale helpless soldiers had been debarkd and lay around on the wharf and neighborhood anywhere the rain was probably grateful to them at any rate they were exposed to it the few torches light up the spectacle all aroundon the wharf on the ground out on side placesthe men are lying on blankets old quilts c with bloody rags bound round heads arms and legs the attendants are few and at night few outsiders alsoonly a few hardworkd transportation men and drivers the wounded are getting to be common and people grow callous the men whatever their condition lie there and patiently wait till their turn comes to be taken up near by the ambulances are now arriving in clusters and one after another is calld to back up and take its load extreme cases are sent off on stretchers the men generally make little or no ado whatever their sufferings a few groans that cannot be suppressd and occasionally a scream of pain as they lift a man into the ambulance today as i write hundreds more are expected and tomorrow and the next day more and so on for many days quite often they arrive at the rate of 1000 a day   a night battle over a week since  may 12there was part of the late battle at chancellorsville second fredericksburgh a little over a week ago saturday saturday night and sunday under gen joe hooker i would like to give just a glimpse ofa moments look in a terrible storm at seaof which a few suggestions are enough and full details impossible the fighting had been very hot during the day and after an intermission the latter part was resumed at night and kept up with furious energy till 3 oclock in the morning that afternoon saturday an attack sudden and strong by stonewall jackson had gaind a great advantage to the southern army and broken our lines entering us like a wedge and leaving things in that position at dark but hooker at 11 at night made a desperate push drove the secesh forces back restored his original lines and resumed his plans this night scrimmage was very exciting and afforded countless strange and fearful pictures the fighting had been general both at chancellorsville and northeast at fredericksburgh we hear of some poor fighting episodes skedaddling on our part i think not of it i think of the fierce bravery the general rule one corps the 6th sedgewicks fights four dashing and bloody battles in thirtysix hours retreating in great jeopardy losing largely but maintaining itself fighting with the sternest desperation under all circumstances getting over the rappahannock only by the skin of its teeth yet getting over it lost many many brave men yet it took vengeance ample vengeance  but it was the tug of saturday evening and through the night and sunday morning i wanted to make a special note of it was largely in the woods and quite a general engagement the night was very pleasant at times the moon shining out full and clear all nature so calm in itself the early summer grass so rich and foliage of the treesyet there the battle raging and many good fellows lying helpless with new accessions to them and every minute amid the rattle of muskets and crash of cannon for there was an artillery contest too the red lifeblood oozing out from heads or trunks or limbs upon that green and dewcool grass patches of the woods take fire and several of the wounded unable to move are consumedquite large spaces are swept over burning the dead alsosome of the men have their hair and beards singedsome burns on their faces and handsothers

 my preparations for visits  in my visits to the hospitals i found it was in the simple matter of personal presence and emanating ordinary cheer and magnetism that i succeeded and helpd more than by medical nursing or delicacies or gifts of money or anything else during the war i possessd the perfection of physical health my habit when practicable was to prepare for starting out on one of those daily or nightly tours of from a couple to four or five hours by fortifying myself with previous rest the bath clean clothes a good meal and as cheerful an appearance as possible   ambulance processions  june 23 sundownas i sit writing this paragraph i see a train of about thirty huge fourhorse wagons used as ambulances filld with wounded passing up fourteenth street on their way probably to columbian carver and mount pleasant hospitals this is the way the men come in now seldom in small numbers but almost always in these long sad processions through the past winter while our army lay opposite fredericksburg the like strings of ambulances were of frequent occurrence along seventh street passing slowly up from the steamboat wharf with loads from aquia creek   bad woundsthe young  the soldiers are nearly all young men and far more american than is generally supposedi should say ninetenths are nativeborn among the arrivals from chancellorsville i find a large proportion of ohio indiana and illinois men as usual there are all sorts of wounds some of the men fearfully burnt from the explosions of artillery caissons one ward has a long row of officers some with ugly hurts yesterday was perhaps worse than usual amputations are going onthe attendants are dressing wounds as you pass by you must be on your guard where you look i saw the other day a gentlemen a visitor apparently from curiosity in one of the wards stop and turn a moment to look at an awful wound they were probing he turnd pale and in a moment more he had fainted away and fallen to the floor   the most inspiriting of all wars shows  june 29just before sundown this evening a very large cavalry force went bya fine sight the men evidently had seen service first came a mounted band of sixteen bugles drums and cymbals playing wild martial tunesmade my heart jump then the principal officers then company after company with their officers at their heads making of course the main part of the cavalcade then a long train of men with led horses lots of mounted negroes with special horsesand a long string of baggagewagons each drawn by four horsesand then a motley rear guard  it was a pronouncedly warlike and gay show the sabres clankd the men lookd young and healthy and strong the electric tramping of so many horses on the hard road and the gallant bearing fine seat and bright faced appearance of a thousand and more handsome young american men were so good to see an hour later another troop went by smaller in numbers perhaps three hundred men they too lookd like serviceable men campaigners used to field and fight  july 3this forenoon for more than an hour again long strings of cavalry several regiments very fine men and horses four or five abreast i saw them in fourteenth street coming in town from north several hundred extra horses some of the mares with colts trotting along appeard to be a number of prisoners too how inspiriting always the cavalry regiments our men are generally well mounted feel good are young gay on the saddle their blankets in a roll behind them their sabres clanking at their sides this noise and movement and the tramp of many horses hoofs has a curious effect upon one the bugles playpresently you hear them afar off deadend mixd with other noises then just as they had all passd a string of ambulances commencd from the other way moving up fourteenth street north slowly wending along bearing a large lot of wounded to the hospitals   battle of gettysburg  july 4ththe weather today upon the whole is very fine warm but from a smart rain last night fresh enough and no dust which is a great relief for this city i saw the parade about noon pennsylvania avenue from fifteenth street down toward the capitol there were three regiments of infantry i suppose the ones doing patrol duty here two or three societies of odd fellows a lot of children in barouches and a squad of policemen a useless imposition upon the soldiersthey have work enough on their backs without piling the like of this  as i went down the avenue saw a big flaring placard on the bulletin board of a newspaper office announcing glorious victory for the union army meade had fought lee at gettysburg pennsylvania yesterday and day before and repulsd him most signally taken 3000 prisoners c i afterwards saw meades despatch very modest and a sort of order of the day from the president himself quite religious giving thanks to the supreme and calling on the people to do the same  i walkd on to armory hospitaltook along with me several bottles of blackberry and cherry syrup good and strong but innocent went through several of the wards announcd to the soldiers the news from meade and gave them all a good drink of the syrups with ice water quite refreshingprepard it all myself and servd it around meanwhile the washington bells are ringing their sundown peals for fourth of july and the usual fusilades of boys pistols crackers and guns   a cavalry camp  i am writing this nearly sundown watching a cavalry company acting signal service just come in through a shower making their nights camp ready on some broad vacant ground a sort of hill in full view opposite my window there are the men in their yellowstriped jackets all are dismounted the freed horses stand with drooping heads and wet sides they are to be led off presently in groups to water the little walltents and shelter tents spring up quickly i see the fires already blazing and pots and kettles over them some among the men are driving in tentpoles wielding their axes with strong slow blows i see great huddles of horses bundles of hay groups of men some with unbuckled sabres yet on their sides a few officers piles of wood the flames of the fires saddles harness c the smoke streams upward additional men arrive and dismountsome drive in stakes and tie their horses to them some go with buckets for water some are chopping wood and so on  july 6tha steady rain dark and thick and warm a train of sixmule wagons has just passd bearing pontoons great squareend flatboats and the heavy planking for overlaying them we hear that the potomac above here is flooded and are wondering whether lee will be able to get back across again or whether meade will indeed break him to pieces the cavalry camp on the hill is a ceaseless field of observation for me this forenoon there stand the horses tetherd together dripping steaming chewing their hay the men emerge from their tents dripping also the fires are half quenchd  july 10thstill the camp oppositeperhaps fifty or sixty tents some of the men are cleaning their sabres pleasant today some brushing boots some laying off reading writingsome cooking some sleeping on long temporary crosssticks back of the tents are cavalry accoutrementsblankets and overcoats are hung out to airthere are the squads of horses tetherd feeding continually stamping and whisking their tails to keep off flies i sit long in my third story window and look at the scenea hundred little things going onpeculiar objects connected with the camp that could not be described any one of them justly without much minute drawing and coloring in words   a new york soldier  this afternoon july 22d i have spent a long time with oscar f wilber company g 154th new york low with chronic diarrhoea and a bad wound also he asked me to read him a chapter in the new testament i complied and askd him what i should read he said make your own choice i opend at the close of one of the first books of the evangelists and read the chapters describing the latter hours of christ and the scenes at the crucifixion the poor wasted young man askd me to read the following chapter also how christ rose again i read very slowly for oscar was feeble it pleased him very much yet the tears were in his eyes he askd me if i enjoyd religion i said perhaps not my dear in the way you mean and yet maybe it is the same thing he said it is my chief reliance he talkd of death and said he did not fear it i said why oscar dont you think you will get well he said i may but it is not probable he spoke calmly of his condition the wound was very bad it dischargd much then the diarrhoea had prostrated him and i felt that he was even then the same as dying he behaved very manly and affectionate the kiss i gave him as i was about leaving he returnd fourfold he gave me his mothers address mrs sally d wilber alleghany pestoffice cattaraugus county n y i had several such interviews with him he died a few days after the one just described   homemade music  august 8thtonight as i was trying to keep cool sitting by a wounded soldier in armorysquare i was attracted by some pleasant singing in an adjoining ward as my soldier was asleep i left him and entering the ward where the music was i walkd halfway down and took a seat by the cot of a young brooklyn friend s r badly wounded in the hand at chancellorsville and who has sufferd much but at that moment in the evening was wide awake and comparatively easy he had turnd over on his left side to get a better view of the singers but the mosquitocurtains of the adjoining cots obstructed the sight i stept round and loopd them all up so that he had a clear show and then sat down again by him and lookd and listend the principal singer was a young ladynurse of one of the wards accompanying on a melodeon and joind by the ladynurses of other wards they sat there making a charming group with their handsome healthy faces and standing up a little behind them were some ten or fifteen of the convalescent soldiers young men nurses c with books in their hands singing of course it was not such a performance as the great soloists at the new york opera house take a hand in yet i am not sure but i receivd as much pleasure under the circumstances sitting there as i have had from the best italian compositions expressd by worldfamous performers the men lying up and down the hospital in their cots some badly woundedsome never to rise thence the cots themselves with their drapery of white curtains and the shadows down the lower and upper parts of the ward then the silence of the men and the attitudes they tookthe whole was a sight to look around upon again and again and there sweetly rose those voices up to the high whitewashd wooden roof and pleasantly the roof sent it all back again they sang very well mostly quaint old songs and declamatory hymns to fitting tunes here for instance      my days are swiftly gliding by and i a pilgrim stranger     would not detain them as they fly those hours of toil and danger     for o we stand on jordans strand our friends are passing over     and just before the shining shore we may almost discover     well gird our loins my brethren dear our distant home discerning     our absent lord has left us word let every lamp be burning     for o we stand on jordans strand our friends are passing over     and just before the shining shore we may almost discover   abraham lincoln  august 12thi see the president almost every day as i happen to live where he passes to or from his lodgings out of town he never sleeps at the white house during the hot season but has quarters at a healthy location some three miles north of the city the soldiers home a united states military establishment i saw him this morning about 8 12 coming in to business riding on vermont avenue near l street he always has a company of twentyfive or thirty cavalry with sabres drawn and held upright over their shoulders they say this guard was against his personal wish but he let his counselors have their way the party makes no great show in uniform or horses mr lincoln on the saddle generally rides a goodsized easygoing gray horse is dressd in plain black somewhat rusty and dusty wears a black stiff hat and looks about as ordinary in attire c as the commonest man a lieutenant with yellow straps rides at his left and following behind two by two come the cavalry men in their yellowstriped jackets they are generally going at a slow trot as that is the pace set them by the one they wait upon the sabres and accoutrements clank and the entirely unornamental cortege as it trots towards lafayette square arouses no sensation only some curious stranger stops and gazes i see very plainly abraham lincolns dark brown face with the deepcut lines the eyes always to me with a deep latent sadness in the expression we have got so that we exchange bows and very cordial ones sometimes the president goes and comes in an open barouche the cavalry always accompany him with drawn sabres often i notice as he goes out eveningsand sometimes in the morning when he returns earlyhe turns off and halts at the large and handsome residence of the secretary of war on k street and holds conference there if in his barouche i can see from my window he does not alight but sits in his vehicle and mr stanton comes out to attend him sometimes one of his sons a boy of ten or twelve accompanies him riding at his right on a pony earlier in the summer i occasionally saw the president and his wife toward the latter part of the afternoon out in a barouche on a pleasure ride through the city mrs lincoln was dressd in complete black with a long crape veil the equipage is of the plainest kind only two horses and they nothing extra they passd me once very close and i saw the president in the face fully as they were moving slowly and his look though abstracted happend to be directed steadily in my eye he bowd and smiled but far beneath his smile i noticed well the expression i have alluded to none of the artists or pictures has caught the deep though subtle and indirect expression of this mans face there is something else there one of the great portrait painters of two or three centuries ago is needed   heated term  there has lately been much suffering here from heat we have had it upon us now eleven days i go around with an umbrella and a fan i saw two cases of sunstroke yesterday one in pennsylvania avenue and another in seventh street the city railroad company loses some horses every day yet washington is having a livelier august and is probably putting in a more energetic and satisfactory summer than ever before during its existence there is probably more human electricity more population to make it more business more lightheartedness than ever before the armies that swiftly circumambiated from fredericksburghmarchd struggled fought had out their mighty clinch and hurl at gettysburgwheeld circumambiated again returnd to their ways touching us not either at their going or coming and washington feels that she has passd the worst perhaps feels that she is henceforth mistress so here she sits with her surrounding hills spotted with guns and is conscious of a character and identity different from what it was five or six short weeks ago and very considerably pleasanter and prouder   soldiers and talks  soldiers soldiers soldiers you meet everywhere about the city often superblooking men though invalids dressd in worn uniforms and carrying canes or crutches i often have talks with them occasionally quite long and interesting one for instance will have been all through the peninsula under mcclellannarrates to me the fights the marches the strange quick changes of that eventful campaign and gives glimpses of many things untold in any official reports or books or journals these indeed are the things that are genuine and precious the man was there has been out two years has been through a dozen fights the superfluous flesh of talking is long workd off him and he gives me little but the hard meat and sinew i find it refreshing these hardy bright intuitive american young men experiencd soldiers with all their youth the vocal play and significance moves one more than books then there hangs something majestic about a man who has borne his part in battles especially if he is very quiet regarding it when you desire him to unbosom i am continually lost at the absence of blowing and blowers among these oldyoung american militaires i have found some man or other who has been in every battle since the war began and have talkd with them about each one in every part of the united states and many of the engagements on the rivers and harbors too i find men here from every state in the union without exception there are more southerners especially border state men in the union army than is generally supposed a i now doubt whether one can get a fair idea of what this war practically is or what genuine america is and her character without some such experience as this i am having   death of a wisconsin officer  another characteristic scene of that dark and bloody 1863 from notes of my visit to armorysquare hospital one hot but pleasant summer day in ward h we approach the cot of a young lieutenant of one of the wisconsin regiments tread the bare board floor lightly here for the pain and panting of death are in this cot i saw the lieutenant when he was first brought here from chancellorsville and have been with him occasionally from day to day and night to night he had been getting along pretty well till night before last when a sudden hemorrhage that could not be stopt came upon him and today it still continues at intervals notice that waterpail by the side of the bed with a quantity of blood and bloody pieces of muslin nearly full that tells the story the poor young man is struggling painfully for breath his great dark eyes with a glaze already upon them and the choking faint but audible in his throat an attendant sits by him and will not leave him till the last yet little or nothing can be done he will die here in an hour or two without the presence of kith or kin meantime the ordinary chat and business of6 the ward a little way off goes on indifferently some of the inmates are laughing and joking others are playing checkers or cards others are reading c  i have noticed through most of the hospitals that as long as there is any chance for a man no matter how bad he may be the surgeon and nurses work hard sometimes with curious tenacity for his life doing everything and keeping somebody by him to execute the doctors orders and minister to him every minute night and day see that screen there as you advance through the dusk of early candlelight a nurse will step forth on tiptoe and silently but imperiously forbid you to make any noise or perhaps to come near at all some soldiers life is flickering there suspended between recovery and death perhaps at this moment the exhausted frame has just fallen into a light sleep that a step might shake you must retire the neighboring patients must move in their stocking feet i have been several times struck with such markd effortseverything bent to save a life from the very grip of the destroyer but when that grip is once firmly fixd leaving no hope or chance at all the surgeon abandons the patient if it is a case where stimulus is any relief the nurse gives milkpunch or brandy or whatever is wanted ad libitum there is no fuss made not a bit of sentimentalism or whining have i seen about a single deathbed in hospital or on the field but generally impassive indifference all is over as far as any efforts can avail it is useless to expend emotions or labors while there is a prospect they strive hardat least most surgeons do but death certain and evident they yield the field   note  6mr garfield in the house of representatives april 1579 do gentlemen know that leaving out all the border states there were fifty regiments and seven companies of white men in our army fighting for the union from the states that went into rebellion do they know that from the single state of kentucky more union soldiers fought under our flag than napoleon took into the battle of waterloo more than wellington took with all the allied armies against napoleon do they remember that 186000 colord men fought under our flag against the rebellion and for the union and that of that number 90000 were from the states which went into rebellion   hospitals ensemble  aug sept and oct 63i am in the habit of going to all and to fairfax seminary alexandria and over long bridge to the great convalescent camp the journals publish a regular directory of them a long list as a specimen of almost any one of the larger of these hospitals fancy to yourself a space of three to twenty acres of ground on which are groupd ten or twelve very large wooden barracks with perhaps a dozen or twenty and sometimes more than that number small buildings capable altogether of accommodating from five hundred to a thousand or fifteen hundred persons sometimes these wooden barracks or wards each of them perhaps from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet long are rangd in a straight row evenly fronting the street others are plannd so as to form an immense v and others again are ranged around a hollow square they make altogether a huge cluster with the additional tents extra wards for contagious diseases guardhouses sutlers stores chaplains house in the middle will probably be an edifice devoted to the offices of the surgeon in charge and the ward surgeons principal attaches clerks c the wards are either letterd alphabetically ward g ward k or else numerically 1 2 3 c each has its ward surgeon and corps of nurses of course there is in the aggregate quite a muster of employes and over all the surgeon in charge here in washington when these army hospitals are all filld as they have been already several times they contain a population more numerous in itself than the whole of the washington of ten or fifteen years ago within sight of the capitol as i write are some thirty or forty such collections at times holding from fifty to seventy thousand men looking from any eminence and studying the topography in my rambles i use them as landmarks through the rich august verdure of the trees see that white group of buildings off yonder in the outskirts then another cluster half a mile to the left of the first then another a mile to the right and another a mile beyond and still another between us and the first indeed we can hardly look in any direction but these clusters are dotting the landscape and environs that little town as you might suppose it off there on the brow of a hill is indeed a town but of wounds sickness and death it is finley hospital northeast of the city on kendall green as it used to be calld that other is campbell hospital both are large establishments i have known these two alone to have from two thousand to twentyfive hundred inmates then there is carver hospital larger still a walld and military city regularly laid out and guarded by squads of sentries again off east lincoln hospital a still larger one and half a mile further emory hospital still sweeping the eye around down the river toward alexandria we see to the right the locality where the convalescent camp stands with its five eight or sometimes ten thousand inmates even all these are but a portion the harewood mount pleasant armorysquare judiciary hospitals are some of the rest and all large collections   a silent night ramble  october 20thtonight after leaving the hospital at 10 oclock i had been on selfimposed duty some five hours pretty closely confined i wanderd a long time around washington the night was sweet very clear sufficiently cool a voluptuous halfmoon slightly golden the space near it of a transparent bluegray tinge i walkd up pennsylvania avenue and then to seventh street and a long while around the patentoffice somehow it lookd rebukefully strong majestic there in the delicate moonlight the sky the planets the constellations all so bright so calm so expressively silent so soothing after those hospital scenes i wanderd to and fro till the moist moon set long after midnight   spiritual characters among the soldiers  every now and then in hospital or camp there are beings i meetspecimens of unworldliness disinterestedness and animal purity and heroismperhaps some unconscious indianian or from ohio or tennesseeon whose birth the calmness of heaven seems to have descended and whose gradual growing up whatever the circumstances of worklife or change or hardship or small or no education that attended it the power of a strange spiritual sweetness fibre and inward health have also attended something veild and abstracted is often a part of the manners of these beings i have met them i say not seldom in the army in camp and in the hospitals the western regiments contain many of them they are often young men obeying the events and occasions about them marching soldiering righting foraging cooking working on farms or at some trade before the warunaware of their own nature as to that who is aware of his own nature their companions only understanding that they are different from the rest more silent something odd about them and apt to go off and meditate and muse in solitude   cattle droves about washington  among other sights are immense droves of cattle with their drivers passing through the streets of the city some of the men have a way of leading the cattle by a peculiar call a wild pensive hoot quite musical prolongd indescribable sounding something between the cooing of a pigeon and the hoot of an owl i like to stand and look at the sight of one of these immense drovesa little way offas the dust is great there are always men on horseback cracking their whips and shoutingthe cattle lowsome obstinate ox or steer attempts to escapethen a lively scenethe mounted men always excellent riders and on good horses dash after the recusant and wheel and turna dozen mounted drovers their great slouchd broadbrimd hats very picturesqueanother dozen on footeverybody coverd with dustlong goads in their handsan immense drove of perhaps 1000 cattlethe shouting hooting movement c   hospital perplexity  to add to other troubles amid the confusion of this great army of sick it is almost impossible for a stranger to find any friend or relative unless he has the patients specific address to start upon besides the directory printed in the newspapers here there are one or two general directories of the hospitals kept at provosts headquarters but they are nothing like complete they are never up to date and as things are with the daily streams of coming and going and changing cannot be i have known cases for instance such as a farmer coming here from northern new york to find a wounded brother faithfully hunting round for a week and then compelld to leave and go home without getting any trace of him when he got home he found a letter from the brother giving the right address   down at the front  culpepper va feb 64here i am front pretty well down toward the extreme front three or four days ago general s who is now in chief command i believe meade is absent sick moved a strong force southward from camp as if intending business they went to the rapidan there has since been some manoeuvering and a little fighting but nothing of consequence the telegraphic accounts given monday morning last make entirely too much of it i should say what general s intended we here know not but we trust in that competent commander we were somewhat excited but not so very much either on sunday during the day and night as orders were sent out to pack up and harness and be ready to evacuate to fall back towards washington but i was very sleepy and went to bed some tremendous shouts arousing me during the night i went forth and found it was from the men above mentiond who were returning i talkd with some of the men as usual i found them full of gayety endurance and many fine little outshows the signs of the most excellent good manliness of the world it was a curious sight to see those shadowy columns moving through the night i stood unobservd in the darkness and watchd them long the mud was very deep the men had their usual burdens overcoats knapsacks guns and blankets along and along they filed by me with often a laugh a song a cheerful word but never once a murmur it may have been odd but i never before so realized the majesty and reality of the american people en masse it fell upon me like a great awe the strong ranks moved neither fast nor slow they had marchd seven or eight miles already through the slipping unctuous mud the brave first corps stopt here the equally brave third corps moved on to brandy station the famous brooklyn 14th are here guarding the town you see their red legs actively moving everywhere then they have a theatre of their own here they give musical performances nearly everything done capitally of course the audience is a jam it is good sport to attend one of these entertainments of the 14th i like to look around at the soldiers and the general collection in front of the curtain more than the scene on the stage   paying the bounties  one of the things to note here now is the arrival of the paymaster with his strong box and the payment of bounties to veterans reenlisting major h is here today with a small mountain of greenbacks rejoicing the hearts of the 2d division of the first corps in the midst of a rickety shanty behind a little table sit the major and clerk eldridge with the rolls before them and much moneys a reenlisted man gets in cash about 200 down and heavy instalments following as the paydays arrive one after another the show of the men crowding around is quite exhilarating i like to stand and look they feel elated their pockets full and the ensuing furlough the visit home it is a scene of sparkling eyes and flushd cheeks the soldier has many gloomy and harsh experiences and this makes up for some of them major h is orderd to pay first all the reenlisted men of the first corps their bounties and back pay and then the rest you hear the peculiar sound of the rustling of the new and crisp greenbacks by the hour through the nimble fingers of the major and my friend clerk e   rumors changes etc  about the excitement of sunday and the orders to be ready to start i have heard since that the said orders came from some cautious minor commander and that the high principalities knew not and thought not of any such move which is likely the rumor and fear here intimated a long circuit by lee and flank attack on our right but i cast my eyes at the mud which was then at its deepest and palmiest condition and retired composedly to rest still it is about time for culpepper to have a change authorities have chased each other here like clouds in a stormy sky before the first bull run this was the rendezvous and camp of instruction of the secession troops i am stopping at the house of a lady who has witnessd all the eventful changes of the war along this route of contending armies she is a widow with a family of young children and lives here with her sister in a large handsome house a number of army officers board with them   virginia  dilapidated fenceless and trodden with war as virginia is wherever i move across her surface i find myself rousd to surprise and admiration what capacity for products improvements human life nourishment and expansion everywhere that i have been in the old dominion the subtle mockery of that title now such thoughts have filld me the soil is yet far above the average of any of the northern states and how full of breadth the scenery everywhere distant mountains everywhere convenient rivers even yet prodigal in forest woods and surely eligible for all the fruits orchards and flowers the skies and atmosphere most luscious as i feel certain from more than a years residence in the state and movements hither and yon i should say very healthy as a general thing then a rich and elastic quality by night and by day the sun rejoices in his strength dazzling and burning and yet to me never unpleasantly weakening it is not the panting tropical heat but invigorates the north tempers it the nights are often unsurpassable last evening feb 8 i saw the first of the new moon the outlined old moon clear along with it the sky and air so clear such transparent hues of color it seemd to me i had never really seen the new moon before it was the thinnest cut crescent possible it hung delicate just above the sulky shadow of the blue mountains ah if it might prove an omen and good prophecy for this unhappy state   summer of 1864  i am back again in washington on my regular daily and nightly rounds of course there are many specialties dotting a ward here and there are always cases of poor fellows longsuffering under obstinate wounds or weak and disheartend from typhoid fever or the like markd cases needing special and sympathetic nourishment these i sit down and either talk to or silently cheer them up they always like it hugely and so do i each case has its peculiarities and needs some new adaptation i have learnt to thus conformlearnt a good deal of hospital wisdom some of the poor young chaps away from home for the first time in their lives hunger and thirst for affection this is sometimes the only thing that will reach their condition the men like to have a pencil and something to write in i have given them cheap pocketdiaries and almanacs for 1864 interleavd with blank paper for reading i generally have some old pictorial magazines or story papersthey are always acceptable also the morning or evening papers of the day the best books i do not give but lend to read through the wards and then take them to others and so on they are very punctual about returning the books in these wards or on the field as i thus continue to go round i have come to adapt myself to each emergency after its kind or call however trivial however solemn every one justified and made real under its circumstances not only visits and cheering talk and little giftsnot only washing and dressing wounds i have some cases where the patient is unwilling any one should do this but mebut passages from the bible expounding them prayer at the bedside explanations of doctrine c i think i see my friends smiling at this confession but i was never more in earnest in my life in camp and everywhere i was in the habit of reading or giving recitations to the men they were very fond of it and liked declamatory poetical pieces we would gather in a large group by ourselves after supper and spend the time in such readings or in talking and occasionally by an amusing game called the game of twenty questions   a new army organization fit for america  it is plain to me out of the events of the war north and south and out of all considerations that the current military theory practice rules and organization adopted from europe from the feudal institutes with of course the modern improvements largely from the french though tacitly followd and believd in by the officers generally are not at all consonant with the united states nor our people nor our days what it will be i know notbut i know that as entire an abnegation of the present military system and the naval too and a building up from radically different rootbases and centres appropriate to us must eventually result as that our political system has resulted and become establishd different from feudal europe and built up on itself from original perennial democratic premises we have undoubtedly in the united states the greatest military poweran exhaustless intelligent brave and reliable rank and filein the world any land perhaps all lands the problem is to organize this in the manner fully appropriate to it to the principles of the republic and to get the best service out of it in the present struggle as already seen and reviewd probably threefourths of the losses men lives c have been sheer superfluity extravagance waste   death of a hero  i wonder if i could ever convey to anotherto you for instance reader dearthe tender and terrible realities of such cases many many happend as the one i am now going to mention stewart c glover company e 5th wisconsinwas wounded may 5 in one of those fierce tussles of the wildernessdied may 21aged about 20 he was a small and beardless young mana splendid soldierin fact almost an ideal american of his age he had servd nearly three years and would have been entitled to his discharge in a few days he was in hancocks corps the fighting had about ceasd for the day and the general commanding the brigade rode by and calld for volunteers to bring in the wounded glover responded among the firstwent out gaylybut while in the act of bearing in a wounded sergeant to our lines was shot in the knee by a rebel sharpshooter consequence amputation and death he had resided with his father john glover an aged and feeble man in batavia genesee county n y but was at school in wisconsin after the war broke out and there enlistedsoon took to soldierlife liked it was very manly was belovd by officers and comrades he kept a little diary like so many of the soldiers on the day of his death he wrote the following in it today the doctor says i must dieall is over with meah so young to die on another blank leaf he pencilld to his brother dear brother thomas i have been brave but wickedpray for me   hospital scenesincidents  it is sunday afternoon middle of summer hot and oppressive and very silent through the ward i am taking care of a critical case now lying in a half lethargy near where i sit is a suffering rebel from the 8th louisiana his name is irving he has been here a long time badly wounded and lately had his leg amputated it is not doing very well right opposite me is a sick soldierboy laid down with his clothes on sleeping looking much wasted his pallid face on his arm i see by the yellow trimming on his jacket that he is a cavalry boy i step softly over and find by his card that he is named william cone of the 1st maine cavalry and his folks live in skowhegan  ice cream treatone hot day toward the middle of june i gave the inmates of carver hospital a general ice cream treat purchasing a large quantity and under convoy of the doctor or head nurse going around personally through the wards to see to its distribution an incidentin one of the rights before atlanta a rebel soldier of large size evidently a young man was mortally wounded top of the head so that the brains partially exuded he lived three days lying on his back on the spot where he first dropt he dug with his heel in the ground during that time a hole big enough to put in a couple of ordinary knapsacks he just lay there in the open air and with little intermission kept his heel going night and day some of our soldiers then moved him to a house but he died in a few minutes  anotherafter the battles at columbia tennessee where we repulsd about a score of vehement rebel charges they left a great many wounded on the ground mostly within our range whenever any of these wounded attempted to move away by any means generally by crawling off our men without exception brought them down by a bullet they let none crawl away no matter what his condition   a yankee soldier  as i turnd off the avenue one cool october evening into thirteenth street a soldier with knapsack and overcoat stood at the corner inquiring his way i found he wanted to go part of the road in my direction so we walkd on together we soon fell into conversation he was small and not very young and a tough little fellow as i judged in the evening light catching glimpses by the lamps we passd his answers were short but clear his name was charles carroll he belongd to one of the massachusetts regiments and was born in or near lynn his parents were living but were very old there were four sons and all had enlisted two had died of starvation and misery in the prison at andersonville and one had been killd in the west he only was left he was now going home and by the way he talkd i inferrd that his time was nearly out he made great calculations on being with his parents to comfort them the rest of their days   union prisoners south  michael stansbury 48 years of age a seafaring man a southerner by birth and raising formerly captain of u s light ship long shoal stationd at long shoal point pamlico soundthough a southerner a firm union manwas capturd feb 17 1863 and has been nearly two years in the confederate prisons was at one time orderd releasd by governor vance but a rebel officer rearrested him then sent on to richmond for exchangebut instead of being exchanged was sent down as a southern citizen not a soldier to salisbury n c where he remaind until lately when he escapd among the exchangd by assuming the name of a dead soldier and coming up via wilmington with the rest was about sixteen months in salisbury  subsequent to october 64 there were about 11000 union prisoners in the stockade about 100 of them southern unionists 200 u s deserters during the past winter 1500 of the prisoners to save their lives joind the confederacy on condition of being assignd merely to guard duty out of the 11000 not more than 2500 came out 500 of these were pitiable helpless wretchesthe rest were in a condition to travel there were often 60 dead bodies to be buried in the morning the daily average would be about 40 the regular food was a meal of corn the cob and husk ground together and sometimes once a week a ration of sorghum molasses a diminutive ration of meat might possibly come once a month not oftener in the stockade containing the 11000 men there was a partial show of tents not enough for 2000 a large proportion of the men lived in holes in the ground in the utmost wretchedness some froze to death others had their hands and feet frozen the rebel guards would occasionally and on the least pretence fire into the prison from mere demonism and wantonness all the horrors that can be named starvation lassitude filth vermin despair swift loss of selfrespect idiocy insanity and frequent murder were there stansbury has a wife and child living in newbernhas written to them from hereis in the u s lighthouse employ stillhad been home to newbern to

thinking on their conditionhope all gone has himself a hard sad strangely deadend kind of look as of one chill d for years in the cold and dark where his good manly nature had no room to exercise itself   deserters  oct 24saw a large squad of our own deserters over 300 surrounded with a cordon of armd guards marching along pennsylvania avenue the most motley collection i ever saw all sorts of rig all sorts of hats and caps many finelooking young fellows some of them shamefaced some sickly most of them dirty shirts very dirty and long worn c they trampd along without order a huge huddling mass not in ranks i saw some of the spectators laughing but i felt like anything else but laughing these deserters are far more numerous than would be thought almost every day i see squads of them sometimes two or three at a time with a small guard sometimes ten or twelve under a larger one i hear that desertions from the army now in the field have often averaged 10000 a month one of the commonest sights in washington is a squad of deserters   a glimpse of wars hellscenes  in one of the late movements of our troops in the valley near upperville i think a strong force of mosebys mounted guerillas attackd a train of wounded and the guard of cavalry convoying them the ambulances containd about 60 wounded quite a number of them officers of rank the rebels were in strength and the capture of the train and its partial guard after a short snap was effectually accomplishd no sooner had our men surrenderd the rebels instantly commenced robbing the train and murdering their prisoners even the wounded here is the scene or a sample of it ten minutes after among the wounded officers in the ambulances were one a lieutenant of regulars and another of higher rank these two were draggd out on the ground on their backs and were now surrounded by the guerillas a demoniac crowd each member of which was stabbing them in different parts of their bodies one of the officers had his feet pinnd firmly to the ground by bayonets stuck through them and thrust into the ground these two officers as afterwards found on examination had receivd about twenty such thrusts some of them through the mouth face c the wounded had all been draggd to give a better chance also for plunder out of their wagons some had been effectually dispatchd and their bodies were lying there lifeless and bloody others not yet dead but horribly mutilated were moaning or groaning of our men who surrenderd most had been thus maimd or slaughterd  at this instant a force of our cavalry who had been following the train at some interval charged suddenly upon the secesh captors who proceeded at once to make the best escape they could most of them got away but we gobbled two officers and seventeen men in the very acts just described the sight was one which admitted of little discussion as may be imagined the seventeen capturd men and two officers were put under guard for the night but it was decided there and then that they should die the next morning the two officers were taken in the town separate places put in the centre of the street and shot the seventeen men were taken to an open ground a little one side they were placed in a hollow square halfencompassd by two of our cavalry regiments one of which regiments had three days before found the bloody corpses of three of their men hamstrung and hung up by the heels to limbs of trees by mosebys guerillas and the other had not long before had twelve men after surrendering shot and then hung by the neck to limbs of trees and jeering inscriptions pinnd to the breast of one of the corpses who had been a sergeant those three and those twelve had been found i say by these environing regiments now with revolvers they formd the grim cordon of the seventeen prisoners the latter were placed in the midst of the hollow square unfastend and the ironical remark made to them that they were now to be given a chance for themselves a few ran for it but what use from every side the deadly pills came in a few minutes the seventeen corpses strewd the hollow square i was curious to know whether some of the union soldiers some few some one or two at least of the youngsters did not abstain from shooting on the helpless men not one there was no exultation very little said almost nothing yet every man there contributed his shot  multiply the above by scores aye hundredsverify it in all the forms that different circumstances individuals places could affordlight it with every lurid passion the wolfs the lions lapping thirst for bloodthe passionate boiling volcanoes of human revenge for comrades brothers slainwith the light of burning farms and heaps of smutting smouldering black embersand in the human heart everywhere black worse embersand you have an inkling of this war   giftsmoneydiscrimination  as a very large proportion of the wounded came up from the front without a cent of money in their pockets i soon discoverd that it was about the best thing i could do to raise their spirits and show them that somebody cared for them and practically felt a fatherly or brotherly interest in them to give them small sums in such cases using tact and discretion about it i am regularly supplied with funds for this purpose by good women and men in boston salem providence brooklyn and new york i provide myself with a quantity of bright new tencent and fivecent bills and when i think it incumbent i give 25 or 30 cents or perhaps 50 cents and occasionally a still larger sum to some particular case as i have started this subject i take opportunity to ventilate the financial question my supplies altogether voluntary mostly confidential often seeming quite providential were numerous and varied for instance there were two distant and wealthy ladies sisters who sent regularly for two years quite heavy sums enjoining that their names should be kept secret the same delicacy was indeed a frequent condition from several i had carte blanche many were entire strangers from these sources during from two to three years in the manner described in the hospitals i bestowed as almoner for others many many thousands of dollars i learnd one thing conclusivelythat beneath all the ostensible greed and heartlessness of our times there is no end to the generous benevolence of men and women in the united states when once sure of their object another thing became clear to mewhile cash is not amiss to bring up the rear tact and magnetic sympathy and unction are and ever will be sovereign still   items from my note

bull run  well poor john mahay is dead he died yesterday his was a painful and longlingering case see p 24 ante i have been with him at times for the past fifteen months he belonged to company a 101st new york and was shot through the lower region of the abdomen at second bull run august 62 one scene at his bedside will suffice for the agonies of nearly two years the bladder had been perforated by a bullet going entirely through him not long since i sat a good part of the morning by his bedside ward e armory square the water ran out of his eyes from the intense pain and the muscles of his face were distorted but he utterd nothing except a low groan now and then hot moist cloths were applied and relievd him somewhat poor mahay a mere boy in age but old in misfortune he never knew the love of parents was placed in infancy in one of the new york charitable institutions and subsequently bound out to a tyrannical master in sullivan county the scars of whose cowhide and club remaind yet on his back his wound here was a most disagreeable one for he was a gentle cleanly and affectionate boy he found friends in his hospital life and indeed was a universal favorite he had quite a funeral ceremony   army surgeonsaid deficiencies  i must bear my most emphatic testimony to the zeal manliness and professional spirit and capacity generally prevailing among the surgeons many of them young men in the hospitals and the army i will not say much about the exceptions for they are few but i have met some of those few and very incompetent and airish they were i never ceasd to find the best men and the hardest and most disinterested workers among the surgeons in the hospitals they are full of genius too i have seen many hundreds of them and this is my testimony there are however serious deficiencies wastes sad want of system in the commissions contributions and in all the voluntary and a great part of the governmental nursing edibles medicines stores c i do not say surgical attendance because the surgeons cannot do more than human endurance permits whatever puffing accounts there may be in the papers of the north this is the actual fact no thorough previous preparation no system no foresight no genius always plenty of stores no doubt but never where they are needed and never the proper application of all harrowing experiences none is greater than that of the days following a heavy battle scores hundreds of the noblest men on earth uncomplaining lie helpless mangled faint alone and so bleed to death or die from exhaustion either actually untouchd at all or merely the laying of them down and leaving them when there ought to be means provided to save them   the blue everywhere  this city its suburbs the capitol the front of the white house the places of amusement the avenue and all the main streets swarm with soldiers this winter more than ever before some are out from the hospitals some from the neighboring camps c one source or another they pour plenteously and make i should say the markd feature in the human movement and costumeappearance of our national city their blue pants and overcoats are everywhere the clump of crutches is heard up the stairs of the paymasters offices and there are characteristic groups around the doors of the same often waiting long and wearily in the cold toward the latter part of the afternoon you see the furloughd men sometimes singly sometimes in small squads making their way to the baltimore depot at all times except early in the morning the patrol detachments are moving around especially during the earlier hours of evening examining passes and arresting all soldiers without them they do not question the onelegged or men badly disabled or maind but all others are stopt they also go around evenings through the auditoriums of the theatres and make officers and all show their passes or other authority for being there   a model hospital  sunday january 29th 1865have been in armorysquare this afternoon the wards are very comfortable new floors and plaster walls and models of neatness i am not sure but this is a model hospital after all in important respects i found several sad cases of old lingering wounds one delaware soldier william h millis from bridgeville whom i had been with after the battles of the wilderness last may where he receivd a very bad wound in the chest with another in the left arm and whose case was serious pneumonia had set in all last june and july i now find well enough to do light duty for three weeks at the time mentiond he just hovered between life and death   boys in the army  as i walkd home about sunset i saw in fourteenth street a very young soldier thinly clad standing near the house i was about to enter i stopt a moment in front of the door and calld him to me i knew that an old tennessee regiment and also an indiana regiment were temporarily stopping in new barracks near fourteenth street this boy i found belonged to the tennessee regiment but i could hardly believe he carried a musket he was but 15 years old yet had been twelve months a soldier and had borne his part in several battles even historic ones i askd him if he did not suffer from the cold and if he had no overcoat no he did not suffer from cold and had no overcoat but could draw one whenever he wishd his father was dead and his mother living in some part of east tennessee all the men were from that part of the country the next forenoon i saw the tennessee and indiana regiments marching down the avenue my boy was with the former stepping along with the rest there were many other boys no older i stood and watchd them as they trampd along with slow strong heavy regular steps there did not appear to be a man over 30 years of age and a large proportion were from 15 to perhaps 22 or 23 they had all the look of veterans worn staind impassive and a certain unbent lounging gait carrying in addition to their regular arms and knapsacks frequently a fryingpan broom c they were all of pleasant physiognomy no refinement nor blanchd with intellect but as my eye pickd them moving along rank by rank there did not seem to be a single repulsive brutal or markedly stupid face among them   burial of a lady nurse  here is an incident just occurrd in one of the hospitals a lady named miss or mrs billings who has long been a practical friend of soldiers and nurse in the army and had become attached to it in a way that no one can realize but him or her who has had experience was taken sick early this winter lingerd some time and finally died in the hospital it was her request that she should be buried among the soldiers and after the military method this request was fully carried out her coffin was carried to the grave by soldiers with the usual escort buried and a salute fired over the grave this was at annapolis a few days since   female nurses for soldiers  there are many women in one position or another among the hospitals mostly as nurses here in washington and among the military stations quite a number of them young ladies acting as volunteers they are a help in certain ways and deserve to be mentiond with respect then it remains to be distinctly said that few or no young ladies under the irresistible conventions of society answer the practical requirements of nurses for soldiers middleaged or healthy and good conditiond elderly women mothers of children are always best many of the wounded must be handled a hundred things which cannot be gainsayd must occur and must be done the presence of a good middleaged or elderly woman the magnetic touch of hands the expressive features of the mother the silent soothing of her presence her words her knowledge and privileges arrived at only through having had children are precious and final qualifications it is a natural faculty that is required it is not merely having a genteel young woman at a table in a ward one of the finest nurses i met was a redfaced illiterate old irish woman i have seen her take the poor wasted naked boys so tenderly up in her arms there are plenty of excellent clean old black women that would make tiptop nurses   southern escapees  feb 23 65i saw a large procession of young men from the rebel army deserters they are calld but the usual meaning of the word does not apply to them passing the avenue today there were nearly 200 come up yesterday by boat from james river i stood and watchd them as they shuffled along in a slow tired worn sort of way a large proportion of lighthaird blonde light grayeyed young men among them their costumes had a dirtstaind uniformity most had been originally gray some had articles of our uniform pants on one vest or coat on another i think they were mostly georgia and north carolina boys they excited little or no attention as i stood quite close to them several good looking enough youths but o what a tale of misery their appearance told nodded or just spoke to me without doubt divining pity and fatherliness out of my face for my heart was full enough of it several of the couples trudgd along with their arms about each other some probably brothers as if they were afraid they might somehow get separated they nearly all lookd what one might call simple yet intelligent too some had pieces of old carpet some blankets and others old bags around their shoulders some of them here and there had fine faces still it was a procession of misery the two hundred had with them about half a dozen armd guards along this week i saw some such procession more or less in numbers every day as they were brought up by the boat the government does what it can for them and sends them north and west  feb 27some three or four hundred more escapees from the confederate army came up on the boat as the day has been very pleasant indeed after a long spell of bad weather i have been wandering around a good deal without any other object than to be outdoors and enjoy it have met these escaped men in all directions their apparel is the same ragged longworn motley as before described i talkd with a number of the men some are quite bright and stylish for all their poor clotheswalking with an air wearing their old headcoverings on one side quite saucily i find the old unquestionable proofs as all along the past four years of the unscrupulous tyranny exercised by the secession government in conscripting the common people by absolute force everywhere and paying no attention whatever to the mens time being upkeeping them in military service just the same one gigantic young fellow a georgian at least six feet three inches high broadsized in proportion attired in the dirtiest drab well smeard rags tied with strings his trousers at the knees all strips and streamers was complacently standing eating some bread and meat he appeard contented enough then a few minutes after i saw him slowly walking along it was plain he did not take anything to heart  feb 28as i passd the military headquarters of the city not far from the presidents house i stopt to interview some of the crowd of escapees who were lounging there in appearance they were the same as previously mentiond two of them one about 17 and the other perhaps 25 or 6 i talkd with some time they were from north carolina born and raisd there and had folks there the elder had been in the rebel service four years he was first conscripted for two years he was then kept arbitrarily in the ranks this is the case with a large proportion of the secession army there was nothing downcast in these young mens manners the younger had been soldiering about a year he was conscripted there were six brothers all the boys of the family in the army part of them as conscripts part as volunteers three had been killd one had escaped about four months ago and now this one had got away he was a pleasant and welltalking lad with the peculiar north carolina idiom not at all disagreeable to my ears he and the elder one were of the same company and escaped togetherand wishd to remain together they thought of getting transportation away to missouri and working there but were not sure it was judicious i advised them rather to go to some of the directly northern states and get farm work for the present the younger had made six dollars on the boat with some tobacco he brought he had three and a half left the elder had nothing i gave him a trifle soon after met john wormley 9th alabama a west tennessee rais d boy parents both deadhad the look of one for a long time on short allowancesaid very littlechewd tobacco at a fearful rate spitting in proportionlarge clear darkbrown eyes very finedidnt know what to make of metold me at last he wanted much to get some clean underclothes and a pair of decent pants didnt care about coat or hat fixings wanted a chance to wash himself well and put on the underclothes i had the very great pleasure of helping him to accomplish all those wholesome designs  march 1stplenty more butternut or claycolord escapees every day about 160 came in today a large portion south carolinians they generally take the oath of allegiance and are sent north west or extreme southwest if they wish several of them told me that the desertions in their army of men going home leave or no leave are far more numerous than their desertions to our side i saw a very forlorn looking squad of about a hundred late this afternoon on their way to the baltimore depot   the capitol by gaslight  tonight i have been wandering awhile in the capitol which is all lit up the illuminated rotunda looks fine i like to stand aside and look a long long while up at the dome it comforts me somehow the house and senate were both in session till very late i lookd in upon them but only a few moments they were hard at work on tax and appropriation bills i wanderd through the long and rich corridors and apartments under the senate an old habit of mine former winters and now more satisfaction than ever not many persons down there occasionally a flitting figure in the distance   the inauguration  march 4ththe president very quietly rode down to the capitol in his own carriage by himself on a sharp trot about noon either because he wishd to be on hand to sign bills or to get rid of marching in line with the absurd procession the muslin temple of liberty and pasteboard monitor i saw him on his return at three oclock after the performance was over he was in his plain twohorse barouche and lookd very much worn and tired the lines indeed of vast responsibilities intricate questions and demands of life and death cut deeper than ever upon his dark brown face yet all the old goodness tenderness sadness and canny shrewdness underneath the furrows i never see that man without feeling that he is one to become personally attachd to for his combination of purest heartiest tenderness and native western form of manliness by his side sat his little boy of ten years there were no soldiers only a lot of civilians on horseback with huge yellow scarfs over their shoulders riding around the carriage at the inauguration four years ago he rode down and back again surrounded by a dense mass of armd cavalrymen eight deep with drawn sabres and there were sharpshooters stationd at every corner on the route i ought to make mention of the closing levee of saturday night last never before was such a compact jam in front of the white houseall the grounds filld and away out to the spacious sidewalks i was there as i took a notion to gowas in the rush inside with the crowdsurged along the passageways the blue and other rooms and through the great east room crowds of country people some very funny fine music from the marine band off in a side place i saw mr lincoln drest all in black with white kid gloves and a clawhammer coat receiving as in duty bound shaking hands looking very disconsolate and as if he would give anything to be somewhere else   attitude of foreign governments during the war  looking over my scraps i find i wrote the following during 1864 the happening to our america abroad as well as at home these years is indeed most strange the democratic republic has paid her today the terrible and resplendent compliment of the united wish of all the nations of the world that her union should be broken her future cut off and that she should be compelld to descend to the level of kingdoms and empires ordinarily great there is certainly not one government in europe but is now watching the war in this country with the ardent prayer that the united states may be effectually split crippled and dismemberd by it there is not one but would help toward that dismemberment if it dared i say such is the ardent wish today of england and of france as governments and of all the nations of europe as governments i think indeed it is today the real heartfelt wish of all the nations of the world with the single exception of mexicomexico the only one to whom we have ever really done wrong and now the only one who prays for us and for our triumph with genuine prayer is it not indeed strange america made up of all cheerfully from the beginning opening her arms to all the result and justifier of all of britain germany france and spainall herethe accepter the friend hope last resource and general house of allshe who has harmd none but been bounteous to so many to millions the mother of strangers and exiles all nationsshould now i say be paid this dread compliment of general governmental fear and hatred are we indignant alarmd do we feel jeopardized no helpd braced concentrated rather we are all too prone to wander from ourselves to affect europe and watch her frowns and smiles we need this hot lesson of general hatred and henceforth must never forget it never again will we trust the moral sense nor abstract friendliness of a single government of the old world   the weatherdoes it sympathize with these times  whether the rains the heat and cold and what underlies them all are affected with what affects man in masses and follow his play of passionate action straind stronger than usual and on a larger scale than usualwhether this or no it is certain that there is now and has been for twenty months or more on this american continent north many a remarkable many an unprecedented expression of the subtile world of air above us and around us there since this war and the wide and deep national agitation strange analogies different combinations a different sunlight or absence of it different products even out of the ground after every great battle a great storm even civic events the same on saturday last a forenoon like whirling demons dark with slanting rain full of rage and then the afternoon so calm so bathed with flooding splendor from heavens most excellent sun with atmosphere of sweetness so clear it showd the stars long long before they were due as the president came out on the capitol portico a curious little white cloud the only one in that part of the sky appeard like a hovering bird right over him  indeed the heavens the elements all the meteorological influences have run riot for weeks past such caprices abruptest alternation of frowns and beauty i never knew it is a common remark that as last summer was different in its spells of intense heat from any preceding it the winter just completed has been without parallel it has remaind so down to the hour i am writing much of the daytime of the past month was sulky with leaden heaviness fog interstices of bitter cold and some insane storms but there have been samples of another description nor earth nor sky ever knew spectacles of superber beauty than some of the nights lately here the western star venus in the earlier hours of evening has never been so large so clear it seems as if it told something as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity with us americans five or six nights since it hung close by the moon then a little past its first quarter the star was wonderful the moon like a young mother the sky dark blue the transparent night the planets the moderate west wind the elastic temperature the miracle of that great star and the young and swelling moon swimming in the west suffused the soul then i heard slow and clear the deliberate notes of a bugle come up out of the silence sounding so good through the nights mystery no hurry but firm and faithful floating along rising falling leisurely with here and there a longdrawn note the bugle well playd sounding tattoo in one of the army hospitals near here where the wounded some of them personally so dear to me are lying in their cots and many a sick boy come down to the war from illinois michigan wisconsin iowa and the rest   inauguration ball  march 6i have been up to look at the dance and supperrooms for the inauguration ball at the patent office and i could not help thinking what a different scene they presented to my view a while since filld with a crowded mass of the worst wounded of the war brought in from second bull run antietam and fredericksburgh tonight beautiful women perfumes the violins sweetness the polka and the waltz then the amputation the blue face the groan the glassy eye of the dying the clotted rag the odor of wounds and blood and many a mothers son amid strangers passing away untended there for the crowd of the badly hurt was great and much for nurse to do and much for surgeon   scene at the capitol  i must mention a strange scene at the capitol the hall of representatives the morning of saturday last march 4th the day just dawnd but in halfdarkness everything dim leaden and soaking in that dim light the members nervous from long drawn duty exhausted some asleep and many half asleep the gaslight mixd with the dingy daybreak produced an unearthly effect the poor little sleepy stumbling pages the smell of the hall the members with heads leaning on their desks the sounds of the voices speaking with unusual intonationsthe general moral atmosphere also of the close of this important sessionthe strong hope that the war is approaching its closethe tantalizing dread lest the hope may be a false onethe grandeur of the hall itself with its effect of vast shadows up toward the panels and spaces over the galleriesall made a markd combination  in the midst of this with the suddenness of a thunderbolt burst one of the most angry and crashing storms of rain and hail ever heard it beat like a deluge on the heavy glass roof of the hall and the wind literally howld and roard for a moment and no wonder the nervous and sleeping representatives were thrown into confusion the slumberers awaked with fear some started for the doors some lookd up with blanchd cheeks and lips to the roof and the little pages began to cry it was a scene but it was over almost as soon as the drowsied men were actually awake they recoverd themselves the storm raged on beating dashing and with loud noises at times but the house went ahead with its business then i think as calmly and with as much deliberation as at any time in its career perhaps the shock did it good one is not without impression after all amid these members of congress of both the houses that if the flat routine of their duties should ever be broken in upon by some great emergency involving real danger and calling for firstclass personal qualities those qualities would be found generally forthcoming and from men not now credited with them   a yankee antique  march 27 1865sergeant calvin f harlowe company c 29th massachusetts 3d brigade 1st division ninth corpsa markd sample of heroism and death some may say bravado but i say heroism of grandest oldest orderin the late attack by the rebel troops and temporary capture by them of fort steadman at night the fort was surprised at dead of night suddenly awakend from their sleep and rushing from their tents harlowe with others found himself in the hands of the seceshthey demanded his surrenderhe answerd never while i live of course it was useless the others surrenderd the odds were too great again he was askd to yield this time by a rebel captain though surrounded and quite calm he again refused calld sternly to his comrades to fight on and himself attempted to do so the rebel captain then shot himbut at the same instant he shot the captain both fell together mortally wounded harlowe died almost instantly the rebels were driven out in a very short time the body was buried next day but soon taken up and sent home plymouth county mass harlowe was only 22 years of agewas a tall slim darkhaird blueeyed young manhad come out originally with the 29th and that is the way he met his death after four years campaign he was in the seven days fight before richmond in second bull run antietam first fredericksburgh vicksburgh jackson wilderness and the campaigns followingwas as good a soldier as ever wore the blue and every old officer in the regiment will bear that testimony though so young and in a common rank he had a spirit as resolute and brave as any hero in the books ancient or modernit was too great to say the words i surrenderand so he died when i think of such things knowing them well all the vast and complicated events of the war on which history dwells and makes its volumes fall aside and for the moment at any rate i see nothing but young calvin harlowes figure in the night disdaining to surrender   wounds and diseases  the war is over but the hospitals are fuller than ever from former and current cases a large majority of the wounds are in the arms and legs but there is every kind of wound in every part of the body i should say of the sick from my observation that the prevailing maladies are typhoid fever and the camp fevers generally diarrhoea catarrhal affections and bronchitis rheumatism and pneumonia these forms of sickness lead all the rest follow there are twice as many sick as there are wounded the deaths range from seven to ten per cent of those under treatment7   note  7 in the u s surgeongenerals office since there is a formal record and treatment of 153 142 cases of wounds by government surgeons what must have been the number unofficial indirectto say nothing of the southern armies   death of president lincoln  april 16 65i find in my notes of the time this passage on the death of abraham lincoln he leaves for americas history and biography so far not only its most dramatic reminiscencehe leaves in my opinion the greatest best most characteristic artistic moral personality not but that he had faults and showd them in the presidency but honesty goodness shrewdness conscience and a new virtue unknown to other lands and hardly yet really known here but the foundation and tie of all as the future will grandly develop unionism in its truest and amplest sense formd the hardpan of his character these he seald with his life the tragic splendor of his death purging illuminating all throws round his form his head an aureole that will remain and will grow brighter through time while history lives and love of country lasts by many has this union been helpd but if one name one man must be pickd out he most of all is the conservator of it to the future he was assassinatedbut the union is not assassinatedca ira one falls and another falls the soldier drops sinks like a wavebut the ranks of the ocean eternally press on death does its work obliterates a hundred a thousandpresident general captain privatebut the nation is immortal   shermans armys jubilationits sudden stoppage  when shermans armies long after they left atlanta were marching through southand north carolinaafter leaving savannah the news of lees capitulation having been receivdthe men never movd a mile without from some part of the line sending up continued inspiriting shouts at intervals all day long sounded out the wild music of those peculiar army cries they would be commencd by one regiment or brigade immediately taken up by others and at length whole corps and armies would join in these wild triumphant choruses it was one of the characteristic expressions of the western troops and became a habit serving as a relief and outlet to the mena vent for their feelings of victory returning peace c morning noon and afternoon spontaneous for occasion or without occasion these huge strange cries differing from any other echoing through the open air for many a mile expressing youth joy wildness irrepressible strength and the ideas of advance and conquest sounded along the swamps and uplands of the south floating to the skies there never were men that kept in better spirits in danger or defeatwhat then could they do in victorysaid one of the 15th corps to me afterwards this exuberance continued till the armies arrived at raleigh there the news of the presidents murder was receivd then no more shouts or yells for a week all the marching was comparatively muffled it was very significanthardly a loud word or laugh in many of the regiments a hush and silence pervaded all   no good portrait of lincoln  probably the reader has seen physiognomies often old farmers seacaptains and such that behind their homeliness or even ugliness held superior points so subtle yet so palpable making the real life of their faces almost as impossible to depict as a wild perfume or fruittaste or a passionate tone of the living voiceand such was lincolns face the peculiar color the lines of it the eyes mouth expression of technical beauty it had nothingbut to the eye of a great artist it furnished a rare study a feast and fascination the current portraits are all failuresmost of them caricatures   releasd union prisoners from south  the releasd prisoners of war are now coming up from the southern prisons i have seen a number of them the sight is worse than any sight of battlefields or any collection of wounded even the bloodiest there was as a sample one large boat load of several hundreds brought about the 25th to annapolis and out of the whole number only three individuals were able to walk from the boat the rest were carried ashore and laid down in one place or another can those be menthose little livid brown ashstreakd monkeylooking dwarfsare they really not mummied dwindled corpses they lay there most of them quite still but with a horrible look in their eyes and skinny lips often with not enough flesh on the lips to cover their teeth probably no more appalling sight was ever seen on this earth there are deeds crimes that may be forgiven but this is not among them it steeps its perpetrators in blackest escapeless endless damnation over 50000 have been compell d to die the death of starvationreader did you ever try to realize what starvation actually isin those prisonsand in a land of plenty an indescribable meanness tyranny aggravating course of insults almost incrediblewas evidently the rule of treatment through all the southern military prisons the dead there are not to be pitied as much as some of the living that come from thereif they can be call d livingmany of them are mentally imbecile and will never recuperate8   note  8 from a review of andersonville a story of southern milttary prisons published serially in the toledo blade in 1879 and afterwards in book form  there is a deep fascination in the subject of andersonvillefor that golgotha in which lie the whitening bones of 13000 gallant young men represents the dearest and costliest sacrifice of the war for the preservation of our national unity it is a type too of its class its more than hundred hecatombs of dead represent several times that number of their brethren for whom the prison gates of belle isle danville salisbury florence columbia and cahaba opend only in eternity there are few families in the north who have not at least one dear relative or friend among these 60000 whose sad fortune it was to end their service for the union by lying down and dying for it in a southern prison pen the manner of their death the horrors that clusterd thickly around every moment of their existence the loyal unfaltering steadfastness with which they endured all that fate had brought them has never been adequately told it was not with them as with their comrades in the field whose every act was performd in the presence of those whose duty it was to observe such matters and report them to the world hidden from the view of their friends in the north by the impenetrable veil which the military operations of the rebels drew around the socalled confederacy the people knew next to nothing of their career or their sufferings thousands died there less heeded even than the hundreds who perishd on the battlefield grant did not lose as many men killd outright in the terrible campaign from the wilderness to the james river43 days of desperate fightingas died in july and august at andersonville nearly twice as many died in that prison as fell from the day that grant crossd the rapidan till he settled down in the trenches before petersburg more than four times as many union dead lie under the solemn soughing pines about that forlorn little village in southern georgia than mark the course of sherman from chattanooga to atlanta the nation stands aghast at the expenditure of life which attended the two bloody campaigns of 1864 which virtually crushd the confederacy but no one remembers that more union soldiers died in the rear of the rebel lines than were killd in the front of them the great military events which stampd out the rebellion drew attention away from the sad drama which starvation and disease playd in those gloomy pens in the far recesses of sombre southern forests  from a letter of johnny bouquet in n y tribune march 27 81  i visited at salisbury n c the prison pen or the site of it from which nearly 11000 victims of southern politicians were buried being confined in a pen without shelter exposed to all the elements could do to all the disease herding animals together could create and to all the starvation and cruelty an incompetent and intense caitiff government could accomplish from the conversation and almost from the recollection of the northern people this place has dropp d but not so in the gossip of the salisbury people nearly all of whom say that the half was never told that such was the nature of habitual outrage here that when federal prisoners escaped the townspeople harbord them in their barns afraid the vengeance of god would fall on them to deliver even their enemies back to such cruelty said one old man at the boyden house who joind in the conversation one evening there were often men buried out of that prison pen still alive i have the testimony of a surgeon that he had seen them pulld out of the dead cart with their eyes open and taking notice but too weak to lift a finger there was not the least excuse for such treatment as the confederate government had seized every sawmill in the region and could just as well have put up shelter for these prisoners as not wood being plentiful here it will be hard to make any honest man in salisbury say that there was the slightest necessity for those prisoners having to live in old tents caves and holes halffull of water representations were made to the davis government against the officers in charge of it but no attention was paid to them promotion was the punishment for cruelty there the inmates were skeletons hell could have no terrors for any man who died there except the inhuman keepers   death of a pennsylvania soldier  frank h irwin company e 93rd pennsylvaniadied may 1 65my letter to his motherdear madam no doubt you and franks friends have heard the sad fact of his death in hospital here through his uncle or the lady from baltimore who took his things i have not seen them only heard of them visiting frank i will write you a few linesas a casual friend that sat by his deathbed your son corporal frank h irwin was wounded near fort fisher virginia march 25th 1865the wound was in the left knee pretty bad he was sent up to washington was receivd in ward c armorysquare hospital march 28ththe wound became worse and on the 4th of april the leg was amputated a little above the kneethe operation was perform d by dr bliss one of the best surgeons in the armyhe did the whole operation himselfthere was a good deal of bad matter gatherdthe bullet was found in the knee for a couple of weeks afterwards he was doing pretty well i visited and sat by him frequently as he was fond of having me the last ten or twelve days of april i saw that his case was critical he previously had some fever with cold spells the last week in april he was much of the time flightybut always mild and gentle he died first of may the actual cause of death was pyaemia the absorption of the matter in the system instead of its discharge frank as far as i saw had everything requisite in surgical treatment nursing c he had watches much of the time he was so good and wellbehaved and affectionate i myself liked him very much i was in the habit of coming in afternoons and sitting by him and soothing him and he liked to have meliked to put his arm out and lay his hand on my kneewould keep it so a long while toward the last he was more restless and flighty at nightoften fancied himself with his regimentby his talk sometimes seemd as if his feelings were hurt by being blamed by his officers for something he was entirely innocent ofsaid i never in my life was thought capable of such a thing and never was at other times he would fancy himself talking as it seemd to children or such like his relatives i suppose and giving them good advice would talk to them a long while all the time he was out of his head not one single bad word or idea escaped him it was remarkd that many a mans conversation in his senses was not half as good as franks delirium he seemd quite willing to diehe had become very weak and had sufferd a good deal and was perfectly resignd poor boy i do not know his past life but i feel as if it must have been good at any rate what i saw of him here under the most trying circumstances with a painful wound and among strangers i can say that he behaved so brave so composed and so sweet and affectionate it could not be surpassd and now like many other noble and good men after serving his country as a soldier he has yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service such things are gloomyyet there is a text god doeth all things wellthe meaning of which after due time appears to the soul  i thought perhaps a few words though from a stranger about your son from one who was with him at the last might be worth whilefor i loved the young man though i but saw him immediately to lose him i am merely a friend visiting the hospitals occasionally to cheer the wounded and sick  w w   the armies returning  may 7sundaytoday as i was walking a mile or two south of alexandria i fell in with several large squads of the returning western army shermans men as they calld themselves about a thousand in all the largest portion of them half sick some convalescents on their way to a hospital camp these fragmentary excerpts with the unmistakable western physiognomy and idioms crawling along slowlyafter a great campaign blown this way as it were out of their latitudei markd with curiosity and talkd with off and on for over an hour here and there was one very sick but all were able to walk except some of the last who had given out and were seated on the ground faint and despondent these i tried to cheer told them the camp they were to reach was only a little way further over the hill and so got them up and started accompanying some of the worst a little way and helping them or putting them under the support of stronger comrades  may 21saw general sheridan and his cavalry today a strong attractive sight the men were mostly young a few middleaged superblooking fellows brown spare keen with wellworn clothing many with pieces of waterproof cloth around their shoulders hanging down they dashd along pretty fast in wide close ranks all spatterd with mud no holiday soldiers brigade after brigade i could have watchd for a week sheridan stood on a balcony under a big tree coolly smoking a cigar his looks and manner impressd me favorably  may 22have been taking a walk along pennsylvania avenue and seventh street north the city is full of soldiers running around loose officers everywhere of all grades all have the weatherbeaten look of practical service it is a sight i never tire of all the armies are now here or portions of them for tomorrows review you see them swarming like bees everywhere   the grand review  for two days now the broad spaces of pennsylvania avenue along to treasury hill and so by detour around to the presidents house and so up to georgetown and across the aqueduct bridge have been alive with a magnificent sight the returning armies in their wide ranks stretching clear across the avenue i watch them march or ride along at a brisk pace through two whole daysinfantry cavalry artillerysome 200000 men some days afterwards one or two other corps and then still afterwards a good part of shermans immense army brought up from charleston savannah c   western soldiers  may 267the streets the public buildings and grounds of washington still swarm with soldiers from illinois indiana ohio missouri iowa and all the western states i am continually meeting and talking with them they often speak to me first and always show great sociability and glad to have a good interchange of chat these western soldiers are more slow in their movements and in their intellectual quality also have no extreme alertness they are larger in size have a more serious physiognomy are continually looking at you as they pass in the street they are largely animal and handsomely so during the war i have been at times with the fourteenth fifteenth seventeenth and twentieth corps i always feel drawn toward the men and like their personal contact when we are crowded close together as frequently these days in the streetcars they all think the world of general sherman call him old bill or sometimes uncle billy   a soldier on lincoln  may 28as i sat by the bedside of a sick michigan soldier in hospital today a convalescent from the adjoining bed rose and came to me and presently we began talking he was a middleaged man belonged to the 2d virginia regiment but lived in racine ohio and had a family there he spoke of president lincoln and said the war is over and many are lost and now we have lost the best the fairest the truest man in america take him altogether he was the best man this country ever produced it was quite a while i thought very different but some time before the murder thats the way i have seen it there was deep earnestness in the soldier i found upon further talk he had known mr lincoln personally and quite closely years before he was a veteran was now in the fifth year of his service was a cavalry man and had been in a good deal of hard fighting   two brothers

wounded captain a special friend of mine lying with a painful fracture of left leg in one of the hospitals in a large ward partially vacant the lights were put out all but a little candle far from where i sat the full moon shone in through the windows making long slanting silvery patches on the floor all was still my friend too was silent but could not sleep so i sat there by him slowly wafting the fan and occupied with the musings that arose out of the scene the long shadowy ward the beautiful ghostly moonlight on the floor the white beds here and there an occupant with huddled form the bedclothes thrown off the hospitals have a number of cases of sunstroke and exhaustion by heat from the late reviews there are many such from the sixth corps from the hot parade of day before yesterday some of these shows cost the lives of scores of men  sunday sep 10visited douglas and stanton hospitals they are quite full many of the cases are bad ones lingering wounds and old sickness there is a more than usual look of despair on the countenances of many of the men hope has left them i went through the wards talking as usual there are several here from the confederate army whom i

heard a couple of neighboring soldiers talking to each other from their cots one down with fever but improving had come up belated from charleston not long before the other was what we now call an old veteran ie he was a connecticut youth probably of less than the age of twentyfive years the four last of which he had spent in active service in the war in all parts of the country the two were chatting of one thing and another the fever soldier spoke of john c calhouns monument which he had seen and was describing it the veteran said i have seen calhouns monument that you saw is not the real monument but i have seen it it is the desolated ruined south nearly the whole generation of young men between seventeen and thirty destroyed or maimd all the old families used upthe rich impoverishd the plantations coverd with weeds the slaves unloosd and become the masters and the name of southerner blackend with every shameall that is calhouns real monument   hospitals closing  october 3there are two army hospitals now remaining i went to the largest of these douglas and spent the afternoon and evening there are many sad cases old wounds incurable sickness and some of the wounded from the march and april battles before richmond few realize how sharp and bloody those closing battles were our men exposed themselves more than usual pressd ahead without urging then the southerners fought with extra desperation both sides knew that with the successful chasing of the rebel cabal from richmond and the occupation of that city by the national troops the game was up the dead and wounded were unusually many of the wounded the last lingering driblets have been brought to hospital here i find many rebel wounded here and have been extra busy today tending to the worst cases of them with the rest  oct nov and dec 65sundaysevery sunday of these months visited harewood hospital out in the woods pleasant and recluse some two and a half or three miles north of the capitol the situation is healthy with broken ground grassy slopes and patches of oak woods the trees large and fine it was one of the most extensive of the hospitals now reduced to four or five partially occupied wards the numerous others being vacant in november this became the last military hospital kept up by the government all the others being closed cases of the worst and most incurable wounds obstinate illness and of poor fellows who have no homes to go to are found here  dec 10sundayagain spending a good part of the day at harewood i write this about an hour before sundown i have walkd out for a few minutes to the edge of the woods to soothe myself with the hour and scene it is a glorious warm goldensunny still afternoon the only noise is from a crowd of cawing crows on some trees three hundred yards distant clusters of gnats swimming and dancing in the air in all directions the oak leaves are thick under the bare trees and give a strong and delicious perfume inside the wards everything is gloomy death is there as i enterd i was confronted by it the first thing a corpse of a poor soldier just dead of typhoid fever the attendants had just straightend the limbs put coppers on the eyes and were laying it out  the roadsa great recreation the past three years has been in taking long walks out from washington five seven perhaps ten miles and back generally with my friend peter doyle who is as fond of it as i am fine moonlight nights over the perfect military roads hard and smoothor sundayswe had these delightful walks never to be forgotten the roads connecting washington and the numerous forts around the city made one useful result at any rate out of the war   typical soldiers  even the typical soldiers i have been personally intimate withit seems to me if

occasion would turn out lots of just such typical soldiers whenever wanted   convulsiveness  as i have lookd over the proofsheets of the preceding pages i have once or twice feard that my diary would prove at best but a batch of convulsively written reminiscences well be it so  they are but parts of the actual distraction heat smoke and excitement of those times the war itself with the temper of society preceding it can indeed be best described by that very word convulsiveness   three years summd up  during those three years in hospital camp or field i made over six hundred visits or tours and went as i estimate counting all among from eighty thousand to a hundred thousand of the wounded and sick as sustainer of spirit and body in some degree in time of need these visits varied from an hour or two to all day or night for with dear or critical cases i generally watchd all night sometimes i took up my quarters in the hospital and slept or watchd there several nights in succession those three years i consider the greatest privilege and satisfaction with all their feverish excitements and physical deprivations and lamentable sights and of course the most profound lesson of my life i can say that in my ministerings i comprehended all whoever came in my way northern or southern and slighted none it arousd and brought out and decided undreamdof depths of emotion it has given me my most fervent views of the true ensemble and extent of the states while i was with wounded and sick in thousands of cases from the new england states and from new york new jersey and pennsylvania and from michigan wisconsin ohio indiana illinois and all the western states i was with more or less from all the states north and south without exception i was with many from the border states especially from maryland and virginia and found during those lurid years 186263 far more union southerners especially tennesseans than is supposed i was with many rebel officers and men among our wounded and gave them always what i had and tried to cheer them the same as any i was among the army teamsters considerably and indeed always found myself drawn to them among the black soldiers wounded or sick and in the contraband camps i also took my way whenever in their neighborhood and did what i could for them   the million dead too summd up  the dead in this warthere they lie strewing

those years but radiating since in all the peaceful quarters of the landwe see and ages yet may see on monuments and gravestones singly or in masses to thousands or tens of thousands the significant word unknown  in some of the cemeteries nearly all the dead are unknown at salisbury n c for instance the known are only 85 while the unknown are 12027 and 11700 of these are buried in trenches a national monument has been put up here by order of congress to mark the spotbut what visible material monument can ever fittingly commemorate that spot   the real war will never get in the books  and so goodbye to the war i know not how it may have been or may be to othersto me the main interest i found and still on recollection find in the rank and file of the armies both sides and in those specimens amid the hospitals and even the dead on the field to me the points illustrating the latent personal character and eligibilities of these states in the two or three millions of american young and middleaged men north and south embodied in those armiesand especially the onethird or onefourth of their number stricken by wounds or disease at some time in the course of the contestwere of more significance even than the political interests involved as so much of a race depends on how it faces death and how it stands personal anguish and sickness as in the glints of emotions under emergencies and the indirect traits and asides in plutarch we get far profounder clues to the antique world than all its more formal history  future years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal background of countless minor scenes and interiors not the official surfacecourteousness of the generals not the few great battles of the secession war and it is best they should notthe real war will never get in the books in the mushy influences of current times too the fervid atmosphere and typical events of those years are in danger of being totally forgotten i have at night watchd by the side of a sick man in the hospital one who could not live many hours i have seen his eyes flash and burn as he raised himself and recurrd to the cruelties on his surrenderd brother and mutilations of the corpse afterward see in the preceding pages the incident at uppervillethe seventeen killd as in the description were left there on the ground after they dropt dead no one touchd themall were made sure of however the carcasses were left for the citizens to bury or not as they chose  such was the war it was not a quadrille in a ballroom its interior history will not only never be writtenits practicality minutia of deeds and passions will never be even suggested the actual soldier of 186265 north and south with all his ways his incredible dauntlessness habits practices tastes language his fierce friendship his appetite rankness his superb strength and animality lawless gait and a hundred unnamed lights and shades of camp i say will never be writtenperhaps must not and should not be  the preceding notes may furnish a few stray glimpses into that life and into those lurid interiors never to be fully conveyd to the future the hospital part of the drama from 61 to 65 deserves indeed to be recorded of that manythreaded drama with its sudden and strange surprises its confounding of prophecies its moments of despair the dread of foreign interference the interminable campaigns the bloody battles the mighty and cumbrous and green armies the drafts and bountiesthe immense money expenditure like a heavypouring constant rainwith over the whole land the last three years of the struggle an unending universal mourningwail of women parents orphansthe marrow of the tragedy concentrated in those army hospitalsit seemd sometimes as if the whole interest of the land north and south was one vast central hospital and all the rest of the affair but flangesthose forming the untold and unwritten history of the warinfinitely greater like lifes than the few

paragraph  several years now elapse before i resume my diary i continued at washington working in the attorneygenerals department through 66 and 67 and some time afterward in february 73 i was stricken down by paralysis gave up my desk and migrated to camden new jersey where i lived during 74 and 75 quite unwellbut after that began to grow better commencd going for weeks at a time even for months down in the country to a charmingly recluse and rural spot along timber creek twelve or thirteen miles from where it enters the delaware river domicild at the farmhouse of my friends the staffords near by i lived half the time along this creek and its adjacent fields and lanes and it is to my life here that i perhaps owe partial recovery a sort of second wind or semirenewal of the lease of life from the prostration of 187475 if the notes of that outdoor life could only prove as glowing to you reader dear as the experience itself was to me doubtless in the course of the following the fact of invalidism will crop out i call myself a halfparalytic these days and reverently bless the lord it is no worse between some of the linesbut i get my share of fun and healthy

learn this to some vexation perhaps as much of their copy is from those hastilywritten first notes   birds migrating at midnight  did you ever chance to hear the midnight flight of birds passing through the air and darkness overhead in countless armies changing their early or late summer habitat it is something not to be forgotten a friend called me up just after 12 last night to mark the peculiar noise of unusually immense flocks migrating north rather late this year in the silence shadow and delicious odor of the hour the natural perfume belonging to the night alone i thought it rare music you could hear the characteristic motiononce or twice the rush of mighty wings but often a velvety rustle long drawn outsometimes quite nearwith continual calls and chirps and some songnotes it all lasted from 12 till after 3 once in a while the species was plainly distinguishable i could make out the bobolink tanager wilsons thrush whitecrownd sparrow and occasionally from high in the air

tinge from the last two days mildness and moisture how the sun silently mounts in the broad clear sky on his days journey how the warm beams bathe all and come streaming kissingly and almost hot on my

last two days it has been the great wild bee the humblebee or bumble as the children call him as i walk or hobble from the farmhouse down to the creek i traverse the beforementiond lane fenced by old rails with many splits splinters breaks holes c the choice habitat of those crooning hairy insects up and down and by and between these rails they swarm and dart and fly in countless myriads as i wend slowly along i am often accompanied with a moving cloud of them they play a leading part in my morning midday or sunset rambles and often dominate the landscape in a way i never before thought offill the long lane not by scores or hundreds only but by thousands large and vivacious and swift with wonderful momentum and a loud swelling perpetual hum varied now and then by something almost like a shriek they dart to and fro in rapid flashes chasing each other and little things as they are conveying to me a new and pronouncd sense of strength beauty vitality and movement are they in their mating season or what is the meaning of this plenitude swiftness eagerness display as i walkd i thought i was followd by a particular swarm but upon observation i saw that it was a rapid succession of changing swarms one after another  as i write i am seated under a big wildcherry treethe warm day temperd by partial clouds and a fresh breeze neither too heavy nor lightand here i sit long and long envelopd in the deep musical drone of these bees flitting balancing darting to and fro about me by hundredsbig fellows with light yellow jackets great glistening swelling bodies stumpy heads and gauzy wingshumming their perpetual rich mellow boom is there not a hint in it for a musical composition of which it should be the background some bumblebee symphony how it all nourishes lulls me in the way most needed the open air the ryefields the apple orchards the last two days have been faultless in sun breeze temperature and everything never two more perfect days and i have enjoyd them wonderfully my health is somewhat better and my spirit at peace yet the anniversary of the saddest loss and sorrow of my life is close at hand  another jotting another perfect day forenoon from 7 to 9 two hours envelopd in sound of bumblebees and birdmusic down in the appletrees and in a neighboring cedar were three or four russetbackd thrushes each singing his best and roulading in ways i never heard surpassd two hours i abandon myself to hearing them and indolently absorbing the scene almost every bird i notice has a special time in the yearsometimes limited to a few dayswhen it sings its best and now is the period of these russetbacks meanwhile up and down the lane the darting droning musical bumblebees a great swarm again for my entourage as i return home moving along with me as before  as i write this two or three weeks later i am sitting near the brook under a tulip tree 70 feet high thick with the fresh verdure of its young maturitya beautiful objectevery branch every leaf perfect from top to bottom seeking the sweet juice in the blossoms it swarms with myriads of these wild bees whose loud and steady humming makes an undertone to the whole and to my mood and the hour all of which i will bring to a close by extracting the following verses from henry a beerss little volume      as i lay yonder in tall grass     a drunken bumblebee went past      delirious with honey toddy     the golden sash about his body     scarce kept it in his swollen belly     distent with honeysuckle jelly     rose liquor and the sweetpea wine     had fill d his soul with song divine     deep had he drunk the warm night through     his hairy thighs were wet with dew     full many an antic he had playd     while the world went round through sleep and shade     oft had he lit with thirsty lip     some flowercups nectard sweets to sip     when on smooth petals he would slip     or over tangled stamens trip     and headlong in the pollen rolld     crawl out quite dusted oer with gold     or else his heavy feet would stumble     against some bud and down hed tumble     amongst the grass there lie and grumble     in low soft basspoor maudlin bumble   cedarapples  as i journeyd today in a light wagon ten or twelve miles through the country nothing pleasd me more in their homely beauty and novelty i had either never seen the little things to such advantage or had never noticed them before than that peculiar fruit with its profuse clearyellow dangles of inchlong silk or yarn in boundless profusion spotting the dark green cedar bushescontrasting well with their bronze tuftsthe flossy shreds covering the knobs all over like a shock of wild hair on elfin pates on my ramble afterward down by the creek i pluckd one from its bush and shall keep it these cedarapples last only a

chipperingshriek of two kingfishers i have been watching the latter the last half hour on their regular evening frolic over and in the stream evidently a spree of the liveliest kind they pursue each

the latter at night and the other both day and night i thought the morning and evening warble of birds delightful but i find i can listen to these strange insects with just as much pleasure a single locust is now heard near noon from a tree two hundred feet off as i writea long whirring continued quite loud noise graded in distinct whirls or swinging circles increasing in strength and rapidity up to a certain point and then a fluttering quietly tapering fall each strain is continued from one to two minutes the locustsong is very appropriate to the scenegushes has meaning is masculine is like some fine old wine not sweet but far better than sweet  but the katydidhow shall i describe its piquant utterances one sings from a willowtree just outside my open bedroom window twenty yards distant every clear night for a fortnight past has soothd me to sleep i rode through a piece of woods for a hundred rods the other evening and heard the katydids by myriadsvery curious for once but i like better my single neighbor on the tree let me say more about the song of the locust even to repetition a long chromatic tremulous crescendo like a brass disk whirling round and round emitting wave after wave of notes beginning with a certain moderate beat or measure rapidly increasing in speed and emphasis reaching a point of great energy and significance and then quickly and gracefully dropping down and out not the melody of the singingbirdfar from it the common musician might think without melody but surely having to the finer ear a harmony of its own monotonousbut what a swing there is in that brassy drone round and round cymballineor like the whirling of brass quoits   the lesson of a tree  sept 1i should not take either the biggest or the most picturesque tree to illustrate it here is one of my favorites now before me a fine yellow poplar quite straight perhaps 90 feet high and four thick at the butt how strong vital enduring how dumbly eloquent what suggestions of imperturbability and being as against the human trait of mere seeming then the qualities almost emotional palpably artistic heroic of a tree so innocent and harmless yet so savage it is yet says nothing how it rebukes by its tough and equable serenity all weathers this gustytemperd little whiffet man that runs indoors at a mite of rain or snow science or rather halfway science scoffs at reminiscence of dryad and hamadryad and of trees speaking but if they dont they do as well as most speaking writing poetry sermonsor rather they do a great deal better i should say indeed that those old dryadreminiscences are quite as true as any and profounder than most reminiscences we get cut this out as the quack mediciners say and keep by you go and sit in a grove or woods with one or more of those voiceless companions and read the foregoing and think  one lesson from affiliating a treeperhaps the greatest moral lesson anyhow from earth rocks animals is that same lesson of

autumn sun and westerly breeze today 3d as i sit here the water surface prettily moving in windripples before me on a stout old beech at the edge decayed and slanting almost fallen to the stream yet with life and leaves in its mossy limbs a gray squirrel exploring runs up and down flirts his tail leaps to the ground sits on his haunches upright as he sees me a darwinian hint and then races up the

from lightest to richest redall set in and toned down by the prevailing brown of the earth and gray of the sky so winter is coming and i yet in my sickness i sit here amid all these fair sights and vital influences and abandon myself to that thought with its wandering trains of speculation   note  10 there is a tulip poplar within sight of woodstown which is twenty feet around three feet from the ground four feet across about eighteen feet up the trunk which is broken off about three or four feet higher up on the south side an arm has shot out from which rise two stems each to about ninetyone or ninetytwo feet from the ground twentyfive or more years since the cavity in the butt was large enough for and nine men at one time ate dinner therein it is supposed twelve to fifteen men could now at one time stand within its trunk the severe winds of 1877 and 1878 did not seem to damage it and the two stems send out yearly many blossoms scenting the air immediately about it with their sweet perfume it is entirely unprotected by other trees on a hillwoodstown n j register april 15 79   the skydays and nightshappiness  oct 20a clear crispy daydry and breezy air full of oxygen out of the sane silent beauteous miracles that envelope and fuse metrees water grass sunlight and early frostthe one i am looking at most today is the sky it has that delicate transparent blue peculiar to autumn and the only clouds are little or larger white ones giving their still and spiritual motion to the great concave all through the earlier day say from 7 to 11 it keeps a pure yet vivid blue but as noon approaches the color gets lighter quite gray for two or three hoursthen still paler for a spell till sundownwhich last i watch dazzling through the interstices of a knoll of big treesdarts of fire and a gorgeous show of lightyellow livercolor and red with a vast silver glaze askant on the waterthe transparent shadows shafts sparkle and vivid colors beyond all the paintings ever made  i dont know what or how but it seems to me mostly owing to these skies every now and then i think while i have of course seen them every day of my life i never really saw the skies before have had this autumn some wondrously contented hoursmay i not say perfectly happy ones as i have read byron just before his death told a friend that he had known but three happy hours during his whole existence then there is the old german legend of the kings bell to the same point while i was out there by the wood that beautiful sunset through the trees i thought of byrons and the bell story and the notion started in me that i was having a happy hour though perhaps my best moments i never jot down when they come i cannot afford to break the charm by inditing memoranda i just abandon myself to the mood and let it float on carrying me in its placid extasy  what is happiness anyhow is this one of its hours or the like of itso impalpablea mere breath an evanescent tinge i am not sureso let me give myself the benefit of the doubt hast thou pellucid in thy azure depths medicine for case like mine ah the physical shatter and troubled spirit of me the last three years and dost thou subtly

opens into a broad grassy upland field of over twenty acres slightly sloping to the south here i am accustomd to walk for sky views and effects either morning or sundown today from this field my soul is calmd and expanded beyond description the whole forenoon by the clear blue arching over all cloudless nothing particular only sky and daylight their soothing accompaniments autumn leaves the cool dry air the faint aromacrows cawing in the distancetwo great buzzards wheeling gracefully and slowly far up therethe occasional murmur of the wind sometimes quite gently then threatening through the treesa gang of farmlaborers loading cornstalks in a field in sight and the patient horses waiting   colorsa contrast  such a play of colors and lights different seasons different hours of the daythe

here and sit by the silent pond how different from the excitement amid which in the cities millions of people are now waiting news of yesterdays presidential election or receiving and discussing the resultin this secluded place uncaredfor unknown   crows and crows  nov 14as i sit here by the creek resting after my walk a warm languor bathes me from the sun no sound but a cawing of crows and no motion but their black flying figures from overhead reflected in the mirror of the pond below indeed a principal feature of the scene today is these crows their incessant cawing far or near and their countless flocks and processions moving from place to place and at times almost darkening the air with their myriads as i sit a moment writing this by the bank i see the black clearcut reflection of them far below flying through the watery lookingglass by ones twos or long strings all last night i heard the noises from their great roost in a neighboring wood   a winter day on the seabeach  one bright december midday lately i spent down on the new jersey seashore reaching it by a little more than an hours railroad trip over the old camden and atlantic i had started betimes fortified by nice strong coffee and a good breakfast cookd by the hands i love my dear sister loushow much better it makes the victuals taste and then assimilate strengthen you perhaps make the whole day comfortable afterwards five or six miles at the last our track enterd a broad region of salt grass meadows intersected by lagoons and cut up everywhere by watery runs the sedgy perfume delightful to my nostrils reminded me of the mash and south bay of my native island i could have journeyd contentedly till night through these flat and odorous seaprairies from halfpast 11 till 2 i was nearly all the time along the beach or in sight of the ocean listening to its hoarse murmur and inhaling the bracing and welcome breezes first a rapid fivemile drive over the hard sandour carriage wheels hardly made dents in it then after dinner as there were nearly two hours to spare i walkd off in another direction hardly met or saw a person and taking possession of what appeard to have been the receptionroom of an old bathhouse range had a broad expanse of view all to myselfquaint refreshing unimpededa dry area of sedge and indian grass immediately before and around mespace simple unornamented space distant vessels and the faroff just visible trailing smoke of an inward bound steamer more plainly ships brigs schooners in sight most of them with every sail set to the firm and steady wind  the attractions fascinations there are in sea and shore how one dwells on their simplicity even vacuity what is it in us arousd by those indirections and directions that spread of waves and graywhite beach salt monotonous senselesssuch an entire absence of art books talk eleganceso indescribably comforting even this winter daygrim yet so delicatelooking so spiritualstriking emotional impalpable depths subtler than all the poems paintings music i have ever read seen heard yet let me be fair perhaps it is because i have read those poems and heard that music   seashore fancies  even as a boy i had the fancy the wish to write a piece perhaps a poem about the seashorethat suggesting dividing line contact junction the solid marrying the liquidthat curious lurking something as doubtless every objective form finally becomes to the subjective spirit which means far more than its mere first sight grand as that isblending the real and ideal and each made portion of the other hours days in my long island youth and early manhood i haunted the shores of rockaway or coney island or away east to the hamptons or montauk once at the latter place by the old lighthouse nothing but seatossings in sight in every direction as far as the eye could reach i remember well i felt that i must one day write a book expressing this liquid mystic theme afterward i recollect how it came to me that instead of any special lyrical or epical or literary attempt the seashore should be an invisible influence a pervading gauge and tally for me in my composition let me give a hint here to young writers i am not sure but i have unwittingly followd out the same rule with other powers besides sea and shoresavoiding them in the way of any dead set at poetizing them as too big for formal handlingquite satisfied if i could indirectly show that we have met and fused even if only once but enoughthat we have really absorbd each other and understand each other  there is a dream a picture that for years at intervals sometimes quite long ones but surely again in time has come noiselessly up before me and i really believe fiction as it is has enterd largely into my practical lifecertainly into my writings and shaped and colord them it is nothing more or less than a stretch of interminable whitebrown sand hard and smooth and broad with the ocean perpetually grandly rolling in upon it with slowmeasured sweep with rustle and hiss and foam and many a thump as of low bass drums this scene this picture i say has risen before me at times for years sometimes i wake at night and can hear and see it plainly   in memory of thomas paine  spoken at lincoln hall philadelphia sunday jan 28 77 for 140th anniversary of t ps birthday  some thirtyfive years ago in new york city at tammany hall of which place i was then a frequenter i happend to become quite well acquainted with thomas paines perhaps most intimate chum and certainly his later years very frequent companion a remarkably fine old man col fellows who may yet be rememberd by some stray relics of that period and spot if you will allow me i will first give a description of the colonel himself he was tall of military bearing aged about 78 i should think hair white as snow cleanshaved on the face dressd very neatly a tailcoat of blue cloth with metal buttons buff vest pantaloons of drab color and his neck breast and wrists showing the whitest of linen under all circumstances fine manners a good but not profuse talker his wits still fully about him balanced and live and undimmd as ever he kept pretty fair health though so old for employmentfor he was poorhe had a post as constable of some of the upper courts i used to think him very picturesque on the fringe of a crowd holding a tall staff with his erect form and his superb bare thickhaird closelycropt white head the judges and young lawyers with whom he was ever a favorite and the subject of respect used to call him aristides it was the general opinion among them that if manly rectitude and the instincts of absolute justice remaind vital anywhere about new york city hall or tammany they were to be found in col fellows he liked young men and enjoyd to leisurely talk with them over a social glass of toddy after his days work he on these occasions never drank but one glass and it was at reiterated meetings of this kind in old tammanys back parlor of those days that he told me much about thomas paine at one of our interviews he gave me a minute account of paines sickness and death in short from those talks i was and am satisfied that my old friend with his markd advantages had mentally morally and emotionally gauged the author of common sense and besides giving me a good portrait of his appearance and manners had taken the true measure of his interior character  paines practical demeanor and much of his theoretical belief was a mixture of the french and english schools of a century ago and the best of both like most oldfashiond people he drank a glass or two every day but was no tippler nor intemperate let alone being a drunkard he lived simply and economically but quite wellwas always cheery and courteous perhaps occasionally a little blunt having very positive opinions upon politics religion and so forth that he labord well and wisely for the states in the trying period of their parturition and in the seeds of their character there seems to me no question i dare not say how much of what our union is owning and enjoying todayits independenceits ardent belief in and substantial practice of radical human rightsand the severance of its government from all ecclesiastical and superstitious dominioni dare not say how much of all this is owing to thomas paine but i am inclined to think a good portion of it decidedly is  but i was not going either into an analysis or eulogium of the man i wanted to carry you back a generation or two and give you by indirection a moments glanceand also to ventilate a very earnest and i believe authentic opinion nay conviction of that time the fruit of the interviews i have mentiond and of questioning and crossquestioning clenchd by my best information since that thomas paine had a noble personality as exhibited in presence face voice dress manner and what may be calld his atmosphere and magnetism especially the later years of his life i am sure of it of the foul and foolish fictions yet told about the circumstances of his decease the absolute fact is that as he lived a good life after its kind he died calmly and philosophically as became him he served the embryo union with most precious servicea service that every man woman and child in our thirtyeight states is to some extent receiving the benefit of todayand i for one here cheerfully reverently throw my pebble on the cairn of his memory as we all know the season demandsor rather will it ever be out of seasonthat america learn to better dwell on her choicest possession the legacy of her good and faithful menthat she well preserve their fame if unquestiondor if need be that she fail not to dissipate what clouds have intruded on that fame and burnish it newer truer and brighter continually   a

about the open window in the sun  feb 11in the soft rose and pale gold of the declining light this beautiful evening i heard the first hum and preparation of awakening springvery faintwhether in the earth or roots or starting of insects i know notbut it was audible as i leand on a rail i am down in my country quarters awhile and lookd long at the western horizon turning to the east sirius as the

chest my whole body by a tough oak sapling thick as my wrist twelve feet highpulling and pushing inspiring the good air after i wrestle with the tree awhile i can feel its young sap and virtue welling up out of the ground and tingling through me from crown to toe like healths wine then for addition and variety i launch forth in my vocalism shout declamatory pieces sentiments sorrow anger c from the stock poets or playsor inflate my lungs and sing the wild tunes and refrains i heard of the blacks down south or patriotic songs i learnd in the army i make the echoes ring i tell you as the twilight fell in a pause of these ebullitions an owl somewhere the other side of the creek sounded toooooooooo soft and pensive and i fancied a little sarcastic repeated four or five times either to applaud the negro songsor perhaps an ironical comment on the sorrow anger or style of the stock poets   one of the human kinks  how is it that in all the serenity and lonesomeness of solitude away off here amid the hush of the forest alone or as i have found in prairie wilds or mountain stillness one is never entirely without the instinct of looking around i never am and others tell me the same of themselves confidentially for somebody to appear or start up out of the earth or from behind some tree or rock is it a lingering inherited remains of mans primitive wariness from the wild animals or from his savage ancestry far back it is not at all nervousness or fear seems as if something unknown were possibly lurking in those bushes or solitary places nay it is quite certain there issome vital unseen presence   an afternoon scene  feb 22last night and today rainy and thick till midafternoon when the wind choppd round the clouds swiftly drew off like curtains the clear appeard and with it the fairest grandest most wondrous rainbow i ever saw all complete very vivid at its earthends spreading vast effusions of illuminated haze violet yellow drabgreen in all directions overhead through which the sun beamdan indescribable utterance of color and light so gorgeous yet so soft such as i had never witnessd before then its continuance a full hour passd before the last of those earthends disappeard the sky behind was all spread in translucent blue with many little white clouds and edges to these a sunset filling dominating the esthetic and soul senses sumptuously tenderly full i end this note by the pond just light enough to see through the evening shadows the western reflections in its watermirror surface with inverted figures of trees i hear now and then the flup of a pike leaping out and rippling the water   the gates opening  april 6palpable spring indeed or the indications of it i am sitting in bright sunshine at the edge of the creek the surface just rippled by the wind all is solitude morning freshness negligence for companions my two kingfishers sailing winding darting dipping sometimes capriciously separate then flying together i hear their guttural twittering again and again for awhile nothing but that peculiar sound as noon approaches other birds warm up the reedy notes of the robin and a musical passage of two parts one a clear delicious gurgle with several other birds i cannot place to which is joind yes i just hear it one low purr at intervals from some impatient hylas at the pondedge the sibilant murmur of a pretty stiff breeze now and then through the trees then a poor little dead leaf long frostbound whirls from somewhere up aloft in one wild escaped freedomspree in space and sunlight and then dashes down to the waters which hold it closely and soon drown it out of sight the bushes and trees are yet bare but the beeches have their wrinkled yellow leaves of last seasons foliage largely left frequent cedars and pines yet green and the grass not without proofs of coming fullness and over all a wonderfully fine dome of clear blue the play of light coming and going and great fleeces of white clouds swimming so silently

pompous the day may be there is something left in the notday that can outvie it the rarest finest sample of longdrawnout clearobscure from sundown to 9 oclock i went down to the delaware and crossd and crossd venus like blazing silver well up in the west the large pale thin crescent of the new moon half an hour high sinking languidly under a barsinister of cloud and then emerging arcturus right overhead a faint fragrant seaodor wafted up from the south the gloaming the temperd coolness with every feature of the scene indescribably soothing and tonicone of those hours that give hints to the soul impossible to put in a statement ah where would be any food for spirituality without night and the stars the vacant spaciousness of the air and the veild blue of the heavens seemd miracles enough  as the night advancd it changed its spirit and garments to ampler stateliness i was almost conscious of a definite presence nature silently near the great constellation of the waterserpent stretchd its coils over more than half the heavens the swan with outspread wings was flying down the milky way the northern crown the eagle lyra all up there in their places from the whole dome shot down points of light rapport with me through the clear blueblack all the usual sense of motion all animal life seemd discarded seemd a fiction a curious power like the placid rest of egyptian gods took possession none the less potent for being impalpable earlier i had seen many bats balancing in the luminous twilight darting their black forms hither and yon over the river but now they altogether disappeard the evening star and the moon had gone alertness and peace lay camly couching together through the fluid universal shadows  aug 26bright has the day been and my spirits an equal forzando

telescope that mars has certainly one moon perhaps two pale and distant but near in the heavens saturn precedes him   mulleins and mulleins  large placid mulleins as summer advances velvety in texture

the suggestion of everything elseand lately i sometimes think all is concentrated for me in these hardy yellowflowerd weeds as i come down the lane early in the morning i pause before their soft woollike fleece and stem and broad leaves glittering with countless diamonds annually for three summers now they and i have silently returnd together at such long intervals i stand or sit among them

and wood and field two months july and august 77 have i absorbd them and they begin to make a new man of me every day seclusionevery day at least two or three hours of freedom bathing no talk no bonds no dress no books no manners  shall i tell you reader to what i attribute my already muchrestored health that i have been almost two years off and on without drugs and medicines and daily in the open air last summer i found a particularly secluded little dell off one side by my creek originally a large dugout marlpit now abandond filld with bushes trees grass a group of willows a straggling bank and a spring of delicious water running right through the middle of it with two or three little cascades here i retreated every hot day and follow it up this summer here i realize the meaning of that old fellow who said he was seldom less alone than when alone never before did i get so close to nature never before did she come so close to me by old habit i pencilld down from time to time almost automatically moods sights hours tints and outlines on the spot let me specially record the satisfaction of this current forenoon so serene and primitive so conventionally exceptional natural  an hour or so after breakfast i wended my way down to the recesses of the aforesaid dell which i and certain thrushes catbirds c had all to ourselves a light southwest wind was blowing through the treetops it was just the place and time for my adamic airbath and fleshbrushing from head to foot so hanging clothes on a rail near by keeping old broadbrim straw on head and easy shoes on feet havnt i had a good

carrying my portable chair with me from place to place as my range is quite extensive here nearly a hundred rods feeling quite secure from intrusion and that indeed i am not at all nervous about if it accidentally happens  as i walkd slowly over the grass the sun shone out enough to show the shadow moving with me somehow i seemd to get identity with each and every thing around me in its condition nature was naked and i was also it was too lazy soothing and joyousequable to speculate about yet i might have thought somehow in this vein perhaps the inner neverlost rapport we hold with earth light air trees c is not to be realized through eyes and mind only but through the whole corporeal body which i will not have blinded or bandaged any more than the eyes sweet sane still nakedness in natureah if poor sick prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more is not nakedness then indecent no not inherently it is your thought your sophistication your tear your respectability that is indecent there come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear but are themselves indecent perhaps indeed he or she to whom the free exhilarating extasy of nakedness in nature has never been eligible and how many thousands there are has not really known what purity isnor what faith or art or health really is probably the whole curriculum of firstclass philosophy beauty heroism form illustrated by the old hellenic racethe highest height and deepest depth known to civilization in those departmentscame from their natural and religious idea of nakedness  many

it is   the oaks and i  sept 5 77i write this 11 am shelterd under a dense oak by the bank where i have taken refuge from a sudden rain i came down here we had sulky drizzles all the morning but an hour ago a lull for the beforementiond daily and simple exercise i am fond ofto pull on that young hickory sapling out thereto sway and yield to its toughlimber upright stemhaply to get into my old sinews some of its elastic fibre and clear sap i stand on the turf and take these healthpulls moderately and at intervals for nearly an hour inhaling great draughts of fresh air wandering by the creek i have three or four naturally favorable spots where i restbesides a chair i lug with me and use for more deliberate occasions at other spots convenient i have selected besides the hickory just named strong and limber boughs of beech or holly in easyreaching distance for my natural gymnasia for arms chest trunkmuscles i can soon feel the sap and sinew rising through me like mercury to heat i hold on boughs or slender trees caressingly there in the sun and shade wrestle with their innocent stalwartnessand know the virtue thereof passes from them into me or maybe we interchangemaybe the trees are more aware of it all than i ever thought  but now pleasantly imprisond here under the big oakthe rain dripping and the sky coverd with leaden cloudsnothing but the pond on one side and the other a

and alone why would any intrusion even from people i like spoil the charm but am i alone doubtless there comes a timeperhaps it has come to mewhen one feels through his whole being and pronouncedly the emotional part that identity between himself subjectively and nature objectively which schelling and fichte are so fond of pressing how it is i know not but i often realize a presence herein clear moods i am certain of it and neither chemistry nor reasoning nor esthetics will give the least explanation all the past two summers it has been strengthening and nourishing my sick body and soul as

artistically let me give the following three cases from budgets of personal memoranda which i have been turning over alone in my room and resuming and dwelling on this rainy afternoon who is there to whom the theme does not come home then i dont know how it may be to others but to me not only is there nothing gloomy or depressing in such caseson the contrary as reminiscences i find them soothing

monday afternoon his widow mother relatives mates of the fire department and his other friends i was one only lately it is true but our love grew fast and close the days and nights of those eight weeks by the chair of rapid decline and the bed of death gatherd to the funeral of this young man who had grown up and was wellknown here with nothing special perhaps to record i would give a word or two to his memory he seemd to me not an inappropriate specimen in character and elements of that bulk of the average good american race that ebbs and flows perennially beneath this scum of eructations on the surface always very quiet in manner neat in person and dress good temperdpunctual and industrious at his work till he could work no longerhe just lived his steady square unobtrusive life in its own humble sphere doubtless unconscious of itself though i think there were currents of emotion and intellect undevelopd beneath far deeper than his acquaintances ever suspectedor than he himself ever did he was no talker his troubles when he had any he kept to himself as there was nothing querulous about him in life he made no complaints during his last sickness he was one of those persons that while his associates never thought of attributing any particular talent or grace to him yet all insensibly really liked billy alcott  i too loved him at last after being with him quite a good deal after hours and days of panting for breath much of the time unconscious for though the consumption that had been lurking in his system once thoroughly started made rapid progress there was still great vitality in him and indeed for four or five days he lay dying before the close late on wednesday night nov 4th where we surrounded his bed in silence there came a lulla longer drawn breath a pause a faint sighanothera weaker breath another sigh a pause again and just a trembleand the face of the poor wasted young man he was just 26 fell gently over in death on my hand on the pillow  charles

down in my country retreat under an old cedar for two hours i have been idly wandering around the woods and pond lugging my chair picking out choice spots to sit awhilethen up and slowly on again all is peace here of course none of the summer noises or vitality today hardly even the winter ones i amuse myself by exercising my voice in recitations and in ringing the changes on all the vocal and alphabetical sounds not even an echo only the cawing of a solitary crow flying at some distance the pond is one bright flat spread without a ripplea vast claude lorraine glass in which i study the sky the light the leafless trees and an occasional crow with flapping wings flying overhead the brown fields have a few white patches of snow left  feb 9after an hours ramble now retreating resting sitting close by the pond in a warm nook writing this shelterd from the breeze just before noon the emotional aspects and influences of nature i too like the rest feel these modern tendencies from all the prevailing intellections literature and poems to turn everything to pathos ennui morbidity dissatisfaction death yet how clear it is to me that those are not the born results influences of nature at all but of ones own distorted sick or silly soul here amid this wild free scene how healthy how joyous how clean and vigorous and sweet  midafternoonone of my nooks is south of the barn and here i am sitting now on a log still basking in the sun shielded from the wind near me are the cattle feeding on cornstalks occasionally a cow or the young bull how handsome and bold he is scratches and munches the far end of the log on which i sit the fresh milky odor is quite perceptible also the perfume of hay from the barn the perpetual rustle of dry cornstalks the low sough of the wind round the barn gables the grunting of pigs the distant whistle of a locomotive and occasional crowing of chanticleers are the sounds  feb 19cold and sharp last nightclear and not much windthe full moon shining and a fine spread of constellations and little and big starssirius very bright rising early preceded by manyorbd orion glittering vast sworded and chasing with his dog the earth hard frozen and a stiff glare of ice over the pond attracted by the calm splendor of the night i attempted a short walk but was driven back by the cold too severe for me also at 9 oclock when i came out this morning so i turnd back again but now near noon i have walkd down the lane basking all the way in the sun this farm has a pleasant southerly exposure and here i am seated under the lee of a bank close by the water there are bluebirds already flying about and i hear much chirping and twittering and two or three real songs sustaind quite awhile in the midday brilliance and warmth there that is a true carol coming out boldly and repeatedly as if the singer meant it then as the noon strengthens the reedy trill of the robinto my ear the most cheering of birdnotes at intervals like bars and breaks out of the low murmur that in any scene however quiet is never entirely absent to a delicate ear the occasional crunch and cracking of the iceglare congeald over the creek as it gives way to the sunbeamssometimes with low sighsometimes with indignant obstinate tug and snort  robert burns says in one of his letters there is scarcely any earthly object gives me morei do not know if i should call it pleasurebut something which exalts mesomething which enraptures methan to walk in the shelter d side of a wood in a cloudy winter day and hear the stormy wind howling among the trees and raving over the plain it is my best season of devotion some of his most characteristic poems were composed in such scenes and seasons   a meadow lark  march 16fine clear dazzling morning the sun an hour high the air just tart enough what a stamp in advance my whole day receives from the song of that meadow lark perchd on a fencestake twenty rods distant two or three liquidsimple notes repeated at intervals full of careless happiness and hope with its peculiar shimmering slow progress and rapidnoiseless action of the wings it flies on a way lights on another stake and so on to another shimmering and singing many minutes   sundown lights  may 6 5 p mthis is the hour for strange effects in light and shadeenough to make a colorist go deliriouslong spokes of molten silver sent horizontally through the trees now in their brightest tenderest green each leaf and branch of endless foliage a litup miracle then lying all prone on the youthfulripe interminable grass and giving the blades not only aggregate but individual splendor in ways unknown to any other hour i have particular spots where i get these effects in their perfection one broad splash lies on the water with many a rippling twinkle offset by the rapidly deepening blackgreen murkytransparent shadows behind and at intervals all along the banks these with great shafts of horizontal fire thrown among the trees and along the grass as the sun lowers give effects more and more peculiar more and more superb unearthly rich and dazzling   thoughts under an oaka dream  june 2this is the fourth day of a dark northeast storm wind and rain day before yesterday was my birthday i have now enterd on my 60th year every day of the storm protected by overshoes and a waterproof blanket i regularly come down to the pond and ensconce myself under the lee of the great oak i am here now writing these lines the dark smokecolord clouds roll in furious silence athwart the sky the soft green leaves dangle all around me the wind steadily keeps up its hoarse soothing music over my headnatures mighty whisper seated here in solitude i have been musing over my lifeconnecting events dates as links of a chain neither sadly nor cheerily but somehow today here under the oak in the rain in an unusually matteroffact spirit  but my great oaksturdy vital greenfive feet thick at the butt i sit a great deal near or under him then the tulip tree near bythe apollo of the woodstall and graceful yet robust and sinewy inimitable in hang of foliage and throwingout of limb as if the beauteous vital leafy creature could walk if it only would i had a sort of dreamtrance the other day in which i saw my favorite trees step out and promenade up down and around very curiouslywith a whisper from one leaning down as he passd me we do all this on the present occasion exceptionally just for you   clover and hay perfume  july 3d 4th 5thclear hot favorable weatherhas been a good summerthe growth of clover and grass now generally mowd the familiar delicious perfume fills the barns and lanes as you go along you see the fields of grayish white slightly tinged with yellow the loosely stackd grain the slowmoving wagons passing and farmers in the fields with stout boys pitching and loading the sheaves the corn is about beginning to tassel all over the middle and southern states the spearshaped battalia multitudinous curving flauntinglong glossy darkgreen plumes for the great horseman earth i hear the cheery notes of my old acquaintance tommy quail but too late for the whippoorwill though i heard one solitary lingerer night before last i watch the broad majestic flight of a turkeybuzzard sometimes high up sometimes low enough to see the lines of his form even his spread quills in relief against the sky once or twice lately i have seen an eagle here at early candlelight flying low   an unknown  june 15today i noticed a new large bird size of a nearly grown hena haughty whitebodied darkwingd hawki suppose a hawk from his bill and general lookonly he had a clear loud quite musical sort of belllike call which he repeated again and again at intervals from a lofty dead treetop overhanging the water sat there a long time and i on the opposite bank watching him then he darted down skimming pretty close to the streamrose slowly a magnificent sight and saild with steady widespread wings no flapping at all up and down the pond two or three times near me in circles in clear sight as if for my delectation once he came quite close over my head i saw plainly his hookd bill and hard restless eyes   birdwhistling  how much music wild simple savage doubtless but so tartsweet there is in mere whistling it is fourfifths of the utterance of birds there are all sorts and styles for the last halfhour now while i have been sitting here some featherd fellow away off in the bushes has been repeating over and over again what i may call a kind of throbbing whistle and now a bird about the robin size has just appeard all mulberry red flitting among the busheshead wings body deep red not very brightno song as i have heard 4 oclock there is a real concert going on around mea dozen different birds pitching in with a will there have been occasional rains and the growths all show its vivifying influences as i finish this seated on a log close by the pondedge much chirping and trilling in the distance and a featherd recluse in the woods near by is singing deliciouslynot many notes but full of music of almost human sympathycontinuing for a long long while   horsemint  aug 22not a human being and hardly the evidence of one in sight after my brief semidaily bath i sit here for a bit the brook musically brawling to the chromatic tones of a fretful catbird somewhere off in the bushes on my walk hither two hours since through fields and the old lane i stopt to view now the sky now the mileoff woods on the hill and now the apple orchards what a contrast from new yorks or philadelphias streets everywhere great patches of dingyblossomd horsemint wafting a spicy odor through the air especially evenings everywhere the flowering boneset and the rosebloom of the wild bean   three of us  july 14my two kingfishers still haunt the pond in the bright sun and breeze and perfect temperature of today noon i am sitting here by one of the gurgling brooks dipping a french waterpen in the limpid crystal and using it to write these lines again watching the featherd twain as they fly and sport athwart the water so close almost touching into its surface indeed there seem to be three of us for nearly an hour i indolently look and join them while they dart and turn and take their airy gambols sometimes far up the creek disappearing for a few moments and then surely returning again and performing most of their flight within sight of me as if they knew i appreciated and absorbd their vitality spirituality faithfulness and the rapid vanishing delicate lines of moving yet quiet electricity they draw for me across the spread of the grass the trees and the blue sky while the brook babbles babbles and the shadows of the boughs dapple in the sunshine around me and the cool westbynorwest wind faintly soughs in the thick bushes and tree tops  among the objects of beauty and interest now beginning to appear quite plentifully in this secluded spot i notice the hummingbird the dragonfly with its wings of slatecolord guaze and many varieties of beautiful and plain butterflies idly flapping among the plants and wild posies the mullein has shot up out of its nest of broad leaves to a tall stalk towering sometimes five or six feet high now studded with knobs of golden blossoms the milkweed i see a great gorgeous creature of gamboge and black lighting on one as i write is in flower with its delicate red fringe and there are profuse clusters of a feathery blossom waving in the wind on taper stems i see lots of these and much else in every direction as i saunter or sit for the last half hour a bird has persistently kept up a simple sweet melodious song from the bushes i have a positive conviction that some of these birds sing and others fly and flirt about here

bryant over thirty years ago and he had been markedly kind to me off and on along that time for years as they passd we met and chatted together i thought him very sociable in his way and a man to become attachd to we were both walkers and when i workd in brooklyn he several times came over middle of afternoons and we took rambles miles long till dark out towards bedford or flatbush in company

tradethe man seated on a low board in front drivingthe gauntish woman by his side with a baby well bundled in her arms its little red feet and lower legs sticking out right towards us as we passdand in the wagon behind we saw two or three crouching little children it was a queer taking rather sad picture if i had been alone and on foot i should have stoppd and held confab but on our return nearly two hours afterward we found them a ways further along the same road in a lonesome open spot hauld aside unhitchd and evidently going to camp for the night the freed horse was not far off quietly cropping the grass the man was busy at the wagon the boy had gatherd some dry wood and was making a fireand as we went a little further we met the woman afoot i could not see her face in its great sunbonnet but somehow her figure and gait told misery terror destitution she had the ragbundled halfstarvd infant still in her arms and in her hands held two or three baskets which she had evidently taken to the next house for sale a little barefoot fiveyear old girlchild with fine eyes trotted behind her clutching her gown we stoppd asking about the baskets which we bought as we paid the money she kept her face hidden in the recesses of her bonnet then as we started and stoppd again al whose sympathies were evidently arousd went back to the camping group to get another basket he caught a

clouds suddenly rose seemingly from different points and sweeping with broad swirls of wind but no thunder underspread the orbs from view everywhere and indicated a violent heatstorm but without storm clouds blackness and all sped and vanishd as suddenly as they had risen and from a little after 9 till 11 the atmosphere and the whole show above were in that state of exceptional clearness and glory

while dominating majestic jupiter swam an hour and a half risen in the eastno moon till after 11 a large part of the sky seemd just laid in great splashes of phosphorus you could look deeper in farther through than usual the orbs thick as heads of wheat in a field not that there was any special brilliancy eithernothing near as sharp as i have seen of keen winter nights but a curious general luminousness throughout to sight sense and soul the latter had much to do with it i am convinced there are hours of nature especially of the atmosphere mornings and evenings addressd to the soul night transcends for that purpose what the proudest day can do now indeed if never before the heavens declared the glory of god it was to the full sky of the bible of arabia of the prophets and of the

or reminder which no poem or literature has yet caught in very old and primitive ballads i have come across lines or asides that suggest it after a while the clouds mostly cleard and as the moon swam

the crows i always watch them from the boats they play quite a part in the winter scenes on the river by day their black splatches are seen in relief against the snow and ice everywhere at that seasonsometimes flying and flappingsometimes on little or larger cakes sailing up or down the stream one day the river was mostly clearonly a single long ridge of broken ice making a narrow stripe by

yet something haughty almost supercilious in the night never did i realize more latent sentiment almost passion in those silent interminable stars up there one can understand such a night why from the days of the pharaohs or job the dome of heaven sprinkled with planets has supplied the subtlest deepest criticism on human pride glory ambition  another winter nighti dont know anything more filling than to be on the wide firm deck of a powerful boat a clear cool extramoonlight night crushing proudly and resistlessly through this thick marbly glistening ice the whole river is now spread with it some immense cakes there is such weirdness about the scenepartly the quality of the light with its tinge of blue the lunar twilight only the large stars holding their own in the radiance of the moon

anotherfor two hours i crossd and recrossd merely for pleasurefor a still excitement both sky and river went through several changes the first for awhile held two vast fanshaped echelons of light clouds through which the moon waded now radiating carrying with her an aureole of tawny transparent brown and now flooding the whole vast with clear vapory lightgreen through which as through an illuminated veil she moved with measurd womanly motion then another trip the heavens would be absolutely clear and luna in all her effulgence the big dipper in the north with the double star in the

sundown the song of the woodthrush we stoppd without a word and listend long the delicious notesa sweet artless voluntary simple anthem as from the flutestops of some organ wafted through the twilightechoing well to us from the perpendicular high rock where in some thick young trees recesses at the base sat the bird filld our senses our souls   meeting a hermit  i found in one of my rambles up the hills a real hermit living in a lonesome spot hard to get at rocky the view fine with a little patch of land two rods square a man of youngish middle age city born and raised had been to school had traveld in europe and california i first met him once or twice on the road and passd the time of day with some small talk then the third time he askd me to go along a bit and rest in his hut an almost unprecedented compliment as i heard from others afterwards he was of quaker stock i think talkd with ease and moderate freedom but did not unbosom his life or story or tragedy or

medal  as i saunterd along the high road yesterday i stoppd to watch a man near by ploughing a rough stony field with a yoke of oxen usually there is much geeing and hawing excitement and continual noise and expletives about a job of this kind but i noticed how different how easy and wordless yet firm and sufficient the work of this young ploughman his name was walter dumont a farmer and son of a farmer working for their living three years ago when the steamer sunnyside was wreckd of a bitter icy night on the west bank here walter went out in his boatwas the first man on hand with assistancemade a way through the ice to shore connected a line performd work of firstclass readiness daring danger and saved numerous lives some weeks after one evening when he was up at esopus among the usual loafing crowd at the country store and postoffice there arrived the gift of an unexpected official gold medal for the quiet hero the impromptu presentation was made to him on the spot but he blushd hesitated as he took it and had nothing to say   hudson river sights  it was a happy thought to build the hudson river railroad right along the shore the grade is already made by nature you are sure of ventilation one sideand you are in nobodys way i see hear the locomotives and cars rumbling roaring flaming smoking constantly away off there night and dayless than a mile distant and in full view by day i like both sight and sound express trains thunder and lighten along of freight trains most of them very long there cannot be less than a hundred a day at night far down you see the headlight approaching coming steadily on like a meteor the river at night has its special characterbeauties the shad fishermen go forth in their boats and pay out their netsone sitting forward rowing and one standing up aft dropping it properlymarking the line with little floats bearing candles conveying as they glide over the water an indescribable sentiment and doubled brightness i like to watch the tows at night too with their twinkling lamps and hear the husky panting of the steamers or catch the sloops and schooners shadowy forms like phantoms white silent indefinite out there then the hudson of a clear moonlight night  but there is one sight the very grandest sometimes in the fiercest driving storm of wind rain hail or snow a great eagle will appear over the river now soaring with steady and now overbended wings always confronting the gale or perhaps cleaving into or at times literally sitting upon it it is like reading some firstclass natural tragedy or epic or hearing martial trumpets the splendid bird enjoys the hubbubis adjusted and equal to itfinishes it so artistically his pinions just oscillatingthe position of his head and neckhis resistless occasionally varied flightnow a swirl now an upward movementthe black clouds drivingthe angry wash belowthe hiss of rain the winds piping perhaps the ice colliding gruntinghe tacking or jibingnow as it were for a change abandoning himself to the gale moving with it with such velocityand now resuming control he comes up against it lord of the situation and the stormlord amid it of power and savage joy  sometimes as at present writing middle of sunny afternoon the old vanderbilt steamer stalking aheadi plainly hear her rhythmic slushing paddlesdrawing by long hawsers an immense and varied following string an old sow

79perhaps no quarters of this city i have returnd again for awhile make more brilliant animated crowded spectacular human presentations these fine may afternoons than the two i am now going to describe from personal observation first that area comprising fourteenth street especially the short range between broadway and fifth avenue with union square its adjacencies and so retrostretching down broadway for half a mile all the walks here are wide and the spaces ample and freenow flooded with liquid gold from the last two hours of powerful sunshine the whole area at 5 oclock the days of my observations must have containd from thirty to forty thousand finelydressd people all in motion plenty of them goodlooking many beautiful women often youths and children the latter in groups with their nursesthe trottoirs everywhere closespread thicktangled yet no collision no trouble with masses of bright color action and tasty toilets surely the women dress better than ever before and the men do too as if new york would show these afternoons what it can do in its humanity its choicest physique and physiognomy and its countless prodigality of locomotion dry goods glitter magnetism and happiness  second also from 5 to 7 pm the stretch of fifth avenue all the way from the central park exits at fiftyninth street down to fourteenth especially along the high grade by fortieth street and down the hill a mississippi of horses and rich vehicles not by dozens and scores but hundreds and thousandsthe broad avenue filled and crammd with thema moving sparkling hurrying crush for more than two miles i wonder they dont get blockd but i believe they never do altogether it is to me the marvel sight of new york i like to get in one of the fifth avenue stages and ride up stemming the swiftmoving procession i doubt if london or paris or any city in the world can show such a carriage carnival as i have seen here five or six times these beautiful may afternoons   central park walks and talks  may 16 to 22i visit central park now almost every day sitting or slowly rambling or riding around the whole place presents its very best appearance this current monththe full flush of the trees the plentiful white and pink of the flowering shrubs the emerald green of the grass spreading everywhere yellow dotted still with dandelions the specialty of the plentiful gray rocks peculiar to these grounds cropping out miles and milesand over all the beauty and purity three days out of four of our summer skies as i sit placidly early afternoon off against ninetieth street the policeman c c a wellformd sandycomplexiond young fellow comes over and stands near me we grow quite friendly and chatty forthwith he is a new yorker born and raised and in answer to my questions tells me about the life of a new york park policeman while he talks keeping his eyes and ears vigilantly open occasionally pausing and moving where he can get full views of the vistas of the road up and down and the spaces around the pay is 240 a day seven days to a weekthe men come on and work eight hours straight ahead which is all that is required of them out of the twentyfour the position has more risks than one might supposefor instance if a team or horse runs away which happens daily each man is expected not only to be prompt but to waive safety and stop wildest nag or nagsdo it and dont be thinking of your bones or facegive the alarmwhistle too so that other guards may repeat and the vehicles up and down the tracks be warnd injuries to the men are continually happening there is much alertness and quiet strength few appreciate i have often thought the ulyssean capacity derring do quick readiness in emergencies practicality unwitting devotion and heroism among our american young men and workingpeoplethe firemen the railroad employes the steamer and ferry men the police the conductors and driversthe whole splendid average of native stock city and country it is good work though and upon the whole the park force members like it they see life and the excitement keeps them up there is not so much difficulty as might be supposed from tramps roughs or in keeping people off the grass the worst trouble of the regular park employe is from malarial fever chills and the like   a fine afternoon 4 to 6  ten thousand vehicles careering through the park this perfect afternoon such a show and i have seen allwatchd it narrowly and at my leisure private barouches cabs and coupes some fine horsefleshlapdogs footmen fashions foreigners cockades on hats crests on panelsthe full oceanic tide of new yorks wealth and gentility it was an impressive rich interminable circus on a grand scale full of action and color in the beauty of the day under the clear sun and moderate breeze family groups couples single driversof course dresses generally elegantmuch style yet perhaps little or nothing even in that direction that fully justified itself through the windows of two or three of the richest carriages i saw faces almost corpselike so ashy and listless indeed the whole affair exhibited less of sterling america either in spirit or countenance than i had counted on from such a select massspectacle i suppose as a proof of limitless wealth leisure and the aforesaid gentility it was tremendous yet what i saw those hours i took two other occasions two other afternoons to watch the same scene confirms a thought that haunts me every additional glimpse i get of our toploftical general or rather exceptional phases of wealth and fashion in this countrynamely that they are ill at ease much too conscious cased in too many cerements and far from happythat there is nothing in them which we who are poor and plain need at all envy and that instead of the perennial smell of the grass and woods and shores their typical redolence is of soaps and essences very rare may be but suggesting the barber shopsomething that turns stale and musty in a few hours anyhow  perhaps the show on the horseback road was prettiest many groups threes a favorite number some couples some singlymany ladiesfrequently horses or parties dashing along on a full runfine riding the rulea few really firstclass animals as the afternoon waned the wheeld carriages grew less but the saddleriders seemed to increase they lingerd longand i saw some charming forms and faces   departing of the big steamers  may 25a three hours baytrip from 12 to 3 this afternoon accompanying the city of brussels down as far as the narrows in behoof of some europebound friends to give them a good send off our spirited little tug the seth low kept close to the great black brussels sometimes one side sometimes the other always up to her or even pressing ahead like the blooded pony accompanying the royal elephant the whole affair from the first was an animated quickpassing characteristic new york scene the large goodlooking welldressd crowd on the wharfendmen and women come to see their friends depart and bid them godspeedthe ships sides swarming with passengersgroups of bronzefaced sailors with uniform d officers at their poststhe quiet directions as she quickly unfastens and moves out prompt to a minutethe emotional faces adieus and fluttering handkerchiefs and many smiles and some tears on the wharfthe answering faces smiles tears and fluttering handkerchiefs from the shipwhat can be subtler and finer than this play of faces on such occasions in these responding crowdswhat go more to ones heartthe proud steady noiseless cleaving of the grand oceaner down the baywe speeding by her side a few miles and then turning wheelingamid a babel of wild hurrahs shouted partings earsplitting steam whistles kissing of hands and waving of handkerchiefs  this departing of the big steamers noons or afternoonsthere is no better medicine when one is listless or vapory i am fond of going down wednesdays and saturdaystheir more special daysto watch them and the crowds on the wharves the arriving passengers the general bustle and activity the eager looks from the faces the cleartoned voices a traveld foreigner a musician told me the other day she thinks an american crowd has the finest voices in the world the whole look of the great shapely black ships themselves and their groups and lined sidesin the setting of our bay with the blue sky overhead two days after the above i saw the britannic the donau the helvetia and the schiedam steam out all off for europea magnificent sight   two hours on the minnesota  from 7 to 9 aboard the united states schoolship minnesota lying up the

gundeck were gatherd nearly a hundred of the boys to give us some of their singing exercises with a melodeon accompaniment playd by one of their number they sang with a will the best part however was the sight of the young fellows themselves i went over among them before the singing began and talkd a few minutes informally they are from all the states i asked for the southerners but could only find one a lad from baltimore in age apparently they range from about fourteen years to nineteen or twenty they are all of american birth and have to pass a rigid medical examination wellgrown youths good flesh bright eyes looking straight at you healthy intelligent not a slouch among them nor a menialin every one the promise of a man i have been to many public aggregations of young and old and of

buildingto sighting a shadowd figure or group or couple of lovers every now and then passing some near or farther aislei abandond myself for over an hour  returning home riding down market street in an open summer car something detaind us between fifteenth and broad and i got out to view better the new threefifthsbuilt marble edifice the city hall of magnificent proportionsa majestic and lovely

magnificent pile impress one as it impressd me those fifteen minutes  tonight since i have been long on the river i watch the cshaped northern crown with the star alshacca that blazed out so suddenly alarmingly one night a few years ago the moon in her third quarter and up nearly all night and there as i look eastward my longabsent pleiades welcome again to sight for an hour i enjoy the soothing and vital scene to the low splash of wavesnew stars steadily noiselessly rising in the east  as i cross the delaware one of the deckhands f r tells me how a woman jumpd overboard and was drownd a couple of hours since it happend in midchannelshe leapd from the forward part of the boat which went over her he saw her rise on the other side in the swift running water throw her arms and closed hands high up white hands and bare forearms in the moonlight like a flash and then she sank i found out afterwards that this young fellow had promptly jumpd in swam after the poor creature and made though unsuccessfully the bravest efforts to rescue her but he didnt mention that part at all in telling me the story   swallows on the river  sept 3cloudy and wet and wind due east air without palpable fog but very heavy with moisturewelcome for a change forenoon crossing the delaware i noticed unusual numbers of swallows in flight circling darting graceful beyond description close to the water thick around the bows of the ferryboat as she lay tied in her slip they flew and as we went out i watchd beyond the pierheads and across the broad stream their swiftwinding loopribands of motion down close to it cutting and intersecting though i had seen swallows all my life seemd as though i never before realized their peculiar beauty and character in the landscape some time ago for an hour

dec 79 i made quite a western journey fetching up at denver colorado and penetrating the rocky mountain region enough to get a good notion of it all left west philadelphia after 9 oclock one night middle of september in a comfortable sleeper oblivious of the two or three hundred miles across pennsylvania at pittsburgh in the morning to breakfast pretty good view of the city and birminghamfog and damp smoke cokefurnaces flames discolord wooden houses and vast collections of coalbarges presently a bit of fine region west virginia the panhandle and crossing the river the ohio by day through the latter statethen indianaand so rockd to slumber for a second night flying like lightning through illinois   in the sleeper  what a fierce weird pleasure to lie in my berth at night in the luxurious palacecar drawn by the mighty baldwinembodying and filling me too full of the swiftest motion and most resistless strength it is late perhaps midnight or afterdistances joind like magicas we speed through harrisburg columbus indianapolis the element of danger adds zest to it all on we go rumbling and flashing with our loud whinnies thrown out from time to time or trumpetblasts into the

childrenas on on on we fly like lightning through the nighthow strangely sound and sweet they sleep they say the french voltaire in his time designated the grand opera and a ship of war the most signal illustrations of the growth of humanitys and arts advance beyond primitive barbarism perhaps if the witty philosopher were here these days and went in the same car with perfect bedding and feed from new york to san francisco he would shift his type and sample to one of our american sleepers   missouri state  we should have made the run of 960 miles from philadelphia to st louis in thirtysix hours but we had a collision and bad locomotive smash about twothirds of the way which set us back so merely stopping over night that time in st louis i sped on westward as i crossd missouri state the whole distance by the st louis and kansas city northern railroad a fine early autumn day i thought my eyes had never looked on scenes of greater pastoral beauty for over two hundred miles successive rolling prairies agriculturally perfect viewd by pennsylvania and new jersey eyes and dotted here and there with fine timber yet fine as the land is it isnt the finest portion there is a bed of impervious clay and hardpan beneath this section that holds water too firmly drowns the land in wet weather and bakes it in dry as a cynical farmer told me south are some richer tracts though perhaps the beautyspots of the state are the northwestern counties altogether i am clear now and from what i have seen and learnd since that missouri in climate soil relative situation wheat grass mines railroads and every important materialistic respect stands in the front rank of the union of missouri averaged politically and socially i have heard all sorts of talk some pretty severebut i should have no fear myself of getting along safely and comfortably anywhere among the missourians they raise a good deal of tobacco you see at this time quantities of the light greenishgray leaves pulled and hanging out to dry on temporary frameworks or rows of sticks looks much like the mullein familiar to eastern eyes   lawrence and topeka kansas  we thought of stopping in kansas city but when we got there we found a train ready and a crowd of hospitable kansians to take us on to lawrence to which i proceeded i shall not soon forget my good days in l in company with judge usher and his sons especially john and linton true westerners of the noblest type nor the similar days in topeka nor the brotherly kindness of my rr friends there and the city and state officials lawrence and topeka are large bustling halfrural handsome cities i took two or three long drives about the latter drawn by a spirited team over smooth roads   the prairies and an undeliverd speech  at a large popular meeting at topekathe kansas state silver wedding fifteen or twenty thousand peoplei had been erroneously billd to deliver a poem as i seemd to be made much of and wanted to be goodnatured i hastily pencilld out the following little speech unfortunately or fortunately i had such a good time and rest and talk and dinner with the u boys that i let the hours slip away and didnt drive over to the meeting and speak my piece but here it is just the same  my friends your bills announce me as giving a poem but i have no poemhave composed none for this occasion and i can honestly say i am now glad of it under these skies resplendent in september beautyamid the peculiar landscape you are used to but which is new to methese interminable and stately prairiesin the freedom and vigor and sane enthusiasm of this perfect western air and autumn sunshineit seems to me a poem would be almost an impertinence but if you care to have a word from me i should speak it about these very prairies they impress me most of all the objective shows i see or have seen on this my first real visit to the west as i have rolld rapidly hither for more than a thousand miles through fair ohio through breadraising indiana and illinoisthrough ample missouri that contains and raises everything as i have partially explord your charming city during the last two days and standing on oread hill by the university have launchd my view across broad expanses of living green in every directioni have again been most impressd i say and shall remain for the rest of my life most impressd with that feature of the topography of your western central worldthat vast something stretching out on its own unbounded scale unconfined which there is in these prairies combining the real and ideal and beautiful as dreams  i wonder indeed if the people of this continental inland west know how much of firstclass art they have in these prairieshow original and all your ownhow much of the influences of a character for your future humanity broad patriotic heroic and new how entirely they tally on land the grandeur and superb monotony of the skies of heaven and the ocean with its waters how freeing soothing nourishing they are to the soul  then is it not subtly they who have given us our leading modern americans lincoln and grantvastspread average mentheir foregrounds of character altogether practical and real yet to those who have eyes to see with finest backgrounds of the ideal towering high as any and do we not see in them foreshadowings of the future races that shall fill these prairies  not but what the yankee and

will come including canada entireare equally and integrally and indissolubly this nation the sine qua non of the human political and commercial new world but this favord central area of in round numbers two thousand miles square seems fated to be the home both of what i would call americas distinctive ideas and distinctive realities   on to denvera frontier incident  the jaunt of five or six hundred miles from topeka to denver took me through a variety of country but all unmistakably prolific western american and on the largest scale for a long distance we follow the line of the kansas river i like better the old name kaw a stretch of very rich dark soil famed for its wheat and calld the golden beltthen plains and plains hour after hourellsworth county the centre of the statewhere i

hang him  in due time we reach denver which city i fall in love with from the first and have that feeling confirmd the longer i stay there one of my pleasantest days was a jaunt via platte canon to leadville   an hour on kenosha summit  jottings from the rocky mountains mostly pencilld during a days trip over the south park rr returning from leadville and especially the hour we were detaind much to my satisfaction at kenosha summit as afternoon advances novelties farreaching splendors accumulate under the bright sun in this pure air but i had better commence with the day  the confronting of

ether now sinking low and coming quite near and then up again in statelylanguid circlesthen higher higher slanting to the north and gradually out of sight   americas backbone  i jot these lines literally at kenosha summit where we return afternoon and take a long rest 10000 feet above sealevel at this immense height the south park stretches fifty miles before me mountainous chains and peaks in every variety of perspective every hue of vista fringe the view in nearer or middle or fardim distance or fade on the horizon we have now reachd penetrated the rockies hayden calls it the front range for a hundred miles or so and though these chains spread away in every direction specially north and south thousands and thousands farther i have seen specimens of the utmost of them and know henceforth at least what they are and what they look like not themselves alone for they typify stretches and areas of half the globeare in fact the vertebrae or backbone of our hemisphere as the anatomists say a man is only a spine toppd footed breasted and radiated so the whole western world is in a sense but an expansion of these mountains in south america they are the andes in central america and mexico the cordilleras and in our states they go under different namesin california the coast and cascade rangesthence more eastwardly the sierra nevadasbut mainly and more centrally here the rocky mountains proper with many an elevation such as lincolns greys harvards yales longs and pikes peaks all over 14000 feet high east the highest peaks of the alleghanies the adirondacks the catskills and the white mountains range from 2000 to 5500 feetonly mount washington in the latter 6300 feet   the parks  in the midst of all here lie such beautiful contrasts as the sunken basins of the north middle and south parks the latter i am now on one side of and overlooking each the size of a large level almost quandrangular grassy western county walld in by walls of hills and each park the source of a river the ones i specify are the largest in colorado but the whole of that state and of wyoming utah nevada and western california through their sierras and ravines are copiously markd by similar spreads and openings many of the small ones of paradisiac loveliness and perfection with their offsets of mountains streams atmosphere and hues beyond compare   art features  talk i say again of going to europe of visiting the ruins of feudal castles or coliseum remains or kings palaceswhen you can come here the alternations one gets too after the illinois and kansas prairies of a thousand milessmooth and easy areas of the corn and wheat of ten million democratic farms in the futurehere start up in every conceivable presentation of shape these nonutilitarian piles coping the skies emanating a beauty terror power more than dante or angelo ever knew yes i think the chyle of not only poetry and painting but oratory and even the metaphysics and music fit for the new world before being finally assimilated need first and feeding visits here  mountain streamsthe spiritual contrast and etheriality of the whole region consist largely to me in its neverabsent peculiar streamsthe snows of inaccessible upper areas melting and running down through the gorges continually nothing like the water of pastoral plains or creeks with wooded banks and turf or anything of the kind elsewhere the shapes that element takes in the shows of the globe cannot be fully understood by an artist until he has studied these unique rivulets  aerial effectsbut perhaps as i gaze around me the rarest sight of all is in atmospheric hues the prairiesas i crossd them in my journey hitherand these mountains and parks seem to me to afford new lights and shades everywhere the aerial gradations and skyeffects inimitable nowhere else such perspectives such transparent lilacs and grays i can conceive of some superior landscape painter some fine colorist after sketching awhile out here discarding all his previous work delightful to stock exhibition amateurs as muddy raw and artificial near ones eye ranges an infinite variety high up the bare whiteybrown above timber line in

the patches of snow   denver impressions  through the longlingering halflight of the most superb of evenings we returnd to denver where i staid several days leisurely exploring receiving impressions with which i may as well taper off this memorandum itemizing what i saw there the best was the men threefourths of them large able calm alert american and cash why they create it here out in the smelting works the biggest and most improvd ones for the precious metals in the world i saw long rows of vats pans coverd by bubblingboiling water and filld with pure silver four or five inches thick many thousand dollars worth in a pan the foreman who was showing me shoveld it carelessly up with a little wooden shovel as one might toss beans then large silver bricks worth 2000 a brick dozens of piles twenty in a pile in one place in the mountains at a mining camp i had a few days before seen rough bullion on the ground in the open air like the confectioners pyramids at some swell dinner in new york such a sweet morsel to roll over with a poor authors pen and inkand appropriate to slip in herethat the silver product of colorado and utah with the gold product of california new mexico

others particularly finesome with tall storehouses of stone or iron and windows of plateglassall the streets with little canals of mountain water running along the sidesplenty of people business modernnessyet not without a certain racy wild smack all its own a place of fast horses many mares with their colts and i saw lots of big greyhounds for antelope hunting now and then groups of miners some just come in some starting out very picturesque  one of the papers here interviewd me and reported me as saying offhand i have lived in or visited all the great cities on the atlantic third of the republicboston brooklyn with its hills new orleans baltimore stately washington broad philadelphia teeming cincinnati and chicago and for thirty years in that wonder washd by hurried and glittering tides my own new york not only the new worlds but the worlds citybut newcomer to denver as i am and threading its streets breathing its air warmd by its sunshine and having what there is of its human as well as aerial ozone flashd upon me now for only three or four days i am very much like a man feels sometimes toward certain people he meets with and warms to and hardly knows why i too can hardly tell why but as i enterd the city in the slight haze of a late september afternoon and have breathd its air and slept well o nights and have roamd or rode leisurely and watchd the comers and goers at the hotels and absorbd the climatic magnetism of this curiously attractive region there has steadily grown upon me a feeling of affection for the spot which sudden as it is has become so definite and strong that i must put it on record  so much for my feeling toward the queen city of the plains and peaks where she sits in her delicious rare atmosphere over 5000 feet above sealevel irrigated by mountain streams one way looking east over the prairies for a thousand miles and having the other westward in constant view by day draped in their violet haze mountain tops innumerable yes i fell in love with denver and even felt a wish to spend my declining and dying days there   i turn south and then east again  leave denver at 8 am by the rio grande rr going south mountains

thought and feeling while i know the standard claim is that yosemite niagara falls the upper yellowstone and the like afford the greatest natural shows i am not so sure but the prairies and the plains while less stunning at first sight last longer fill the esthetic sense fuller precede all the rest and make north americas characteristic landscape  indeed through the whole of this journey with all its shows and varieties what most impressd me and will longest remain with me are these same prairies day after day and night after night to my eyes to all my sensesthe esthetic one most of allthey silently and broadly unfolded even their simplest statistics are sublime   earths most important stream  the valley of the mississippi river and its tributaries this stream and its adjuncts involve a big part of the question comprehends more than twelve hundred thousand square miles the greater part prairies it is by far the most important stream on the globe and would seem to have been marked out by design slowflowing from north to south through a dozen climates all fitted for mans healthy occupancy its outlet unfrozen all the year and its line forming a safe cheap continental avenue for commerce and passage from the north temperate to the torrid zone not even the mighty amazon though larger in volume on its line of east and westnot the nile in africa nor the danube in europe nor the three great rivers of china compare with it only the mediterranean sea has playd some such part in history and all through the past as the mississippi is destined to play in the future by its demesnes waterd and welded by its branches the missouri the ohio the arkansas the red the yazoo the st francis and others it already compacts twentyfive millions of people not merely the most peaceful and moneymaking but the most restless and warlike on earth its valley or reach is rapidly concentrating the political power of the american union one almost thinks it is the unionor soon will be take it out with its radiations and what would be left from the car windows through indiana illinois missouri or stopping some days along the topeka and santa fe road in southern kansas and indeed wherever i went hundreds and thousands of miles through this region my eyes feasted on primitive and rich meadows some of them partially inhabited but far immensely far more untouchd unbrokenand much of it more lovely and fertile in its unploughd innocence than the fair and valuable fields of new yorks pennsylvanias marylands or virginias richest farms   prairie analogiesthe tree question  the word prairie is french and means literally meadow the cosmical analogies of our north american plains are the steppes of asia the pampas and llanos of south america and perhaps the saharas of africa some think the plains have been originally lakebeds others attribute the absence of forests to the fires that almost annually sweep over themthe cause in vulgar estimation of indian summer the tree question will soon become a grave one although the atlantic slope the rocky mountain region and the southern portion of the mississippi valley are well wooded there are here stretches of hundreds and thousands of miles where either not a tree grows or often useless destruction has prevaild and the matter of the cultivation and spread of forests may well be pressd upon thinkers who look to the coming generations of the prairie states   mississippi valley literature  lying by one rainy day in missouri to rest after quite a long explorationfirst trying a big volume i found there of milton young gray beattie and collins but giving it up for a bad jobenjoying however for awhile as often before the reading of walter scotts poems lay of the last minstrel marmion and so oni stoppd and laid down the book and ponderd the thought of a poetry that should in due time express and supply the teeming region i was in the midst of and have briefly touchd upon ones mind needs but a moments deliberation anywhere in the united states to see clearly enough that all the prevalent book and library poets either as imported from great britain or followd and doppelgangd here are foreign to our states copiously as they are read by us all but to fully understand not only how absolutely in opposition to our times and lands and how little and crampd and what anachronisms and absurdities many of their pages are for american purposes one must dwell or travel awhile in missouri kansas and colorado and get rapport with their people and country  will the day ever comeno matter how long deferrdwhen those models and layfigures from the british islandsand even the precious traditions of the classicswill be reminiscences studies only the pure breath primitiveness boundless prodigality and amplitude strange mixture of delicacy and power of continence of real and ideal and of all original and firstclass elements of these prairies the rocky mountains and of the mississippi and missouri riverswill they ever appear in and in some sort form a standard for our poetry and art i sometimes think that even the ambition of my friend joaquin miller to put them in and illustrate them places him ahead of the whole crowd  not long ago i was down new york bay on a steamer watching the sunset over the dark green heights of navesink and viewing all that inimitable spread of shore shipping and sea around sandy hook but an intervening week or two and my eyes catch the shadowy outlines of the spanish peaks in the more than two thousand miles between though of infinite and paradoxical variety a curious and absolute fusion is doubtless steadily annealing compacting identifying all but subtler and wider and more solid to produce such compaction than the laws of the states or the common ground of congress or the supreme court or the grim welding of our national wars or the steel ties of railroads or all the kneading and fusing processes of our material and business history past or present would in my opinion be a great throbbing vital imaginative work or series of works or literature in constructing which the plains the prairies and the mississippi river with the demesnes of its varied and ample valley should be the concrete background and americas humanity passions struggles hopes there and nowan eclaircissement as it is and is to be on the stage of the new world of all times hitherto drama of war romance and evolutionshould furnish the lambent fire the ideal   an interviewers item  oct 17 79today one of the newspapers of st louis prints the following informal remarks of mine on american especially western literature we called on mr whitman yesterday and after a somewhat desultory conversation abruptly asked him do you think we are to have a distinctively american literature it seems to me said hethat our work at present is to lay the foundations of a great nation in products in agriculture in commerce in networks of intercommunication and in all that relates to the comforts of vast masses of men and families with freedom of speech ecclesiasticism c these we have founded and are carrying out on a grander scale than ever hitherto and ohio illinois indiana missouri kansas and colorado seem to me to be the seat and field of these very facts and ideas materialistic prosperity in all its varied forms with those other points that i mentioned intercommunication and freedom are first to be attended to when those have their results and get settled then a literature worthy of us will begin to be defined our american superiority and vitality are in the bulk of our people not in a gentry like the old world the greatness of our army during the secession war was in the rank and file and so with the nation other lands have their vitality in a few a class but we have it in the bulk of the people our leading men are not of much account and never have been but the average of the people is immense beyond all history sometimes i think in all departments literature and art included that will be the way our superiority will exhibit itself we will not have great individuals or great leaders but a great average bulk unprecedentedly great   the women of the west  kansas cityi am not so well satisfied with what i see of the women of the prairie cities i am writing this where i sit leisurely in a store in main street kansas city a streaming crowd on the sidewalks flowing by the ladies and the same in denver are all fashionably drest and have the look of gentility in face manner and action but they do not have either in physique or the mentality appropriate to them any high native originality of spirit or body as the men certainly have appropriate to them they are intellectual and fashionable but dyspepticlooking and generally dolllike their ambition evidently is to copy their eastern sisters something far different and in advance must appear to tally and complete the superb masculinity of the west and maintain and continue it   the silent general  sept 28 79so general grant after circumambiating the world has arrived home again landed in san francisco yesterday from the ship city of tokio from japan what a man he is what a history what an illustrationhis lifeof the capacities of that american individuality common to us all cynical critics are wondering what the people can see in grant to make such a hubbub about they aver and it is no doubt true that he has hardly the average of our days literary and scholastic culture and absolutely no pronouncd genius or conventional eminence of any sort correct but he proves how an average western farmer mechanic boatman carried by tides of circumstances perhaps caprices into a position of incredible military or civic responsibilities history has presented none more trying no born monarchs no mark more shining for attack or envy may steer his way fitly and steadily through them all carrying the country and himself with credit year after

have concentrated upon him   president hayess speeches  sept 30i see president hayes has come out west passing quite informally from point to point with his wife and a small cortege of big officers receiving ovations and making daily and sometimes doubledaily addresses to the people to these addressesall impromptu and some would call them ephemerali feel to devote a memorandum they are shrewd goodnaturd facetoface speeches on easy topics not too deep but they give me some revised ideas of oratoryof a new opportune theory and practice of that art quite changed from the classic rules and adapted to our days our occasions to american democracy and to the swarming populations of the west i hear them criticised as wanting in dignity but to me they are just what they should be considering all the circumstances who they come from and who they are addressd to underneath his objects are to compact and fraternize the states encourage their materialistic and industrial development soothe and expand their selfpoise and tie all and each with resistless double ties not only of intertrade barter but human comradeship  from kansas city i went on to st louis where i remaind nearly three months with my brother tjw and my dear nieces   st louis memoranda  oct nov and dec 79the points of st louis are its position its absolute wealth the long accumulations of time and trade solid riches probably a higher average thereof than any city the unrivalld amplitude of its welllaidout environage of broad plateaus for future expansionand the great state of which it is the head it fuses northern and southern qualities perhaps native and foreign ones to perfection rendezvous the whole stretch of the mississippi and missouri rivers and its american electricity goes well with its german phlegm fourth fifth and third streets are storestreets showy modern metropolitan with hurrying crowds vehicles horsecars hubbub plenty of people rich goods plateglass windows iron fronts often five or six stories high you can purchase anything in st louis in most of the big western cities for the matter of that just as readily and cheaply as in the atlantic marts often in going about the town you see reminders of old even decayd civilization the water of the west in some places is not good but they make it up here by plenty of very fair wine and inexhaustible quantities of the best beer in the world there are immense establishments for slaughtering beef and porkand i saw flocks of sheep 5000 in a flock in kansas city i had visited a packing establishment that kills and packs an average of 2500 hogs a day the whole year round for export another in atchison kansas same extent others nearly equal elsewhere and just as big ones here   nights on the mississippi  oct 29th 30th and 31stwonderfully fine with the full harvest moon dazzling and silvery i have haunted the river every night lately where i could get a look at the bridge by moonlight it is indeed a structure of perfection and beauty unsurpassable and i never tire of it the river at present is very low i noticed today it had much more of a blueclear look than usual i hear the slight ripples the air is fresh and cool and the view up or down wonderfully clear in the moonlight i am out pretty late it is so fascinating dreamy the cool nightair all the influences the silence with those faroff eternal stars do me good i have been quite ill of late and so wellnear the centre of our national demesne these night views of the mississippi   upon our own land  always after supper take a walk half a mile long says an old proverb dryly adding and if convenient let it be upon your own land i wonder does any other nation but ours afford opportunity for such a jaunt as this indeed has any previous period afforded it no one i discover begins to know the real geographic democratic indissoluble american union in the present or suspect it in the future until he explores these central states and dwells awhile observantly on their prairies or amid their busy towns and the mighty father of waters a ride of two or three thousand miles on ones own land with hardly a disconnection could certainly be had in no other place than the united states and at no period before this if you want to see what the railroad is and how civilization and progress date from ithow it is the conqueror of crude nature which it turns to mans use both on small scales and on the largestcome hither to inland america  i returnd home east jan 5 1880 having traversd to and fro and across 10000 miles and more i soon resumed my seclusions down in the woods or by the creek or gaddings about cities and an occasional disquisition as will be seen following   edgar poes significance  jan 1 80in diagnosing this disease called humanityto assume for the nonce what seems a chief mood of the personality and writings of my subjecti have thought that poets somewhere or other on the list present the most markd indications comprehending artists in a mass musicians painters actors and so on and considering each and all of them as radiations or flanges of that furious whirling wheel poetry the centre and axis of the whole where else indeed may we so well investigate the causes growths tallymarks of the timethe ages matter and malady  by common consent there is nothing better for man or woman than a perfect and noble life morally without flaw happily balanced in activity physically sound and pure giving its due proportion and no more to the sympathetic the human emotional elementa life in all these unhasting unresting untiring to the end and yet there is another shape of personality dearer far to the artistsense which likes the play of strongest lights and shades where the perfect character the good the heroic although never attaind is never lost sight of but through failures sorrows temporary downfalls is returnd to again and again and while often violated is passionately adhered to as long as mind muscles voice obey the power we call volition this sort of personality we see more or less in burns byron schiller and george sand but we do not see it in edgar poe all this is the result of reading at intervals the last three days a new volume of his poemsi took it on my rambles down by the pond and by degrees read it all through there while to the character first outlined the service poe renders is certainly that entire contrast and contradiction which is next best to fully exemplifying it  almost without the first sign of moral principle or of the concrete or its heroisms or the simpler affections of the heart poes verses illustrate an intense faculty for technical and abstract beauty with the rhyming art to excess an incorrigible propensity toward nocturnal themes a demoniac undertone behind every pageand by final judgment probably belong among the electric lights of imaginative literature brilliant and dazzling but with no heat there is an indescribable magnetism about the poets life and reminiscences as well as the poems to one who could work out their subtle retracing and retrospect the latter would make a close tally no doubt between the authors birth and antecedents his childhood and youth his physique his socalld education his studies and associates the literary and social baltimore richmond philadelphia and new york of those timesnot only the places

care for it something further of my point of view toward this interesting figure and influence of our era there occurrd about that date in baltimore a public reburial of poes remains and dedication of a monument over the grave  being in washington on a visit at the time the old gray went over to baltimore and though ill from paralysis consented to hobble up and silently take a seat on the platform but refused to make any speech saying i have felt a strong impulse to come over and be here today myself in memory of poe which i have obeyd but not the slightest impulse to make a speech which my dear friends must also be obeyed in an informal circle however in conversation after the ceremonies whitman said for a long while and until lately i had a distaste for poes writings i wanted and still want for poetry the clear sun shining and fresh air blowingthe strength and power of health not of delirium even amid the stormiest passionswith always the background of the eternal moralities noncomplying with these requirements poes genius has yet conquerd a special recognition for itself and i too have come to fully admit it and appreciate it and him  in a dream i once had i saw a vessel on the sea at midnight in a storm it was no great fullriggd ship nor majestic steamer steering firmly through the gale but seemd one of those superb little schooner yachts i had often seen lying

the firm orotund voice of the minister and most of all beyond any portraying or suggesting that audience deeply impressd me i was furnishd with an armchair near the pulpit and sat facing the motley yet perfectly wellbehaved and orderly congregation the quaint dresses and bonnets of some of the women several very old and gray here and there like the heads in old pictures o the looks that came from those faces there were two or three i shall probably never forget nothing at all markedly repulsive or hideousstrange enough i did not see one such our common humanity mine and yours everywhere

as i am the owner of two i send you one   grand native growth  in a few days i go to lake huron and may have something to say of that region and people from what i already see i should say the young native population of canada was growing up forming a hardy democratic intelligent radically sound and just as american goodnatured and individualistic race as the average range of best specimens among us as among us too i please myself by considering that this element though it may not be the majority promises to be the leaven which must eventually leaven the whole lump   a zollverein between the us and canada  some of the more liberal of the presses here are discussing the question of a zollverein between the united states and canada it is proposed to form a union for commercial purposesto altogether abolish the frontier tariff line with its double sets of custom house officials now existing between the two countries and to agree upon one tariff for both the proceeds of this tariff to be divided between the two governments on the basis of population it is said that a large proportion of the merchants of canada are in favor of this step as they believe it would materially add to the business of the country by removing the restrictions that now exist on trade between canada and the states those persons who are opposed to the measure believe that it would increase the material welfare or the country but it would loosen the bonds between canada and england and this sentiment overrides the desire for commercial prosperity whether the sentiment can continue to bear the strain put upon it is a question it is thought by many that commercial considerations must in the end prevail it seems also to be generally agreed that such a zollverein or common customs union would bring practically more benefits to the canadian provinces than to the united states it seems to me a certainty of time sooner or later that canada shall form two or three grand states equal and independent with the rest of the american union the st lawrence and lakes are not for a frontier line but a grand interior or midchannel   the st lawrence line  august 20premising that my three or four months in canada were intended among the rest as an exploration of the line of the st lawrence from lake superior to the sea the engineers here insist upon considering it as one stream over 2000 miles long including lakes and niagara and allthat i have only partially carried out my programme but for the seven or eight hundred miles so far fulfilld i find that the canada question is absolutely controld by this vast water line with its firstclass features and points of trade humanity and many morehere i am writing this nearly a thousand miles north of my philadelphia startingpoint by way of montreal and quebec in the midst of regions that go to a further extreme of grimness wildness of beauty and a sort of still and pagan scaredness while yet christian inhabitable and partially fertile than perhaps any other on earth the weather remains perfect some might call it a little cool but i wear my old gray overcoat and find it just right the days are full of sunbeams and oxygen most of the forenoons and afternoons i am on the forward deck of the steamer   the savage saguenay  up these black waters over a hundred milesalways strong deep hundreds of feet sometimes thousands ever with high rocky hills for banks green and grayat times a little like some parts of the hudson but much more pronouncd and defiant the hills rise higherkeep their ranks more unbroken the river is straighter and of more resolute flow and its hue though dark as ink exquisitely polishd and sheeny under the august sun different indeed this saguenay from all other riversdifferent effectsa bolder more vehement play of lights and shades of a rare charm of singleness and simplicity like the organchant at midnight from the old spanish convent in favoritaone strain only simple and monotonous and unornamentedbut indescribably penetrating and grand and masterful great place for echoes while our steamer was tied at the wharf at tadousac tajoosac waiting the escapepipe letting off steam i was sure i heard a band at the hotel up in the rockscould even make out some of the tunes only when our pipe stoppd i knew what caused it then at cape eternity and trinity rock the pilot with his whistle producing similar marvellous results echoes indescribably weird as we lay off in the still bay under their shadows   capes eternity and trinity  but the great haughty silent capes themselves i doubt if any crack points or hills or historic places of note or anything of the kind elsewhere in the world outvies these objectsi write while i am before them face to face they are very simple they do not startleat least they did not mebut they linger in ones memory forever they are placed very near each other side by side each a mountain rising flush out of the saguenay a good thrower could throw a stone on each in passingat least it seems so then they are as distinct in form as a perfect physical man or a perfect physical woman cape eternity is bare rising as just said sheer out of the water rugged and grim yet with an indescribable beauty nearly two thousand feet high trinity rock even a little higher also rising flush toprounded like a great head with closecut verdure of hair i consider myself well repaid for coming my thousand miles to get the sight and memory of the unrivalld duo they have stirrd me more profoundly than anything of the kind i have yet seen if europe or asia had them we should certainly hear of them in all sorts of sentback poems rhapsodies c a dozen times a year through our papers and magazines   chicoutimi and haha bay  no indeedlife and travel and memory have offerd and will preserve to me no deepercut incidents panorama or sights to cheer my soul than these at chicoutimi and haha bay and my days and nights up and down this fascinating savage riverthe rounded mountains some bare and gray some dull red some draped close all over with matted green verdure or vinesthe ample calm eternal rocks everywherethe long streaks of motley foam a milkwhite curd on the glistening breast of the streamthe little twomasted schooner dingy yellow with patchd sails set wingandwing nearing us coming saucily up the water with a couple of swarthy blackhaird men aboardthe strong shades falling on the light gray or yellow outlines of the hills all through the forenoon as we steam within gunshot of themwhile ever the pure and delicate sky spreads over all and the splendid sunsets and the sights of eveningthe same old stars relatively a little different i see so far north arcturus and lyra and the eagle and great jupiter like a silver globe and the constellation of the scorpion then northern lights nearly every night   the inhabitantsgood living  grim and rocky and blackwaterd as the demesne hereabout is however you must not think genial humanity and comfort and goodliving are not to be met before i began this memorandum i made a firstrate breakfast of seatrout finishing off with wild raspberries i find smiles and courtesy

country charlevoix chicoutimi and tadousac counties and lake st john region a simple hardy population lumbering trapping furs boating fishing berrypicking and a little farming i was watching a group

country this when the solid frost and ice fully set in   cedarplums likenames back again in camden and down in jersey  one time i thought of naming this collection cedarplums like which i still fancy wouldnt have been a bad name nor inappropriate a melange of loafing looking hobbling sitting travelinga little thinking thrown in for salt but very littlenot only summer but all seasonsnot only days but nightssome literary meditationsbooks authors examined carlyle poe emerson tried always under my cedartree in the open air and never in the librarymostly the scenes everybody sees but some of my own caprices meditations egotismtruly an open air and mainly summer formationsingly or in clusterswild and free and somewhat acridindeed more like cedarplums than you might guess at first glance  but do you know what they are to city man or some sweet parlor lady i now talk as you go along roads or barrens or across country anywhere through these states middle eastern western or southern you will see certain seasons of the year the thick woolly tufts of the cedar mottled with bunches of chinablue berries about as big as foxgrapes but first a special word for the tree itself everybody knows that the cedar is a healthy cheap democratic wood streakd red and whitean evergreenthat it is not a cultivated treethat it keeps away mothsthat it grows inland or seaboard all climates hot or cold any soilin fact rather prefers sand and bleak side spotscontent if the plough the fertilizer and the trimmingaxe will but keep away and let it alone after a long rain when everything looks bright often have i stopt in my woodsaunters south or north or far west to take in its dusky green washd clean and sweet and speckd copiously with its fruit of clear hardy blue the wood of the cedar is of usebut what profit on earth are those sprigs of acrid plums a question impossible to answer satisfactorily true some of the herb doctors give them for stomachic affections but the remedy is as bad as the disease then in my rambles down in camden county i once found an old crazy woman gathering the clusters with zeal and joy she showd as i was told afterward a sort of infatuation for them and every year placed and kept profuse bunches high and low about her room they had a strange charm on her uneasy head and effected docility and peace she was harmless and lived near by with her welloff married daughter whether there is any connection between those bunches and being out of ones wits i cannot say but i myself entertain a weakness for them indeed i love the cedar anyhowits naked ruggedness its just palpable odor so different from the perfumers best its silence its equable acceptance of winters cold and summers heat of rain or drouthits shelter to me from those at timesits associationswell i never could explain why i love anybody or anything the service i now specially owe to the cedar is while i cast around for a name for my proposed collection hesitating puzzledafter rejecting a long long string i lift my eyes and lo the very term i want at any rate i go no furtheri tire in the search i take what some invisible kind spirit has put before me besides who shall say there is not affinity enough between at least the bundle of sticks that produced many of these pieces or granulations and those blue berries their uselessness growing wilda certain aroma of nature i would so like to have in my pagesthe thin soil whence they cometheir content in being let alonetheir stolid and deaf repugnance to answering questions this latter the nearest dearest trait affinity of all  then reader dear in conclusion as to the point of the name for the present collection let us be satisfied to have a namesomething to identify and bind it together to concrete all its vegetable mineral personal memoranda abrupt raids of criticism crude gossip of philosophy varied sands and clumpswithout bothering ourselves because certain pages do not present themselves to you or me as coming under their own name with entire fitness or amiability it is a profound vexatious neverexplicable matterthis of names i have been exercised deeply about it my whole life11  after all of which the name cedarplums like got its nose put out of joint but i cannot afford to throw away what i pencilld down the lane there under the shelter of my old friend one warm october noon besides it wouldnt be civil

81and so the flame of the lamp after long wasting and flickering has gone out entirely  as a representative author a literary figure no man else will bequeath to the future more significant hints of our stormy era its fierce paradoxes its din and its struggling parturition periods than carlyle he belongs to our own branch of the stock too neither latin nor greek but altogether gothic rugged mountainous volcanic he was himself more a french revolution than any of his volumes in some respects so far in the nineteenth century the best equipt keenest mind even from the college point of view of all britain only he had an ailing body dyspepsia is to be traced in every page and now and then fills the page one may include among the lessons of his lifeeven though that life stretchd to amazing lengthhow behind the tally of genius and morals stands the stomach and gives a sort of casting vote  two conflicting agonistic elements seem to have contended in the man sometimes pulling him different ways like wild horses he was a cautious conservative scotchman fully aware what a foetid gasbag much of modern radicalism is but then his great heart demanded reform demanded changeoften terribly at odds with his scornful brain no author ever put so much wailing and despair into his books sometimes palpable oftener latent he reminds me of that passage in youngs poems where as death presses closer and closer for his prey the soul rushes hither and thither appealing shrieking berating to escape the general doom  of shortcomings even positive blurspots from an american point of view he had serious share  not for his merely literary merit though that was greatnot as maker of books but as launching into the selfcomplacent atmosphere of our days a rasping questioning dislocating agitation and shock is carlyles final value it is time the englishspeaking peoples had some true idea about the verteber of genius namely power as if they must always have it cut and biasd to the fashion like a ladys cloak what a needed service he performs how he shakes our comfortable reading circles with a touch of the old hebraic anger and prophecyand indeed it is just the same not isaiah himself more scornful more threatening the crown of pride the drunkards of ephraim shall be trodden under feet and the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley shall be a fading flower the word prophecy is much misused it seems narrowd to prediction merely that is not the main sense of the hebrew word translated prophet it means one whose mind bubbles up and pours forth as a fountain from inner divine spontaneities revealing god prediction is a very minor part of prophecy the great matter is to reveal and outpour the godlike suggestions pressing for birth in the soul this is briefly the doctrine of the friends or quakers  then the simplicity and amid ostensible frailty the towering strength of this mana hardy oak knot you could never wear outan old farmer dressd in brown clothes and not handsomehis very foibles fascinating who cares that he wrote about dr francia and shooting niagaraand the nigger questionand didnt at all admire our united states i doubt if he ever thought or said half as bad words about us as we deserve how he splashes like leviathan in the seas of modern literature and politics doubtless respecting the latter one needs first to realize from actual observation the squalor vice and doggedness ingraind in the bulkpopulation of the british islands with the red tape the fatuity the flunkeyism everywhere to understand the last meaning in his pages accordingly though he was no chartist or radical i consider carlyles by far the most indignant comment or protest anent the fruits of feudalism today in great britainthe increasing poverty and degradation of the homeless landless twenty millions while a few thousands or rather a few hundreds possess the entire soil the money and the fat berths trade and shipping and clubs and culture and prestige and guns and a fine select class of gentry and aristocracy with every modern improvement cannot begin to salve or defend such stupendous hoggishness  the way to test how much he has left his country were to consider or try to consider for a moment the array of british thought the resultant ensemble of the last fifty years as existing today but with carlyle left out it would be like an army with no artillery the show were still a gay and rich onebyron scott tennyson and many morehorsemen and rapid infantry and banners flyingbut the last heavy roar so dear to the ear of the traind soldier and that settles fate and victory would be lacking  for the last three years we in america have had transmitted glimpses of a thinbodied lonesome wifeless childless very old man lying on a sofa kept out of bed by indomitable will but of late never well enough to take the open air i have noted this news from time to time in brief descriptions in the papers a week ago i read such an item just before i started out for my customary evening stroll between eight and nine in the fine cold night unusually clear feb 5 81 as i walkd some open grounds adjacent the condition of carlyle and his approachingperhaps even then actualdeath filled me with thoughts eluding statement and curiously blending with the scene the planet venus an hour high in the west with all her volume and lustre recoverd she has been shorn and languid for nearly a year including an additional sentiment i never noticed beforenot merely voluptuous paphian steeping fascinatingnow with calm commanding seriousness and hauteurthe milo venus now upward to the zenith jupiter saturn and the moon past her quarter trailing in procession with the pleiades following and the constellation taurus and red aldebaran not a cloud in heaven orion strode through the southeast with his glittering beltand a trifle below hung the sun of the night sirius every star dilated more vitreous nearer than usual not as in some clear nights when the larger stars entirely outshine the rest every little star or cluster just as distinctly visible and just as nigh berenices hair showing every gem and new ones to the northeast and north the sickle the goat and kids cassiopeia castor and pollux and the two dippers while through the whole of this silent indescribable show inclosing and bathing my whole receptivity ran the thought of carlyle dying to soothe and spiritualize and as far as may be solve the mysteries of death and genius consider them under the stars at midnight  and now that he has gone hence can it be that thomas carlyle soon to chemically dissolve in ashes and by winds remains an identity still in ways perhaps eluding all the statements lore and speculations of ten thousand yearseluding all possible statements to mortal sensedoes he yet exist a definite vital being a spirit an individualperhaps now wafted in space among those stellar systems which suggestive and limitless as they are merely edge more limitless far more suggestive systems i have no doubt of it in silence of a fine night such questions are answerd to the soul the best answers that can be given with me too when depressd by some specially sad event or tearing problem i wait till i go out under the stars for the last voiceless satisfaction   carlyle from american points of view  later thoughts and jottings  there is surely at present an inexplicable rapport all the more piquant from its contradictoriness between that deceasd author and our united states of americano matter whether it lasts or not13 as we westerners assume definite shape and result in formations and fruitage unknown before it is curious with what a new sense our eyes turn to representative outgrowths of crises and personages in the old world beyond question since carlyles death and the publication of froudes memoirs not only the interest in his books but every personal bit regarding the famous scotchmanhis dyspepsia his buffetings his parentage his paragon of a wife his career in edinburgh in the lonesome nest on craigenputtock moor and then so many years in londonis probably wider and livelier today in this country than in his own land whether i succeed or no i too reaching across the atlantic and taking the mans dark fortunetelling of humanity and politics would offset it all such is the fancy that comes to me by a far more profound horoscopecasting of those themesg f hegels14  first about a chance a neverfulfilld vacuity of this pale cast of thoughtthis british hamlet from cheyne row more puzzling than the danish one with his contrivances for settling the broken and spavind joints of the worlds government especially its democratic dislocation carlyles grim fate was cast to live and dwell in and largely embody the parturition agony and qualms of the old order amid crowded accumulations of ghastly morbidity giving birth to the new  but conceive of him or his parents before him coming to america recuperated by the cheering realities and activity of our people and countrygrowing up and delving facetoface resolutely among us here especially at the westinhaling and exhaling our limitless air and eligibilitiesdevoting his mind to the theories and developments of this republic amid its practical facts as exemplified in kansas missouri illinois tennessee or louisiana i say facts and facetoface confrontingsso different from books and all those quiddities and mere reports in the libraries upon which the man it was wittily said of him at the age of thirty that there was no one in scotland who had gleand so much and seen so little almost wholly fed and which even his sturdy and vital mind but reflected at best  something of the sort narrowly escaped happening in 1835 after more than a dozen years of trial and nonsuccess the author of sartor resartus removing to london very poor a confirmed hypochondriac sartor universally scoffed at no literary prospects ahead deliberately settled on one last casting throw of the literary diceresolvd to compose and launch forth a book on the subject of the french revolutionand if that won no higher guerdon or prize than hitherto to sternly abandon the trade of author forever and emigrate for good to america but the venture turnd out a lucky one and there was no emigration  carlyles work in the sphere of literature as he commenced and carried it out is the same in one or two leading respects that immanuel kants was in speculative philosophy but the scotchman had none of the stomachic phlegm and neverperturbd placidity of the konigsberg sage and did not like the latter understand his own limits and stop when he got to the end of them he clears away jungle and poisonvines and underbrushat any rate hacks valiantly at them smiting hip and thigh kant did the like in his sphere and it was all he professd to do his labors have left the ground fully prepared ever sinceand greater service was probably never performd by mortal man but the pang and hiatus of carlyle seem to me to consist in the evidence everywhere that amid a whirl of fog and fury and crosspurposes he firmly believd he had a clue to the medication of the worlds ills and that his bounden mission was to exploit it15  there were two anchors or sheetanchors for steadying as a last resort the carlylean ship one will be specified presently the other perhaps the main was only to be found in some markd form of personal force an extreme degree of competent urge and will a man or men born to command probably there ran through every vein and current of the scotchmans blood something that warmd up to this kind of trait and character above aught else in the world and which makes him in my opinion the chief celebrater and promulger of it in literaturemore than plutarch more than shakspere the great masses of humanity stand for nothingat least nothing but nebulous raw material only the big planets and shining suns for him to ideas almost invariably languid or cold a numberone forceful personality was sure to rouse his eulogistic passion and savage joy in such case even the standard of duty hereinafter raisd was to be instantly lowerd and vaild all that is comprehended under the terms republicanism and democracy were distasteful to him from the first and as he grew older they became hateful and contemptible for an undoubtedly candid and penetrating faculty such as his the bearings he persistently ignored were marvellous for instance the promise nay certainty of the democratic principle to each and every state of the current world not so much of helping it to perfect legislators and executives but as the only effectual method for surely however slowly training people on a large scale toward voluntarily ruling and managing themselves the ultimate aim of political and all other developmentto gradually reduce the fact of governing to its minimum and to subject all its staffs and their doings to the telescopes and microscopes of committees and partiesand greatest of all to afford not stagnation and obedient content which went well enough with the feudalism and ecclesiasticism of the antique and medieval world but a vast and sane and recurrent ebb and tide action for those floods of the great deep that have henceforth palpably burst forever their old boundsseem never to have enterd carlyles thought it was splendid how he refusd any compromise to the last he was curiously antique in that harsh picturesque most potent voice and figure one seems to be carried back from the present of the british islands more than two thousand years to the range between jerusalem and tarsus his fullest best biographer justly says of him  he was a teacher and a prophet in the jewish sense of the word the prophecies of isaiah and jeremiah have become a part of the permanent spiritual inheritance of mankind because events proved that they had interpreted correctly the sign of their own times and their prophecies were fulfilld carlyle like them believd that he had a special message to deliver to the present age whether he was correct in that belief and whether his message was a true message remains to be seen he has told us that our most cherishd ideas of political liberty with their kindred corollaries are mere illusions and that the progress which has seemd to go along with them is a progress towards anarchy and social dissolution if he was wrong he has misused his powers the principles of his teachings are false he has offerd himself as a guide upon a road of which he had no knowledge and his own desire for himself would be the speediest oblivion both of his person and his works if on the other hand he has been right if like his great predecessors he has read truly the tendencies of this modern age of ours and his teaching is authenticated by facts then carlyle too will take his place among the inspired seers  to which i add an amendment that under no circumstances and no matter how completely time and events disprove his lurid vaticinations should the englishspeaking world forget this man nor fail to hold in honor his unsurpassd conscience his unique method and his honest fame never were convictions more earnest and genuine never was there less of a flunkey or temporizer never had political progressivism a foe it could more heartily respect  the second main point of carlyles utterance was the idea of duty being done it is simply a new codicilif it be particularly new which is by no means certainon the timehonord bequest of dynasticism the mouldeaten rules of legitimacy and kings he seems to have been impatient sometimes to madness when reminded by persons who thought at least as deeply as himself that this formula though precious is rather a vague one and that there are many other considerations to a philosophical estimate of each and every department either  altogether i dont know anything more amazing than these persistent strides and throbbings so far through our nineteenth century of perhaps its biggest sharpest and most erudite brain in defiance and discontent with everything contemptuously ignoring either from constitutional inaptitude ignorance itself or more likely because he demanded a definite cureall here and now the only solace and solvent to be had  there is apart from mere intellect in the makeup of every superior human identity in its moral completeness considered as ensemble not for that moral alone but for the whole being including physique a wondrous something that realizes without argument frequently without what is called education

history and time and all events however trivial however momentous like a leashd dog in the hand of the hunter such soulsight and rootcentre for the mindmere optimism explains only the surface or fringe of itcarlyle was mostly perhaps entirely without he seems instead to have been haunted in the play of his mental action by a spectre never entirely laid from first to last greek scholars i believe find the same mocking and fantastic apparition attending aristophanes his comediesthe spectre of worlddestruction  how largest triumph or failure in human life in war or peace may depend on some little hidden centrality hardly more than a drop of blood a pulsebeat or a breath of air it is certain that all these weighty matters democracy in america carlyleism and the temperament for deepest political or literary exploration turn on a simple point in speculative philosophy  the most profound theme that can occupy the mind of manthe problem on whose solution science art the bases and pursuits of nations and everything else including intelligent human happiness here today 1882 new york texas california the same as all times all lands subtly and finally resting depends for competent outset and argument is doubtless involved in the query what is the fusing explanation and tiewhat the relation between the radical democratic me the human identity of understanding emotions spirit c on the one side of and with the conservative not me the whole of the material objective universe and laws with what is behind them in time and space on the other side immanuel kant though he explaind or partially explaind as may be said the laws of the human understanding left this question an open one schellings answer or suggestion of answer is and very valuable and important as far as it goes that the same general and particular intelligence passion even the standards of right and wrong which exist in a conscious and formulated state in man exist in an unconscious state or in perceptible analogies throughout the entire universe of external nature in all its objects large or small and all its movements and processesthus making the impalpable human mind and concrete nature notwithstanding their duality and separation convertible and in centrality and essence one but g f hegels fuller statement of the matter probably remains the last best word that has been said upon it up to date substantially adopting the scheme just epitomized he so carries it out and fortifies it and merges everything in it with certain serious gaps now for the first time filld that it becomes a coherent metaphysical system and substantial answer as far as there can be any answer to the foregoing questiona system which while i distinctly admit that the brain of the future may add to revise and even entirely reconstruct at any rate beams forth today in its entirety illuminating the thought of the universe and satisfying the mystery thereof to the human mind with a more consoling scientific assurance than any yet  according to hegel the whole earth an old nucleusthought as in the vedas and no doubt before but never hitherto brought so absolutely to the front fully surcharged with modern scientism and facts and made the sole entrance to each and all with its infinite variety the past the surroundings of today or what may happen in the future the contrarieties of material with spiritual and of natural with artificial are all to the eye of the ensemblist but necessary sides and unfoldings different steps or links in the endless process of creative thought which amid numberless apparent failures and contradictions is held together by central and neverbroken unitynot contradictions or failures at all but radiations of one consistent and eternal purpose the whole mass of everything steadily unerringly tending and flowing toward the permanent utile and morale as rivers to oceans as life is the whole law and incessant effort of the visible universe and death only the other or invisible side of the same so the utile so truth so health are the continuousimmutable laws of the moral universe and vice and disease with all their perturbations are but transient even if ever so prevalent expressions  to politics throughout hegel applies the like catholic standard and faith not any one party or any one form of government is absolutely and exclusively true truth consists in the just relations of objects to each other a majority or democracy may rule as outrageously and do as great harm as an oligarchy or despotismthough far less likely to do so but the great evil is either a violation of the relations just referrd to or of the moral law the specious the unjust the cruel and what is called the unnatural though not only permitted but in a certain sense like shade to light inevitable in the divine scheme are by the whole constitution of that scheme partial inconsistent temporary and though having ever so great an ostensible majority are certainly destind to failures after causing great suffering  theology hegel translates into science16 all apparent contradictions in the statement of the deific nature by different ages nations churches points of view are but fractional and imperfect expressions of one essential unity from which they all proceedcrude endeavors or distorted parts to be regarded both as distinct and united in short to put it in our own form or summing up that thinker or analyzer or overlooker who by an inscrutable combination of traind wisdom and natural intuition most fully accepts in perfect faith the moral unity and sanity of the creative scheme in history science and all life and time present and future is both the truest cosmical devotee or religioso and the profoundest philosopher while he who by the spell of himself and his circumstance sees darkness and despair in the sum of the workings of gods providence and who in that denies or prevaricates is no matter how much piety plays on his lips the most radical sinner and infidel  i am the more assured in recounting hegel a little freely here17 not only for offsetting the carlylean letter and spiritcutting it out all and several from the very roots and below the rootsbut to counterpoise since the late death and deservd apotheosis of darwin the tenets of the evolutionists unspeakably precious as those are to biology and henceforth indispensable to a right aim and estimate in study they neither comprise or explain everythingand the last word or whisper still remains to be breathed after the utmost of those claims floating high and forever above them all and above technical metaphysics while the contributions which german kant and fichte and schelling and hegel have bequeathd to humanityand which english darwin has also in his fieldare indispensable to the erudition of americas future i should say that in all of them and the best of them when compared with the lightning flashes and flights of the old prophets and exaltes the spiritual poets and poetry of all lands as in the hebrew bible there seems to be nay certainly is something lackingsomething cold a failure to satisfy the deepest emotions of the soula want of living glow fondness warmth which the old exaltes and poets supply and which the keenest modern philosophers so far do not  upon the whole and for our purposes this mans name certainly belongs on the list with the justspecified firstclass moral physicians of our current eraand with emerson and two or three othersthough his prescription is drastic and perhaps destructive while theirs is assimilating normal and tonic feudal at the core and mental offspring and radiation of feudalism as are his books they afford evervaluable lessons and affinities to democratic america nations or individuals we surely learn deepest from unlikeness from a sincere opponent from the light thrown even scornfully on dangerous spots and liabilities michel angelo invoked heavens special protection against his friends and affectionate flatterers palpable foes he could manage for himself in many particulars carlyle was indeed as froude terms him one of those faroff hebraic utterers a new micah or

intellect of the first class turnd on british and european politics social life literature and representative personagesthoroughly dissatisfied with all and mercilessly exposing the illness of all but while he announces the malady and scolds and raves about it he himself born and bred in the same atmosphere is a markd illustration of it   notes  13 it will be difficult for the futurejudging by his books personal dissympathies cto account for the deep hold this author has taken on the present age and the way he has colord its method and thought i am certainly at a loss to account for it all as affecting myself but there could be no view or even partial picture of the middle and latter part of our nineteenth century that did not markedly include thomas carlyle in his case as so many others literary productions works of art personal identities events there has been an impalpable something more effective than the palpable then i find no better text it is always important to have a definite special even oppositional living man to start from for sending out certain speculations and comparisons for home use let us see what they amount tothose reactionary doctrines fears scornful analyses of democracyeven from the most erudite and sincere mind of europe  14 not the least mentionable part of the case a streak it may be of that humor with which history and fate love to contrast their gravity is that although neither of my great authorities during their lives considerd the united states worthy of serious mention all the principal works of both might not inappropriately be this day collected and bound up under the conspicuous title speculations for the use of north america and democracy there with the relations of the same to metaphysics including lessons and warnings encouragements too and of the vastest from the old world to the new  15 i hope i shall not myself fall into the error i charge upon him of prescribing a specific for indispensable evils my utmost pretension is probably but to offset that old claim of the exclusively curative power of firstclass individual men as leaders and rulers by the claims and general movement and result of ideas something of the latter kind seems to me the distinctive theory of america of democracy and of the modernor rather i should say it is democracy and is the modern  16 i am much indebted to j gosticks abstract  17 i have deliberately repeated it all not only in offset to carlyle s everlurking pessimism and worlddecadence but as presenting the most thoroughly american points of view i know in my opinion the above formulas of hegel are an essential and crowning justification of new world democracy in the creative realms of time and space there is that about them which only the vastness the multiplicity and the vitality of america would seem able to comprehend to give scope and illustration to or to be fit for or even originate it is strange to me that they were born in germany or in the old world at all while a carlyle i should say is quite the legitimate european product to be expected   a couple of old friendsa coleridge bit  latter aprilhave run down in my country haunt for a couple of days and am spending them by the pond i had already discoverd my kingfisher here but only onethe mate not here yet this fine bright morning down by the creek he has come out for a spree circling flirting chirping at a round rate while i am writing these lines he is disporting himself in scoots and rings over the wider parts of the pond into whose surface he dashes once or twice making a loud sousethe spray flying in the sunbeautiful i see his white and darkgray plumage and peculiar shape plainly as he has deignd to come very near me the noble graceful bird now he is sitting on the limb of an old tree high up bending over the waterseems to be looking at me while i memorandize i almost fancy he knows me three days latermy second kingfisher is here with his or her mate i saw the two together flying and whirling around i had heard in the distance what i thought was the clear rasping staccato of the birds several times alreadybut i couldnt be sure the notes came from both until i saw them together today at noon they appeard but apparently either on business or for a little limited exercise only no wild frolic now full of free fun and motion up and down for an hour doubtless now they have cares duties incubation responsibilities the frolics are deferrd till summerclose  i dont know as i can finish todays memorandum better than with coleridges lines curiously

today had been settled not only with reference to speed and directness but for the comfort of women children invalids and old fellows like me i went on by a through train that runs daily from washington to the yankee metropolis without change you get in a sleepingcar soon after dark in philadelphia and after ruminating an hour or two have your bed made up if you like draw the curtains and go to sleep in itfly on through jersey to new yorkhear in your halfslumbers a dull jolting and bumping sound or twoare unconsciously toted from jersey city by a midnight steamer around the battery and under the big bridge to the track of the new haven roadresume your flight eastward and early the next morning you wake up in boston all of which was my experience i wanted to go to the revere house a tall unknown gentleman a fellowpassenger on his way to newport he told me i had just chatted a few moments before with him assisted me out through the depot crowd procured a hack put me in it with my traveling bag saying smilingly and quietly now i want you to let this be my ride paid the driver and before i could remonstrate bowd himself off  the occasion of my jaunt i suppose i had better say here was for a public reading of the death of abraham lincoln essay on the sixteenth anniversary of that tragedy which reading duly came off night of april 15 then i lingerd a week in bostonfelt pretty well the mood propitious my paralysis lulldwent around everywhere and saw all that was to be seen especially human beings bostons immense material growthcommerce finance commission stores the plethora of goods the crowded streets and sidewalksmade of course the first surprising show in my trip out west last year i thought the wand of future prosperity future empire must soon surely be wielded by st louis chicago beautiful denver perhaps san francisco but i see the said wand stretchd out just as decidedly in boston with just as much certainty of staying evidences of copious capitalindeed no centre of the new world ahead of it half the big railroads in the west are built with yankees money and they take the dividends old boston with its zigzag streets and multitudinous angles crush up a sheet of letterpaper in your hand throw it down stamp it flat and that is a map of old bostonnew boston with its miles upon miles of large and costly housesbeacon street commonwealth avenue and a hundred others but the best new departures and expansions of boston and of all the cities of new england are in another direction   the boston of today  in the letters we get from dr schliemann interesting but fishy about his excavations there in the faroff homeric area i notice cities ruins c as he digs them out of their graves are certain to be in layersthat is to say upon the foundation of an old concern very far down indeed is always another city or set of ruins and upon that another superaddedand sometimes upon that still anothereach representing either a long or rapid stage of growth and development different from its predecessor but unerringly growing out of and resting on it in the moral emotional heroic and human growths the main of a race in my opinion something of this kind has certainly taken place in boston the new england metropolis of today may be described as sunny there is something else that makes warmth mastering even winds and meteorologies though those are not to be sneezd at joyous receptive full of ardor sparkle a certain element of yearning magnificently tolerant yet not to be foold fond of good eating and drinkingcostly in costume as its purse can buy and all through its best average of houses streets people that subtle something generally thought to be climate but it is notit is something indefinable in the race the turn of its development which effuses behind the whirl of animation study business a happy and joyous public spirit as distinguishd from a sluggish and saturnine one makes me think of the glints we get as in symondss books of the jolly old greek cities indeed there is a good deal of the hellenic in b and the people are getting handsomer toopadded out with freer motions and with color in their faces i never saw although this is not greek so many finelooking grayhaird women at my lecture i caught myself pausing more than once to look at them plentiful everywhere through the audiencehealthy and wifely and motherly and wonderfully charming and beautifuli think such as no time or land but ours could show   my tribute to four poets  april 16a short but pleasant visit to longfellow i am not one of the calling kind but as the author of evangeline kindly took the trouble to come and see me three years ago in camden where i was ill i felt not only the impulse of my own pleasure on that occasion but a duty he was the only particular eminence i called on in boston and i shall not soon forget his litup face and glowing warmth and courtesy in the modes of what is called the old school  and now just here i feel the impulse to interpolate something about the mighty four who stamp this first american century with its birthmarks of poetic literature in a late magazine one of my reviewers who ought to know better speaks of my attitude of contempt and scorn and intolerance toward the leading poetsof my deriding them and preaching their uselessness if anybody cares to know what i thinkand have long thought and avowdabout them i am entirely willing to propound i cant imagine any better luck befalling these states for a poetical beginning and initiation than has come from emerson longfellow bryant and whittier emerson to me stands unmistakably at the head but for the others i am at a loss where to give any precedence each illustrious each rounded each distinctive

to see a collection of j f millets pictures two rapt hours never before have i been so penetrated by this kind of expression i stood long and long before the sower i believe what the picturemen designate the first sower as the artist executed a second copy and a third and some think improved in each but i doubt it there is something in this that could hardly be caught againa sublime murkiness and original pent fury besides this masterpiece there were many others i shall never forget the simple evening scene watering the cow all inimitable all perfect as pictures works of mere art and then it seemd to me with that last impalpable ethic purpose from the artist most likely unconscious to himself which i am always looking for to me all of them told the full story of what went before and necessitated the great french revolutionthe long precedent crushing of the masses of a heroic people into the earth in abject poverty hungerevery right denied humanity attempted to be put back for generationsyet natures force titanic here the stronger and hardier for that repressionwaiting terribly to break forth revengefulthe pressure on the dykes and the bursting at lastthe storming of the bastilethe execution of the king and queenthe tempest of massacres and blood yet who can wonder      could we wish humanity different     could we wish the people made of wood or stone     or that there be no justice in destiny or time  the true france base of all the rest is certainly in these pictures i comprehend fieldpeople reposing the diggers and the angelus in this opinion some folks always think of the french as a small race five or five and a half feet high and ever frivolous and smirking nothing of the sort the bulk of the personnel of france before the revolution was largesized serious industrious as now and simple the revolution and napoleons wars dwarfd the standard of human size but it will come up again if for nothing else i should dwell on my brief boston

custers last rally  went today to see this justfinishd painting by john mulvany who has been out in far dakota on the spot at the forts and among the frontiersmen soldiers and indians for the last two years on purpose to sketch it in from reality or the best that could be got of it sat for over an hour before the picture completely absorbd in the first view a vast canvas i should say twenty or twentytwo feet by twelve all crowded and yet not crowded conveying such a vivid play of color it takes a little time to get used to it there are no tricks there is no throwing of shades in masses it is all at first painfully real overwhelming needs good nerves to look at it forty or fifty figures perhaps more in full finish and detail in the midground with three times that number or more through the restswarms upon swarms of savage sioux in their warbonnets frantic mostly on ponies driving through the background through the smoke like a hurricane of demons a dozen of the figures are wonderful altogether a western autochthonic phase of america the frontiers culminating typical deadly heroic to the uttermostnothing in the books like it nothing in homer nothing in shakspere more grim and

partially wounded blood on the white handkerchief around his head aiming his carbine coolly half kneelinghis body was afterwards found close by custers the slaughterd or halfslaughterd horses for

broadbrimmd western hats the powdersmoke in puffs the dying horses with their rolling eyes almost human in their agony the clouds of warbonneted sioux in the background the figures of custer and cookwith indeed the whole scene dreadful yet with an attraction and beauty that will remain in my memory with all its color and fierce action a certain greek continence pervades it a sunny sky and clear light envelop all there is an almost entire absence of the stock traits of european war pictures the physiognomy of the work is realistic and western i only saw it for an hour or so but it needs to be seen many timesneeds to be studied over and over again i could look on such a work at brief intervals all my life without tiring it is very tonic to me then it has an ethic purpose below all as all great art must have the artist said the sending of the picture abroad probably to london had been talkd of i advised him if it went abroad to take it to paris i think they might appreciate it therenay they certainly would then i would like to show messieur crapeau that some things can be done in america as well as others   some old acquaintancesmemories  aug 16chalk a big mark for today was one of the sayings of an old sportsmanfriend of mine when he had had unusually good luckcome home thoroughly tired but with satisfactory results of fish or birds  well today might warrant such a mark for me everything propitious from the start an hours fresh stimulation coming down ten miles of manhattan island by railroad and 8 oclock stage then an excellent breakfast at pfaffs restaurant 24th street our host himself an old friend of mine quickly appeard on the scene to welcome me and bring up the news and first opening a big fat bottle of the best wine in the cellar talk about

themselves fully confirmd namely big brimming filldup champagneglasses draind in abstracted silence very leisurely to the last drop pfaff is a generous german restaurateur silent stout jolly and i should say the best selecter of champagne in america   a discovery of old age  perhaps the best is always cumulative ones eating and drinking one wants fresh and for the nonce right off and have done with itbut i would not give a straw for that person or poem or friend or city or work of art that was not more grateful the second time than the firstand more still the third nay i do not believe any grandest eligibility ever comes forth at first in my own experience persons poems places characters i discover the best hardly ever at first no absolute rule about it however sometimes suddenly

emerson in a way i couldnt have wishd better or different for nearly two hours he has been placidly sitting where i could see his face in the best light near me mrs ss backparlor well filld with people neighbors many fresh and charming faces women mostly young but some old my friend a b alcott and his daughter louisa were there early a good deal of talk the subject henry thoreausome new glints of his life and fortunes with letters to and from himone of the best by margaret fuller others by horace greeley channing cone from thoreau himself most quaint and interesting no doubt i seemd very stupid to the roomful of company taking hardly any part in the conversation but i had my own pail to milk in as the swiss proverb puts it my seat and the relative arrangement were such that without being rude or anything of the kind i could just look squarely at e which i did a good part of the two hours on entering he had spoken very briefly and politely to several of the company then settled himself in his chair a trifle pushd back and though a listener and apparently an alert one remaind silent through the whole talk and discussion a lady friend quietly took a seat next him to give special attention a good color in his face eyes clear with the wellknown expression of sweetness and the old clearpeering aspect quite the same  next dayseveral hours at es house and dinner there an old familiar house he has been in it thirtyfive years with surroundings furnishment roominess and plain elegance and fullness signifying democratic ease sufficient opulence and an admirable oldfashioned simplicitymodern luxury with its mere sumptuousness and affectation either touchd lightly upon or ignored altogether dinner the same of course the best of the occasion sunday september 18 81 was the sight of e himself as just said a healthy color in the cheeks and good light in the eyes cheery expression and just the amount of talking that best suited namely a word or short phrase only where needed and almost always with a smile besides emerson himself mrs e with their daughter ellen the son edward and his wife with my friend f s and mrs s and others relatives and intimates mrs emerson resuming the subject of the evening before i sat next to her gave me further and fuller information about thoreau who years ago during mr es absence in europe had lived for some time in the family by invitation   other concord notations  though the evening at mr and mrs sanborns and the memorable family dinner at mr and mrs emersons have most pleasantly and permanently filld my memory i must not slight other notations of concord i went to the old manse walkd through the ancient garden enterd the rooms noted the quaintness the unkempt grass and bushes the little panes in the windows the low ceilings the spicy smell the creepers embowering the light went to the concord battle ground which is close by scannd frenchs statue the minute man read emersons poetic inscription on the base lingerd a long while on the bridge and stoppd by the grave of the unnamed british soldiers buried there the day after the fight in april 75 then riding on thanks to my friend miss m and her spirited white ponies she driving them a half hour at hawthornes and thoreaus graves i got out and went up of course on foot and stood a long while and ponderd they lie close together in a pleasant wooded spot well up the cemetery hill sleepy hollow the flat surface of the first was densely coverd by myrtle with a border of arborvitae and the other had a brown headstone moderately elaborate with inscriptions by henrys side lies his brother john of whom much was expected but he died young then to walden pond that beautiful embowerd sheet of water and spent over an hour there on the spot in the woods where thoreau had his solitary house is now quite a cairn of stones to mark the place i too carried one and deposited on the heap as we drove back saw the school of philosophy but it was shut up and i would not have it opend for me near by stoppd at the house of wt harris the hegelian who came out and we had a pleasant chat while i sat in the wagon i shall not soon forget those concord drives and especially that charming sunday forenoon one with my friend miss m and the white ponies   boston commonmore of emerson  oct 1013i spend a good deal of time on the common these delicious days and nightsevery midday from 1130 to about 1and almost every sunset another hour i know all the big trees especially the old elms along tremont and beacon streets and have come to a sociable silent understanding with most of them in the sunlit air yet crispycool enough as i saunter along the wide unpaved walks up and down this breadth by beacon street between these same old elms i walkd for two hours of a bright sharp february midday twentyone years ago with emerson then in his prime keen physically and morally magnetic armd at every point and when he chose wielding the emotional just as well as the intellectual during those two hours he was the talker and i the listener it was an argumentstatement reconnoitring review attack and pressing home like an army corps in order artillery cavalry infantry of all that could be said against that part and a main part in the construction of my poems children of adam more precious than gold to me that dissertionit afforded me ever after

along between philadelphia and camden is worth weaving into an item it was full tide a fair breeze from the southwest the water of a pale tawny color and just enough motion to make things frolicsome and lively add to these an approaching sunset of unusual splendor a broad tumble of clouds with much golden haze and profusion of beaming shaft and dazzle in the midst of all in the clear drab of the afternoon light there steamd up the river the large new boat the wenonah as pretty an object as you could wish to see lightly and swiftly skimming along all trim and white coverd with flags transparent red and blue streaming out in the breeze only a new ferryboat and yet in its fitness comparable with the prettiest product of natures cunning and rivaling it high up in the transparent ether gracefully balanced and circled four or five great sea hawks while here below amid the pomp and picturesqueness of sky and river swam this creation of artificial beauty and motion and power in its way no less perfect   death of longfellow  camden april 82i have just returnd from an old forest haunt where i love to go occasionally away from parlors pavements and the newspapers and magazinesand where of a clear forenoon deep in the shade of pines and cedars and a tangle of old laureltrees and vines the news of longfellows death first reachd me for want of anything better let me lightly twine a sprig of the sweet groundivy trailing so plentifully through the dead leaves at my feet with reflections of that half hour alone there in the silence and lay it as my contribution on the dead bards grave  longfellow in his voluminous works seems to me not only to be eminent in the style and forms of poetical expression that mark the present age an idiosyncrasy almost a sickness of verbal melody but to bring what is always dearest as poetry to the general human heart and taste and probably must be so in the nature of things he is certainly the sort of bard and counteractant most needed for our materialistic selfassertive moneyworshipping anglosaxon races and especially for the present age in americaan age tyrannically regulated with reference to the manufacturer the merchant the financier the politician and the day workmanfor whom and among whom he comes as the poet of melody courtesy deferencepoet of the mellow twilight of the past in italy germany spain and in northern europepoet of all sympathetic gentlenessand universal poet of women and young people i should have to think long if i were askd to name the man who has done more and in more valuable directions for america  i doubt if there ever was before such a fine intuitive judge and selecter of poems his translations of many german and scandinavian pieces are said to be better than the vernaculars he does not urge or lash his influence is like good drink or air he is not tepid either but always vital with flavor motion grace he strikes a splendid average and does not sing exceptional passions or humanitys jagged escapades he is not revolutionary brings nothing offensive or new does not deal hard blows on the contrary his songs soothe and heal or if they excite it is a healthy and agreeable excitement his very anger is gentle is at second hand as in the quadroon girl and the witnesses  there is no undue element of pensiveness in longfellows strains even in the early translation the manrique the movement is as of strong and steady wind or tide holding up and buoying death is not avoided through his many themes but there is something almost winning in his original verses and renderings on that dread subjectas closing the happiest land dispute      and then the landlords daughter       up to heaven raisd her hand     and said ye may no more contend       there lies the happiest land  to the ungracious complaintcharge of his want of racy nativity and special originality i shall only say that america and the world may well be reverently thankfulcan never be thankful enoughfor any such singingbird vouchsafed out of the centuries without asking that the notes be different from those of other songsters adding what i have heard longfellow himself say that ere the new world can be worthily original and announce herself and her own heroes she must be well saturated with the originality of others and respectfully consider the heroes that lived before agamemnon   starting newspapers  reminiscences from the camden courier as i sat taking my evening sail across the delaware in the staunch ferryboat beverly a night or two ago i was joind by two young reporter friends i have a message for you said one of them the c folks told me to say they would like a piece signd by your name to go in their first number can you do it for them i guess so said i what might it be about well anything on newspapers or perhaps what youve done yourself starting them and off the boys went for we had reachd the philadelphia side the hour was fine and mild the bright halfmoon shining venus with excess of splendor just setting in the west and the great scorpion rearing its length more than half up in the southeast as i crossd leisurely for an hour in the pleasant nightscene my young friends words brought up quite a string of reminiscences  i commenced when i was but a boy of eleven or twelve writing sentimental bits for the old long island patriot in brooklyn this was about 1832 soon after i had a piece or two in george p morriss then celebrated and fashionable mirror of new york city i remember with what halfsuppressd excitement i used to watch for the big fat redfaced slowmoving very old english carrier who distributed the mirror in brooklyn and when i got one opening and cutting the leaves with trembling fingers how it made my heart doublebeat to see my piece on the pretty white paper in nice type  my first real venture was the long islander in my own beautiful town of huntington in 1839 i was about twenty years old i had been teaching country school for two or three years in various parts of suffolk and queens counties but liked printing had been at it while a lad learnd the trade of compositor and was encouraged to start a paper in the region where i was born i went to new york bought a press and types hired some little help but did most of the work myself including the presswork everything seemd turning out well only my own restlessness prevented me gradually establishing a permanent property there i bought a good horse and every week went all round the country serving my papers devoting one day and night to it i never had happier jauntsgoing over to south side to babylon down the south road across to smithtown and comac and back home the experiences of those jaunts the dear oldfashiond farmers and their wives the stops by the hayfields the hospitality nice dinners occasional evenings the girls the rides through the brush come up in my memory to this day  i next went to the aurora daily in new york citya sort of free lance also wrote regularly for the tattler an evening paper with these and a little outside work i was occupied off and on until i went to edit the brooklyn eagle where for two years i had one of the pleasantest sits of my lifea good owner good pay and easy work and hours the troubles in the democratic party broke forth about those times 184849 and i split off with the radicals which led to rows with the boss and the party and i lost my place  being now out of a job i was offerd impromptu it happend between the acts one night in the lobby of the old broadway theatre near pearl street new york city a good chance to go down to new orleans on the staff of the crescent a daily to be started there with plenty of capital behind it one of the owners who was north buying material met me walking in the lobby and though that was our first acquaintance after fifteen minutes talk and a drink we made a formal bargain and he paid me two hundred dollars down to bind the contract and bear my expenses to new orleans i started two days afterwards had a good leisurely time as the paper wasnt to be out in three weeks i enjoyd my journey and louisiana life much returning to brooklyn a year or two afterward i started the freeman first as a weekly then daily pretty soon the secession war broke out and i too got drawn in the current southward and spent the following three years there as memorandized preceding  besides starting them as aforementioned i have had to do one time or another during my life with a long list of papers at divers places sometimes under queer circumstances during the war the hospitals at washington among other means of amusement printed a little sheet among themselves surrounded by wounds and death the armory square gazette to which i contributed the same long afterward casually to a paperi think it was calld the jimplecuteout in colorado where i stoppd at the time when i was in quebec province in canada in 1880 i went into the queerest little old french printingoffice near tadousac it was far more primitive and ancient than my camden friend william kurtzs place up on federal street i remember as a youngster several characteristic old printers of a kind hard to be seen these days   the great unrest of which we are part  my thoughts went floating on vast and mystic currents as i sat today in solitude and halfshade by the creekreturning

questions of the day about twothirds of the time i am quite comfortable what mentality i ever had remains entirely unaffected though physically i am a halfparalytic and likely to be so long as i live but the principal object of my life seems to have been accomplishdi have the most devoted and ardent of friends and affectionate relativesand of enemies i really make no account   after trying a certain book  i tried to read a beautifully printed and scholarly volume on the theory of poetry received by mail this morning from englandbut gave it up at last for a bad job here are some capricious pencillings that followd as i find them in my notes  in youth and maturity poems are charged with sunshine and varied pomp of day but as the soul more and more takes precedence the sensuous still included the dusk becomes the poets atmosphere i too have sought and ever seek the brilliant sun and make my songs according but as i grow old the halflights of evening are far more to me  the play of imagination with the sensuous objects of nature for symbols and faithwith love and pride as the unseen impetus and movingpower of all make up the curious chessgame of a poem  common teachers or critics are always asking what does it mean symphony of fine musician or sunset or seawaves rolling up the beachwhat do they mean undoubtedly in the most subtleelusive sense they mean somethingas love does and religion does and the best poembut who shall fathom and define those meanings i do not intend this as a warrant for wildness and frantic escapadesbut to justify the souls frequent joy in what cannot be defined to the intellectual part or to calculation  at its best poetic lore is like what may be heard of conversation in the dusk from speakers far or hid of which we get only a few broken murmurs what is not gatherd is far moreperhaps the main thing  grandest poetic passages are only to be taken at free removes as we sometimes look for stars at night not by gazing directly toward them but off one side  to a poetic student and friendi only seek to put you in rapport your own brain heart evolution must not only understand the matter but largely supply it   final confessionsliterary tests  so draw near their end these garrulous notes there have doubtless occurrd some repetitions technical errors in the consecutiveness of dates in the minutiae of botanical astronomical c exactness and perhaps elsewherefor in gathering up writing peremptorily dispatching copy this hot weather last of july and through august 82 and delaying not the printers i have had to hurry along no time to spare but in the deepest veracity of allin reflections of objects scenes natures outpourings to my senses and receptivity as they seemd to mein the work of giving those who care for it some authentic glints specimendays of my lifeand in the bona fide spirit and relations from author to reader on all the subjects designd and as far as they go i feel to make unmitigated claims  the synopsis of my early life long island new york city and so forth and the diaryjottings in the secession war tell their own story my plan in starting what constitutes most of the middle of the book was originally for hints and data of a naturepoem that should carry ones experiences a few hours commencing at noonflush and so through the afterpart of the dayi suppose led to such idea by my own lifeafternoon now arrived but i soon found i could move at more ease by giving the narrative at first hand then there is a humiliating lesson one learns in serene hours of a fine day or night nature seems to look on all fixedup poetry and art as something almost impertinent  thus i went on years following various seasons and areas spinning forth my thought beneath the night and stars or as i was confined to my room by halfsickness or at midday looking out upon the sea or far north steaming over the saguenays black breast jotting all down in the loosest sort of chronological order and here printing from my impromptu notes hardly even the seasons groupd together or anything correctedso afraid of dropping what smack of outdoors or sun or starlight might cling to the lines i dared not try to meddle with or smooth them every now and then not often but for a foil i carried a book in my pocketor perhaps tore out from some broken or cheap edition a bunch of loose leaves most always had something of the sort ready but only took it out when the mood demanded in that way utterly out of reach of literary conventions i reread many authors  i cannot divest my appetite of literature yet i find myself eventually trying it all by naturefirst premises many call it but really the crowning results of all laws tallies and proofs has it never occurd to any one how the last deciding tests applicable to a book are entirely outside of technical and grammatical ones and that any truly firstclass production has little or nothing to do with the rules and calibres of ordinary critics or the bloodless chalk of allibones dictionary i have fancied the ocean and the daylight the mountain and the forest putting their spirit in a judgment on our books i have fancied some disembodied human soul giving its verdict   nature and democracymorality  democracy most of all affiliates with the open air is sunny and hardy and sane only with naturejust as much as art is something is required to temper bothto check them restrain them from excess morbidity i have wanted before departure to bear special testimony to a very old lesson and requisite american democracy in its myriad personalities in factories workshops stores officesthrough the dense streets and houses of cities and all their manifold sophisticated lifemust either be fibred vitalized by regular contact with outdoor light and air and growths farmscenes animals fields trees birds sunwarmth and free skies or it will certainly dwindle and pale we cannot have grand races of mechanics work people and commonalty the only specific purpose of america on any less terms i conceive of no flourishing and heroic elements of democracy in the united states or of democracy maintaining itself at all without the natureelement forming a main partto be its healthelement and beautyelementto really underlie the whole politics sanity religion and art of the new world  finally the morality virtue said marcus aurelius what is it only a living and enthusiastic sympathy with nature perhaps indeed the efforts of the true poets founders religions literatures all ages have been and ever will be our time and times to come essentially the sameto bring people back from their persistent strayings and sickly abstractions to the costless average divine original concrete      collect     one or two index items   though the ensuing collect and preceding specimen days are both largely from memoranda already existing the hurried peremptory needs of copy for the printers already referrd tothe musicians story of a composer up in a garret rushing the middle body and last of his score together while the fiddlers are playing the first parts down in the concertroomof this haste while quite willing to get the consequent stimulus of life and motion i am sure there must have resulted sundry technical errors if any are too glaring they will be corrected in a future edition  a special word about pieces in early youth at the end on jaunts over long island as boy and young fellow nearly half a century ago i heard of or came across in my own experience characters true occurrences incidents which i tried my prentice hand at recordingi was then quite an abolitionist and advocate of the temperance and anticapitalpunishment causesand publishd during occasional visits to new york city a majority of the sketches appeard first in the democratic review others in the columbian magazine or the american review of that period my serious wish were to have all those crude and boyish pieces quietly droppd in oblivionbut to avoid the annoyance of their surreptitious issue as lately announced from outsiders i have with some qualms tackd them on here a doughface song came out first in the evening postbloodmoney and wounded in the

lessons of nature through the universe are perhaps the lessons of variety and freedom the same present the greatest lessons also in new world politics and progress if a man were askd for instance the distinctive points contrasting modern european and american political and other life with the old asiatic cultus as lingeringbequeathd yet in china and turkey he might find the amount of them in john stuart mills profound essay on liberty in the future where he demands two main constituents or substrata for a truly grand nationality1st a large variety of characterand 2d full play for human nature to expand itself in numberless and even conflicting directionsseems to be for general humanity much like the influences that make up in their limitless field that perennial healthaction of the air we call the weatheran infinite number of currents and forces and contributions and temperatures and crosspurposes whose ceaseless play of counterpart upon counterpart brings constant restoration and vitality with this thoughtand not for itself alone but all it necessitates and draws after itlet me begin my speculations  america filling the present with greatest deeds and problems cheerfully accepting the past including feudalism as indeed the present is but the legitimate birth of the past including feudalism counts as i reckon for her justification and success for who as yet dare claim success almost entirely on the future nor is that hope unwarranted today ahead though dimly yet we see in vistas a copious sane gigantic offspring for our new world i consider far less important for what it has done or what it is than for results to come sole among nationalities these states have assumed the task to put in forms of lasting power and practicality on areas of amplitude rivaling the operations of the physical kosmos the moral political speculations of ages long long deferrd the democratic republican principle and the theory of development and perfection by voluntary standards and selfreliance who else indeed except the united states in history so far have accepted in unwitting faith and as we now see stand act upon and go security for these things but preluding no longer let me strike the keynote of the following strain first premising that though the passages of it have been written at widely different times it is in fact a collection of memoranda perhaps for future designers comprehenders and though it may be open to the charge of one part contradicting anotherfor there are opposite sides to the great question of democracy as to every great questioni feel the parts harmoniously blended in my own realization and convictions and present them to be read only in such oneness each page and each claim and assertion modified and temperd by the others bear in mind too that they are not the result of studying up in political economy but of the ordinary sense observing wandering among men these states these stirring years of war and peace i will not gloss over the appaling dangers of universal suffrage in the united states in fact it is to admit and face these dangers i am writing to him or her within whose thought rages the battle advancing retreating between democracys convictions aspirations and the peoples crudeness vice caprices i mainly write this essay i shall use the words america and democracy as convertible terms not an ordinary one is the issue the united states are destined either to surmount the gorgeous history of feudalism or else prove the most tremendous failure of time not the least doubtful am i on any prospects of their material success the triumphant future of their business geographic and productive departments on larger scales and in more varieties than ever is certain in those respects the republic must soon if she does not already outstrip all examples hitherto afforded and dominate the world20  admitting all this with the priceless value of our political institutions general suffrage and fully acknowledging the latest widest opening of the doors i say that far deeper than these what finally and only is to make of our western world a nationality superior to any hither known and outtopping the past must be vigorous yet unsuspected literatures perfect personalities and sociologies original transcendental and expressing what in highest sense are not yet expressd at all democracy and the modern with these and out of these i promulge new races of teachers and of perfect women indispensable to endow the birthstock of a new world for feudalism caste the ecclesiastic traditions though palpably retreating from political institutions still hold essentially by their spirit even in this country entire possession of the more important fields indeed the very subsoil of education and of social standards and literature  i say that democracy can never prove itself beyond cavil until it founds and luxuriantly grows its own forms of art poems schools theology displacing all that exists or that has been produced anywhere in the past under opposite influences it is curious to me that while so many voices pens minds in the press lecturerooms in our congress c are discussing intellectual topics pecuniary dangers legislative problems the suffrage tariff and labor questions and the various business and benevolent needs of america with propositions remedies often worth deep attention there is one need a hiatus the profoundest that no eye seems to perceive no voice to state our fundamental want today in the united states with closest amplest reference to present conditions and to the future is of a class and the clear idea of a class of native authors literatuses far different far higher in grade than any yet known sacerdotal modern fit to cope with our occasions lands permeating the whole mass of american mentality taste belief breathing into it a new breath of life giving it decision affecting politics far more than the popular superficial suffrage with results inside and underneath the elections of presidents or congressesradiating begetting appropriate teachers schools manners and as its grandest result accomplishing what neither the schools nor the churches and their clergy have hitherto accomplishd and without which this nation will no more stand permanently soundly than a house will stand without a substratum a religious and moral character beneath the political and productive and intellectual bases of the states for know you not dear earnest reader that the people of our land may all read and write and may all possess the right to voteand yet the main things may be entirely lackingand this to suggest them  viewd today from a point of view sufficiently overarching the problem of humanity all over the civilized world is social and religious and is to be finally met and treated by literature the priest departs the divine literatus comes never was anything more wanted than today and here in the states the poet of the modern is wanted or the great literatus of the modern at all times perhaps the central point in any nation and that whence it is itself really swayd the most and whence it sways others is its national literature especially its archetypal poems above all previous lands a great original literature is surely to become the justification and reliance in some respects the sole reliance of american democracy  few are aware how the great literature penetrates all gives hue to all shapes aggregates and individuals and after subtle ways with irresistible power constructs sustains demolishes at will why tower in reminiscence above all the nations of the earth two special lands petty in themselves yet inexpressibly gigantic beautiful columnar immortal judah lives and greece immortal lives in a couple of poems  nearer than this it is not generally realized but it is true as the genius of greece and all the sociology personality politics and religion of those wonderful states resided in their literature or esthetics that what was afterwards the main support of european chivalry the feudal ecclesiastical dynastic world over thereforming its osseous structure holding it together for hundreds thousands of years preserving its flesh and bloom giving it form decision rounding it out and so saturating it in the conscious and unconscious blood breed belief and intuitions of men that it still prevails powerful to this day in defiance of the mighty changes of timewas its literature permeating to the very marrow especially that major part its enchanting songs ballads and poems21  to the ostent of the senses and eyes i know the influences which stamp the worlds history are wars uprisings or downfalls of dynasties changeful movements of trade important inventions navigation military or civil governments advent of powerful personalities conquerors etc these of course play their part yet it may be a single new thought imagination abstract principle even literary style fit for the time put in shape by some great literatus and projected among mankind may duly cause changes growths removals greater than the longest and bloodiest war or the most stupendous merely political dynastic or commercial overturn  in short as though it may not be realized it is strictly true that a few firstclass poets philosophs and authors have substantially settled and given status to the entire religion education law sociology c of the hitherto civilized world by tinging and often creating the atmospheres out of which they have arisen such also must stamp and more than ever stamp the interior and real democratic construction of this american continent today and days to come remember also this fact of difference that while through the antique and through the mediaeval ages highest thoughts and ideals realized themselves and their expression made its way by other arts as much as or even more than by technical literature not open to the mass of persons or even to the majority of eminent persons such literature in our day and for current purposes is not only more eligible than all the other arts put together but has become the only general means of morally influencing the world painting sculpture and the dramatic theatre it would seem no longer play an indispensable or even important part in the workings and mediumship of intellect utility or even high esthetics architecture remains doubtless with capacities and a real future then music the combiner nothing more spiritual nothing more sensuous a god yet completely human advances prevails holds highest place supplying in certain wants and quarters what nothing else could supply yet in the civilization of today it is undeniable that over all the arts literature dominates serves beyond allshapes the character of church and schoolor at any rate is capable of doing so including the literature of science its scope is indeed unparalleld  before proceeding further it were perhaps well to discriminate on certain points literature tills its crops in many fields and some may flourish while others lag what i say in these vistas has its main bearing on imaginative literature especially poetry the stock of all in the department of science and the specialty of journalism there appear in these states promises perhaps fulfilments of highest earnestness reality and life these of course are modern but in the region of imaginative spinal and essential attributes something equivalent to creation is for our age and lands imperatively demanded for not only is it not enough that the new blood new frame of democracy shall be vivified and held together merely by political means superficial suffrage legislation c but it is clear to me that unless it goes deeper gets at least as firm and as warm a hold in mens hearts emotions and belief as in their days feudalism or ecclesiasticism and inaugurates its own perennial sources welling from the centre forever its strength will be defective its growth doubtful and its main charm wanting i suggest therefore the possibility should some two or three really original american poets perhaps artists or lecturers arise mounting the horizon like planets stars of the first magnitude that from their eminence fusing contributions races far localities c together they would give more compaction and more moral identity the quality today most needed to these states than all its constitutions legislative and judicial ties and all its hitherto political warlike or materialistic experiences as for instance there could hardly happen anything that would more serve the states with all their variety of origins their diverse climes cities standards c than possessing an aggregate of heroes characters exploits sufferings prosperity or misfortune glory or disgrace common to all typical of allno less but even greater would it be to possess the aggregation of a cluster of mighty poets artists teachers fit for us national expressers comprehending and effusing for the men and women of the states what is universal native common to all inland and seaboard northern and southern the historians say of ancient greece with her everjealous autonomies cities and states that the only positive unity she ever ownd or receivd was the sad unity of a common subjection at the last to foreign conquerors subjection aggregation of that sort is impossible to america but the fear of conflicting and irreconcilable interiors and the lack of a common skeleton knitting all close continually haunts me or if it does not nothing is plainer than the need a long period to come of a fusion of the states into the only reliable identity the moral and artistic one for i say the true nationality of the states the genuine union when we come to a moral crisis is and is to be after all neither the written law nor as is generally supposed either selfinterest or common pecuniary or material objectsbut the fervid and tremendous idea melting everything else with resistless heat and solving all lesser and definite distinctions in vast indefinite spiritual emotional power  it may be claimd and i admit the weight of the claim that common and general worldly prosperity and a populace welltodo and with all lifes material comforts is the main thing and is enough it may be argued that our republic is in performance really enacting today the grandest arts poems c by beating up the wilderness into fertile farms and in her railroads ships machinery c and it may be askd are these not better indeed for america than any utterances even of greatest rhapsode artist or literatus  i too hail those achievements with pride and joy then answer that the soul of man will not with such onlynay not with such at allbe finally satisfied but needs what standing on these and on all things as the feet stand on the ground is addressd to the loftiest to itself alone  out of such considerations such truths arises for treatment in these vistas the important question of character of an american stockpersonality with literatures and arts for outlets and returnexpressions and of course to correspond within outlines common to all to these the main affair the thinkers of the united states in general so acute have either given feeblest attention or have remaind and remain in a state of somnolence  for my part i would alarm and caution even the political and business reader and to the utmost extent against the prevailing delusion that the establishment of free political institutions and plentiful intellectual smartness with general good order physical plenty industry c desirable and precious advantages as they all are do of themselves determine and yield to our experiment of democracy the fruitage of success with such advantages at present fully or almost fully possessdthe union just issued victorious from the struggle with the only foes it need ever fear namely those within itself the interior ones and with unprecedented materialistic advancementsociety in these states is cankerd crude superstitious and rotten political or lawmade society is and private or voluntary society is also in any vigor the element of the moral conscience the most important the verteber to state or man seems to me either entirely lacking or seriously enfeebled or ungrown  i say we had best look our times and lands searchingly in the face like a physician diagnosing some deep disease never was there perhaps more hollowness at heart than at present and here in the united states genuine belief seems to have left us the underlying principles of the states are not honestly believd in for all this hectic glow and these melodramatic screamings nor is humanity itself believd in what penetrating eye does not everywhere see through the mask the spectacle is appaling we live in an atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout the men believe not in the women nor the women in the men a scornful superciliousness rules in literature the aim of all the litterateurs is to find something to make fun of a lot of churches sects c the most dismal phantasms i know usurp the name of religion conversation is a mass of badinage from deceit in the spirit the mother of all false deeds the offspring is already incalculable an acute and candid person in the revenue department in washington who is led by the course of his employment to regularly visit the cities north south and west to investigate frauds has talkd much with me about his discoveries the depravity of the business classes of our country is not less than has been supposed but infinitely greater the official services of america national state and municipal in all their branches and departments except the judiciary are saturated in corruption bribery falsehood maladministration and the judiciary is tainted the great cities reek with respectable as much as nonrespectable robbery and scoundrelism in fashionable life flippancy tepid amours weak infidelism small aims or no aims at all only to kill time in business this alldevouring modern word business the one sole object is by any means pecuniary gain the magicians serpent in the fable ate up all the other serpents and moneymaking is our magicians serpent remaining today sole master of the field the best class we show is but a mob of fashionably dressd speculators and vulgarians true indeed behind this fantastic farce enacted on the visible stage of society solid things and stupendous labors are to be discoverd existing crudely and going on in the background to advance and tell themselves in time yet the truths are none the less terrible i say that our new world democracy however great a success in uplifting the masses out of their sloughs in materialistic development products and in a certain highlydeceptive superficial popular intellectuality is so far an almost complete failure in its social aspects and in really grand religious moral literary and esthetic results in vain do we march with unprecedented strides to empire so colossal outvying the antique beyond alexanders beyond the proudest sway of rome in vain have we annexd texas california alaska and reach north for canada and south for cuba it is as if we were somehow being endowd with a vast and more and more thoroughlyappointed body and then left with little or no soul  let me illustrate further as i write with current observations localities c the subject is important and will bear repetition after an absence i am now again september 1870 in new york city and brooklyn on a few weeks vacation the splendor picturesqueness and oceanic amplitude and rush of these great cities the unsurpassd situation rivers and bay sparkling seatides costly and lofty new buildings facades of marble and iron of original grandeur and elegance of design with the masses of gay color the preponderance of white and blue the flags flying the endless ships the tumultuous streets broadway the heavy low musical roar hardly ever intermitted even at night the jobbers houses the rich shops the wharves the great central park and the brooklyn park of hills as i wander among them this beautiful fall weather musing watching absorbingthe assemblages of the citizens in their groups conversations trades evening amusements or along the byquartersthese i say and the like of these completely satisfy my senses of power fulness motion c and give me through such senses and appetites and through my esthetic conscience a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment always and more and more as i cross the east and north rivers the ferries or with the pilots in their pilothouses or pass an hour in wall street or the gold exchange i realize if we must admit such partialisms that not nature alone is great in her fields of freedom and the open air in her storms the shows of night and day the mountains forests seasbut in the artificial the work of man too is equally greatin this profusion of teeming humanityin these ingenuities streets goods houses shipsthese hurrying feverish electric crowds of men their complicated business genius not least among the geniuses and all this mighty manythreaded wealth and industry concentrated here  but sternly discarding shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of the general superficial effect coming down to what is of the only real importance personalities and examining minutely we question we ask are there indeed men here worthy the name are there athletes are there perfect women to match the generous material luxuriance is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners are there crops of fine youths and majestic old persons are there arts worthy freedom and a rich people is there a great moral and religious civilizationthe only justification of a great material one confess that to severe eyes using the moral microscope upon humanity a sort of dry and flat sahara appears these cities crowded with petty grotesques malformations phantoms playing meaningless antics  confess that everywhere in shop street church theatre barroom official chair are pervading flippancy and vulgarity low cunning infidelityeverywhere the youth puny impudent foppish prematurely ripeeverywhere an abnormal libidinousness unhealthy forms male female painted padded dyed chignond muddy complexions bad blood the capacity for good motherhood deceasing or deceasd shallow notions of beauty with a range of manners or rather lack of manners considering the advantages enjoyd probably the meanest to be seen in the world22  of all this and these lamentable conditions to breathe into them the breath recuperative of sane and heroic life i say a new founded literature not merely to copy and reflect existing surfaces or pander to what is called tastenot only to amuse pass away time celebrate the beautiful the refined the past or exhibit technical rhythmic or grammatical dexteritybut a literature underlying life religious consistent with science handling the elements and forces with competent power teaching and training menand as perhaps the most precious of its results achieving the entire redemption of woman out of these incredible holds and webs of silliness millinery and every kind of dyspeptic depletionand thus insuring to the states a strong and sweet female race a race of perfect mothersis what is needed  and now in the full conception of these facts and points and all that they infer pro and conwith yet unshaken faith in the elements of the american masses the composites of both sexes and even considerd as individualsand ever recognizing in them the broadest bases of the best literary and esthetic appreciationi proceed with my speculations vistas  first let us see what we can make out of a brief general sentimental consideration of political democracy and whence it has arisen with regard to some of its current features as an aggregate and as the basic structure of our future literature and authorship we shall it is true quickly and continually find the originidea of the singleness of man individualism asserting itself and cropping forth even from the opposite ideas but the mass or lump character for imperative reasons is to be ever carefully weighd borne in mind and provided for only from it and from its proper regulation and potency comes the other comes the chance of individualism the two are contradictory but our task is to reconcile them23  the political history of the past may be summd up as having grown out of what underlies the words order safety caste and especially out of the need of some prompt deciding authority and of cohesion at all cost leaping time we come to the period within the memory of people now living when as from some lair where they had slumberd long accumulating wrath sprang up and are yet active 1790 and on eyen to the present 1870 those noisy eructations destructive iconoclasms a fierce sense of wrongs amid which moves the form well known in modern history in the old world staind with much blood and markd by savage reactionary clamors and demands these bear mostly as on one inclosing point of need  for after the rest is saidafter the many timehonord and really true things for subordination experience rights of property c have been listend to and acquiesced inafter the valuable and wellsettled statement of our duties and relations in society is thoroughly connd over and exhaustedit remains to bring forward and modify everything else with the idea of that something a man is last precious consolation of the drudging poor standing apart from all else divine in his own right and a woman in hers sole and untouchable by any canons of authority or any rule derived from precedent statesafety the acts of legislatures or even from what is called religion modesty or art the radiation of this truth is the key of the most significant doings of our immediately preceding three centuries and has been the political genesis and life of america advancing visibly it still more advances invisibly underneath the fluctuations of the expressions of society as well as the movements of the politics of the leading nations of the world we see steadily pressing ahead and strengthening itself even in the midst of immense tendencies toward aggregation this image of completeness in separatism of individual personal dignity of a single person either male or female characterized in the main not from extrinsic acquirements or position but in the pride of himself or herself alone and as an eventual conclusion and summing up or else the entire scheme of things is aimless a cheat a crash the simple idea that the last best dependence is to be upon humanity itself and its own inherent normal fullgrown qualities without any superstitious support whatever this idea of perfect individualism it is indeed that deepest tinges and gives character to the idea of the aggregate for it is mainly or altogether to serve independent separatism that we favor a strong generalization consolidation as it is to give the best vitality and freedom to the rights of the states every bit as important as the right of nationality the union that we insist on the identity of the union at all hazards  the purpose of democracysupplanting old belief in the necessary absoluteness of establishd dynastic rulership temporal ecclesiastical and scholastic as furnishing the only security against chaos crime and ignoranceis through many transmigrations and amid endless ridicules arguments and ostensible failures to illustrate at all hazards this doctrine or theory that man properly traind in sanest highest freedom may and must become a law and series of laws unto himself surrounding and providing for not only his own personal control but all his relations to other individuals and to the state and that while other theories as in the past histories of nations have proved wise enough and indispensable perhaps for their conditions this as matters now stand in our civilized world is the only scheme worth working from as warranting results like those of natures laws reliable when once establishd to carry on themselves  the argument of the matter is extensive and we admit by no means all on one side what we shall offer will be far far from sufficient but while leaving unsaid much that should properly even prepare the way for the treatment of this manysided question of political liberty equality or republicanismleaving the whole history and consideration of the feudal plan and its products embodying humanity its politics and civilization through the retrospect of past time which plan and products indeed make up all of the past and a large part of the presentleaving unanswerd at least by any specific and local answer many a wellwrought argument and instance and many a conscientious declamatory cry and warningas very lately from an eminent and venerable person abroad24things problems full of doubt dread suspense not new to me but old occupiers of many an anxious hour in citys din or nights silence we still may give a page or so whose drift is opportune time alone can finally answer these things but as a substitute in passing let us even if fragmentarily throw forth a short direct or indirect suggestion of the premises of that other plan in the new spirit under the new forms started here in our america  as to the political section of democracy which introduces and breaks ground for further and vaster sections few probably are the minds even in these republican states that fully comprehend the aptness of that phrase the government of the people by the people for the people which we inherit from the lips of abraham lincoln a formula whose verbal shape is homely wit but whose scope includes both the totality and all minutiae of the lesson  the people like our huge earth itself which to ordinary scansion is full of vulgar contradictions and offence man viewed in the lump displeases and is a constant puzzle and affront to the merely educated classes the rare cosmical artistmind lit with the infinite alone confronts his manifold and oceanic qualitiesbut taste intelligence and culture socalled have been against the masses and remain so there is plenty of glamour about the most damnable crimes and hoggish meannesses special and general of the feudal and dynastic world over there with its personnel of lords and queens and courts so welldressd and so handsome but the people are ungrammatical untidy and their sins gaunt and illbred  literature strictly considerd has never recognized the people and whatever may be said does not today speaking generally the tendencies of literature as hitherto pursued have been to make mostly critical and querulous men it seems as if so far there were some natural repugnance between a literary and professional life and the rude rank spirit of the democracies there is in later literature a treatment of benevolence a charity business rife enough it is true but i know nothing more rare even in this country than a fit scientific estimate and reverent appreciation of the peopleof their measureless wealth of latent power and capacity their vast artistic contrasts of lights and shadeswith in america their entire reliability in emergencies and a certain breadth of historic grandeur of peace or war far surpassing all the vaunted samples of bookheroes or any haut ton coteries in all the records of the world  the movements of the late secession war and their results to any sense that studies well and comprehends them show that popular democracy whatever its faults and dangers practically justifies itself beyond the proudest claims and wildest hopes of its enthusiasts probably no future age can know but i well know how the gist of this fiercest and most resolute of the worlds warlike contentions resided exclusively in the unnamed unknown rank and file and how the brunt of its labor of death was to all essential purposes volunteerd the people of their own choice fighting dying for their own idea insolently attackd by the secessionslavepower and its very existence imperild descending to detail entering any of the armies and mixing with the private soldiers we see and have seen august spectacles we have seen the alacrity with which the americanborn populace the peaceablest and most goodnatured race in the world and the most personally independent and intelligent and the least fitted to submit to the irksomeness and exasperation of regimental discipline sprang at the first tap of the drum to armsnot for gain nor even glory nor to repel invasionbut for an emblem a mere abstractionfor the life the safety of the flag we have seen the unequald docility and obedience of these soldiers we have seen them tried long and long by hopelessness mismanagement and by defeat have seen the incredible slaughter toward or through which the armies as at first fredericksburg and afterward at the wilderness still unhesitatingly obeyd orders to advance we have seen them in trench or crouching behind breastwork or tramping in deep mud or amid pouring rain or thickfalling snow or under forced marches in hottest summer as on the road to get to gettysburgvast suffocating swarms divisions corps with every single man so grimed and black with sweat and dust his own mother would not have known himhis clothes all dirty staind and torn with sour accumulated sweat for perfumemany a comrade perhaps a brother sunstruck staggering out dying by the roadside of exhaustionyet the great bulk bearing steadily on cheery enough hollowbellied from hunger but sinewy with unconquerable resolution  we have seen this race proved by wholesale by drearier yet more fearful teststhe wound the amputation the shatterd face or limb the slow hot fever long impatient anchorage in bed and all the forms of maiming operation and disease alas america have we seen though only in her early youth already to hospital brought there have we watchd these soldiers many of them only boys in yearsmarkd their decorum their religious nature and fortitude and their sweet affection wholesale truly for at the front and through the camps in countless tents stood the regimental brigade and division hospitals while everywhere amid the land in or near cities rose clusters of huge whitewashd crowded onestory wooden barracks and there ruled agony with bitter scourge yet seldom brought a cry and there stalkd death by day and night along the narrow aisles between the rows of cots or by the blankets on the ground and touchd lightly many a poor sufferer often with blessed welcome touch  i know not whether i shall be understood but i realize that it is finally from what i learnd personally mixing in such scenes that i am now penning these pages one night in the gloomiest period of the war in the patentoffice hospital in washington city as i stood by the bedside of a pennsylvania soldier who lay conscious of quick approaching death yet perfectly calm and with noble spiritual manner the veteran surgeon turning aside said to me that though he had witnessd many many deaths of soldiers and had been a worker at bull run antietam fredericksburg c he had not seen yet the first case of man or boy that met the approach of dissolution with cowardly qualms or terror my own observation fully bears out the remark  what have we here if not towering above all talk and argument the plentifullysupplied lastneeded proof of democracy in its personalities curiously enough too the proof on this point comes i should say every bit as much from the south as from the north although i have spoken only of the latter yet i deliberately include all grand common stock to me the accomplishd and convincing growth prophetic of the future proof undeniable to sharpest sense of perfect beauty tenderness and pluck that never feudal lord nor greek nor roman breed yet rivald let no tongue ever speak in disparagement of the american races north or south to one who has been through the war in the great army hospitals  meantime general humanity for to that we return as for our purposes what it really is to bear in mind has always in every department been full of perverse maleficence and is so yet in downcast hours the soul thinks it always will bebut soon recovers from such sickly moods i myself see clearly enough the crude defective streaks in all the strata of the common people the specimens and vast collections of the ignorant the credulous the unfit and uncouth the incapable and the very low and poor the eminent person just mentiond sneeringly asks whether we expect to elevate and improve a nations politics by absorbing such morbid collections and qualities therein the point is a formidable one and there will doubtless always be numbers of solid and reflective citizens who will never get over it our answer is general and is involved in the scope and letter of this essay we believe the ulterior object of political and all other government having of course provided for the police the safety of life property and for the basic statute and common law and their administration always first in order to be among the rest not merely to rule to repress disorder c but to develop to open up to cultivation to encourage the possibilities of all beneficent and manly outcroppage and of that aspiration for independence and the pride and selfrespect latent in all characters or if there be exceptions we cannot fixing our eyes on them alone make theirs the rule for all  i say the mission of government henceforth in civilized lands is not repression alone and not authority alone not even of law nor by that favorite standard of the eminent writer the rule of the best men the born heroes and captains of the race as if such ever or one time out of a hundred get into the big places elective or dynasticbut higher than the highest arbitrary rule to train communities through all their grades beginning with individuals and ending there again to rule themselves what christ appeard for in the moralspiritual field for humankind namely that in respect to the absolute soul there is in the possession of such by each single individual something so transcendent so incapable of gradations like life that to that extent it places all beings on a common level utterly regardless of the distinctions of intellect virtue station or any height or lowliness whateveris tallied in like manner in this other field by democracys rule that men the nation as a common aggregate of living identities affording in each a separate and complete subject for freedom worldly thrift and happiness and for a fair chance for growth and for protection in citizenship c must to the political extent of the suffrage or vote if no further be placed in each and in the whole on one broad primary universal common platform  the purpose is not altogether direct perhaps it is more indirect for it is not that democracy is of exhaustive account in itself perhaps indeed it is like nature of no account in itself it is that as we see it is the best perhaps only fit and full means formulater general callerforth trainer for the million not for grand material personalities only but for immortal souls to be a voter with the rest is not so much and this like every institute will have its imperfections  but to become an enfranchised man and now impediments removed to stand and start without humiliation and equal with the rest to commence or have the road cleard to commence the grand experiment of development whose end perhaps requiring several generations may be the forming of a fullgrown man or womanthat is something to ballast the state is also secured and in our times is to be secured in no other way  we do not at any rate i do not put it either on the ground that the people the masses even the best of them are in their latent or exhibited qualities essentially sensible and goodnor on the ground of their rights but that good or bad rights or no rights the democratic formula is the only safe and preservative one for coming times we endow the masses with the suffrage for their own sake no doubt then perhaps still more from another point of view for communitys sake leaving the rest to the sentimentalists we present freedom as sufficient in its scientific aspect cold as ice reasoning deductive clear and passionless as crystal  democracy too is law and of the strictest amplest kind many suppose and often in its own ranks the error that it means a throwing aside of law and running riot but briefly it is the superior law not alone that of physical force the body which adding to it supersedes with that of the spirit law is the unshakable order of the universe forever and the law over all and law of laws is the law of successions that of the superior law in time gradually supplanting and overwhelming the inferior one while for myself i would cheerfully agreefirst covenanting that the formative tendencies shall be administerd in favor or at least not against it and that this reservation be closely construedthat until the individual or community show due signs or be so minor and fractional as not to endanger the state the condition of authoritative tutelage may continue and selfgovernment must abide its time nor is the esthetic point always an important one without fascination for highest aiming souls the common ambition strains for elevations to become some privileged exclusive the master sees greatness and health in being part of the mass nothing will do as well as common ground would you have in yourself the divine vast general law then merge yourself in it  and topping democracy this most alluring record that it alone can bind and ever seeks to bind all nations all men of however various and distant lands into a brotherhood a family it is the old yet evermodern dream of earth out of her eldest and her youngest her fond philosophers and poets not that half only individualism which isolates there is another half which is adhesiveness or love that fuses ties and aggregates making the races comrades and fraternizing all both are to be vitalized by religion sole worthiest elevator of man or state breathing into the proud material tissues the breath of life for i say at the core of democracy finally is the religious element all the religions old and new are there nor may the scheme step forth clothed in resplendent beauty and command till these bearing the best the latest fruit the spiritual shall fully appear  a portion of our pages we might indite with reference toward europe especially the british part of it more than our own land perhaps not absolutely needed for the home reader but the whole question hangs together and fastens and links all peoples the liberalist of today has this advantage over antique or mediaeval times that his doctrine seeks not only to individualize but to universalize the great word solidarity has arisen of all dangers to a nation as things exist in our day there can be no greater one than having certain portions of the people set off from the rest by a line drawnthey not privileged as others but degraded humiliated made of no account much quackery teems of course even on democracys side yet does not really affect the orbic quality of the matter to work in if we may so term it and justify god his divine aggregate the people or the veritable hornd and sharptaild devil his aggregate if there be who convulsively insist upon itthis i say is what democracy is for and this is what our america means and is doingmay i not say has done if not she means nothing more and does nothing more than any other land and as by virtue of its kosmical antiseptic power natures stomach is fully strong enough not only to digest the morbific matter always presented not to be turnd aside and perhaps indeed intuitively gravitating thitherbut even to change such contributions into nutriment for highest use and lifeso american democracys that is the lesson we these days send over to european lands by every western breeze  and truly whatever may be said in the way of abstract argument for or against the theory of a wider democratizing of institutions in any civilized country much trouble might well be saved to all european lands by recognizing this palpable fact for a palpable fact it is that some form of such democratizing is about the only resource now left that or chronic dissatisfaction continued mutterings which grow annually louder and louder till in due course and pretty swiftly in most cases the inevitable crisis crash dynastic ruin anything worthy to be calld statesmanship in the old world i should say among the advanced students adepts or men of any brains does not debate today whether to hold on attempting to lean back and monarchize or to look forward and democratizebut how and in what degree and part most prudently to democratize  the eager and often inconsiderate appeals of reformers and revolutionists are indispensable to counterbalance the inertness and fossilism making so large a part of human institutions the latter will always take care of themselvesthe danger being that they rapidly tend to ossify us the former is to be treated with indulgence and even with respect as circulation to air so is agitation and a plentiful degree of speculative license to political and moral sanity indirectly but surely goodness virtue law of the very best follow freedom these to democracy are what the keel is to the ship or saltness to the ocean  the true gravitationhold of liberalism in the united states will be a more universal ownership of property general homesteads general comforta vast intertwining reticulation of wealth as the human frame or indeed any object in this manifold universe is best kept together by the simple miracle of its own cohesion and the necessity exercise and profit thereof so a great and varied nationality occupying millions of square miles were firmest held and knit by the principle of the safety and endurance of the aggregate of its middling property owners so that from another point of view ungracious as it may sound and a paradox after what we have been saying democracy looks with suspicious illsatisfied eye upon the very poor the ignorant and on those out of business she asks for men and women with occupations welloff owners of houses and acres and with cash in the bankand with some cravings for literature too and must have them and hastens to make them luckily the seed is already wellsown and has taken ineradicable root25  huge and mighty are our days our republican landsand most in their rapid shiftings their changes all in the interest of the cause as i write this particular passage november 1868 the din of disputation rages around me acrid the temper of the parties vital the pending questions congress convenes the president sends his message reconstruction is still in abeyance the nomination and the contest for the twentyfirst presidentiad draw close with loudest threat and bustle of these and all the like of these the eventuations i know not but well i know that behind them and whatever their eventuations the vital things remain safe and certain and all the needed work goes on time with soon or later superciliousness disposes of presidents congressmen party platforms and such anon it clears the stage of each and any mortal shred that thinks itself so potent to its day and at and after which with precious golden exceptions once or twice in a century all that relates to sir potency is flung to moulder in a burialvault and no one bothers himself the least bit about it afterward but the people ever remain tendencies continue and all the idiocratic transfers in unbroken chain go on  in a few years the dominionheart of america will be far inland toward the west our future national capital may not be where the present one is it is possible nay likely that in less than fifty years it will migrate a thousand or two miles will be refounded and every thing belonging to it made on a different plan original far more superb the main social political spinecharacter of the states will probably run along the ohio missouri and mississippi rivers and west and north of them including canada those regions with the group of powerful brothers toward the pacific destined to the mastership of that sea and its countless paradises of islands will compact and settle the traits of america with all the old retaind but more expanded grafted on newer hardier purely native stock a giant growth composite from the rest getting their contribution absorbing it to make it more illustrious from the north intellect the sun of things also the idea of unswayable justice anchor amid the last the wildest tempests from the south the living soul the animus of good and bad haughtily admitting no demonstration but its own while from the west itself comes solid personality with blood and brawn and the deep quality of allaccepting fusion  political democracy as it exists and practically works in america with all its threatening evils supplies a trainingschool for making firstclass men it is lifes gymnasium not of good only but of all we try often though we fall back often a brave delight fit for freedoms athletes fills these arenas and fully satisfies out of the action in them irrespective of success whatever we do not attain we at any rate attain the experiences of the fight the hardening of the strong campaign and throb with currents of attempt at least time is ample let the victors come after us not for nothing does evil play its part among us judging from the main portions of the history of the world so far justice is always in jeopardy peace walks amid hourly pitfalls and of slavery misery meanness the craft of tyrants and the credulity of the populace in some of their protean forms no voice can at any time say they are not the clouds break a little and the sun shines outbut soon and certain the lowering darkness falls again as if to last forever yet is there an immortal courage and prophecy in every sane soul that cannot must not under any circumstances capitulate vive the attackthe perennial assault vive the unpopular causethe spirit that audaciously aimsthe neverabandond efforts pursued the same amid opposing proofs and precedents  once before the war alas i dare not say how many times the mood has come i too was filld with doubt and gloom a foreigner an acute and good man had impressively said to me that dayputting in form indeed my own observations i have traveld much in the united states and watchd their politicians and listend to the speeches of the candidates and read the journals and gone into the public houses and heard the unguarded talk of men and i have found your vaunted america honeycombd from top to toe with infidelism even to itself and its own programme i have markd the brazen hellfaces of secession and slavery gazing defiantly from all the windows and doorways i have everywhere found primarily thieves and scalliwags arranging the nominations to offices and sometimes filling the offices themselves i have found the north just as full of bad stuff as the south of the holders of public office in the nation or the states or their municipalities i have found that not one in a hundred has been chosen by any spontaneous selection of the outsiders the people but all have been nominated and put through by little or large caucuses of the politicians and have got in by corrupt rings and electioneering not capacity or desert i have noticed how the millions of sturdy farmers and mechanics are thus the helpless supplejacks of comparatively few politicians and i have noticed more and more the alarming spectacle of parties usurping the government and openly and shamelessly wielding it for party purposes  sad serious deep truths yet are there other still deeper amply confronting dominating truths over those politicians and great and little rings and over all their insolence and wiles and over the powerfulest parties looms a power too sluggish maybe but ever holding decisions and decrees in hand ready with stern process to execute them as soon as plainly neededand at times indeed summarily crushing to atoms the mightiest parties even in the hour of their pride  in saner hours far different are the amounts of these things from what at first sight they appear though it is no doubt important who is elected governor mayor or legislator and full of dismay when incompetent or vile ones get elected as they sometimes do there are other quieter contingencies infinitely more important shams c will always be the show like oceans scum enough if waters deep and clear make up the rest enough that while the piled embroiderd shoddy gaud and fraud spreads to the superficial eye the hidden warp and weft are genuine and will wear forever enough in short that the race the land which could raise such as the late rebellion could also put it down the average man of a land at last only is important he in these states remains immortal owner and boss deriving good uses somehow out of any sort of servant in office even the basest certain universal requisites and their settled regularity and protection being first secured a nation like ours in a sort of geological formation state trying continually new experiments choosing new delegations is not served by the best men only but sometimes more by those that provoke itby the combats they arouse thus national rage fury discussions c better than content thus also the warning signals invaluable for after times  what is more dramatic than the spectacle we have seen repeated and doubtless long shall seethe popular judgment taking the successful candidates on trial in the officesstanding off as it were and observing them and their doings for a while and always giving finally the fit exactly due reward i think after all the sublimest part of political history and its culmination is currently issuing from the american people i know nothing grander better exercise better digestion more positive proof of the past the triumphant result of faith in humankind than a wellcontested american national election  then still the thought returns like the threadpassage in overtures giving the key and echo to these pages when i pass to and fro different latitudes different seasons beholding the crowds of the great cities new york boston philadelphia cincinnati chicago st louis san francisco new orleans baltimorewhen i mix with these interminable swarms of alert turbulent goodnatured independent citizens mechanics clerks young personsat the idea of this mass of men so fresh and free so loving and so proud a singular awe falls upon me i feel with dejection and amazement that among our geniuses and talented writers or speakers few or none have yet really spoken to this people created a single imagemaking work for them or absorbd the central spirit and the idiosyncrasies which are theirsand which thus in highest ranges so far remain entirely uncelebrated unexpressd  dominion strong is the bodys dominion stronger is the minds what has filld and fills today our intellect our fancy furnishing the standards therein is yet foreign the great poems shakspere included are poisonous to the idea of the pride and dignity of the common people the lifeblood of democracy the models of our literature as we get it from other lands ultramarine have had their birth in courts and baskd and grown in castle sunshine all smells of princes favors of workers of a certain sort we have indeed plenty contributing after their kind many elegant many learnd all complacent but touchd by the national test or tried by the standards of democratic personality they wither to ashes i say i have not seen a single writer artist lecturer or whatnot that has confronted the voiceless but ever erect and active pervading underlying will and typic aspiration of the land in a spirit kindred to itself do you call those genteel little creatures american poets do you term that perpetual pistareen pastepot work american art american drama taste verse i think i hear echoed as from some mountaintop afar in the west the scornful laugh of the genius of these states  democracy in silence biding its time ponders its own ideals not of literature and art onlynot of men only but of women the idea of the women of america extricated from this daze this fossil and unhealthy air which hangs about the word lady developd raised to become the robust equals workers and it may be even practical and political deciders with the mengreater than man we may admit through their divine maternity always their towering emblematical attributebut great at any rate as man in all departments or rather capable of being so soon as they realize it and can bring themselves to give up toys and fictions and launch forth as men do amid real independent stormy life  then as towards our thoughts finale and in that overarching the true scholars lesson we have to say there can be no complete or epical presentation of democracy in the aggregate or anything like it at this day because its doctrines will only be effectually incarnated in any one branch when in all their spirit is at the root and centre far far indeed stretch in distance our vistas how much is still to be disentangled freed how long it takes to make this american world see that it is in itself the final authority and reliance  did you too o friend suppose democracy was only for elections for politics and for a party name i say democracy is only of use there that it may pass on and come to its flower and fruits in manners in the highest forms of interaction between men and their beliefsin religion literature colleges and schoolsdemocracy in all public and private life and in the army and navy26 i have intimated that as a paramount scheme it has yet few or no full realizers and believers i do not see either that it owes any serious thanks to noted propagandists or champions or has been essentially helpd though often harmd by them it has been and is carried on by all the moral forces and by trade finance machinery intercommunications and in fact by all the developments of history and can no more be stoppd than the tides or the earth in its orbit doubtless also it resides crude and latent well down in the hearts of the fair average of the americanborn people mainly in the agricultural regions but it is not yet there or anywhere the fullyreceivd the fervid the absolute faith  i submit therefore that the fruition of democracy on aught like a grand scale resides altogether in the future as under any profound and comprehensive view of the gorgeouscomposite feudal world we see in it through the long ages and cycles of ages the results of a deep integral human and divine principle or fountain from which issued laws ecclesia manners institutes costumes personalities poems hitherto unequalld faithfully partaking of their source and indeed only arising either to betoken it or to furnish parts of that variedflowing display whose centre was one and absoluteso long ages hence shall the due historian or critic make at least an equal retrospect an equal history for the democratic principle it too must be adornd credited with its resultsthen when it with imperial power through amplest time has dominated mankindhas been the source and test of all the moral esthetic social political and religious expressions and institutes of the civilized worldhas begotten them in spirit and in form and has carried them to its own unprecedented heightshas had it is possible monastics and ascetics more numerous more devout than the monks and priests of all previous creedshas swayd the ages with a breadth and rectitude tallying natures ownhas fashiond systematized and triumphantly finishd and carried out in its own interest and with unparalleld success a new earth and a new man  thus we presume to write as it were upon things that exist not and travel by maps yet unmade and a blank but the throes of birth are upon us and we have something of this advantage in seasons of strong formations doubts suspensefor then the afflatus of such themes haply may fall upon us more or less and then hot from surrounding war and revolution our speech though without polishd coherence and a failure by the standard called criticism comes forth real at least as the lightnings  and maybe we these days have too our own rewardfor there are yet some in all lands worthy to be so encouraged though not for us the joy of entering at the last the conquerd citynot ours the chance ever to see with our own eyes the peerless power and splendid eclat of the democratic principle arrivd at meridian filling the world with effulgence and majesty far beyond those of past historys kings or all dynastic swaythere is yet to whoever is eligible among us the prophetic vision the joy of being tossd in the brave turmoil of these timesthe promulgation and the path obedient lowly reverent to the voice the gesture of the god or holy ghost which others see not hear notwith the proud consciousness that amid whatever clouds seductions or heartwearying postponements we have never deserted never despaird never abandond the faith  so much contributed to be connd well to help prepare and brace our edifice our plannd ideawe still proceed to give it in another of its aspectsperhaps the main the high facade of all for to democracy the leveler the unyielding principle of the average is surely joind another principle equally unyielding closely tracking the first indispensable to it opposite as the sexes are opposite and whose existence confronting and ever modifying the other often clashing paradoxical yet neither of highest avail without the other plainly supplies to these grand cosmic politics of ours and to the launchdforth mortal dangers of republicanism today or any day the counterpart and offset whereby nature restrains the deadly original relentlessness of all her firstclass laws this second principle is individuality the pride and centripetal isolation of a human being in himselfidentitypersonalism whatever the name its acceptance and thorough infusion through the organizations of political commonalty now shooting auroralike about the world are of utmost importance as the principle itself is needed for very lifes sake it forms in a sort or is to form the compensating balancewheel of the successful working machinery of aggregate america  and if we think of it what does civilization itself rest uponand what object has it with its religions arts schools c but rich luxuriant varied personalism to that all bends and it is because toward such result democracy alone on anything like natures scale breaks up the limitless fallows of humankind and plants the seed and gives fair play that its claims now precede the rest the literature songs esthetics c of a country are of importance principally because they furnish the materials and suggestions of personality for the women and men of that country and enforce them in a thousand effective ways27 as the topmost claim of a strong consolidating of the nationality of these states is that only by such powerful compaction can the separate states secure that full and free swing within their spheres which is becoming to them each after its kind so will individuality with unimpeded branchings flourish best under imperial republican forms  assuming democracy to be at present in its embryo condition and that the only large and satisfactory justification of it resides in the future mainly through the copious production of perfect characters among the people and through the advent of a sane and pervading religiousness it is with regard to the atmosphere and spaciousness fit for such characters and of certain nutriment and cartoondraftings proper for them and indicating them for newworld purposes that i continue the present statementan exploration as of new ground wherein like other primitive surveyors i must do the best i can leaving it to those who come after me to do much better the service in fact if any must be to break a sort of first path or track no matter how rude and ungeometrical  we have frequently printed the word democracy yet i cannot too often repeat that it is a word the real gist of which still sleeps quite unawakend notwithstanding the resonance and the many angry tempests out of which its syllables have come from pen or tongue it is a great word whose history i suppose remains unwritten because that history has yet to be enacted it is in some sort younger brother of another great and oftenused word nature whose history also waits unwritten as i perceive the tendencies of our day in the states and i entirely respect them are toward those vast and sweeping movements influences moral and physical of humanity now and always current over the planet on the scale of the impulses of the elements then it is also good to reduce the whole matter to the consideration of a single self a man a woman on permanent grounds even for the treatment of the universal in politics metaphysics or anything sooner or later we come down to one single solitary soul  there is in sanest hours a consciousness a thought that rises independent lifted out from all else calm like the stars shining eternal this is the thought of identityyours for you whoever you are as mine for me miracle of miracles beyond statement most spiritual and vaguest of earths dreams yet hardest basic fact and only entrance to all facts in such devout hours in the midst of the significant wonders of heaven and earth significant only because of the me in the centre creeds conventions fall away and become of no account before this simple idea under the luminousness of real vision it alone takes possession takes value like the shadowy dwarf in the fable once liberated and lookd upon it expands over the whole earth and spreads to the roof of heaven  the quality of being in the objects self according to its own central idea and purpose and of growing therefrom and theretonot criticism by other standards and adjustments theretois the lesson of nature true the full man wisely gathers culls absorbs but if engaged disproportionately in that he slights or overlays the precious idiocrasy and special nativity and intention that he is the mans self the main thing is a failure however wide his general cultivation thus in our times refinement and delicatesse are not only attended to sufficiently but threaten to eat us up like a cancer already the democratic genius watches illpleased these tendencies provision for a little healthy rudeness savage virtue justification of what one has in ones self whatever it is is demanded negative qualities even deficiencies would be a relief singleness and normal simplicity and separation amid this more and more complex more and more artificialized state of societyhow pensively we yearn for them how we would welcome their return  in some such direction thenat any rate enough to preserve the balancewe feel called upon to throw what weight we can not for absolute reasons but current ones to prune gather trim conform and ever cram and stuff and be genteel and proper is the pressure of our days while aware that much can be said even in behalf of all this we perceive that we have not now to consider the question of what is demanded to serve a halfstarved and barbarous nation or set of nations but what is most applicable most pertinent for numerous congeries of conventional overcorpulent societies already becoming stifled and rotten with flatulent infidelistic literature and polite conformity and art in addition to establishd sciences we suggest a science as it were of healthy average personalism on originaluniversal grounds the object of which should be to raise up and supply through the states a copious race of superb american men and women cheerful religious ahead of any yet known  america has yet morally and artistically originated nothing she seems singularly unaware that the models of persons books manners c appropriate for former conditions and for european lands are but exiles and exotics here no current of her life as shown on the surfaces of what is authoritatively called her society accepts or runs into social or esthetic democracy but all the currents set squarely against it never in the old world was thoroughly upholsterd exterior appearance and show mental and other built entirely on the idea of caste and on the sufficiency of mere outside acquisitionnever were glibness verbal intellect more the test the emulationmore loftily elevated as head and samplethan they are on the surface of our republican states this day the writers of a time hint the mottoes of its gods the word of the modern say these voices is the word culture  we find ourselves abruptly in close quarters with the enemy this word culture or what it has come to represent involves by contrast our whole theme and has been indeed the spur urging us to engagement certain questions arise as now taught accepted and carried out are not the processes of culture rapidly creating a class of supercilious infidels who believe in nothing shall a man lose himself in countless masses of adjustments and be so shaped with reference to this that and the other that the simply good and healthy and brave parts of him are reduced and clippd away like the bordering of box in a garden you can cultivate corn and roses and orchardsbut who shall cultivate the mountain peaks the ocean and the tumbling gorgeousness of the clouds lastlyis the readilygiven reply that culture only seeks to help systematize and put in attitude the elements of fertility and power a conclusive reply  i do not so much object to the name or word but i should certainly insist for the purposes of these states on a radical change of category in the distribution of precedence i should demand a programme of culture drawn out not for a single class alone or for the parlors or lecturerooms but with an eye to practical life the west the workingmen the facts of farms and jackplanes and engineers and of the broad range of the women also of the middle and working strata and with reference to the perfect equality of women and of a grand and powerful motherhood i should demand of this programme or theory a scope generous enough to include the widest human area it must have for its spinal meaning the formation of a typical personality of character eligible to the uses of the high average of menand not restricted by conditions ineligible to the masses the best culture will always be that of the manly and courageous instincts and loving perceptions and of selfrespectaiming to form over this continent an idiocrasy of universalism which true child of america will bring joy to its mother returning to her in her own spirit recruiting myriads of offspring able natural perceptive tolerant devout believers in her america and with some definite instinct why and for what she has arisen most vast most formidable of historic births and is now and here with wonderful step journeying through time  the problem as it seems to me presented to the new world is under permanent law and order and after preserving cohesion ensembleindividuality at all hazards to vitalize mans free play of special personalism recognizing in it something that calls ever more to be considerd fed and adopted as the substratum for the best that belongs to us government indeed is for it including the new esthetics of our future  to formulate beyond this present vaguenessto help line and put before us the species or a specimen of the species of the democratic ethnology of the future is a work toward which the genius of our land with peculiar encouragement invites her wellwishers already certain limnings more or less grotesque more or less fading and watery have appeard we too repressing doubts and qualms will try our hand  attempting then however crudely a basic model or portrait of personality for general use for the manliness of the states and doubtless that is most useful which is most simple and comprehensive for all and toned low enough we should prepare the canvas well beforehand parentage must consider itself in advance will the time hasten when fatherhood and motherhood shall become a scienceand the noblest science to our model a clearblooded strongfibred physique is indispensable the questions of food drink air exercise assimilation digestion can never be intermitted out of these we descry a wellbegotten selfhoodin youth fresh ardent emotional aspiring full of adventure at maturity brave perceptive under control neither too talkative nor too reticent neither flippant nor sombre of the bodily figure the movements easy the complexion showing the best blood somewhat flushd breast expanded an erect attitude a voice whose sound outvies music eyes of calm and steady gaze yet capable also of flashingand a general presence that holds its own in the company of the highest for it is native personality and that alone that endows a man to stand before presidents or generals or in any distinguishd collection with aplomband not culture or any knowledge or intellect whatever with regard to the mentaleducational part of our model enlargement of intellect stores of cephalic knowledge c the concentration thitherward of all the customs of our age especially in america is so overweening and provides so fully for that part that important and necessary as it is it really needs nothing from us hereexcept indeed a phrase of warning and restraint manners costumes too though important we need not dwell upon here like beauty grace of motion c they are results causes original things being attended to the right manners unerringly follow much is said among artists of the grand style as if it were a thing by itself when a man artist or whoever has health pride acuteness noble aspirations he has the motiveelements of the grandest style the rest is but manipulation yet that is no small matter  leaving still unspecified several sterling parts of any model fit for the future personality of america i must not fail again and ever to pronounce myself on one probably the least attended to in modern timesa hiatus indeed threatening its gloomiest consequences after us i mean the simple unsophisticated conscience the primary moral element if i were asked to specify in what quarter lie the grounds of darkest dread respecting the america of our hopes i should have to point to this particular i should demand the invariable application to individuality this day and any day of that old evertrue plumbrule of persons eras nations our triumphant modern civilizee with his allschooling and his wondrous appliances will still show himself but an amputation while this deficiency remains beyond assuming a more hopeful tone the vertebration of the manly and womanly personalism of our western world can only be and is indeed to be i hope its allpenetrating religiousness  the ripeness of religion is doubtless to be looked for in this field of individuality and is a result that no organization or church can ever achieve as history is poorly retaind by what the technists call history and is not given out from their pages except the learner has in himself the sense of the wellwrapt never yet written perhaps impossible to be written historyso religion although casually arrested and after a fashion preservd in the churches and creeds does not depend at all upon them but is a part of the identified soul which when greatest knows not bibles in the old way but in new waysthe identified soul which can really confront religion when it extricates itself entirely from the churches and not before  personalism fuses this and favors it i should say indeed that only in the perfect uncontamination and solitariness of individuality may the spirituality of religion positively come forth at all only here and on such terms the meditation the devout ecstasy the soaring flight only here communion with the mysteries the eternal problems whence whither alone and identity and the moodand the soul emerges and all statements churches sermons melt away like vapors alone and silent thought and awe and aspirationand then the interior consciousness like a hitherto unseen inscription in magic ink beams out its wondrous lines to the sense bibles may convey and priests expound but it is exclusively for the noiseless operation of ones isolated self to enter the pure ether of veneration reach the divine levels and commune with the unutterable   to practically enter into politics is an important part of american personalism to every young man north and south earnestly studying these things i should here as an offset to what i have said in former pages now also say that may be to views of very largest scope after all perhaps the political perhaps the literary and sociological america goes best about its development its own waysometimes to temporary sight appaling enough it is the fashion among dillettants and fops perhaps i myself am not guiltless to decry the whole formulation of the active politics of america as beyond redemption and to be carefully kept away from see you that you do not fall into this error america it may be is doing very well upon the whole notwithstanding these antics of the parties and their leaders these halfbraind nominees the many ignorant ballots and many elected failures and blatherers it is the dillettants and all who shirk their duty who are not doing well as for you i advise you to enter more strongly yet into politics i advise every young man to do so always inform yourself always do the best you can always vote disengage yourself from parties they have been useful and to some extent remain so but the floating uncommitted electors farmers clerks mechanics the masters of partieswatching aloof inclining victory this side or that sidesuch are the ones most needed present and future for america if eligible at all to downfall and ruin is eligible within herself not without for i see clearly that the combined foreign world could not beat her down but these savage wolfish parties alarm me owning no law but their own will more and more combative less and less tolerant of the idea of ensemble and of equal brotherhood the perfect equality of the states the everoverarching american ideas it behooves you to convey yourself implicitly to no party nor submit blindly to their dictators but steadily hold yourself judge and master over all of them  so much hastily tossd together and leaving far more unsaid for an ideal or intimations of an ideal toward american manhood but the other sex in our land requires at least a basis of suggestion  i have seen a young american woman one of a large family of daughters who some years since migrated from her meagre country home to one of the northern cities to gain her own support she soon became an expert seamstress but finding the employment too confining for health and comfort she went boldly to work for others to housekeep cook clean c after trying several places she fell upon one where she was suited she has told me that she finds nothing degrading in her position it is not inconsistent with personal dignity selfrespect and the respect of others she confers benefits and receives them she has good health her presence itself is healthy and bracing her character is unstaind she has made herself understood and preserves her independence and has been able to help her parents and educate and get places for her sisters and her course of life is not without opportunities for mental improvement and of much quiet uncosting happiness and love  i have seen another woman who from taste and necessity conjoind has gone into practical affairs carries on a mechanical business partly works at it herself dashes out more and more into real hardy life is not abashd by the coarseness of the contact knows how to be firm and silent at the same time holds her own with unvarying coolness and decorum and will compare any day with superior carpenters farmers and even boatmen and drivers for all that she has not lost the charm of the womanly nature but preserves and bears it fully though through such rugged presentation  then there is the wife of a mechanic mother of two children a woman of merely passable english education but of fine wit with all her sexs grace and intuitions who exhibits indeed such a noble female personality that i am fain to record it here never abnegating her own proper independence but always genially preserving it and what belongs to itcooking washing childnursing housetendingshe beams sunshine out of all these duties and makes them illustrious physiologically sweet and sound loving work practical she yet knows that there are intervals however few devoted to recreation music leisure hospitalityand affords such intervals whatever she does and wherever she is that charm that indescribable perfume of genuine womanhood attends her goes with her exhales from her which belongs of right to all the sex and is or ought to be the invariable atmosphere and common aureola of old as well as young  my dear mother once described to me a resplendent person down on long island whom she knew in early days she was known by the name of the peacemaker she was well toward eighty years old of happy and sunny temperament had always lived on a farm and was very neighborly sensible and discreet an invariable and welcomd favorite especially with young married women she had numerous children and grandchildren she was uneducated but possessd a native dignity she had come to be a tacitly agreed upon domestic regulator judge settler of difficulties shepherdess and reconciler in the land she was a sight to draw near and look upon with her large figure her profuse snowwhite hair uncoild by any headdress or cap dark eyes clear complexion sweet breath and peculiar personal magnetism  the foregoing portraits i admit are frightfully out of line from these imported models of womanly personalitythe stock feminine characters of the current novelists or of the foreign court poems ophelias enids princesses or ladies of one thing or another which fill the envying dreams of so many poor girls and are accepted by our men too as supreme ideals of feminine excellence to be sought after but i present mine just for a change  then there are mutterings we will not now stop to heed them here but they must be heeded of something more revolutionary the day is coming when the deep questions of womans entrance amid the arenas of practical life politics the suffrage c will not only be argued all around us but may be put to decision and real experiment  of course in these states for both man and woman we must entirely recast the types of highest personality from what the oriental feudal ecclesiastical worlds bequeath us and which yet possess the imaginative and esthetic fields of the united states pictorial and melodramatic not without use as studies but making sad work and forming a strange anachronism upon the scenes and exigencies around us of course the old undying elements remain the task is to successfully adjust them to new combinations our own days nor is this so incredible i can conceive a community today and here in which on a sufficient scale the perfect personalities without noise meet say in some pleasant western settlement or town where a couple of hundred best men and women of ordinary worldly status have by luck been drawn together with nothing extra of genius or wealth but virtuous chaste industrious cheerful resolute friendly and devout i can conceive such a community organized in running order powers judiciously delegatedfarming building trade courts mails schools elections all attended to and then the rest of life the main thing freely branching and blossoming in each individual and bearing golden fruit i can see there in every young and old man after his kind and in every woman after hers a true personality developd exercised proportionately in body mind and spirit i can imagine this case as one not necessarily rare or difficult but in buoyant accordance with the municipal and general requirements of our times and i can realize in it the culmination of something better than any stereotyped eclat of history or poems perhaps unsung undramatized unput in essays or biographiesperhaps even some such community already exists in ohio illinois missouri or somewhere practically fulfilling itself and thus outvying in cheapest vulgar life all that has been hitherto shown in best ideal pictures  in short and to sum up america betaking herself to formative action as it is about time for more solid achievement and less windy promise must for her purposes cease to recognize a theory of character grown of feudal aristocracies or formd by merely literary standards or from any ultramarine fulldress formulas of culture polish caste c and must sternly promulgate her own new standard yet old enough and accepting the old the perennial elements and combining them into groups unities appropriate to the modern the democratic the west and to the practical occasions and needs of our own cities and of the agricultural regions ever the most precious in the common ever the fresh breeze of field or hill or lake is more than any palpitation of fans though of ivory and redolent with perfume and the air is more than the costliest perfumes  and now for fear of mistake we may not intermit to beg our absolution from all that genuinely is or goes along with even culture pardon us venerable shade if we have seemd to speak lightly of your office the whole civilization of the earth we know is yours with all the glory and the light thereof it is indeed in your own spirit and seeking to tally the loftiest teachings of it that we aim these poor utterances for you too mighty minister know that there is something greater than you namely the fresh eternal qualities of being from them and by them as you at your best we too evoke the last the needed help to vitalize our country and our days thus we pronounce not so much against the principle of culture we only supervise it and promulge along with it as deep perhaps a deeper principle as we have shown the new world including in itself the allleveling aggregate of democracy we show it also including the allvaried allpermitting allfree theorem of individuality and erecting therefor a lofty and hitherto unoccupied framework or platform broad enough for all eligible to every farmer and mechanicto the female equally with the malea towering selfhood not physically perfect onlynot satisfied with the mere minds and learnings stores but religious possessing the idea of the infinite rudder and compass sure amid this troublous voyage oer darkest wildest wave through stormiest wind of mans or nations progressrealizing above the rest that known humanity in deepest sense is fair adhesion to itself for purposes beyondand that finally the personality of mortal life is most important with reference to the immortal the unknown the spiritual the only permanently real which as the ocean waits for and receives the rivers waits for us each and all  much is there yet demanding line and outline in our vistas not only on these topics but others quite unwritten indeed we could talk the matter and expand it through lifetime but it is necessary to return to our original premises in view of them we have again pointedly to confess that all the objective grandeurs of the world for highest purposes yield themselves up and depend on mentality alone here and here only all balances all rests for the mind which alone builds the permanent edifice haughtily builds it to itself by it with what follows it are conveyd to mortal sense the culminations of the materialistic the known and a prophecy of the unknown to take expression to incarnate to endow a literature with grand and archetypal modelsto fill with pride and love the utmost capacity and to achieve spiritual meanings and suggest the futurethese and these only satisfy the soul we must not say one word against real materials but the wise know that they do not become real till touched by emotions the mind did we call the latter imponderable ah let us rather proclaim that the slightest songtune the countless ephemera of passions arousd by orators and taletellers are more dense more weighty than the engines there in the great factories or the granite blocks in their foundations  approaching thus the momentous spaces and considering with reference to a new and greater personalism the needs and possibilities of american imaginative literature through the mediumlight of what we have already broachd it will at once be appreciated that a vast gulf of difference separates the present accepted condition of these spaces inclusive of what is floating in them from any condition adjusted to or fit for the world the america there sought to be indicated and the copious races of complete men and women along these vistas crudely outlined it is in some sort no less a difference than lies between that longcontinued nebular state and vagueness of the astronomical worlds compared with the subsequent state the definitelyformd worlds themselves duly compacted clustering in systems hung up there chandeliers of the universe beholding and mutually lit by each others lights serving for ground of all substantial foothold all vulgar usesyet serving still more as an undying chain and echelon of spiritual proofs and shows a boundless field to fill a new creation with needed orbic works launchd forth to revolve in free and lawful circuitsto move selfpoised through the ether and shine like heavens own suns with such and nothing less we suggest that new world literature fit to rise upon cohere and signalize in time these states  what however do we more definitely mean by new world literature are we not doing well enough here already are not the united states this day busily using working more printers type more presses than any other country uttering and absorbing more publications than any other do not our publishers fatten quicker and deeper helping themselves under shelter of a delusive and sneaking law or rather absence of law to most of their forage poetical pictorial historical romantic even comic without money and without priceand fiercely resisting the timidest proposal to pay for it many will come under this delusionbut my purpose is to dispel it i say that a nation may hold and circulate rivers and oceans of very readable print journals magazines novels librarybooks poetry csuch as the states today possess and circulateof unquestionable aid and valuehundreds of new volumes annually composed and brought out here respectable enough indeed unsurpassd in smartness and eruditionwith further hundreds or rather millions as by free forage or theft aforementiond also thrown into the marketand yet all the while the said nation land strictly speaking may possess no literature at all  repeating our inquiry what then do we mean by real literature especially the democratic literature of the future hard questions to meet the clues are inferential and turn us to the past at best we can only offer suggestions comparisons circuits  it must still be reiterated as for the purpose of these memoranda the deep lesson of history and time that all else in the contributions of a nation or age through its politics materials heroic personalities military eclat c remains crude and defers in any close and thoroughgoing estimate until vitalized by national original archetypes in literature they only put the nation in form finally tell anythingprove complete anythingperpetuate anything without doubt some of the richest and most powerful and populous communities of the antique world and some of the grandest personalities and events have to after and present times left themselves entirely unbequeathd doubtless greater than any that have come down to us were among those lands heroisms persons that have not come down to us at all even by name date or location others have arrived safely as from voyages over wide centurystretching seas the little ships the miracles that have buoyd them and by incredible chances safely conveyd them or the best of them their meaning and essence overlong wastes darkness lethargy ignorance c have been a few inscriptionsa few immortal compositions small in size yet compassing what measureless values of reminiscence contemporary portraitures manners idioms and beliefs with deepest inference hint and thought to tie and touch forever the old new body and the old new soul these and still these bearing the freight so deardearer than pridedearer than love all the best experience of humanity folded saved freighted to us here some of these tiny ships we call old and new testament homer eschylus plato juvenal c precious minims i think if we were forced to choose rather than have you and the likes of you and what belongs to and has grown of you blotted out and gone we could better afford appaling as that would be to lose all actual ships this day fastend by wharf or floating on wave and see them with all their cargoes scuttled and sent to the bottom  gatherd by geniuses of city race or age and put by them in highest of arts forms namely the literary form the peculiar combinations and the outshows of that city age or race its particular modes of the universal attributes and passions its faiths heroes lovers and gods wars traditions struggles crimes emotions joys or the subtle spirit of these having been passd on to us to illumine our own selfhood and its experienceswhat they supply indispensable and highest if taken away nothing else in all the worlds boundless storehouses could make up to us or ever again return  for us along the great highways of time those monuments stand those forms of majesty and beauty for us those beacons burn through all the nights unknown egyptians graving hieroglyphs hindus with hymn and apothegm and endless epic hebrew prophet with spirituality as in flashes of lightning conscience like redhot iron plaintive songs and screams of vengeance for tyrannies and enslavement christ with bent head brooding love and peace like a dove greek creating eternal shapes of physical and esthetic proportion roman lord of

painters architects musicians rich shakspere luxuriant as the sun artist and singer of feudalism in its sunset with all the gorgeous colors owner thereof and using them at will and so to such as german kant and hegel where they though near us leaping over the ages sit again impassive imperturbable like the egyptian gods of these and the like of these is it too much indeed to return to our favorite figure and view them as orbs and systems of orbs moving in free paths in the spaces of that other heaven the kosmic intellect the soul  ye powerful and resplendent ones ye were in your atmospheres grown not for america but rather for her foes the feudal and the oldwhile our genius is democratic and modern yet could ye indeed but breathe your breath of life into our new worlds nostrilsnot to enslave us as now but for our needs to breed a spirit like your ownperhaps dare we to say it to dominate even destroy what you yourselves have left on your plane and no less but even higher and wider must we mete and measure for today and here i demand races of orbic bards with unconditional uncompromising sway come forth sweet democratic despots of the west  by points like these we in reflection token what we mean by any lands or peoples genuine literature and thus compared and tested judging amid the influence of loftiest products only what do our current copious fields of print covering in manifold forms the united states better for an analogy present than as in certain regions of the sea those spreading undulating masses of squid through which the whale swimming with head half out feeds  not but that doubtless our current socalled literature like an endless supply of small coin performs a certain service and maybe too the service needed for the time the preparationservice as children learn to spell everybody reads and truly nearly everybody writes either books or for the magazines or journals the matter has magnitude too after a sort but is it really advancing or has it advanced for a long while there is something impressive about the huge editions of the dailies and weeklies the mountainstacks of white paper piled in the pressvaults and the proud crashing tencylinder presses which i can stand and watch any time by the half hour then though the states in the field of imagination present not a single firstclass work not a single great literatus the main objects to amuse to titillate to pass away time to circulate the news and rumors of news to rhyme and read rhyme are yet attaind and on a scale of infinity today in books in the rivalry of writers especially novelists success socalld is for him or her who strikes the mean flat average the sensational appetite for stimulus incident persiflage c and depicts to the common calibre sensual exterior life to such or the luckiest of them as we see the audiences are limitless and profitable but they cease presently while this day or any day to workmen portraying interior or spiritual life the audiences were limited and often laggardbut they last forever  compared with the past our modern science soars and our journals servebut ideal and even ordinary romantic literature does not i think substantially advance behold the prolific brood of the contemporary novel magazinetale theatreplay c the same endless thread of tangled and superlative lovestory inherited apparently from the amadises and palmerins of the 13th 14th and 15th centuries over there in europe the costumes and associations brought down to date the seasoning hotter and more varied the dragons and ogres left outbut the thing i should say has not advancedis just as sensational just as straindremains about the same nor more nor less  what is the reason our time our lands that we see no fresh local courage sanity of our ownthe mississippi stalwart western men real mental and physical facts southerners c in the body of our literature especially the poetic part of it but always instead a parcel of dandies

huge flow of our age s materialismin its spirituality we have had founded for us the most positive of lands the founders have passd to other spheresbut what are these terrible duties they have left us  their politics the united states have in my opinion with all their faults already substantially establishd for good on their own native sound longvistad principles never to be overturnd offering a sure basis for all the rest with that their future religious forms sociology literature teachers schools costumes c are of course to make a compact whole uniform on tallying principles for how can we remain divided contradicting ourselves this way28 i say we can only attain harmony and stability by consulting ensemble and the ethic purports and faithfully building upon them for the new world indeed after two grand stages of preparationstrata i perceive that now a third stage being ready for and without which the other two were useless with unmistakable signs appears the first stage was the planning and putting on record the political foundation rights of immense masses of peopleindeed all peoplein the organization of republican national state and municipal governments all constructed with reference to each and each to all this is the american programme not for classes but for universal man and is embodied in the compacts of the declaration of independence and as it began and has now grown with its amendments the federal constitutionand in the state governments with all their interiors and with general suffrage those having the sense not only of what is in themselves but that their certain several things started planted hundreds of others in the same direction duly arise and follow the second stage relates to material prosperity wealth produce laborsaving machines iron cotton local state and continental railways intercommunication and trade with all lands steamships mining general employment organization of great cities cheap appliances for comfort numberless technical schools books newspapers a currency for money circulation c the third stage rising out of the previous ones to make them and all illustrious i now for one promulge announcing a native expressionspirit getting into form adult and through mentality for these states selfcontaind different from others more expansive more rich and free to be evidenced by original authors and poets to come by american personalities plenty of them male and female traversing the states none exceptedand by native superber tableaux and growths of language songs operas orations lectures architectureand by a sublime and serious religious democracy sternly taking command dissolving the old sloughing off surfaces and from its own interior and vital principles reconstructing democratizing society  for america type of progress and of essential faith in man above all his errors and wickednessfew suspect how deep how deep it really strikes the world evidently supposes and we have evidently supposed so too that the states are merely to achieve the equal franchise an elective governmentto inaugurate the respectability of labor and become a nation of practical operatives lawabiding orderly and well off yes those are indeed parts of the task of america but they not only do not exhaust the progressive conception but rather arise teeming with it as the mediums of deeper higher progress daughter of a physical revolutionmother of the true revolutions which are of the interior life and of the arts for so long as the spirit is not changed any change of appearance is of no avail  the old men i remember as a boy were always talking of american independence what is independence freedom from all laws or bonds except those of ones own being controld by the universal ones to lands to man to woman what is there at last to each but the inherent soul nativity idiocrasy free highestpoised soaring its own flight following out itself  at present these states in their theology and social standards of greater importance than their political institutions are entirely held possession of by foreign lands we see the sons and daughters of the new world ignorant of its genius not yet inaugurating the native the universal and the near still importing the distant the partial and the dead we see london paris italynot original superb as where they belongbut secondhand here where they do not belong we see the shreds of hebrews romans greeks but where on her own soil do we see in any faithful highest proud expression america herself i sometimes question whether she has a corner in her own house  not but that in one sense and a very grand one good theology good art or good literature has certain features shared in common the combination fraternizes ties the racesis in many particulars under laws applicable indifferently to all irrespective of climate or date and from whatever source appeals to emotions pride love spirituality common to human kind nevertheless they touch a man closest perhaps only actually touch him even in these in their expression through autochthonic lights and shades flavors fondnesses aversions specific incidents illustrations out of his own nationality geography surroundings antecedents c the spirit and the form are one and depend far more on association identity and place than is supposed subtly interwoven with the materiality and personality of a land a raceteuton turk californian or whatnotthere is always somethingi can hardly tell what it ishistory but describes the results of itit is the same as the untellable look of some human faces nature too in her stolid forms is full of itbut to most it is there a secret this something is rooted in the invisible roots the profoundest meanings of that place race or nationality and to absorb and again effuse it uttering words and products as from its midst and carrying it into highest regions is the work or a main part of the work of any countrys true author poet historian lecturer and perhaps even priest and philosoph here and here only are the foundations for our really valuable and permanent verse drama c  but at present judged by any higher scale than that which finds the chief ends of existence to be to feverishly make money during onehalf of it and by some amusement or perhaps foreign travel flippantly kill time the other half and considerd with reference to purposes of patriotism health a noble personality religion and the democratic adjustments all these swarms of poems literary magazines dramatic plays resultant so far from american intellect and the formation of our best ideas are useless and a mockery they strengthen and nourish no one express nothing characteristic give decision and purpose to no one and suffice only the lowest level of vacant minds  of what is called the drama or dramatic presentation in the united states as now put forth at the theatres i should say it deserves to be treated with the same gravity and on a par with the questions of ornamental confectionery at public dinners or the arrangement of curtains and hangings in a ballroomnor more nor less of the other i will not insult the readers intelligence once really entering into the atmosphere of these vistas by supposing it necessary to show in detail why the copious dribble either of our little or wellknown rhymesters does not fulfil in any respect the needs and august occasions of this land america demands a poetry that is bold modern and allsurrounding and kosmical as she is herself it must in no respect ignore science or the modern but inspire itself with science and the modern it must bend its vision toward the future more than the past like america it must extricate itself from even the greatest models of the past and while courteous to them must have entire faith in itself and the products of its own democratic spirit only like her it must place in the van and hold up at all hazards the banner of the divine pride of man in himself the radical foundation of the new religion long enough have the people been listening to poems in which common humanity deferential bends low humiliated acknowledging superiors but america listens to no such poems erect inflated and fully selfesteeming be the chant and then america will listen with pleased ears  nor may the genuine gold the gems when brought to light at last be probably usherd forth from any of the quarters currently counted on today doubtless the infant genius of american poetic expression eluding those highlyrefined imported and giltedged themes and sentimental and butterfly flights pleasant to orthodox publisherscausing tender spasms in the coteries and warranted not to chafe the sensitive cuticle of the most exquisitely artificial gossamer delicacy lies sleeping far away happily unrecognized and uninjurd by the coteries the artwriters the talkers and critics of the saloons or the lecturers in the collegeslies sleeping aside unrecking

genuine american aroma and fruits truly and fully our own  i say it were a standing disgrace to these statesi say it were a disgrace to any nation distinguishd above others by the variety and vastness of its territories its materials its inventive activity and the splendid practicality of its people not to rise and soar above others also in its original styles in literature and art and its own supply of intellectual and esthetic masterpieces archetypal and consistent with itself i know not a land except ours that has not to some extent however small made its title clear the scotch have their born ballads subtly expressing their past and present and expressing character the irish have theirs england italy france spain theirs what has america with exhaustless mines of the richest ore of epic lyric tale tune picture etc in the four years war with indeed i sometimes think the richest masses of material ever afforded a nation more variegated and on a larger scalethe first sign of proportionate native imaginative soul and firstclass works to match is i cannot too often repeat so far wanting  long ere the second centennial arrives there will be some forty to fifty great states among them canada and cuba when the present century closes our population will be sixty or seventy millions the pacific will be ours and the atlantic mainly ours there will be daily electric communication with every part of the globe what an age what a land where elsewhere one so great the individuality of one nation must then as always lead the world can there be any doubt who the leader ought to be bear in mind though that nothing less than the mightiest original nonsubordinated soul has ever really gloriously led or ever can lead this soulits other name in these vistas is literature  in fond fancy leaping those hundred years ahead let us survey americas works poems philosophies fulfilling prophecies and giving form and decision to best ideals much that is now undreamd of we might then perhaps see establishd luxuriantly cropping forth richness vigor of letters and of artistic expression in whose products character will be a main requirement and not merely erudition or elegance  intense and loving comradeship the personal and passionate attachment of man to manwhich hard to define underlies the lessons and ideals of the profound saviours of every land and age and which seems to promise when thoroughly developd cultivated and recognized in manners and literature the most substantial hope and safety of the future of these states will then be fully expressd29  a strong fibred joyousness and faith and the sense of health al fresco may well enter into the preparation of future noble american authorship part of the test of a great literatus shall be the absence in him of the idea of the covert the lurid the maleficent the devil the grim estimates inherited from the puritans hell natural depravity and the like the great literatus will be known among the rest by his cheerful simplicity his adherence to natural standards his limitless faith in god his reverence and by the absence in him of doubt ennui burlesque persiflage or any straind and temporary fashion  nor must i fail again and yet again to clinch reiterate more plainly still o that indeed such survey as we fancy may show in time this part completed also the lofty aim surely the proudest and the purest in whose service the future literatus of whatever field may gladly labor as we have intimated offsetting the material civilization of our race our nationality its wealth territories factories population products trade and military and naval strength and breathing breath of life into all these and more must be its moral civilizationthe formulation expression and aidancy whereof is the very highest height of literature the climax of this loftiest range of civilization rising above all the gorgeous shows and results of wealth intellect power and art as suchabove even theology and religious fervoris to be its development from the eternal bases and the fit expression of absolute conscience moral soundness justice even in religious fervor there is a touch of animal heat but moral conscientiousness crystalline without flaw not godlike only entirely human awes and enchants forever great is emotional love even in the order of the rational universe but if we must make gradations i am clear there is something greater power love veneration products genius esthetics tried by subtlest comparisons analyses and in serenest moods somewhere fail somehow become vain then noiseless withflowing steps the lord the sun the last ideal comes by the names right justice truth we suggest but do not describe it to the world of men it remains a dream an idea as they call it but no dream is it to the wisebut the proudest almost only solid lasting thing of all its analogy in the material universe is what holds together this world and every object upon it and carries its dynamics on forever sure and safe its lack and the persistent shirking of it as in life sociology literature politics business and even sermonizing these times or any times still leaves the abysm the mortal flaw and smutch mocking civilization today with all its unquestiond triumphs and all the civilization so far known30  present literature while magnificently fulfilling certain popular demands with plenteous knowledge and verbal smartness is profoundly sophisticated insane and its very joy is morbid it needs tally and express nature and the spirit of nature and to know and obey the standards i say the question of nature largely considerd involves the questions of the esthetic the emotional and the religiousand involves happiness a fitly born and bred race growing up in right conditions of outdoor as much as indoor harmony activity and development would probably from and in those conditions find it enough merely to liveand would in their relations to the sky air water trees c and to the countless common shows and in the fact of life itself discover and achieve happinesswith being suffused night and day by wholesome extasy surpassing all the pleasures that wealth amusement and even gratified intellect erudition or the sense of art can give  in the prophetic literature of these states the reader of my speculations will miss their principal stress unless he allows well for the point that a new literature perhaps a new metaphysics certainly a new poetry are to be in my opinion the only sure and worthy supports and expressions of the american democracy nature true nature and the true idea of nature long absent must above all become fully restored enlarged and must furnish the pervading atmosphere to poems and the test of all high literary and esthetic compositions i do not mean the smooth walks trimmd hedges poseys and nightingales of the english poets but the whole orb with its geologic history the kosmos carrying fire and snow that rolls through the illimitable areas light as a feather though weighing billions of tons furthermore as by what we now partially call nature is intended at most only what is entertainable by the physical conscience the sense of matter and of good animal healthon these it must be distinctly accumulated incorporated that man comprehending these has in towering superaddition the moral and spiritual consciences indicating his destination beyond the ostensible the mortal  to the heights of such estimate of nature indeed ascending we proceed to make observations for our vistas breathing rarest air what is i believe called idealism seems to me to suggest guarding against extravagance and ever modified even by its opposite the course of inquiry and desert of favor for our new world metaphysics their foundation of and in literature giving hue to all31  the elevating and etherealizing ideas of the unknown and of unreality must be brought forward with authority as they are the legitimate heirs of the known and of reality and at least as great as their parents fearless of scoffing and of the ostent let us take our stand our ground and never desert it to confront the growing excess and arrogance of realism to the cry now victoriousthe cry of sense science flesh incomes farms merchandise logic intellect demonstrations solid perpetuities buildings of brick and iron or even the facts of the shows of trees earth rocks c fear not my brethren my sisters to sound out with equally determind voice that conviction brooding within the recesses of every envisiond soulillusions apparitions figments all true we must not condemn the show neither absolutely deny it for the indispensability of its meanings but how clearly we see that migrate in soul to what we can already conceive of superior and spiritual points of view and palpable as it seems under present relations it all and several might nay certainly would fall apart and vanish  i hail with joy the oceanic variegated intense practical energy the demand for facts even the business materialism of the current age our states but we to the age or land in which these things movements stopping at themselves do not tend to ideas as fuel to flame and flame to the heavens so must wealth science materialismeven this democracy of which we make so muchunerringly feed the highest mind the soul infinitude the flight fathomless the mystery man so diminutive dilates beyond the sensible universe competes with outcopes space and time meditating even one great idea thus and thus only does a human being his spirit ascend above and justify objective nature which probably nothing in itself is incredibly and divinely serviceable indispensable real here and as the purport of objective nature is doubtless folded hidden somewhere hereas somewhere here is what this globe and its manifold forms and the light of day and nights darkness and life itself with all its experiences are forit is here the great literature especially verse must get its inspiration and throbbing blood then may we attain to a poetry worthy the immortal soul of man and widen while absorbing materials and in their own sense the shows of nature will above all have both directly and indirectly a freeing fluidizing expanding religious character exulting with science fructifying the moral elements and stimulating aspirations and meditations on the unknown  the process so far is indirect and peculiar and though it may be suggested cannot be defined observing rapport and with intuition the shows and forms presented by nature the sensuous luxuriance the beautiful in living men and women the actual play of passions in history and lifeand above all from those developments either in nature or human personality in which power dearest of all to the sense of the artist transacts itselfout of these and seizing what is in them the poet the esthetic worker in any field by the divine magic of his genius projects them their analogies by curious removes indirections in literature and art no useless attempt to repeat the material creation by daguerreotyping the exact likeness by mortal mental means this is the imagemaking faculty coping with material creation and rivaling almost triumphing over it this alone when all the other parts of a specimen of literature or art are ready and waiting can breathe into it the breath of life and endow it with identity  the true question to ask says the librarian of congress in a paper read before the social science convention at new york october 1869 the true question to ask respecting a book is has it helpd any human soul this is the hint statement not only of the great literatus his book but of every great artist it may be that all works of art are to be first tried by their art qualities their imageforming talent and their dramatic pictorial plotconstructing euphonious and other talents then whenever claiming to be firstclass works they are to be strictly and sternly tried by their foundation in and radiation in the highest sense and always indirectly of the ethic principles and eligibility to free arouse dilate  as within the purposes of the kosmos and vivifying all meteorology and all the congeries of the mineral vegetable and animal worldsall the physical growth and development of man and all the history of the race in politics religions wars c there is a moral purpose a visible or invisible intention certainly underlying allits results and proof needing to be patiently waited forneeding intuition faith idiosyncrasy to its realization which many and especially the intellectual do not haveso in the product or congeries of the product of the greatest literatus this is the last profoundest measure and test of a firstclass literary or esthetic achievement and when understood and put in force must fain i say lead to works books nobler than any hitherto known lo nature the only complete actual poem existing calmly in the divine scheme containing all content careless of the criticisms of a day or these endless and wordy chatterers and lo to the consciousness of the soul the permanent identity the thought the something before which the magnitude even of democracy art literature c dwindles becomes partial measurablesomething that fully satisfies which those do not that something is the all and the idea of all with the accompanying idea of eternity and of itself the soul buoyant indestructible sailing space forever visiting every region as a ship the sea and again lo the pulsations in all matter all spirit throbbing foreverthe eternal beats eternal systole and diastole of life in thingswherefrom i feel and know that death is not the ending as was thought but rather the real beginningand that nothing ever is or can be lost nor ever die nor soul nor matter  in the future of these states must arise poets immenser far and make great poems of death the poems of life are great but there must be the poems of the purports of life not only in itself but beyond itself i have eulogized homer the sacred bards of jewry eschylus juvenal shakspere c and acknowledged their inestimable value but with perhaps the exception in some not all respects of the secondmentiond i say there must for future and democratic purposes appear poets dare i to say so of higher class even than any of thosepoets not only possessd of the religious fire and abandon of isaiah luxuriant in the epic talent of homer or for proud characters as in shakspere but consistent with the hegelian formulas and consistent with modern science america needs and the world needs a class of bards who will now and ever so link and tally the rational physical being of man with the ensembles of time and space and with this vast and multiform show nature surrounding him ever tantalizing him equally a part and yet not a part of him as to essentially harmonize satisfy and put at rest faith very old now scared away by science must be restored brought back by the same power that caused her departurerestored with new sway deeper wider higher than ever surely this universal ennui this coward fear this shuddering at death these low degrading views are not always to rule the spirit pervading future society as it has the past and does the present what the roman lucretius sought most nobly yet all too blindly negatively to do for his age and its successors must be done positively by some great coming literatus especially poet who while remaining fully poet will absorb whatever science indicates with spiritualism and out of them and out of his own genius will compose the great poem of death then will man indeed confront nature and confront time and space both with science and con amore and take his right place prepared for life master of fortune and misfortune and then that which was long wanted will be supplied and the ship that had it not before in all her voyages will have an anchor  there are still other standards suggestions for products of high literatuses that which really balances and conserves the social and political world is not so much legislation police treaties and dread of punishment as the latent eternal intuitional sense in humanity of fairness manliness decorum c indeed this perennial regulation control and oversight by selfsuppliance is sine qua non to democracy and a highest widest aim of democratic literature may well be to bring forth cultivate brace and strengthen this sense in individuals and society a strong mastership of the general inferior self by the superior self is to be aided secured indirectly but surely by the literatus in his works shaping for individual or aggregate democracy a great passionate body in and along with which goes a great masterful spirit  and still providing for contingencies i fain confront the fact the need of powerful native philosophs and orators and bards these states as rallying points to come in times of danger and to fend off ruin and defection for history is long long long shift and turn the combinations of the statement as we may the problem of the future of america is in certain respects as dark as it is vast pride competition segregation vicious wilfulness

arrived now definitely at an apex for these vistas i confess that the promulgation and belief in such a class or institutiona new and greater literatus orderits possibility nay certainty underlies these entire speculationsand that the rest the other parts as superstructures are all founded upon it it really seems to me the condition not only of our future national and democratic development but of our perpetuation in the highly artificial and materialistic bases of modern civilization with the corresponding arrangements and methods of living the forceinfusion of intellect alone the depraving influences of riches just as much as poverty the absence of all high ideals in characterwith the long series of tendencies shapings which few are strong enough to resist and which now seem with steamengine speed to be everywhere turning out the generations of humanity like uniform iron castingsall of which as compared with the feudal ages we can yet do nothing better than accept make the best of and even welcome upon the whole for their oceanic practical grandeur and their restless wholesale kneading of the massesi say of all this tremendous and dominant play of solely materialistic bearings upon current life in the united states with the results as already seen accumulating and reaching far into the future that they must either be confronted and met by at least an equally subtle and tremendous forceinfusion for purposes of spiritualization for the pure conscience for genuine esthetics and for absolute and primal manliness and womanlinessor else our modern civilization with all its improvements is in vain and we are on the road to a destiny a status equivalent in its real world to that of the fabled damned  prospecting thus the coming unsped days and that new order in

little thing we have in having the bequeathd libraries countless shelves of volumes records etc yet how serious the danger depending entirely on them of the bloodless vein the nerveless arm the false application at second or third hand we see that the real interest of this people of ours in the theology history poetry politics and personal models of the past the british islands for instance and indeed all the past is not necessarily to mould ourselves or our literature upon them but to attain fuller more definite comparisons warnings and the insight to ourselves our own present and our own far grander different future history religion social customs c we see that almost everything that has been written sung or stated of old with reference to humanity under the feudal and oriental institutes religions and for other lands needs to be rewritten resung restated in terms consistent with the institution of these states and to come in range and obedient uniformity with them  we see

command them adorn them and carry them upward into superior realmsso out of the series of the preceding social and political universes now arise these states we see that while many were supposing things establishd and completed really the grandest things always remain and discover that the work of the new world is not ended but only fairly begun  we see our land america her literature

true as has been shown by the recent apportionment of population in the house of representatives that some sections of the union have advanced relatively to the rest in an extraordinary and unexpected degree but this does not imply that the states which have gaind no additional representatives or have actually lost some have been stationary or have receded the fact is that the present tide of

complex influences and premises and the man as well as the woman and the woman as well as the man  23 the question hinted here is one which time only can answer must not the virtue of modern individualism continually enlarging usurping all seriously affect perhaps keep down entirely in america the like of the ancient virtue of patriotism the fervid and absorbing love of general country i have no doubt myself that the two will merge and will mutually profit and brace each other and that from them a greater product a third will arise but i feel that at present they and their oppositions form a serious problem and paradox in the united states  24 shooting niagarai was at first roused to much anger and abuse by this essay from mr carlyle so insulting to the theory of americabut happening to think afterwards how i had more than once been in the like mood during which his essay was evidently cast and seen persons and things in the same light indeed some might say there are signs of the same feeling in these vistasi have since read it again not only as a study expressing as it does certain judgments from the highest feudal point of view but have read it with respect as coming from an earnest soul and as contributing certain sharpcutting metallic grains which if not gold or silver may be good hard honest iron  25 for fear of mistake i may as well distinctly specify as cheerfully included in the model and standard of these vistas a practical stirring worldly moneymaking even materialistic character it is undeniable that our farms stores offices drygoods coal and groceries enginery cashaccounts trades earnings markets c should be attended to in earnest and actively pursued just as if they had a real and permanent existence i perceive clearly that the extreme business energy and this almost maniacal appetite for wealth prevalent in the united states are parts of amelioration and progress indispensably needed to prepare the very results i demand my theory includes riches and the getting of riches and the amplest products power activity inventions movements c upon them as upon substrata i raise the edifice designd in these vistas  26 the whole present system of the officering and personnel of the army and navy of these states and the spirit and letter of their treblyaristocratic rules and regulations is a monstrous exotic a nuisance and revolt and belong here just as much as orders of nobility or the popes council of cardinals i say if the present theory of our army and navy is sensible and true then the rest of america is an unmitigated fraud  27 a after the rest is satiated all interest culminates in the field of persons and never flags there accordingly in this field have the great poets and literatuses signally toild they too in all ages all lands have been creators fashioning making types of men and women as adam and eve are made in the divine fable behold shaped bred by orientalism feudalism through their long growth and culmination and breeding back in returnwhen shall we have an equal series typical of democracybehold commencing in primal asia apparently formulated in what beginning we know in the gods of the mythologies and

penelope the portraits of brunhelde and chriemhilde in the nibelungen oriana una c the modern consuelo walter scotts jeanie and effie deans c c yet woman portrayd or outlind at her best or as perfect human mother does not hitherto it seems to me fully appear in literature  28 note today an instructive curious spectacle and conflict science twin in its fields of democracy in itsscience testing absolutely all thoughts all works has already burst well upon the worlda sun mounting most illuminating most glorioussurely never again to set but against it deeply entrenchd holding possession yet remains not only through the churches and schools but by imaginative literature and unregenerate poetry the fossil theology of the mythicmaterialistic superstitious untaught and credulous fableloving primitive ages of humanity  29 it is to the development identification and general prevalence of that fervid comradeship the adhesive love at least rivaling the amative love hitherto possessing imaginative literature if not going beyond it that i look for the counterbalance and offset of our materialistic and vulgar american democracy and for the spiritualization thereof many will say it is a dream and will not follow my inferences but i confidently expect a time when there will be seen running like a halfhid warp through all the myriad audible and visible worldly interests of america threads of manly friendship fond and loving pure and sweet strong and lifelong carried to degrees hitherto unknownnot only giving tone to individual character and making it unprecedently emotional muscular heroic and refined but having the deepest relations to general politics i say democracy infers such loving comradeship as its most inevitable twin or counterpart without which it will be incomplete in vain and incapable of perpetuating itself  30 i am reminded as i write that out of this very conscience or idea of conscience of intense moral right and in its name and straind construction the worst fanaticisms wars persecutions murders c have yet in all lands in the past been broachd and have come to their devilish fruition much is to be saidbut i may say here and in response that side by side with the unflagging stimulation of the elements of religion and conscience must henceforth move with equal sway science absolute reason and the general proportionate development of the whole man these scientific facts deductions are divine tooprecious counted parts of moral civilization and with physical health indispensable to it to prevent fanaticism for abstract religion i perceive is easily led astray ever credulous and is capable of devouring remorseless like fire and flame conscience too isolated from all else and from the emotional nature may but attain the beauty and purity of glacial snowy ice we want for these states for the general character a cheerful religious fervor endued with the everpresent modifications of the human emotions friendship benevolence with a fair field for scientific inquiry the right of individual judgment and always the cooling influences of material nature  31 the culmination and fruit of literary artistic expression and its final fields of pleasure for the human soul are in metaphysics including the mysteries of the spiritual world the soul itself and the question of the immortal continuation of our identity in all ages the mind of man has brought up hereand always will here at least of whatever race or era we stand on common ground applause too is unanimous antique or modern those authors who work well in this fieldthough their reward instead of a handsome percentage or royalty may be but simply the laurelcrown of the victors in the great olympic gameswill be dearest to humanity and their works however esthetically defective will be treasurd forever the altitude of literature and poetry has always been religionand always will be the indian vedas the nackas of zoroaster the tal mud of the jews the old testament the gospel of christ and his disciples platos works the koran of mohammed the edda of snorro and so on toward our own day to swedenborg and to the invaluable contributions of leibnitz kant and hegelthese with such poems only in which while singing well of persons and events of the passions of man and the shows of the material universe the religious tone the consciousness of mystery the recognition of the future of the unknown of deity over and under all and of the divine purpose are never absent but indirectly give tone to allexhibit literatures real heights and elevations towering up like the great mountains of the earth  standing on this groundthe last the highest only permanent groundand sternly criticising from it all works either of the literary or any art we have peremptorily to dismiss every pretensive production however fine its esthetic or intellectual points which violates or ignores or even does not celebrate the central divine idea of all suffusing universe of eternal trains of purpose in the development by however slow degrees of the physical moral and spiritual kosmos i say he has studied meditated to no profit whatever may be his mere erudition who has not absorbed this simple consciousness and faith it is not entirely newbut it is for democracy to elaborate it and look to build upon and expand from it with uncompromising reliance above the doors of teaching the inscription is to appear though little or nothing can be absolutely known perceivd except from a point of view which is evanescent yet we know at least one permanency that time and space in the will of god furnish successive chains completions of material births and beginnings solve all discrepancies fears and doubts and eventually fulfil happinessand that the prophecy of those births namely spiritual results throws the true arch over all teaching all science the local considerations of sin disease deformity ignorance death c and their measurement by the superficial mind and ordinary legislation and theology are to be met by science boldly accepting promulging this faith and planting the seeds of superber lawsof the explication of the physical universe through the spiritualand clearing the way for a religion sweet and unimpugnable alike to little child or great savan     origins of attempted secession  not the whole matter but some side facts worth conning today and any day  i consider the war of attempted secession 186065 not as a struggle of two distinct and separate peoples but a conflict often happening and very fierce between the passions and paradoxes of one and the same identityperhaps the only terms on which that identity could really become fused homogeneous and lasting the origin and conditions out of which it arose are full of lessons full of warnings yet to the republicand always will be the underlying and principal of those origins are yet singularly ignored the northern states were really just as responsible for that war in its precedents foundations instigations as the south let me try to give my view from the age of 21 to 40 184060 i was interested in the political movements of the land not so much as a participant but as an observer and a regular voter at the elections i think i was conversant with the springs of action and their workings not only in new york city and brooklyn but understood them in the whole country as i had made leisurely tours through all the middle states and partially through the western and southern and down to new orleans in which city i resided for some time i was there at the close of the mexican warsaw and talkd with general taylor and the other generals and officers who were feted and detaind several days on their return victorious from that expedition  of course many and very contradictory things specialties developments constitutional views c went to make up the origin of the warbut the most significant general fact can be best indicated and stated as follows for twentyfive years previous to the outbreak the controling democratic nominating conventions of our republicstarting from their primaries in wards or districts and so expanding to counties powerful cities states and to the great presidential nominating conventionswere getting to represent and be composed of more and more putrid and dangerous materials let me give a schedule or list of one of these representative conventions for a long time before and inclusive of that which nominated buchanan remember they had come to be the fountains and tissues of the american body politic forming as it were the whole blood legislation officeholding c one of these conventions from 1840 to 60 exhibited a spectacle such as could never be seen except in our own age and in these states the members who composed it were seveneighths of them the meanest kind of bawling and blowing officeholders officeseekers pimps malignants conspirators murderers fancymen customhouse clerks contractors kepteditors spaniels welltraind to carry and fetch jobbers infidels disunionists terrorists mailriflers slavecatchers pushers of slavery creatures of the president creatures of

vile disease gaudy outside with gold chains made from the peoples money and harlots money twisted together crawling serpentine men the lousy combings and born freedomsellers of the earth and whence came they from backyards and barrooms from out of the customhouses marshals offices postoffices and gamblinghells from the presidents house the jail the stationhouse from unnamed byplaces where devilish disunion was hatchd at midnight from political hearses and from the coffins inside and from the shrouds inside of the coffins from the tumors and abscesses of the land from the skeletons and skulls in the vaults of the federal almshouses and from the running sores of the great cities such i say formd or absolutely controlld the forming of the entire personnel the atmosphere nutriment and chyle of our municipal state and national politicssubstantially permeating handling deciding and wielding everythinglegislation nominations elections public sentiment cwhile the great masses of the people farmers mechanics and traders were helpless in their gripe these conditions were mostly prevalent in the north and west and especially in new york and philadelphia cities and the southern leaders bad enough but of a far higher order struck hands and affiliated with and used them is it strange that a thunderstorm followd such morbid and stifling cloudstrata  i say then that what as just outlined heralded and made the ground ready for secession revolt ought to be held up through all the future as the most instructive lesson in american political historythe most significant warning and beaconlight to coming generations i say that the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth terms of the american presidency have shown that the villainy and shallowness of rulers backd by the machinery of great parties are just as eligible to these states as to any foreign despotism kingdom or empirethere is not a bit of difference history is to record those three presidentiads and especially the administrations of fillmore and buchanan as so far our topmost warning and shame never were publicly displayd more deformd mediocre snivelling unreliable falsehearted men never were these states so insulted and attempted to be betrayd all the main purposes for which the government was establishd were openly denied the perfect equality of slavery with freedom was flauntingly preachd in the northnay the superiority of slavery the slave trade was proposed to be renewd everywhere frowns and misunderstandingseverywhere exasperations and humiliations the slavery contest is settledand the war is long overyet do not those putrid conditions too many of them still exist still result in diseases fevers woundsnot of war and army hospitalsbut the wounds and diseases of peace  out of those generic influences mainly in new york pennsylvania ohio c arose the attempt at disunion to philosophical examination the malignant fever of that war shows its embryonic sources and the original nourishment of its life and growth in the north i say secession below the surface originated and was brought to maturity in the free states i allude to the score of years preceding 1860 my deliberate opinion is now that if at the opening of the contest the abstract dualityquestion of slavery and quiet could have been submitted to a direct popular vote as against their opposite they would have triumphantly carried the day in a majority of the northern statesin the large cities leading off with new york and philadelphia by tremendous majorities the events of 61 amazed everybody north and south and burst all prophecies and calculations like bubbles but even then and during the whole war the stern fact remains that not only did the north put it down but the secession cause had numerically just as many sympathizers in the free as in the rebel states  as to slavery abstractly and practically its idea and the determination to establish and expand it especially in the new territories the future america it is too common i repeat to identify it exclusively with the south in fact down to the opening of the war the whole country had about an equal hand in it the north had at least been just as guilty if not more guilty and the east and west had the former presidents and congresses had been guiltythe governors and legislatures of every northern state had been guilty and the mayors of new york and other northern cities had all been guiltytheir hands were all staind and as the conflict took decided shape it is hard to tell which class the leading southern or northern disunionists was more stunnd and disappointed at the nonaction of the freestate secession element so largely existing and counted on by those leaders both sections  so much for that point and for the north as to the inception and direct instigation of the war in the south itself i shall not attempt interiors or complications behind all the idea that it was from a resolute and arrogant determination on the part of the extreme slaveholders the calhounites to carry the statesrights portion of the constitutional compact to its farthest verge and nationalize slavery or else disrupt the union and found a new empire with slavery for its cornerstone was and is undoubtedly the true theory if successful this attempt mighti am not sure but it mighthave destroyd not only our american republic in anything like firstclass proportions in itself and its prestige but for ages at least the cause of liberty and equality everywhereand would have been the greatest triumph of reaction and the severest blow to political and every other freedom possible to conceive its worst result would have inured to the southern states themselves that our national democratic experiment principle and machinery could triumphantly sustain such a shock and that the constitution could weather it like a ship a storm and come out of it as sound and whole as before is by far the most signal proof yet of the stability of that experiment democracy and of those principles and that constitution  of the war itself we know in the ostent what has been done the numbers of the dead and wounded can be told or approximated the debt posted and put on record the material events narrated c meantime elections go on laws are passd political parties struggle issue their platforms c just the same as before but immensest results not only in politics but in literature poems and sociology are doubtless waiting yet unformd in the future how long they will wait i cannot tell the pageant of historys retrospect shows us ages since all europe marching on the crusades those armd uprisings of the people stirrd by a mere idea to grandest attemptand when once baffled in it returning at intervals twice thrice and again an unsurpassd series of revolutionary events influences yet it took over two hundred years for the seeds of the crusades to germinate before beginning even to sprout two hundred years they lay sleeping not dead but dormant in the ground then out of them unerringly arts travel navigation politics literature freedom the spirit of adventure inquiry all arose grew and steadily sped on to what we see at present far back there that huge agitationstruggle of the crusades stands as undoubtedly the embryo the start of the high preeminence of experiment civilization and enterprise which the european nations have since sustaind and of which these states are the heirs  another illustrationhistory is full of them although the war itself the victory of the union and the relations of our equal states present features of which there are no precedents in the past the conquest of england eight centuries ago by the franconormansthe obliteration of the old in many respects so needing obliterationthe domesday book and the repartition of the landthe old impedimenta removed even by blood and ruthless violence and a new progressive genesis establishd new seeds sowntime has proved plain enough that bitter as they were all these were the most salutary series of revolutions that could possibly have happend out of them and by them mainly have come out of albic roman and saxon englandand without them could not have comenot only the england of the 500 years down to the present and of the presentbut these states nor except for that terrible dislocation and overturn would these states as they are exist today  it is certain to me that the united states by virtue of that war and its results and through that and them only are now ready to enter and must certainly enter upon their genuine career in history as no more torn and divided in their spinal requisites but a great homogeneous nationfree states alla moral and political unity in variety such as nature shows in her grandest physical works and as much greater than any mere work of nature as the moral and political the work of man his mind his soul are in their loftiest sense greater than the merely physical out of that war not only has the nationality of the states escaped from being strangled but more than any of the rest and in my opinion more than the north itself the vital heart and breath of the south have escaped as from the pressure of a general nightmare and are henceforth to enter on a life development and active freedom whose realities are certain in the future notwithstanding all the southern vexations of the houra development which could not possibly have been achievd on any less terms or by any other means than that grim lesson or something equivalent to it and i predict that the south is yet to outstrip the north      prefaces to leaves of grass   preface 1855 to first issue of leaves of grass brooklyn ny  america does not repel the past or what the past has produced under its forms or amid other politics or the idea of castes or the old religionsaccepts the lesson with calmnessis not impatient because the slough still sticks to opinions and manners in literature while the life which served its requirements has passed into the new life of the new formsperceives that the corpse is slowly borne from the eating and sleeping rooms of the houseperceives that it waits a little while in the doorthat it was fittest for its daysthat its action has descended to the stalwart and wellshaped heir who approachesand that he shall be fittest for his days  the americans of all nations at any time upon the earth have probably the fullest poetical nature the united states themselves are essentially the greatest poem in the history of the earth hitherto the largest and most stirring appear tame and orderly to their ampler largeness and stir here at last is something in the doings of man that corresponds with the broadcast doings of the day and night here is action untied from strings necessarily blind to particulars and details magnificently moving in masses here is the hospitality which for ever indicates heroes here the performance disdaining the trivial unapproachd in the tremendous audacity of its crowds and groupings and the push of its perspective spreads with crampless and flowing breadth and showers its prolific and splendid extravagance one sees it must indeed own the riches of the summer and winter and need never be bankrupt while corn grows from the ground or the orchards drop apples or the bays contain fish or men beget children upon women  other states indicate themselves in their deputiesbut the genius of the united states is not best or most in its executives or legislatures nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors nor even in its newspapers or inventorsbut always most in the common people south north west east in all its states through all its mighty amplitude the largeness of the nation however were monstrous without a corresponding largeness and generosity of the spirit of the citizen not swarming states nor streets and steamships nor prosperous business nor farms nor capital nor learning may suffice for the ideal of mannor suffice the poet no reminiscences may suffice either a live nation can always cut a deep mark and can have the best authority the cheapestnamely from its own soul this is the sum of the profitable uses of individuals or states and of present action and grandeur and of the subjects of poets as if it were necessary to trot back generation after generation to the eastern records as if the beauty and sacredness of the demonstrable must fall behind that of the mythical as if men do not make their mark out of any times as if the opening of the western continent by discovery and what has transpired in north and south america were less than the small theatre of the antique or the aimless sleepwalking of the middle ages the pride of the united states leaves the wealth and finesse of the cities and all returns of commerce and agriculture and all the magnitude of geography or shows of exterior victory to enjoy the sight and realization of fullsized men or one fullsized man unconquerable and simple the american poets are to enclose old and new for america is the race of races the expression of the american poet is to be transcendent and new it is to be indirect and not direct or descriptive or epic its quality goes through these to much more let the age and wars of other nations be chanted and their eras and characters be illustrated and that finish the verse not so the great psalm of the republic here the theme is creative and has vista whatever stagnates in the flat of custom or obedience or legislation the great poet never stagnates obedience does not master him he masters it high up out of reach he stands turning a concentrated lighthe turns the pivot with his fingerhe baffles the swiftest runners as he stands and easily overtakes and envelopes them the time straying toward infidelity and confections and persiflage he withholds by steady faith faith is the antiseptic of the soulit pervades the common people and preserves themthey never give up believing and expecting and trusting there is that indescribable freshness and unconsciousness about an illiterate person that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius the poet sees for a certainty how one not a great artist may be just as sacred and perfect as the greatest artist  the power to destroy or remould is freely used by the greatest poet but seldom the power of attack what is past is past if he does not expose superior models and prove himself by every step he takes he is not what is wanted the presence of the great poet conquersnot parleying or struggling or any prepared attempts now he has passed that way see after him there is not left any vestige of despair or misanthropy or cunning or exclusiveness or the ignominy of a nativity or color or delusion of hell or the necessity of helland no man thenceforward shall be degraded for ignorance or weakness or sin the greatest poet hardly knows pettiness or triviality if he breathes into anything that was before thought small it dilates with the grandeur and life of the universe he is a seerhe is individualhe is complete in himselfthe others are as good as he only he sees it and they do not he is not one of the chorushe does not stop for any regulationhe is the president of regulation what the eyesight does to the rest he does to the rest who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight the other senses corroborate themselves but this is removed from any proof but its own and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world a single glance of it mocks all the investigations of man and all the instruments and books of the earth and all reasoning what is marvellous what is unlikely what is impossible or baseless or vagueafter you have once just opend the space of a peachpit and given audience to far and near and to the sunset and had all things enter with electric swiftness softly and duly without confusion or jostling or jam  the land and sea the animals fishes and birds the sky of heaven and the orbs the forests mountains and rivers are not small themes but folks expect of the poet to indicate more than the beauty and dignity which always attach to dumb real objectsthey expect him to indicate the path between reality and their souls men and women perceive the beauty well enoughprobably as well as he the passionate tenacity of hunters woodmen early risers cultivators of gardens and orchards and fields the love of healthy women for the manly form seafaring persons drivers of horses the passion for light and the open air all is an old varied sign of the unfailing perception of beauty and of a residence of the poetic in outdoor people they can never be assisted by poets to perceivesome may but they never can the poetic quality is not marshald in rhyme or uniformity or abstract addresses to things nor in melancholy complaints or good precepts but is the life of these and much else and is in the soul the profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme and of uniformity that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight the rhyme and uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws and bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs and roses on a bush and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts and oranges and melons and pears and shed the perfume impalpable to form the fluency and ornaments of the finest poems or music or orations or recitations are not independent but dependent all beauty comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain if the greatnesses are in conjunction in a man or woman it is enoughthe fact will prevail through the universe but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not prevail who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost this is what you shall do love the earth and sun and the animals despise riches give alms to every one that asks stand up for the stupid and crazy devote your income and labor to others hate tyrants argue not concerning god have patience and indulgence toward the people take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of mengo freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of familiesreexamine all you have been told in school or church or in any book and dismiss whatever insults your own soul and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body the poet shall not spend his time in unneeded work he shall know that the ground is already ploughd and manured others may not know it but he shall he shall go directly to the creation his trust shall master the trust of everything he touchesand shall master all attachment  the known universe has one complete lover and that is the greatest poet he consumes an eternal passion and is indifferent which chance happens and which possible contingency of fortune or misfortune and persuades daily and hourly his delicious pay what balks or breaks others is fuel for his burning progress to contact and amorous joy other proportions of the reception of pleasure dwindle to nothing to his proportions all expected from heaven or from the highest he is rapport with in the sight of the daybreak or the scenes of the winter woods or the presence of children playing or with his arm round the neck of a man or woman his love above all love has leisure and expansehe leaves room ahead of himself he is no irresolute or suspicious loverhe is surehe scorns intervals his experience and the showers and thrills are not for nothing nothing can jar himsuffering and darkness cannotdeath and fear cannot to him complaint and jealousy and envy are corpses buried and rotten in the earthhe saw them buried the sea is not surer of the shore or the shore of the sea than he is the fruition of his love and of all perfection and beauty  the fruition of beauty is no chance of miss or hitit is as inevitable as lifeit is exact and plumb as gravitation from the eyesight proceeds another eyesight and from the hearing proceeds another hearing and from the voice proceeds another voice eternally curious of the harmony of things with man these understand the law of perfection in masses and floodsthat it is profuse and impartialthat there is not a minute of the light or dark nor an acre of the earth and sea without itnor any direction of the sky nor any trade or employment nor any turn of events this is the reason that about the proper expression of beauty there is precision and balance one part does not need to be thrust above another the best singer is not the one who has the most lithe and powerful organ the pleasure of poems is not in them that take the handsomest measure and sound  without effort and without exposing in the least how it is done the greatest poet brings the spirit of any or all events and passions and scenes and persons some more and some less to bear on your individual character as you hear or read to do this well is to compete with the laws that pursue and follow time what is the purpose must surely be there and the clue of it must be thereand the faintest indication is the indication of the best and then becomes the clearest indication past and present and future are not disjoind but joind the greatest poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been and is he drags the dead out of their coffins and stands them again on their feet he says to the past rise and walk before me that i may realize you he learns the lessonhe places himself where the future becomes present the greatest poet does not only dazzle his rays over character and scenes and passionshe finally ascends and finishes allhe exhibits the pinnacles that no man can tell what they are for or what is beyondhe glows a moment on the extremest verge he is most wonderful in his last halfhidden smile or frown by that flash of the moment of parting the one that sees it shall be encouraged or terrified afterward for many years the greatest poet does not moralize or make applications of moralshe knows the soul the soul has that measureless pride which consists in never acknowledging any lessons or deductions but its own but it has sympathy as measureless as its pride and the one balances the other and neither can stretch too far while it stretches in company with the other the inmost secrets of art sleep with the twain the greatest poet has lain close betwixt both and they are vital in his style and thoughts  the art of art the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters is simplicity nothing is better than simplicitynothing can make up for excess or for the lack of definiteness to carry on the heave of impulse and pierce intellectual depths and give all subjects their articulations are powers neither common nor very uncommon but to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of the movements of animals and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the roadside is the flawless triumph of art if you have lookd on him who has achievd it you have lookd on one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times you shall not contemplate the flight of the gray gull over the bay or the mettlesome action of the blood horse or the tall leaning of sunflowers on their stalk or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven or the appearance of the moon afterward with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him the great poet has less a markd style and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution and is the free channel of himself he swears to his art i will not be meddlesome i will not have in my writing any elegance or effect or originality to hang in the way between me and the rest like curtains i will have nothing hang in the way not the richest curtains what i tell i tell for precisely what it is let who may exalt or startle or fascinate or soothe i will have purposes as health or heat or snow has and be as regardless of observation what i experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition you shall stand by my side and look in the mirror with me  the old red blood and stainless gentility of great poets will be proved by their unconstraint a heroic person walks at his ease through and out of that custom or precedent or authority that suits him not of the traits of the brotherhood of firstclass writers savans musicians inventors and artists nothing is finer than silent defiance advancing from new free forms in the need of poems philosophy politics mechanism science behavior the craft of art an appropriate native grand opera shipcraft or any craft he is greatest for ever and ever who contributes the greatest original practical example the cleanest expression is that which finds no sphere worthy of itself and makes one  the messages of great poems to each man and woman are come to us on equal terms only then can you understand us we are no better than you what we inclose you inclose what we enjoy you may enjoy did you suppose there could be only one supreme we affirm there can be unnumberd supremes and that one does not countervail another any more than one eyesight countervails anotherand that men can be good or grand only of the consciousness of their supremacy within them what do you think is the grandeur of storms and dismemberments and the deadliest battles and wrecks and the wildest fury of the elements and the power of the sea and the motion of nature and the throes of human desires and dignity and hate and love it is that something in the soul which says rage on whirl on i tread master here and everywheremaster of the spasms of the sky and of the shatter of the sea master of nature and passion and death and of all terror and all pain  the american bards shall be markd for generosity and affection and for encouraging competitors they shall be kosmos without monopoly or secrecy glad to pass anything to any onehungry for equals night and day they shall not be careful of riches and privilegethey shall be riches and privilegethey shall perceive who the most affluent man is the most affluent man is he that confronts all the shows he sees by equivalents out of the stronger wealth of himself the american bard shall delineate no class of persons nor one or two out of the strata of interests nor love most nor truth most nor the soul most nor the body mostand not be for the eastern states more than the western or the northern states more than the southern  exact science and its practical movements are no checks on the greatest poet but always his encouragement and support the outset and remembrance are therethere the arms that lifted him first and braced him bestthere he

scheme where every motion and every spear of grass and the frames and spirits of men and women and all that concerns them are unspeakably perfect miracles all referring to all and each distinct and in its place it is also not consistent with the reality of the soul to admit that there is anything in the known universe more divine than men and women  men and women and the earth and all upon it are

be known by the absence in them of tricks and by the justification of perfect personal candor all faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candor henceforth let no man of us lie for we have seen that openness wins the inner and outer world and that there is no single exception and that never since our earth gatherd itself in a mass have deceit or subterfuge or prevarication attracted its smallest particle or the faintest tinge of a shadeand that through the enveloping wealth and rank of a state or the whole republic of states a sneak or sly person shall be discoverd and despisedand that the soul has never once been foold and never can be fooldand thrift without the loving nod of the soul is only a foetid puffand there never grew up in any of the continents of the globe nor upon any planet or satellite nor in that condition which precedes the birth of babes nor at any time during the changes of life nor in any stretch of abeyance or action of vitality nor in any process of formation or reformation anywhere a being whose instinct hated the truth  extreme caution or prudence the soundest organic health large hope and comparison and fondness for women and children large alimentiveness and destuctiveness and causality with a perfect sense of the oneness of nature and the propriety of the same spirit applied to human affairs are called up of the float of the brain of the world to be parts of the greatest poet from his birth out of his mothers womb and from her birth out of her mothers caution seldom goes far enough it has been thought that the prudent citizen was the citizen who applied himself to solid gains and did well for himself and for his family and completed a lawful life without debt or crime the greatest poet sees and admits these economies as he sees the economies of food and sleep but has higher notions of prudence than to think he gives much when he gives a few slight attentions at the latch of the gate the premises of the prudence of life are not the hospitality of it or the ripeness and harvest of it beyond the independence of a little sum laid aside for burialmoney and of a few clapboards around and shingles overhead on a lot of american soil ownd and the easy dollars that supply the years plain clothing and meals the melancholy prudence of the abandonment of such a great being as a man is to the toss and pallor of years of moneymaking with all their scorching days and icy nights and all their stifling deceits and underhand dodgings or infinitesimals of parlors or shameless stuffing while others starve and all the loss of the bloom and odor of the earth and of the flowers and atmosphere and of the sea and of the true taste of the women and men you pass or have to do with in youth or middle age and the issuing sickness and desperate revolt at the close of a life without elevation or naivety even if you have achievd a secure 10000 a year or election to congress or the governorship and the ghastly chatter of a death without serenity or majesty is the great fraud upon modern civilization and forethought blotching the surface and system which civilization undeniably drafts and moistening with tears the immense features it spreads and spreads with such velocity before the reachd kisses of the soul  ever the right explanation remains to be made about prudence the prudence of the mere wealth and respectability of the most esteemd life appears too faint for the eye to observe at all when little and large alike drop quietly aside at the thought of the prudence suitable for immortality what is the wisdom that fills the thinness of a year or seventy or eighty yearsto the wisdom spaced out by ages and coming back at a certain time with strong reinforcements and rich presents and the clear faces of weddingguests as far as you can look in every direction running gaily toward you only the soul is of itselfall else has reference to what ensues all that a person does or thinks is of consequence nor can the push of charity or personal force ever be anything else than the profoundest reason whether it brings argument to hand or no no specification is necessaryto add or subtract or divide is in vain little or big learnd or unlearnd white or black legal or illegal sick or well from the first inspiration down the windpipe to the last expiration out of it all that a male or female does that is vigorous and benevolent and clean is so much sure profit to him or her in the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope of it forever the prudence of the greatest poet answers at last the craving and glut of the soul puts off nothing permits no letup for its own case or any case has no particular sabbath or judgment day divides not the living from the dead or the righteous from the unrighteous is satisfied with the present matches every thought or act by its correlative and knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement  the direct trial of him who would be the greatest poet is today if he does not flood himself with the immediate age as with vast oceanic tidesif he be not himself the age transfigurd and if to him is not opend the eternity which gives similitude to all periods and locations and processes and animate and inanimate forms and which is the bond of time and rises up from its inconceivable vagueness and infiniteness in the swimming shapes of today and is held by the ductile anchors of life and makes the present spot the passage from what was to what shall be and commits itself to the representation of this wave of an hour and this one of the sixty beautiful children of the wavelet him merge in the general run and wait his development  still the final test of poems or any character or work remains the prescient poet projects himself centuries ahead and judges performer or performance after the changes of time does it live through them does it still hold on untired will the same style and the direction of genius to similar points be satisfactory now have the marches of tens and hundreds and thousands of years made willing detours to the right hand and the left hand for his sake is he beloved long and long after he is buried does the young man think often of him and the young woman think often of him and do the middleaged and the old think of him  a great poem is for ages and ages in common and for all degrees and complexions and all departments and sects and for a woman as much as a man and a man as much as a woman a great poem is no finish to a man or woman but rather a beginning has any one fancied he could sit at last under some due authority and rest satisfied with explanations and realize and be content and full to no such terminus does the greatest poet bringhe brings neither cessation nor shelterd fatness and ease the touch of him like nature tells in action whom he takes he takes with firm sure grasp into live regions previously unattaindthenceforward is no restthey see the space and ineffable sheen that turn the old spots and lights into dead vacuums now there shall be a man cohered out of tumult and chaos the elder encourages the younger and shows him howthey two shall launch off fearlessly together till the new world fits an orbit for itself and looks unabashd on the lesser orbits of the stars and sweeps through the ceaseless rings and shall never be quiet again  there will soon be no more priests their work is done a new order shall arise and they shall be the priests of man and every man shall be his own priest they shall find their inspiration in real objects today symptoms of the past and future they shall not deign to defend immortality or god or the perfection of things or liberty or the exquisite beauty and reality of the soul they shall arise in america and be responded to from the remainder of the earth  the english language befriends the grand american expressionit is brawny enough and limber and full enough on the tough stock of a race who through all change of circumstance was never without the idea of political liberty which is the animus of all liberty it has attracted the terms of daintier and gayer and subtler and more elegant tongues it is the powerful language of resistanceit is the dialect of common sense it is the speech of the proud and melancholy races and of all who aspire it is the chosen tongue to express growth faith selfesteem freedom justice equality friendliness amplitude prudence decision and courage it is the medium that shall wellnigh express the inexpressible  no great literature nor any like style of behavior or oratory or social intercourse or household arrangements or public institutions or the treatment by bosses of employd people nor executive detail or detail of the army and navy nor spirit of legislation or courts or police or tuition or architecture or songs or amusements can long elude the jealous and passionate instinct of american standards whether or no the sign appears from the mouths of the people it throbs a live interrogation in every freemans and freewomans heart after that which passes by or this built to remain is it uniform with my country are its disposals without ignominious distinctions is it for the evergrowing communes of brothers and lovers large well united proud beyond the old models generous beyond all models is it something grown fresh out of the fields or drawn from the sea for use to me today here i know that what answers for me an american in texas ohio canada must answer for any individual or nation that serves for a part of my materials does this answer is it for the nursing of the young of the republic does it solve readily with the sweet milk of the nipples of the breasts of the mother of many children  america prepares with composure and goodwill for the visitors that have sent word it is not intellect that is to be their warrant and welcome the talented the artist the ingenious the editor the statesman the erudite are not unappreciatedthey fall in their place and do their work the soul of the nation also does its work it rejects none it permits all only toward the like of itself will it advance halfway an individual is as superb as a nation when he has the qualities which make a superb nation the soul of the largest and wealthiest and proudest nation may well go halfway to meet that of its poets      preface 1872 to as a strong bird on pinions free now thou mother with thy equal brood in permanent edition   the impetus and ideas urging me for some years past to an utterance or attempt at utterance of new world songs and an epic of democracy having already had their publishd expression as well as i can expect to give it in leaves of grass the present and any future pieces from me are really but the surplusage forming after that volume or the wake eddying behind it i fulfilld in that an imperious conviction and the commands of my nature as total and irresistible as those which make the sea flow or the globe revolve but of this supplementary volume i confess i am not so certain having from early manhood abandond the business pursuits and applications usual in my time and country and obediently yielded myself up ever since to the impetus mentiond and to the work of expressing those ideas it may be that mere habit has got dominion of me when there is no real need of saying anything further but what is life but an experiment and mortality but an exercise with reference to results beyond and so shall my poems be if incomplete here and superfluous there n importethe earnest trial and persistent exploration shall at least be mine and other success failing shall be success enough i have been more anxious anyhow to suggest the songs of vital endeavor and manly evolution and furnish something for races of outdoor athletes than to make perfect rhymes or reign in the parlors i venturd from the beginning my own way taking chancesand would keep on venturing  i will therefore not conceal from any persons known or unknown to me who take an interest in the matter that i have the ambition of devoting yet a few years to poetic composition the mighty present age to absorb and express in poetry anything of itof its world americacities and statesthe years the events of our nineteeth centurythe rapidity of movementthe violent contrasts fluctuations of light and shade of hope and fearthe entire revolution made by science in the poetic methodthese great new underlying facts and new ideas rushing and spreading everywheretruly a mighty age as if in some colossal drama acted again like those of old under the open sun the nations of our time and all the characteristics of civilization seem hurrying stalking across flitting from wing to wing gathering closing up toward some longprepared most tremendous denouement not to conclude the infinite scenas of the races life and toil and happiness and sorrow but haply that the boards be cleard from oldest worst incumbrances accumulations and man resume the eternal play anew and under happier freer auspices to me the united states are important because in this colossal drama they are unquestionably designated for the leading parts for many a century to come in them history and humanity seem to seek to culminate our broad areas are even now the busy theatre of plots passions interests and suspended problems compared to which the intrigues of the past of europe the wars of dynasties the scope of kings and kingdoms and even the development of peoples as hitherto exhibit scales of measurement comparatively narrow and trivial and on these areas of ours as on a stage sooner or later something like an eclairissement of all the past civilization of europe and asia is probably to be evolved  the leading parts not to be acted emulated here by us again that role till now foremost in historynot to become a conqueror nation or to achieve the glory of mere military or diplomatic or commercial superioritybut to become the grand producing land of nobler men and womenof copious races cheerful healthy tolerant freeto become the most friendly nation the united states indeedthe modern composite nation formd from all with room for all welcoming all immigrantsaccepting the work of our own interior development as the work fitly filling ages and ages to comethe leading nation of peace but neither ignorant nor incapable of being the leading nation of warnot the mans nation only but the womans nationa land of splendid mothers daughters sisters wives  our america today i consider in many respects as but indeed a vast seething mass of materials ampler better worse also than previously knowneligible to be used to carry towards its crowning stage and build for good the great ideal nationality of the future the nation of the body and the soul32no limit here to land help opportunities mines products demands supplies etcwith i think our political organization national state and municipal permanently establishd as far ahead as we can calculatebut so far no social literary religious or esthetic organizations consistent with our politics or becoming to uswhich organizations can only come in time through great democratic ideas religionthrough science which now like a new sunrise ascending begins to illuminate alland through our own begotten poets and literatuses the moral of a late wellwritten book on civilization seems to be that the only real foundationwalls and basesand also sine qua non afterwardof true and full civilization is the eligibility and certainty of boundless products for feeding clothing sheltering everybodyperennial fountains of physical and domestic comfort with intercommunication and with civil and ecclesiastical freedomand that then the esthetic and mental business will take care of itself well the united states have establishd this basis and upon scales of extent variety vitality and continuity rivaling those of nature and have now to proceed to build an edifice upon it i say this edifice is only to be fitly built by new literatures especially the poetic i say a modern imagemaking creation is indispensable to fuse and express the modern political and scientific creationsand then the trinity will be complete  when i commenced years ago elaborating the plan of my poems and continued turning over that plan and shifting it in my mind through many years from the age of twentyeight to thirtyfive experimenting much and writing and abandoning much one deep purpose underlay the others and has underlain it and its execution ever sinceand that has been the religious purpose amid many changes and a formulation taking far different shape from what i at first supposed this basic purpose has never been departed from in the composition of my verses not of course to exhibit itself in the old ways as in writing hymns or psalms with an eye to the churchpew or to express conventional pietism or the sickly yearnings of devotees but in new ways and aiming at the widest subbases and inclusions of humanity and tallying the fresh air of sea and land i will see said i to myself whether there is not for my purposes as poet a religion and a sound religious germenancy in the average human race at least in their modern development in the united states and in the hardy common fiber and native yearnings and elements deeper and larger and affording more profitable returns than all mere sects or churchesas boundless joyous and vital as nature itselfa germenancy that has too long been unencouraged unsung almost unknown with science the old theology of the east long in its dotage begins evidently to die and disappear but to my mind scienceand maybe such will prove its principal serviceas evidently prepares the way for one indescribably grandertimes young but perfect offspringthe new theologyheir of the westlusty and loving and wondrous beautiful for america and for today just the same as any day the supreme and final science is the science of godwhat we call science being only its ministeras democracy is or shall be also and a poet of america i said must fill himself with such thoughts and chant his best out of them and as those were the convictions and aims for good or bad of leaves of grass they are no less the intention of this volume as there can be in my opinion no sane and complete personality nor any grand and electric nationality without the stock element of religion imbuing all the other elements like heat in chemistry invisible itself but the life of all visible life so there can be no poetry worthy the name without that element behind all the time has certainly come to begin to discharge the idea of religion in the united states from mere ecclesiasticism and from sundays and churches and churchgoing and assign it to that general position chiefest most indispensable most exhilarating to which the others are to be adjusted inside of all human character and education and affairs the people especially the young men and women of america must begin to learn that religion like poetry is something far far different from what they supposed it is indeed too important to the power and perpetuity of the new world to be consignd any longer to the churches old or new catholic or protestantsaint this or saint that it must be consignd henceforth to democracy en masse and to literature it must enter into the poems of the nation it must make the nation  the four years war is overand in the peaceful strong exciting fresh occasions of today and of the future that strange sad war is hurrying even now to be forgotten the camp the drill the lines of sentries the prisons the hospitalsah the hospitalsall have passed awayall seem now like a dream a new race a young and lusty generation already sweeps in with oceanic currents obliterating the war and all its scars its mounded graves and all its reminiscences of hatred conflict death so let it be obliterated i say the life of the present and the future makes undeniable demands upon us each and all south north east west to help put the united states even if only in imagination hand in hand in one unbroken circle in a chantto rouse them to the unprecedented grandeur of the part they are to play and are even now playingto the thought of their great future and the attitude conformd to itespecially their great esthetic moral scientific future of which their vulgar material and political present is but as the preparatory tuning of instruments by an orchestra these as hitherto are still for me among my hopes ambitions  leaves of grass already publishd is in its intentions the song of a great composite democratic individual male or female and following on and amplifying the same purpose i suppose i have in my mind to run through the chants of this volume if ever completed the threadvoice more or less audible of an aggregated inseparable unprecedented vast composite electric democratic nationality  purposing then to still fill out from time to time through years to come the following volume unless prevented i conclude this preface to the first instalment of it pencild in the open air on my fiftythird birthday by wafting to you dear reader whoever you are from amid the fresh scent of the grass the pleasant coolness of the forenoon breeze the lights and shades of treeboughs silently dappling and playing around me and the notes of the catbird for undertone and accompaniment my true goodwill and love w w washington d c may 31 1872   note  32 the problems of the achievements of this crowning stage through future firstclass national singers orators artists and othersof creating in literature an imaginative new world the correspondent and counterpart of the current scientific and political new worldsand the perhaps distant but still delightful prospect for our children if not in our own day of delivering america and indeed all christian lands everywhere from the thin moribund and watery but appallingly extensive nuisance of conventional poetryby putting something really alive and substantial in its placei have undertaken to grapple with and argue in the preceding democratic vistas   preface 1876 to the twovolume centennial edition of leaves of grass and two rivulets   at the eleventh hour under grave illness i gather up the pieces of prose and poetry left over since publishing a while since my first and main volume leaves or grasspieces here some new some old nearly all of them sombre as many are making this almost deaths book composed in bygone atmospheres of perfect healthand preceded by the freshest collection the little two rivulets now send them out embodied in the present melange partly as my contribution and outpouring to celebrate in some sort the feature of the time the first centennial of our new world nationalityand then as chyle and nutriment to that moral indissoluble union equally representing all and the mother of many coming centennials  and een for flush and proof of our americafor reminder just as much or more in moods of towering pride and joy i keep my special chants of death and immortality33 to stamp the coloringfinish of all present and past for terminus and temperer to all they were originally written and that shall be their office at the last  for some reasonnot explainable or definite to my own mind yet secretly pleasing and satisfactory to iti have not hesitated to embody in and run through the volume two altogether distinct veins or stratapolitics for one and for the other the pensive thought of immortality thus too the prose and poetic the dual forms of the present book the volume therefore after its minor episodes probably divides into these two at first sight far diverse veins of topic and treatment three points in especial have become very dear to me and all through i seek to make them again and again in many forms and repetitions as will be seen 1 that the true growthcharacteristics of the democracy of the new world are henceforth to radiate in superior literary artistic and religious expressions far more than in its republican forms universal suffrage and frequent elections though these are unspeakably important 2 that the vital political mission of the united states is to practically solve and settle the problem of two sets of rightsthe fusion thorough compatibility and junction of individual state prerogatives with the indispensable necessity of centrality and onenessthe national identity powerthe sovereign union relentless permanently comprising all and over all and in that never yielding an inch then 3d do we not amid a general malaria of fogs and vapors our day unmistakably see two pillars of promise with grandest indestructible indicationsone that the morbid facts of american politics and society everywhere are but passing incidents and flanges of our unbounded impetus of growth weeds annuals of the rank rich soilnot central enduring perennial things the other that all the hitherto experience of the states their first century has been but preparation adolescenceand that this union is only now and henceforth ie since the secession war to enter on its full democratic career  of the whole poems and prose not attending at all to chronological order and with original dates and passing allusions in the heat and impression of the hour left shuffled in and undisturbd the chants of leaves of grass my former volume yet serve as the indispensable deep soil or basis out of which and out of which only could come the roots and stems more definitely indicated by these later pages while that volume radiates physiology alone the present one though of the like origin in the main more palpably doubtless shows the pathology which was pretty sure to come in time from the other  in that former and main volume composed in the flush of my health and strength from the age of 30 to 50 years i dwelt on birth and life clothing my ideas in pictures days transactions of my time to give them positive place identitysaturating them with that vehemence of pride and audacity of freedom necessary to loosen the mind of stilltobeformd america from the accumulated folds the superstitions and all the long tenacious and stifling antidemocratic authorities of the asiatic and european pastmy enclosing purport being to express above all artificial regulation and aid the eternal bodily composite cumulative natural character of ones self34  estimating the american union as so far and for some time to come in its yet formative condition i bequeath poems and essays as nutriment and influences to help truly assimilate and harden and especially to furnish something toward what the states most need of all and which seems to me yet quite unsupplied in literature namely to show them or begin to show them themselves distinctively and what they are for for though perhaps the main points of all ages and nations are points of resemblance and even while granting evolution are substantially the same there are some vital things in which this republic as to its individualities and as a compacted nation is to specially stand forth and culminate modern humanity and these are the very things it least morally and mentally knowsthough curiously enough it is at the same time faithfully acting upon them  i count with such absolute certainty on the great future of the united statesdifferent from though founded on the pastthat i have always invoked that future and surrounded myself with it before or while singing my songs as ever all tends to followingsamerica too is a prophecy what even of the best and most successful would be justified by itself alone by the present or the material ostent alone of men or states few realize how much they live in the future that rising like pinnacles gives its main significance to all you and i are doing today without it there were little meaning in lands or poemslittle purport in human lives all ages all nations and states have been such prophecies but where any former ones with prophecy so broad so clear as our times our landsas those of the west  without being a scientist i have thoroughly adopted the conclusions of the great savants and experimentalists of our time and of the last hundred years and they have interiorly tinged the chyle of all my verse for purposes beyond following the modern spirit the real poems of the present ever solidifying and expanding into the future must vocalize the vastness and splendor and reality with which scientism has invested man and the universe all that is called creation and must henceforth launch humanity into new orbits consonant with that vastness splendor and reality unknown to the old poems like new systems of orbs balanced upon themselves revolving in limitless space more subtle than the stars poetry so largely hitherto and even at present wedded to childrens tales and to mere amorousness upholstery and superficial rhyme will have to accept and while not denying the past nor the themes of the past will be revivified by this tremendous innovation the kosmic spirit which must henceforth in my opinion be the background and underlying impetus more or less visible of all firstclass songs  only for me at any rate in all my prose and poetry joyfully accepting modern science and loyally following it without the slightest hesitation there remains ever recognized still a higher flight a higher fact the eternal soul of man of all else too the spiritual the religiouswhich it is to be the greatest office of scientism in my opinion and of future poetry also to free from fables crudities and superstitions and launch forth in renewd faith and scope a hundred fold to me the worlds of religiousness of the conception of the divine and of the ideal though mainly latent are just as absolute in humanity and the universe as the world of chemistry or anything in the objective worlds to me        the prophet and the bard     shall yet maintain themselvesin higher circles yet     shall mediate to the modern to democracyinterpret yet to them       god and eidolons  to me the crown of savantism is to be that it surely opens the way for a more splendid theology and for ampler and diviner songs no year nor even century will settle this there is a phase of the real lurking behind the real which it is all for there is also in the intellect of man in time far in prospective recesses a judgment a last appellate court which will settle it  in certain parts in these flights or attempting to depict or suggest them i have not been afraid of the charge of obscurity in either of my two volumesbecause human thought poetry or melody must leave dim escapes and outletsmust possess a certain fluid aerial character akin to space itself obscure to those of little or no imaginationbut indispensable to the highest purposes poetic style when addressd to the soul is less definite form outline sculpture and becomes vista music halftints and even less than halftints true it may be architecture but again it may be the forest wildwood or the best effect thereof at twilight the waving oaks and cedars in the wind and the impalpable odor  finally as i have lived in fresh lands inchoate and in a revolutionary age futurefounding i have felt to identify the points of that age these lands in my recitatives altogether in my own way thus my form has strictly grown from my purports and facts and is the analogy of them within my time the united states have emerged from nebulous vagueness and suspense to full orbic though varied decisionhave done the deeds and achievd the triumphs of half a score of centuriesand are henceforth to enter upon their real history the way being now ie since the result of the secession war cleard of deaththreatening impedimenta and the free areas around and ahead of us assured and certain which were not so beforethe past century being but preparations trial voyages and experiments of the ship before her starting out upon deep water  in estimating my volumes the worlds current times and deeds and their spirit must be first profoundly estimated out of the hundred years just ending 17761876 with their genesis of inevitable wilful events and new experiments and introductions and many unprecedented things of war and peace to be realized better perhaps only realized at the remove of a century hence out of that stretch of time and especially out of the immediately preceding twentyfive years 185075 with all their rapid changes innovations and audacious movementsand bearing their own inevitable wilful birthmarksthe experiments of my poems too have found genesis  w w  notes  33 passage to indiaas in some ancient legendplay to close the plot and the heros career there is a farewell gathering on ships deck and on shore a loosing of hawsers and ties a spreading of sails to the winda starting out on unknown seas to fetch up no one knows whitherto return no moreand the curtain falls and there is the end of itso i have reservd that poem with its cluster to finish and explain much that without them would not be explaind and to take leave and escape for good from all that has preceded them then probably passage to india and its cluster are but freer vent and fuller expression to what from the first and so on throughout more or less lurks in my writings underneath every page every line everywhere  i am not sure but the last inclosing sublimation of race or poem is what it thinks of death after the rest has been comprehended and said even the grandestafter those contributions to mightiest nationality or to sweetest song or to the best personalism male or female have been gleand from the rich and varied themes of tangible life and have been fully accepted and sung and the pervading fact of visible existence with the duty it devolves is rounded and apparently completed it still remains to be really completed by suffusing through the whole and several that other pervading invisible fact so large a part is it not the largest part of life here combining the rest and furnishing for person or state the only permanent and unitary meaning to all even the meanest life consistently with the dignity of the universe in time as from the eligibility to this thought and the cheerful conquest of this fact flash forth the first distinctive proofs of the soul so to me extending it only a little further the ultimate democratic purports the ethereal and spiritual ones are to concentrate here and as fixed stars radiate hence for in my opinion it is no less than this idea of immortality above all other ideas that is to enter into and vivify and give crowning religious stamp to democracy in the new world  it was originally my intention after chanting in leaves of grass the songs of the body and existence to then compose a further equally needed volume based on those convictions of perpetuity and conservation which enveloping all precedents make the unseen soul govern absolutely at last i meant while in a sort continuing the theme of my first chants to shift the slides and exhibit the problem and paradox of the same ardent and fully appointed personality entering the sphere of the resistless gravitation of spiritual law and with cheerful face estimating death not at all as the cessation but as somehow what i feel it must be the entrance upon by far the greatest part of existence and something that life is at least as much for as it is for itself but the full construction of such a work is beyond my powers and must remain for some bard in the future the physical and the sensuous in themselves or in their immediate continuations retain holds upon me which i think are never entirely releasd and those holds i have not only not denied but hardly wishd to weaken  meanwhile not entirely to give the goby to my original plan and far more to avoid a markd hiatus in it than to entirely fulfil it i end my books with thoughts or radiations from thoughts on death immortality and a free entrance into the spiritual world in those thoughts in a sort i make the first steps or studies toward the mighty theme from the point of view necessitated by my foregoing poems and by modern science in them i also seek to set the keystone to my democracys enduring arch i recollate them now for the press in order to partially occupy and offset days of strange sickness and the heaviest affliction and bereavement of my life and i fondly please myself with the notion of leaving that cluster to you o unknown reader of the future as something to remember me by more especially than all else written in former days of perfect health little did i think the pieces had the purport that now under present circumstances opens to me  as i write these lines may 31 1875 it is again early summer again my birthdaynow my fiftysixth amid the outside beauty and freshness the sunlight and verdure of the delightful season o how different the moral atmosphere amid which i now revise this volume from the jocund influence surrounding the growth and advent of leaves of grass i occupy myself arranging these pages for publication still envelopt in thoughts of the death two years since of my dear mother the most perfect and magnetic character the rarest combination of practical moral and spiritual and the least selfish of all and any i have ever knownand by me o so much the most deeply lovedand also under the physical affliction of a tedious attack of paralysis obstinately lingering and keeping its hold upon me and quite suspending all bodily activity and comfort  under these influences therefore i still feel to keep passage to india for last words even to this centennial dithyramb not as in antiquity at highest festival of egypt the noisome skeleton of death was sent on exhibition to the revelers for zest and shadow to the occasions joy and lightbut as the marble statue of the normal greeks at elis suggesting death in the form of a beautiful and perfect young man with closed eyes leaning on an inverted torchemblem of rest and aspiration after actionof crown and point which all lives and poems should steadily have reference to namely the justified and noble termination of our identity this grade of it and outletpreparation to another grade  34 namely a character making most of common and normal elements to the superstructure of which not only the precious accumulations of the learning and experiences of the old world and the settled social and municipal necessities and current requirements so long abuilding shall still faithfully contribute but which at its foundations and carried up thence and receiving its impetus from the democratic spirit and accepting its gauge in all departments from the democratic formulas shall again directly be vitalized by the perennial influences of nature at first hand and the old heroic stamina of nature the strong air of prairie and mountain the dash of the briny sea the primary antisepticsof the passions in all their fullest heat and potency of courage rankness amativeness and of immense pride not to lose at all therefore the benefits of artificial progress and civilization but to reoccupy for western tenancy the oldest though everfresh fields and reap from them the savage and sane nourishment indispensable to a hardy nation and the absence of which threatening to become worse and worse is the most serious lack and defect today of our new world literature  not but what the brawn of leaves of grass is i hope thoroughly spiritualized everywhere for final estimate but from the very subjects the direct effect is a sense of the life as it should be of flesh and blood and physical urge and animalism while there are other themes and plenty of abstract thoughts and poems in the volumewhile i have put in it passing and rapid but actual glimpses of the great struggle between the nation and the slavepower 186165 as the fierce and bloody panorama of that contest unrolld itself while the whole book indeed revolves around that four years war which as i was in the midst of it becomes in drumtaps pivotal to the rest entireand here and there before and afterward not a few episodes and speculationsthatnamely to make a typeportrait for living active worldly healthy personality objective as well as subjective joyful and potent and modern and free distinctively for the use of the united states male and female through the long futurehas been i say my general object probably indeed the whole of these varied songs and all my writings both volumes only ring changes in some sort on the ejaculation how vast how eligible how joyful how real is a human being himself or herself  though from no definite plan at the time i see now that i have unconsciously sought by indirections at least as much as directions to express the whirls and rapid growth and intensity of the united states the prevailing tendency and events of the nineteenth century and largely the spirit of the whole current world my time for i feel that i have partaken of that spirit as i have been deeply interested in all those events the closing of longstretchd eras and ages and illustrated in the history of the united states the opening of larger ones the death of president lincoln for instance fitly historically closes in the civilization of feudalism many old influencesdrops on them suddenly a vast gloomy as it were separating curtain  since i have been ill 18737475 mostly without serious pain and with plenty of time and frequent inclination to judge my poems never composed with eye on the bookmarket nor for fame nor for any pecuniary profit i have felt temporary depression more than once for fear that in leaves of grass the moral parts were not sufficiently pronounced but in my clearest and calmest moods i have realized that as those leaves all and several surely prepare the way for and necessitate morals and are adjusted to them just the same as nature does and is they are what consistently with my plan they must and probably should be in a certain sense while the moral is the purport and last intelligence of all nature there is absolutely nothing of the moral in the works or laws or shows of nature those only lead inevitably to itbegin and necessitate it  then i meant leaves of grass as publishd to be the poem of average identity of yours whoever you are now reading these lines a man is not greatest as victor in war nor inventor or explorer nor even in science or in his intellectual or artistic capacity or exemplar in some vast benevolence to the highest democratic view man is most acceptable in living well the practical life and lot which happens to him as ordinary farmer seafarer mechanic clerk laborer or driverupon and from which position as a central basis or pedestal while performing its labors and his duties as citizen son husband father and employd person he preserves his physique ascends developing radiating himself in other regionsand especially where and when greatest of all and nobler than the proudest mere genius or magnate in any field he fully realizes the conscience the spiritual the divine faculty cultivated well exemplified in all his deeds and words through life uncompromising to the enda flight loftier than any of homers or shaksperesbroader than all poems and biblesnamely natures own and in the midst of it yourself your own identity body and soul all serves helpsbut in the centre of all absorbing all giving for your purpose the only meaning and vitality to all master or mistress of all under the law stands yourself to sing the song of that law of average identity and of yourself consistently with the divine law of the universal is a main intention of those leaves  something more may be addedfor while i am about it i would make a full confession i also sent out leaves of grass to arouse and set flowing in mens and womens hearts young and old endless streams of living pulsating love and friendship directly from them to myself now and ever to this terrible irrepressible yearning surely more or less down underneath in most human soulsthis neversatisfied appetite for sympathy and this boundless offering of sympathythis universal democratic comradeshipthis old eternal yet evernew interchange of adhesiveness so fitly emblematic of americai have given in that book undisguisedly declaredly the openest expression besides important as they are in my purpose as emotional expressions for humanity the special meaning of the calamus cluster of leaves of grass and more or less running through the book and cropping out in drumtaps mainly resides in its political significance in my opinion it is by a fervent accepted development of comradeship the beautiful and sane affection of man for man latent in all the young fellows north and south east and westit is by this i say and by what goes directly and indirectly along with it that the united states of the future i cannot too often repeat are to be most effectually welded together intercalated anneald into a living union  then for enclosing clue of all it is imperatively and ever to be borne in mind that leaves of grass entire is not to be construed as an intellectual or scholastic effort or poem mainly but more as a radical utterance out of the emotions and the physiquean utterance adjusted to perhaps born of democracy and the modernin its very nature regardless of the old conventions and under the great laws following only its own impulses    poetry today in america  shaksperethe future   strange as it may seem the topmost proof of a race is its own born poetry the presence of that or the absence each tells its story as the flowering rose or lily as the ripened fruit to a tree the apple or the peach no matter how fine the trunk or copious or rich the branches and foliage here waits sine qua non at last the stamp of entire and finished greatness to any nation to the american republic among the rest must be sternly withheld till it has put what it stands for in the blossom of original firstclass poems no imitations will do  and though no esthetik worthy the present condition or future certainties of the new world seems to have been outlined in mens minds or has been generally called for or thought needed i am clear that until the united states have just such definite and native expressers in the highest artistic fields their mere political geographical wealthforming and even intellectual eminence however astonishing and predominant will constitute but a more and more expanded and wellappointed body and perhaps brain with little or no soul sugarcoat the grim truth as we may and ward off with outward plausible words denials explanations to the mental inward perception of the land this blank is plain a barren void exists for the meanings and maturer purposes of these states are not the constructing of a new world of politics merely and physical comforts for the million but even more determinedly in range with science and the modern of a new world of democratic sociology and imaginative literature if the latter were not establishd for the states to form their only permanent tie and hold the firstnamed would be of little avail  with the poems of a firstclass land are twined as weft with warp its types of personal character of individuality peculiar native its own physiognomy mans and womans its own shapes forms and manners fully justified under the eternal laws of all forms all manners all times the hour has come for democracy in america to inaugurate itself in the two directions specifiedautochthonic poems and personalitiesborn expressers of itself its spirit alone to radiate in subtle ways not only in art but the practical and familiar in the transactions between employers and employed persons in business and wages and sternly in the army and navy and revolutionizing them i find nowhere a scope profound enough and radical and objective enough either for aggregates or individuals the thought and identity of a poetry in america to fill and worthily fill the great void and enhance these aims electrifying all and several involves the essence and integral facts real and spiritual of the whole land the whole body what the great sympathetic is to the congeries of bones joints heart fluids nervous system and vitality constituting launching forth in time and space a human beingaye an immortal soulsuch relation and no less holds true poetry to the single personality or to the nation  here our thirtyeight states stand today the children of past precedents and young as they are heirs of a very old estate one or two points we will consider out of the myriads presenting themselves the feudalism of the british islands illustrated by shakspereand by his legitimate followers walter scott and alfred tennysonwith all its tyrannies superstitions evils had most superb and heroic permeating veins poems manners even its errors fascinating it almost seems as if only that feudalism in europe like slavery in our own south could outcrop types of tallest noblest personal character yetstrength and devotion and love better than elsewhereinvincible courage generosity aspiration the spines of all here is where shakspere and the others i have named perform a service incalculably precious to our america politics literature and everything else centers at last in perfect personnel as democracy is to find the same as the rest and here feudalism is unrivaldhere the rich and highestrising lessons it bequeaths usa mass of foreign nutriment which we are to work over and popularize and enlarge and present again in our own growths  still there are pretty grave and anxious drawbacks jeopardies fears let us give some reflections on the subject a little fluctuating but starting from one central thought and returning there again two or three curious results may plow up as in the astronomical laws the very power that would seem most deadly and destructive turns out to be latently conservative of longest vastest future births and lives we will for once briefly examine the justnamed authors solely from a western point of view it may be indeed that we shall use the sun of english literature and the brightest current stars of his system mainly as pegs to hang some cogitations on for home inspection  as depicter and dramatist of the passions at their stormiest outstretch though ranking high shakspere spanning the arch wide enough is equaled by several and excelled by the best old greeks as eschylus but in portraying mediaeval european lords and barons the arrogant port so dear to the inmost human heart pride pride dearest perhaps of alltouching us too of the states closest of allcloser than love he stands alone and i do not wonder he so witches the world  from first to last also walter scott and tennyson like shakspere exhale that principle of caste which we americans have come on earth to destroy jeffersons verdict on the waverley novels was that they turned and condensed brilliant but entirely false lights and glamours over the lords ladies and aristocratic institutes of europe with all their measureless infamies and then left the bulk of the suffering downtrodden people contemptuously in the shade without stopping to answer this hornetstinging criticism or to repay any part of the debt of thanks i owe in common with every american to the noblest healthiest cheeriest romancer that ever lived i pass on to tennyson his works  poetry here of a very high perhaps the highest order of verbal melody exquisitely clean and pure and almost always perfumed like the tuberose to an extreme of sweetnesssometimes not however but even then a camellia of the hothouse never a common flowerthe verse of inside elegance and highlife and yet preserving amid all its superdelicatesse a smack of outdoors and outdoor folk the old norman lordhood quality here too crossed with that saxon fiber from which twain the best current stock of england springspoetry that revels above all things in traditions of knights and chivalry and deeds of derringdo the odor of english social life in its highest rangea melancholy affectionate very manly but dainty breedpervading the pages like an invisible scent the idleness the traditions the mannerisms the stately ennui the yearning of love like a spinal marrow inside of all the costumes brocade and satin the old houses and furnituresolid oak no mere veneeringthe moldy secrets everywhere the verdure the ivy on the walls the moat the english landscape outside the buzzing fly in the sun inside the window pane never one democratic page nay not a line not a word never free and naive poetry but involved labored quite sophisticatedeven when the theme is ever so simple or rustic a shell a bit of sedge the commonest lovepassage between a lad and lass the handling of the rhyme all showing the scholar and conventional gentleman showing the laureate too the attache of the throne and most excellent too nothing better through the volumes than the dedication to the queen at the beginning and the other fine dedication these to his memory prince alberts preceding idylls of the king  such for an offhand summary of the mighty three that now by the women men and young folk of the fifty millions given these states by their late census have been and are more read than all others put together  we hear it said both of tennyson and another current leading literary illustrator of great britain carlyleas of victor hugo in francethat not one of them is personally friendly or admirant toward america indeed quite the reverse nimporte that they and more good minds than theirs cannot span the vast revolutionary arch thrown by the united states over the centuries fixed in the present launched to the endless future that they cannot stomach the highlifebelowstairs coloring all our poetic and genteel social status so farthe measureless viciousness of the great radical republic with its ruffianly nominations and elections its loud illpitched voice utterly regardless whether the verb agrees with the nominative its fights errors eructations repulsions dishonesties audacities those fearful and varied and longcontinued storm and stress stages so offensive to the wellregulated collegebred mind wherewith nature history and time block out nationalities more powerful than the past and to upturn it and press on to the futurethat they cannot understand and fathom all this i say is it to be wondered at fortunately the gestation of our thirtyeight empires and plenty more to come proceeds on its course on scales of area and velocity immense and absolute as the globe and like the globe itself quite oblivious even of great poets and thinkers but we can by no means afford to be oblivious of them  the same of feudalism its castles courts etiquettes personalities however they or the spirits of them hovering in the air might scowl and glower at such removes as current kansas or kentucky life and forms the latter may by no means repudiate or leave out the former allowing all the evil that it did we get here and today a balance of good out of its reminiscence almost beyond price  am i content then that the general interior chyle of our republic should be supplied and nourishd by wholesale from foreign and antagonistic sources such as these let me answer that question briefly  years ago i thought americans ought to strike out separate and have expressions of their own in highest literature i think so still and more decidedly than ever but those convictions are now strongly temperd by some additional points perhaps the results of advancing age or the reflection of invalidism i see that this world of the west as part of all fuses inseparably with the east and with all as time doesthe ever new yet old old human racethe same subject continued as the novels of our grandfathers had it for chapterheads if we are not to hospitably receive and complete the inaugurations of the old civilizations and change their small scale to the largest broadest scale what on earth are we for  the currents of practical business in america the rude coarse tussling facts of our lives and all their daily experiences need just the precipitation and tincture of this entirely different fancy world of lulling contrasting even feudalistic antirepublican poetry and romance on the enormous outgrowth of our unloosd individualities and the rank selfassertion of humanity here may well fall these gracepersuading recherche influences we first require that individuals and communities shall be free then surely comes a time when it is requisite that they shall not be too free although to such results in the future i look mainly for a great poetry native to us these importations till then will have to be accepted such as they are and thankful they are no worse the inmost spiritual currents of the present time curiously revenge and check their own compelld tendency to democracy and absorption in it by markd leanings to the pastby reminiscences in poems plots operas novels to a faroff contrary deceased world as if they dreaded the great vulgar gulftides of today then what has been fifty centuries growing working in and accepted as crowns and apices for our kind is not going to be pulled down and discarded in a hurry  it is perhaps time we paid our respects directly to the honorable party the real object of these preambles but we must make reconnaissance a little further still not the least part of our lesson were to realize the curiosity and interest of friendly foreign experts35 and how our situation looks to them american poetry says the london times36 is the poetry of apt pupils but it is afflicted from first to last with a fatal want of raciness bryant has been long passed as a poet by professor longfellow but in longfellow with all his scholarly grace and tender feeling the defect is more apparent than it was in bryant mr lowell can overflow with american humor when politics inspire his muse but in the realm of pure poetry he is no more american than a newdigate prizeman joaquin millers verse has fluency and movement and harmony but as for the thought his songs of the sierras might as well have been written in holland  unless in a certain very slight contingency the times says american verse from its earliest to its latest stages seems an exotic with an exuberance of gorgeous blossom but no principle of reproduction that is the very note and test of its inherent want great poets are tortured and massacred by having their flowers of fancy gathered and gummed down in the hortus siccus of an anthology american poets show better in an anthology than in the collected volumes of their works like their audience they have been unable to resist the attraction of the vast orbit of english literature they may talk of the primeval forest but it would generally be very hard from internal evidence to detect that they were writing on the banks of the hudson rather than on those of the thames in fact they have caught the english tone and air and mood only too faithfully and are accepted by the superficially cultivated english intelligence as readily as if they were english born americans themselves confess to a certain disappointment that a literary curiosity and intelligence so diffused as in the united states have not taken up english literature at the point at which america has received it and carried it forward and developed it with an independent energy but like reader like poet both show the effects of having come into an estate they have not earned a nation of readers has required of its poets a diction and symmetry of form equal to that of an old literature like that of great britain which is also theirs no ruggedness however racy would be tolerated by circles which however superficial their culture read byron and tennyson  the english critic though a gentleman and a scholar and friendly withal is evidently not altogether satisfied perhaps he is jealous and winds up by saying for the english language to have been enriched with a national poetry which was not english but american would have been a treasure beyond price with which as whet and foil we shall proceed to ventilate more definitely certain no doubt willful opinions  leaving unnoticed at present the great masterpieces of the antique or anything from the middle ages the prevailing flow of poetry for the last fifty or eighty years and now at its height has been and is like the music an expression of mere surface melody within narrow limits and yet to give it its due perfectly satisfying to the demands of the ear of wondrous charm of smooth and easy delivery and the triumph of technical art above all things it is fractional and select it shrinks with aversion from the sturdy the universal and the democratic  the poetry of the future a phrase open to sharp criticism and not satisfactory to me but significant and i will use itthe poetry of the future aims at the free expression of emotion which means far far more than appears at first and to arouse and initiate more than to define or finish like all modern tendencies it has direct or indirect reference continually to the reader to you or me to the central identity of everything the mighty ego byrons was a vehement dash with plenty of impatient democracy but lurid and introverted amid all its magnetism not at all the fitting lasting song of a grand secure free sunny race it is more akin likewise to outside life and landscape returning mainly to the antique feeling real sun and gale and woods and shoresto the elements themselvesnot sitting at ease in parlor or library listening to a good tale of them told in good rhyme character a feature far above style or polisha feature not absent at any time but now first brought to the foregives predominant stamp to advancing poetry its born sister music already responds to the same influences the music of the present wagners gounods even the later verdis all tends toward this free expression of poetic emotion and demands a vocalism totally unlike that required for rossinis splendid roulades or bellinis suave melodies  is there not even now indeed an evolution a departure from the masters venerable and unsurpassable after their kind as are the old works and always unspeakably precious as studies for americans more than any other people is it too much to say that by the shifted combinations of the modern mind the whole underlying theory of firstclass verse has changed formerly during the period termd classic says saintebeuve when literature was governd by recognized rules he was considered the best poet who had composed the most perfect work the most beautiful poem the most intelligible the most agreeable to read the most complete in every respectthe aeneid the gerusalemme a fine tragedy today something else is wanted for us the greatest poet is he who in his works most stimulates the readers imagination and reflection who excites him the most himself to poetize the greatest poet is not he who has done the best it is he who suggests the most he not all of whose meaning is at first obvious and who leaves you much to desire to explain to study much to complete in your turn  the fatal defects our american singers labor under are subordination of spirit an absence of the concrete and of real patriotism and in excess that modern esthetic contagion a queer friend of mine calls the beauty disease the immoderate taste for beauty and art says charles baudelaire leads men into monstrous excesses in minds imbued with a frantic greed for the beautiful all the balances of truth and justice disappear there is a lust a disease of the art faculties which eats up the moral like a cancer  of course by our plentiful versewriters there is plenty of service performd of a kind nor need we go far for a tally we see in every polite circle a class of accomplished goodnatured persons society in fact could not get on without them fully eligible for certain problems times and dutiesto mix eggnog to mend the broken spectacles to decide whether the stewed eels shall precede the sherry or the sherry the stewed eels to eke out mrs a bs parlortableaux with monk jew lover puck prospero caliban or what not and to generally contribute and gracefully adapt their flexibilities and talents in those ranges to the worlds service but for real crises great needs and pulls moral or physical they might as well have never been born  or the accepted notion of a poet would appear to be a sort of male odalisque singing or pianoplaying a kind of spiced ideas secondhand reminiscences or toying late hours at entertainments in rooms stifling with fashionable scent i think i havent seen a newpublished healthy bracing simple lyric in ten years not long ago there were verses in each of three fresh monthlies from leading authors and in every one the whole central motif perfectly serious was the melancholiness of a marriageable young woman who didnt get a rich husband but a poor one  besides its tonic and al fresco physiology relieving such as this the poetry of the future will take on character in a more important respect science having extirpated the old stockfables and superstitions is clearing a field for verse for all the arts and even for romance a hundredfold ampler and more wonderful with the new principles behind republicanism advances over the whole world liberty with law by her side will one day be paramountwill at any rate be the central idea then onlyfor all the splendor and beauty of what has been or the polish of what isthen only will the true poets appear and the true poems not the satin and patchouly of today not the glorification of the butcheries and wars of the past nor any fight between deity on one side and somebody else on the othernot milton not even shaksperes plays grand as they are entirely different and hitherto unknown classes of men being authoritatively called for in imaginative literature will certainly appear what is hitherto most lacking perhaps most absolutely indicates the future democracy has been hurried on through time by measureless tides and winds resistless as the revolution of the globe and as farreaching and rapid but in the highest walks of art it has not yet had a single representative worthy of it anywhere upon the earth  never had real bard a task more fit for sublime ardor and genius than to sing worthily the songs these states have already indicated their origin washington 76 the picturesqueness of old times the war of 1812 and the seafights the incredible rapidity of movement and breadth of areato fuse and compact the south and north the east and west to express the native forms situations scenes from montauk to california and from the saguenay to the rio grandethe working out on such gigantic scales and with such a swift and mighty play of changing light and shade of the great problems of man and freedomhow far ahead of the stereotyped plots or gemcutting or tales of love or wars of mere ambition our history is so full of spinal modern germinal subjectsone above all what the ancient siege of illium and the puissance of hectors and agamemnons warriors proved to hellenic art and literature and all art and literature since may prove the war of attempted secession of 186165 to the future esthetics drama romance poems of the united states  nor could utility itself provide anything more practically serviceable to the hundred millions who a couple of generations hence will inhabit within the limits just named than the permeation of a sane sweet autochthonous national poetrymust i say of a kind that does not now exist but which i fully believe will in time be supplied on scales as free as natures elements it is acknowledged that we of the states are the most materialistic and moneymaking people ever known my own theory while fully accepting this is that we are the most emotional spiritualistic and poetryloving people also  infinite are the new and orbic traits waiting to be launchd forth in the firmament that is and is to be america lately i have wonderd whether the last meaning of this cluster of thirtyeight states is not only practical fraternity among themselvesthe only real union much nearer its accomplishment too than appears on the surfacebut for fraternity over the whole globethat dazzling pensive dream of ages indeed the peculiar glory of our lands i have come to see or expect to see not in their geographical or republican greatness nor wealth or products nor military or naval power nor special eminent names in any department to shine with or outshine foreign special names in similar departmentsbut more and more in a vaster saner more surrounding comradeship uniting closer and closer not only the american states but all nations and all humanity that o poets is not that a theme worth chanting striving for why not fix your verses henceforth to the gauge of the round globe the whole race perhaps the most illustrious culmination of the modern may thus prove to be a signal growth of joyous more exalted bards of adhesiveness identically one in soul but contributed by every nation each after its distinctive kind let us audacious start it let the diplomats as ever still deeply plan seeking advantages proposing treaties between governments and to bind them on paper what i seek is different simpler i would inaugurate from america for this purpose new formulasinternational poems i have thought that the invisible root out of which the poetry deepest in and dearest to humanity grows is friendship i have thought that both in patriotism and song even amid their grandest shows past we have adhered too long to petty limits and that the time has come to enfold the world  not only is the human and artificial world we have establishd in the west a radical departure from anything hitherto knownnot only men and politics and all that goes with thembut nature itself in the main sense its construction is different the same old font of type of course but set up to a text never composed or issued before for nature consists not only in itself objectively but at least just as much in its subjective reflection from the person spirit age looking at it in the midst of it and absorbing itfaithfully sends back the characteristic beliefs of the time or individualtakes and readily gives again the physiognomy of any nation or literaturefalls like a great elastic veil on a face or like the molding plaster on a statue  what is nature what were the elements the invisible backgrounds and eidolons of it to homers heroes voyagers gods what all through the wanderings of virgils aeneas then to shaksperes charactershamlet lear the englishnorman kings the romans what was nature to rousseau to voltaire to the german goethe in his little classical court gardens in those presentments in tennyson see the idylls of the kingwhat sumptuous perfumed arrasandgold nature inimitably described better than any fit for princes and knights and peerless ladieswrathful or peaceful just the samevivien and merlin in their strange dalliance or the deathfloat of elaine or geraint and the long journey of his disgraced enid and himself through the wood and the wife all day driving the horses as in all the great imported artworks treatises systems from lucretius down there is a constantly lurking often pervading something that will have to be eliminated as not only unsuited to modern democracy and science in america but insulting to them and disproved by them37  still the rule and demesne of poetry will always be not the exterior but interior not the macrocosm but microcosm not nature but man i havent said anything about the imperative need of a race of giant bards in the future to hold up high to eyes of land and race the eternal antiseptic models and to dauntlessly confront greed injustice and all forms of that wiliness and tyranny whose roots never diemy opinion is that after all the rest is advanced that is what firstclass poets are for as to their days and occasions the hebrew lyrists roman juvenal and doubtless the old singers of india and the british druidsto counteract dangers immensest ones already looming in americameasureless corruption in politicswhat we call religion a mere mask of wax or lacefor ensemble that most cankerous offensive of all earths showsa vast and varied community prosperous and fat with wealth of money and products and business venturesplenty of mere intellectuality tooand then utterly without the sound prevailing moral and esthetic healthaction beyond all the money and mere intellect of the world  is it a dream of mine that in times to come west south east north will silently surely arise a race of such poets varied yet one in soulnor only poets and of the best but newer larger prophetslarger than judeas and more passionateto meet and penetrate those woes as shafts of light the darkness  as i write the last fifth of the nineteenth century is enterd upon and will soon be waning now and for a long time to come what the united states most need to give purport definiteness reason why to their unprecedented material wealth industrial products education by rote merely great populousness and intellectual activity is the central spinal reality or even the idea of it of such a democratic band ofnativebornandbred teachers artists litterateurs tolerant and receptive of importations but entirely adjusted to the west to ourselves to our own days combinations differences superiorities indeed i am fond of thinking that the whole series of concrete and political triumphs of the republic are mainly as bases and preparations for half a dozen future poets ideal personalities referring not to a special class but to the entire people four or five millions of square miles  long long are the processes of the development of a nationality only to the rapt vision does the seen become the prophecy of the unseen38 democracy so far attending only to the real is not for the real only but the grandest idealto justify the modern by that and not only to equal but to become by that superior to the past  on a comprehensive summing up of the processes and present and hitherto condition of the united states with reference to their future and the indispensable precedents to it my point below all surfaces and subsoiling them is that the bases and prerequisites of a leading nationality are first at all hazards freedom worldly wealth and products on the largest and most varied scale common education and intercommunication and in general the passing through of just the stages and crudities we have passed or are passing through in the united states  then perhaps as weightiest factor of the whole business and of the main outgrowths of the future it remains to be definitely avowd that the nativeborn middleclass population of quite all the united statesthe average of farmers and mechanics everywherethe real though latent and silent bulk of america city or country presents a magnificent mass of material never before equald on earth it is this material quite unexpressd by literature or art that in every respect insures the future of the republic during the secession war i was with the armies and saw the rank and file north and south and studied them for four years i have never had the least doubt about the country in its essential future since  meantime we can perhaps do no better than to saturate ourselves with and continue to give imitations yet awhile of the esthetic models supplies of that past and of those lands we spring from those wondrous stores reminiscences floods currents let them flow on flow hither freely and let the sources be enlarged to include not only the works of british origin as now but stately and devout spain courteous france profound germany the manly scandinavian lands italys art race and always the mystic orient remembering that at present and doubtless long ahead a certain humility would well become us the course through time of highest civilization does it not wait the first glimpse of our contribution to its kosmic train of poems bibles firstclass structures perpetuitiesegypt and palestine and indiagreece and rome and mediaeval europeand so onward the shadowy procession is not a meagre one and the standard not a low one all that is mighty in our kind seems to have already trod the road ah never may america forget her thanks and reverence for samples treasures such as thesethat other lifeblood inspiration sunshine hourly in use today all days forever through her broad demesne  all serves our new world progress even the bafflers headwinds crosstides through many perturbations and squalls and much backing and filling the ship upon the whole makes unmistakably for her destination shakspere has served and serves maybe the best of any  for conclusion a passing thought a contrast of him who in my opinion continues and stands for the shaksperean cultus at the present day among all englishwriting peoplesof tennyson his poetry i find it impossible as i taste the sweetness of those lines to escape the flavor the conviction the lushripening culmination and last honey of decay i dare not call it rottenness of that feudalism which the mighty english dramatist painted in all the splendors of its noon and afternoon and how they are chantedboth poets happy those kings and nobles to be so sung so told to run their courseto get their deeds and shapes in lasting pigmentsthe very pomp and dazzle of the sunset  meanwhile democracy waits the coming of its bards in silence and in twilightbut tis the twilight of the dawn   notes  35 a few years ago i saw the question has america produced any great poem announced as prizesubject for the competition of some university in northern europe i saw the item in a foreign paper and made a note of it but being taken down with paralysis and prostrated for a long season the matter slippd away and i have never been able since to get hold of any essay presented for the prize or report of the discussion nor to learn for certain whether there was any essay or discussion nor can i now remember the place it may have been upsala or possibly heidelberg perhaps some german or scandinavian can give particulars i think it was in 1872  36 in a long and prominent editorial at the time on the death of william cullen bryant  37 whatever may be said of the few principal poemsor their best passagesit is certain that the overwhelming mass of poetic works as now absorbd into human character exerts a certain constipating repressing indoor and artificial influence impossible to eludeseldom or never that freeing dilating joyous one with which uncrampd nature works on every individual without exception  38 is there not such a thing as the philosophy of american history and politics and if so what is it wise men say there are two sets of wills to nations and to personsone set that acts and works from explainable motivesfrom teaching intelligence judgment circumstance caprice emulation greed etcand then another set perhaps deep hidden unsuspected yet often more potent than the first refusing to be argued with rising as it were out of abysses resistlessly urging on speakers doers communities unwitting to themselvesthe poet to his fieriest wordsthe race to pursue its loftiest ideal indeed the paradox of a nations life and career with all its wondrous contradictions can probably only be explaind from these two wills sometimes conflicting each operating in its sphere combining in races or in persons and producing strangest results  let us hope there is indeed can there be any doubt there is this great unconscious and abysmic second will also running through the average nationality and career of america let us hope that amid all the dangers and defections of the present and through all the processes of the conscious will it alone is the permanent and sovereign force destined to carry on the new world to fulfil its destinies in the futureto resolutely pursue those destinies age upon age to build far far beyond its past vision present thought to form and fashion and for the general type men and women more noble more athletic than the world has yet seen to gradually firmly blend from all the states with all varieties a friendly happy free religious nationalitya nationality not only the richest most inventive most productive and materialistic the world has yet known but compacted indissolubly and out of whose ample and solid bulk and giving purpose and finish to it conscience morals and all the spiritual attributes shall surely rise like spires above some group of edifices firmfooted on the earth yet scaling space and heaven  great as they are and greater far to be the united states too are but a series of steps in the eternal process of creative thought and here is to my mind their final justification and certain perpetuity there is in that sublime process in the laws of the universeand above all in the moral lawsomething that would make unsatisfactory and even vain and contemptible all the triumphs of war the gains of peace and the proudest worldly grandeur of all the nations that have ever existed or that ours included now exist except that we constantly see through all their worldly career however struggling and blind and lame attempts by all ages all peoples according to their development to reach to press to progress on and ever farther on to more and more advanced ideals  the glory of the republic of the united states in my opinion is to be that emerging in the light of the modern and the splendor of science and solidly based on the past it is to cheerfully range itself and its politics are henceforth to come under those universal laws and embody them and carry them out to serve them and as only that individual becomes truly great who understands well that while complete in himself in a certain sense he is but a part of the divine eternal scheme and whose special life and laws are adjusted to move in harmonious relations with the general laws of nature and especially with the moral law the deepest and highest of all and the last vitality of man or stateso the united states may only become the greatest and the most continuous by understanding well their harmonious relations with entire humanity and history and all their laws and progress sublimed with the creative thought of deity through all time past present and future thus will they expand to the amplitude of their destiny and become illustrations and culminating parts of the kosmos and of civilization  no more considering the states as an incident or series of incidents however vast coming accidentally along the path of time and shaped by casual emergencies as they happen to arise and the mere result of modern improvements vulgar and lucky ahead of other nations and times i would finally plant as seeds these thoughts or speculations in the growth of our republicthat it is the deliberate culmination and result of all the pastthat here too as in all departments of the universe regular laws slow and sure in planting slow and sure in ripening have controlld and governd and will yet control and govern and that those laws can no more be baffled or steerd clear of or vitiated by chance or any fortune or opposition than the laws of winter and summer or darkness and light  the summing up of the tremendous moral and military perturbations of 186165 and their resultsand indeed of the entire hundred years of the past of our national experiment from its inchoate movement down to the present day 17801881is that they all now launch the united states fairly forth consistently with the entirety of civilization and humanity and in main sort the representative of them leading the van leading the fleet of the modern and democratic on the seas and voyages of the future  and the real history of the united statesstarting from that great convulsive struggle for unity the secession war triumphantly concluded and the south victorious after allis only to be written at the remove of hundreds perhaps a thousand years hence     a memorandum at a venture   all is proper to be expressd provided our aim is only high enough j f millet  the candor of science is the glory of the modern it does not hide and repress it confronts turns on the light it alone has perfect faithfaith not in a part only but all does it not undermine the old religious standards yes in gods truth by excluding the devil from the theory of the universeby showing that evil is not a law in itself but a sickness a perversion of the good and the other side of the goodthat in fact all of humanity and of everything is divine in its bases its eligibilities  shall the mention of such topics as i have briefly but plainly and resolutely broachd in the children of adam section of leaves of grass be admitted in poetry and literature ought not the innovation to be put down by opinion and criticism and if those fail by the district attorney true i could not construct a poem which declaredly took as never before the complete human identity physical moral emotional and intellectual giving precedence and compass in a certain sense to the first nor fulfil that bona fide candor and entirety of treatment which was a part of my purpose without comprehending this section also but i would entrench myself more deeply and widely than that and while i do not ask any man to indorse my theory i confess myself anxious that what i sought to write and express and the ground i built on shall be at least partially understood from its own platform the best way seems to me to confront the question with entire frankness  there are generally speaking two points of view two conditions of the worlds attitude toward these matters the first the conventional one of good folks and good print everywhere repressing any direct statement of them and making allusions only at second or third handas the greeks did of death which in hellenic social culture was not mentiond pointblank but by euphemisms in the civilization of today this conditionwithout stopping to elaborate the arguments and facts which are many and varied and perplexinghas led to states of ignorance repressal and coverd over disease and depletion forming certainly a main factor in the worlds woe a nonscientific nonesthetic and eminently nonreligious condition bequeathd to us from the past its origins diverse one of them the farback lessons of benevolent and wise men to restrain the prevalent coarseness and animality of the tribal ageswith puritanism or perhaps protestantism itself for another and still another specified in the latter part of this memorandumto it is probably due most of the ill births inefficient maturity snickering pruriency and of that human pathologic evil and morbidity which is in my opinion the keel and reasonwhy of every evil and morbidity its scent as of something sneaking furtive mephitic seems to lingeringly pervade all modern literature conversation and manners  the second point of view and by far the largestas the world in workingday dress vastly exceeds the world in parlor toiletteis the one of common life from the oldest times down and especially in england see the earlier chapters of taines english literature and see shakspere almost anywhere and which our age today inherits from riant stock in the wit or what passes for wit of masculine circles and in erotic stories and talk to excite express and dwell on that merely sensual voluptuousness which according to victor hugo is the most universal trait of all ages all lands this second condition however bad is at any rate like a disease which comes to the surface and therefore less dangerous than a conceald one  the time seems to me to have arrived and america to be the place for a new departurea third point of view the same freedom and faith and earnestness which after centuries of denial struggle repression and martyrdom the present day brings to the treatment of politics and religion must work out a plan and standard on this subject not so much for what is calld society as for thoughtfulest men and women and thoughtfulest literature the same spirit that marks the physiological author and demonstrator on these topics in his important field i have thought necessary to be exemplified for once in another certainly not less important field  in the present memorandum i only venture to indicate that plan and viewdecided upon more than twenty years ago for my own literary action and formulated tangibly in my printed poemsas bacon says an abstract thought or theory is of no moment unless it leads to a deed or work done exemplifying it in the concretethat the sexual passion in itself while normal and unperverted is inherently legitimate creditable not necessarily an improper theme for poet as confessedly not for scientistthat with reference to the whole construction organism and intentions of leaves of grass anything short of confronting that theme and making myself clear upon it as the enclosing basis of everything as the sanity of everything was to be the atmosphere of the poems i should beg the question in its most momentous aspect and the superstructure that followd pretensive as it might assume to be would all rest on a poor foundation or no foundation at all in short as the assumption of the sanity of birth nature and humanity is the key to any true theory of life and the universeat any rate the only theory out of which i wroteit is and must inevitably be the only key to leaves of grass and every part of it that and not a vain consistency or weak pride as a late springfield republican charges is the reason that i have stood out for these particular verses uncompromisingly for over twenty years and maintain them to this day that is what i felt in my inmost brain and heart when i only answerd emersons vehement arguments with silence under the old elms of boston common  indeed might not every physiologist and every good physician pray for the redeeming of this subject from its hitherto relegation to the tongues and pens of blackguards and boldly putting it for once at least if no more in the demesne of poetry and sanityas something not in itself gross or impure but entirely consistent with highest manhood and womanhood and indispensable to both might not only every wife and every mothernot only every babe that comes into the world if that were possiblenot only all marriage the foundation and sine qua non of the civilized statebless and thank the showing or taking for granted that motherhood fatherhood sexuality and all that belongs to them can be asserted where it comes to question openly joyously proudly without shame or the need of shame from the highest artistic and human considerationsbut with reverence be it written on such attempt to justify the base and start of the whole divine scheme in humanity might not the creative power itself deign a smile of approval  to the movement for the eligibility and entrance of women amid new spheres of business politics and the suffrage the current prurient conventional treatment of sex is the main formidable obstacle the rising tide of womans rights swelling and every year advancing farther and farther recoils from it with dismay there will in my opinion be no general progress in such eligibility till a sensible philosophic democratic method is substituted  the whole questionwhich strikes far very far deeper than most people have supposed and doubtless too something is to be said on all sides is peculiarly an important one in artis first an ethic and then still more an esthetic one i condense from a paper read not long since at cheltenham england before the social science congress to the art department by p h rathbone of liverpool on the undraped figure in art and the discussion that followd  when coward europe sufferd the unclean turk to soil the sacred shores of greece by his polluting presence civilization and morality receivd a blow from which they have never entirely recover d and the trail of the serpent has been over european art and european society ever since the turk regarded and regards women as animals without soul toys to be playd with or broken at pleasure and to be hidden partly from shame but chiefly for the purpose of stimulating exhausted passion such is the unholy origin of the objection to the nude as a fit subject for art it is purely asiatic and though not introduced for the first time in the fifteenth century is yet to be traced to the source of all impuritythe east although the source of the prejudice is thoroughly unhealthy and impure yet it is now shared by many pureminded and honest if somewhat uneducated people but i am prepared to maintain that it is necessary for the future of english art and of english morality that the right of the nude to a place in our galleries should be boldly asserted it must however be the nude as represented by thoroughly trained artists and with a pure and noble ethic purpose the human form male and female is the type and standard of all beauty of form and proportion and it is necessary to be thoroughly familiar with it in order safely to judge of all beauty which consists of form and proportion to women it is most necessary that they should become thoroughly imbued with the knowledge of the ideal female form in order that they should recognize the perfection of it at once and without effort and so far as possible avoid deviations from the ideal had this been the case in times past we should not have had to deplore the distortions effected by tightlacing which destroyd the figure and ruind the health of so many of the last generation nor should we have had the scandalous dresses alike of society and the stage the extreme development of the low dresses which obtaind some years ago when the stays crushd up the breasts into suggestive prominence would surely have been checkd had the eye of the public been properly educated by familiarity with the exquisite beauty of line of a wellshaped bust i might show how thorough acquaintance with the ideal nude foot would probably have much modified the foottorturing boots and high heels which wring the foot out of all beauty of line and throw the body forward into an awkward and ungainly attitude  it is argued that the effect of nude representation of women upon young men is unwholesome but it would not be so if such works were admitted without question into our galleries and became thoroughly familiar to them on the contrary it would do much to clear away from healthyhearted lads one of their sorest trialsthat prurient curiosity which is bred of prudish concealment where there is mystery there is the suggestion of evil and to go to a theatre where you have only to look at the stalls to see onehalf of the female form and to the stage to see the other half undraped is far more pregnant with evil imaginings than the most objectionable of totally undraped figures in french art there have been questionable nude figures exhibited but the fault was not that they were nude but that they were the portraits of ugly immodest women some discussion followd there was a general concurrence in the principle contended for by the reader of the paper sir walter stirling maintaind that the perfect male figure rather than the female was the model of beauty after a few remarks from rev mr roberts and colonel oldfield the chairman regretted that no opponent of nude figures had taken part in the discussion he agreed with sir walter stirling as to the male figure being the most perfect model of proportion he joind in defending the exhibition of nude figures but thought considerable supervision should be exercisd over such exhibitions  no it is not the picture or nude statue or text with clear aim that is indecent it is the beholders own thought inference distorted construction true modesty is one of the most precious of attributes even virtues but in nothing is there more pretense more falsity than the needless assumption of it through precept and consciousness man has long enough realized how bad he is i would not so much disturb or demolish that conviction only to resume and keep unerringly with it the spinal meaning of the scriptural text god overlookd all that he had made including the apex of the wholehumanitywith its elements passions appetites and behold it was very good  does not anything short of that third point of view when you come to think of it profoundly and with amplitude impugn creation from the outset in fact however overlaid or unaware of itself does not the conviction involvd in it perennially exist at the centre of all society and of the sexes and of marriage is it not really an intuition of the human race for old as the world is and beyond statement as are the countless and splendid results of its culture and evolution perhaps the best and earliest and purest intuitions of the human race have yet to be developd      death of abraham lincoln lecture  deliverd in new york april 14 1879in philadelphia 80in boston 81   how often since that dark and dripping saturdaythat chilly april day now fifteen years bygonemy heart has entertaind the dream the wish to give of abraham lincolns death its own special thought and memorial yet now the soughtfor opportunity offers i find my notes incompetent why for truly profound themes is statement so idle why does the right phrase never offer and the fit tribute i dreamd of waits unprepared as ever my talk here indeed is less because of itself or anything in it and nearly altogether because i feel a desire apart from any talk to specify the day the martyrdom it is for this my friends i have calld you together oft as the rolling years bring back this hour let it again however briefly be dwelt upon for my own part i hope and desire till my own dying day whenever the 14th or 15th of april comes to annually gather a few friends and hold its tragic reminiscence no narrow or sectional reminiscence it belongs to these states in their entiretynot the north only but the southperhaps belongs most tenderly and devoutly to the south of all for there really this mans birthstock there and thence his antecedent stamp why should i not say that thence his manliest traitshis universalityhis canny easy ways and words upon the surfacehis inflexible determination and courage at heart have you never realized it my friends that lincoln though grafted on the west is essentially in personnel and character a southern contribution  and though by no means proposing to resume the secession war tonight i would briefly remind you of the public conditions preceding that contest for twenty years and especially during the four or five before the war actually began the aspect of affairs in the united states though without the flash of military excitement presents more than the survey of a battle or any extended campaign or series even of natures convulsions the hot passions of the souththe strange mixture at the north of inertia incredulity and conscious powerthe incendiarism of the abolitioniststhe rascality and grip of the politicians unparalleld in any land any age to these i must not omit adding the honesty of the essential bulk of the people everywhereyet with all the seething fury and contradiction of their natures more arousd than the atlantics waves in wildest equinox in politics what can be more ominous though generally unappreciated thenwhat more significant than the presidentiads of fillmore and buchanan proving conclusively that the weakness and wickedness of elected rulers are just as likely to afflict us here as in the countries of the old world under their monarchies emperors and aristocracies in that old world were everywhere heard underground rumblings that died out only to again surely return while in america the volcano though civic yet continued to grow more and more convulsivemore and more stormy and threatening  in the height of all this excitement and chaos hovering on the edge at first and then merged in its very midst and destined to play a leading part appears a strange and awkward figure i shall not easily forget the first time i ever saw abraham lincoln it must have been about the 18th or 19th of february 1861 it was rather a pleasant afternoon in new york city as he arrived there from the west to remain a few hours and then pass on to washington to prepare for his inauguration i saw him in broadway near the site of the present postoffice he came down i think from canal street to stop at the astor house the broad spaces sidewalks and street in the neighborhood and for some distance were crowded with solid masses of people many thousands the omnibuses and other vehicles had all been turnd off leaving an unusual hush in that busy part of the city presently two or three shabby hack barouches made their way with some difficulty through the crowd and drew up at the astor house entrance a tall figure steppd out of the centre of these barouches pausd leisurely on the sidewalk lookd up at the granite walls and looming architecture of the grand old hotelthen after a relieving stretch of arms and legs turnd round for over a minute to slowly and goodhumoredly scan the appearance of the vast and silent crowds there were no speechesno complimentsno welcomeas far as i could hear not a word said still much anxiety was conceald in that quiet cautious persons had feard some markd insult or indignity to the presidentelectfor he possessd no personal popularity at all in new york city and very little political but it was evidently tacitly agreed that if the few political supporters of mr lincoln present would entirely abstain from any demonstration on their side the immense majority who were anything but supporters would abstain on their side also the result was a sulky unbroken silence such as certainly never before characterized so great a new york crowd  almost in the same neighborhood i distinctly rememberd seeing lafayette on his visit to america in 1825 i had also personally seen and heard various years afterward how andrew jackson clay webster hungarian kossuth filibuster walker the prince of wales on his visit and other celebres native and foreign had been welcomd thereall that indescribable human roar and magnetism unlike any other sound in the universethe glad exulting thundershouts of countless unloosd throats of men but on this occasion not a voicenot a sound from the top of an omnibus driven up one side close by and blockd by the curbstone and the crowds i had i say a capital view of it all and especially of mr lincoln his look and gaithis perfect composure and coolnesshis unusual and uncouth height his dress of complete black stovepipe hat pushd back on the head darkbrown complexion seamd and wrinkled yet cannylooking face black bushy head of hair disproportionately long neck and his hands held behind as he stood observing the people he lookd with curiosity upon that immense sea of faces and the sea of faces returnd the look with similar curiosity in both there was a dash of comedy almost farce such as shakspere puts in his blackest tragedies the crowd that hemmd around consisted i should think of thirty to forty thousand men not a single one his personal friendwhile i have no doubt so frenzied were the ferments of the time many an assassins knife and pistol lurkd in hip or breastpocket there ready soon as break and riot came  but no break or riot came the tall figure gave another relieving stretch or two of arms and legs then with moderate pace and accompanied by a few unknownlooking persons ascended the porticosteps of the astor house disappeard through its broad entranceand the dumbshow ended  i saw abraham lincoln often the four years following that date he changed rapidly and much during his presidencybut this scene and him in it are indelibly stampd upon my recollection as i sat on the top of my omnibus and had a good view of him the thought dim and inchoate then has since come out clear enough that four sorts of genius four mighty and primal hands will be needed to the complete limning of this mans future portraitthe eyes and brains and fingertouch of plutarch and eschylus and michel angelo assisted by rabelais  and nowmr lincoln passing on from this scene to washington where he was inaugurated amid armed cavalry and sharpshooters at every pointthe first instance of the kind in our historyand i hope it will be the lastnow the rapid succession of wellknown events too well knowni believe these

alas the hospitals  the secession war nay let me call it the union war though whatever calld it is even yet too near ustoo vast and too closely overshadowingits branches unformd yet but certain shooting too far into the futureand the most indicative and mightiest of them yet ungrown a great literature will yet arise out of the era of those four years those scenesera compressing centuries of native passion firstclass pictures tempests of life and deathan inexhaustible mine for the histories drama romance and even philosophy of peoples to comeindeed the verteber of poetry and art of personal character too for all future americafar more grand in my opinion to the hands capable of it than homers siege of troy or the french wars to shakspere  but i must leave these speculations and come to the theme i have assignd and limited myself to of the actual murder of president lincoln though so much has been written probably the facts are yet very indefinite in most persons minds i read from my memoranda written at the time and revised frequently and finally since  the day april 14 1865 seems to have been a pleasant one throughout the whole landthe moral atmosphere pleasant toothe long storm so dark so fratricidal full of blood and doubt and gloom over and ended at last by the sunrise of such an absolute national victory and utter breakdown of secessionismwe almost doubted our own senses lee had capitulated beneath the appletree of appomattox the other armies the flanges of the revolt swiftly followd and could it really be then out of all the affairs of this world of woe and failure and disorder was there really come the confirmd unerring sign of plan like a shaft of pure lightof rightful ruleof god so the day as i say was propitious early herbage early flowers were out i remember where i was stopping at the time the season being advanced there were many lilacs in full bloom by one of those caprices that enter and give tinge to events without being at all a part of them i find myself always reminded of the great tragedy of that day by the sight and odor of these blossoms it never fails  but i must not dwell on accessories the deed hastens the popular afternoon paper of washington the little evening star had spatterd all over its third page divided among the advertisements in a sensational manner in a hundred different places the president and his lady will be at the theatre this evening lincoln was fond of the theatre i have myself seen him there several times i remember thinking how funny it was that he in some respects the leading actor in the stormiest drama known to real historys stage through centuries should sit there and be so completely interested and absorbd in those human jackstraws moving about with their silly little gestures foreign spirit and flatulent text  on this occasion the theatre was crowded many ladies in rich and gay costumes officers in their uniforms many wellknown citizens young folks the usual clusters of gaslights the usual magnetism of so many people cheerful with perfumes music of violins and flutesand over all and saturating all that vast vague wonder victory the nations victory the triumph of the union filling the air the thought the sense with exhilaration more than all music and perfumes  the president came betimes and with his wife witnessd the play from the large stageboxes of the second tier two thrown into one and profusely drapd with the national flag the acts and scenes of the pieceone of those singularly written compositions which have at least the merit of giving entire relief to an audience engaged in mental action or business excitements and cares during the day as it makes not the slightest call on either the moral emotional esthetic or spiritual naturea piece our american cousin in which among other characters so calld a yankee certainly such a one as was never seen or the least like it ever seen in north america is introduced in england with a varied folderol of talk plot scenery and such phantasmagoria as goes to make up a modern popular dramahad progressd through perhaps a couple of its acts when in the midst of this comedy or nonsuch or whatever it is to be calld and to offset it or finish it out as if in natures and the great muses mockery of those poor mimes came interpolated that scene not really or exactly to be described at all for on the many hundreds who were there it seems to this hour to have left a passing blur a dream a blotchand yet partially to be described as i now proceed to give it there is a scene in the play representing a modern parlor in which two unprecedented english ladies are informd by the impossible yankee that he is not a man of fortune and therefore undesirable for marriagecatching purposes after which the comments being finishd the dramatic trio make exit leaving the stage clear for a moment at this period came the murder of abraham lincoln  great as all its manifold train circling round it and stretching into the future for many a century in the politics history art c of the new world in point of fact the main thing the actual murder transpired with the quiet and simplicity of any commonest occurrencethe bursting of a bud or pod in the growth of vegetation for instance through the general hum following the stage pause with the change of positions came the muffled sound of a pistolshot which not onehundredth part of the audience heard at the timeand yet a moments hushsomehow surely a vague startled thrilland then through the ornamented draperied starrd and striped spaceway of the presidents box a sudden figure a man raises himself with hands and feet stands a moment on the railing leaps below to the stage a distance of perhaps fourteen or fifteen feet falls out of position catching his bootheel in the copious drapery the american flag falls on one knee quickly recovers himself rises as if nothing had happend he really sprains his ankle but unfelt thenand so the figure booth the murderer dressd in plain black broadcloth bareheaded with full glossy raven hair and his eyes like some mad animals flashing with light and resolution yet with a certain strange calmness holds aloft in one hand a large knifewalks along not much back from the footlightsturns fully toward the audience his face of statuesque beauty lit by those basilisk eyes flashing with desperation perhaps insanitylaunches out in a firm and steady voice the words sic semper tyrannisand then walks with neither slow nor very rapid pace diagonally across to the back of the stage and disappears had not all this terrible scenemaking the mimic ones preposteroushad it not all been rehearsd in blank by booth beforehand  a moments husha screamthe cry of murdermrs lincoln leaning out of the box with ashy cheeks and lips with involuntary cry pointing to the retreating figure he has killd the president and still a moments strange incredulous suspenseand then the delugethen that mixture of horror noises uncertaintythe sound somewhere back of a horses hoofs clattering with speedthe people burst through chairs and railings and break them upthere is inextricable confusion and terrorwomen faintquite feeble persons fall and are trampld onmany cries of agony are heardthe broad stage suddenly fills to suffocation with a dense and motley crowd like some horrible carnivalthe audience rush generally upon it at least the strong men dothe actors and actresses are all there in their playcostumes and painted faces with mortal fright showing through the rougethe screams and calls confused talkredoubled trebledtwo or three manage to pass up water from the stage to the presidents boxothers try to clamber upc c  in the midst of all this the soldiers of the presidents guard with others suddenly drawn to the scene burst insome two hundred altogetherthey storm the house through all the tiers especially the upper ones inflamd with fury literally charging the audience with fixd bayonets muskets and pistols snouting clear out clear out you sons of such the wild scene or a suggestion of it rather inside the playhouse that night  outside too in the atmosphere of shock and craze crowds of people filld with frenzy ready to seize any outlet for it come near committing murder several times on innocent individuals one such case was especially exciting the infuriated crowd through some chance got started against one man either for words he utterd or perhaps without any cause at all and were proceeding at once to actually hang him on a neighboring lamppost when he was rescued by a few heroic policemen who placed him in their midst and fought their way slowly and amid great peril toward the station house it was a fitting episode of the whole affair the crowd rushing and eddying to and frothe night the yells the pale faces many frightend people trying in vain to extricate themselvesthe attackd man not yet freed from the jaws of death looking like a corpsethe silent resolute halfdozen policemen with no weapons but their little clubs yet stern and steady through all those eddying swarmsmade a fitting sidescene to the grand tragedy of the murder they gaind the station house with the protected man whom they placed in security for the night and discharged him in the morning  and in the midst of that pandemonium infuriated soldiers the audience and the crowd the stage and all its actors and actresses its paintpots spangles and gaslightsthe life blood from those veins the best and sweetest of the land drips slowly down and deaths ooze already begins its little bubbles on the lips  thus the visible incidents and surroundings of abraham lincolns murder as they really occurd thus ended the attempted secession of these states thus the four years war but the main things come subtly and invisibly afterward perhaps long afterwardneither military political nor great as those are historical i say certain secondary and indirect results out of the tragedy of this death are in my opinion greatest not the event of the murder itself not that mr lincoln strings the principal points and personages of the period like beads upon the single string of his career not that his idiosyncrasy in its sudden appearance and disappearance stamps this republic with a stamp more markd and enduring than any yet given by any one manmore even than washingtonsbut joind with these the immeasurable value and meaning of that whole tragedy lies to me in senses finally dearest to a nation and here all our ownthe imaginative and artistic sensesthe literary and dramatic ones not in any common or low meaning of those terms but a meaning precious to the race and to every age a long and varied series of contradictory events arrives at last at its highest poetic single central pictorial denouement the whole involved baffling multiform whirl of the secession period comes to a head and is gatherd in one brief flash of lightningilluminationone simple fierce deed its sharp culmination and as it were solution of so many bloody and angry problems illustrates those climaxmoments on the stage of universal time where the historic muse at one entrance and the tragic muse at the other

midst in our own timethat seal of the emancipation of three million slavesthat parturition and delivery of our at last really free republic born again henceforth to commence its career of genuine homogeneous union compact consistent with itself  nor will ever future american patriots and unionists indifferently over the whole land or north or south find a better moral to their lesson the final use of the greatest men of a nation is after all not with reference to their deeds in themselves or their direct bearing on their times or lands the final use of a heroiceminent lifeespecially of a heroiceminent deathis its indirect filtering into the nation and the race and to give often at many removes but unerringly age after age color and fibre to the personalism of the youth and maturity of that age and of mankind then there is a cement to the whole people subtler more underlying than any thing in written constitution or courts or armiesnamely the cement of a death identified thoroughly with that people at its head and for its sake strange is it not that battles martyrs agonies blood even assassination should so condenseperhaps only really lastingly condensea nationality  i repeat itthe grand deaths of the racethe dramatic deaths of every nationalityare its most important inheritancevaluein some respects beyond its literature and artas the hero is beyond his finest portrait and the battle itself beyond its choicest song or epic is not here indeed the point underlying all tragedy the famous pieces of the grecian mastersand all masters why if the old greeks had had this man what trilogies of playswhat epicswould have been made out of him how the rhapsodes would have recited him how quickly that quaint tall form would have enterd into the region where men vitalize gods

and hardy as ulyssesdeaths more pitiful than priams  when centuries hence as it must in my opinion be centuries hence before the life of these states or of democracy can be really written and illustrated the leading historians and dramatists seek for some personage some special event incisive enough to mark with deepest cut and mnemonize this turbulent nineteenth century of ours not only these states but all over the political and social worldsomething perhaps to close that gorgeous procession of european feudalism with all its pomp and casteprejudices of whose long train we in america are yet so inextricably the heirssomething to identify with terrible identification by far the greatest revolutionary step in the history of the united states perhaps the greatest of the world

americans our countries so distant so unlike at first glancesuch a difference in social and political conditions and our respective methods of moral and practical development the last hundred yearsand yet in certain features and vastest ones so resembling each other the variety of stockelements and tongues to be resolutely fused in a common identity and union at all hazardsthe idea perennial through the ages that they both have their historic and divine missionthe fervent element of manly friendship throughout the whole people surpassd by no other racesthe grand expanse of territorial limits and boundariesthe unformd and nebulous state of many things not yet permanently settled but agreed on all hands to be the preparations of an infinitely greater futurethe fact that both peoples have their independent and leading positions to hold keep and if necessary fight for against the rest of the worldthe deathless aspirations at the inmost centre of each great community so vehement so mysterious so abysmicare certainly features you russians and we americans possess in common as my dearest dream is for an internationality of poems and poets binding the lands of the earth closer than all treaties and diplomacyas the purpose beneath the rest in my book is such hearty comradeship for individuals to begin with and for all the nations of the earth as a resulthow happy i should be to get the hearing and emotional contact of the great russian peoples  to whom now and here addressing you for russia and russians and empowering you should you see fit to print the present letter in your book as a preface i waft affectionate salutation from these shores in americas name  w w     notes left over   nationalityand yet it is more and more clear to me that the main sustenance for highest separate personality these states is to come from that general sustenance of the aggregate as air earth rains give sustenance to a treeand that such personality by democratic standards will only be fully coherent grand and free through the cohesion grandeur and freedom of the common aggregate the union thus the existence of the true american continental solidarity of the future depending on myriads of superb largesized emotional and physically perfect individualities of one sex just as much as the other the supply of such individualities in my opinion wholly depends on a compacted imperial ensemble the theory and practice of both sovereignties contradictory as they are are necessary as the centripetal law were fatal alone or the centrifugal law deadly and destructive alone but together forming the law of eternal kosmical action evolution preservation and lifeso by itself alone the fullness of individuality even the sanest would surely destroy itself this is what makes the importance to the identities of these states of the thoroughly fused relentless dominating uniona moral and spiritual idea subjecting all the parts with remorseless power more needed by american democracy than by any of historys hitherto empires or feudalities and the sine qua non of carrying out the republican principle to develop itself in the new world through hundreds thousands of years to come  indeed what most needs fostering through the hundred years to come in all parts of the united states north south mississippi valley and atlantic and pacific coasts is this fused and fervent identity of the individual whoever he or she may be and wherever the place with the idea and fact of american totality and with what is meant by the flag the stars and stripes we need this conviction of nationality as a faith to be absorbd in the blood and belief of the people everywhere south north west east to emanate in their life and in native literature and art we want the germinal idea that america inheritor of the past is the custodian of the future of humanity judging from history it is some such moral and spiritual ideas appropriate to them and such ideas only that have made the profoundest glory and endurance of nations in the past the races of judea the classic clusters of greece and rome and the feudal and ecclesiastical clusters of the middle ages were each and all vitalized by their separate distinctive ideas ingraind in them redeeming many sins and indeed in a sense the principal reasonwhy for their whole career  then in the thought of nationality especially for the united states and making them original and different from all other countries another point ever remains to be considered there are two distinct principlesaye paradoxesat the lifefountain and lifecontinuation of the states one the sacred principle of the union the right of ensemble at whatever sacrificeand yet another an equally sacred principle the right of each state considerd as a separate sovereign individual in its own sphere some go zealously for one set of these rights and some as zealously for the other set we must have both or rather bred out of them as out of mother and father a third set the perennial result and combination of both and neither jeopardized i say the loss or abdication of one set in the future will be ruin to democracy just as much as the loss of the other set the problem is to harmoniously adjust the two and the play of the two observe the lesson of the divinity of nature ever checking the excess of one law by an opposite or seemingly opposite lawgenerally the other side of the same law for the theory of this republic is not that the general government is the fountain of all life and power dispensing it forth around and to the remotest portions of our territory but that the people are represented in both underlying both the general and state governments and considerd just as well in their individualities and in their separate aggregates or states as considerd in one vast aggregate the union this was the original dual theory and foundation of the united states as distinguishd from the feudal and ecclesiastical single idea of monarchies and papacies and the divine right of kings kings have been of use hitherto as representing the idea of the identity of nations but to american democracy both ideas must be fulfilld and in my opinion the loss of vitality of either one will indeed be the loss of vitality of the other   emersons books the shadows of them  in the regions we call nature towering beyond all measurement with infinite spread infinite depth and heightin those regions including man socially and historically with his moralemotional influenceshow small a part it came in my mind today has literature really depictedeven summing up all of it all ages seems at its best some little fleet of boats hugging the shores of a boundless sea and never venturing exploring the unmappdnever columbuslike sailing out for new worlds and to complete the orbs rondure emerson writes frequently in the atmosphere of this thought and his books report one or two things from that very ocean and air and more legibly addressd to our age and american polity than by any man yet but i will begin by scarifying himthus proving that i am not insensible to his deepest lessons i will consider his books from a democratic and western point of view i will specify the shadows on these sunny expanses somebody has said of heroic character that wherever the tallest peaks are present must inevitably be deep chasms and valleys mine be the ungracious task for reasons of leaving unmentiond both sunny expanses and skyreaching heights to dwell on the bare spots and darknesses i have a theory that no artist or work of the very first class may be or can be without them  first then these pages are perhaps too perfect too concentrated how good for instance is good butter good sugar but to be eating nothing but sugar and butter all the time even if ever so good and though the author has much to say of freedom and wildness and simplicity and spontaneity no performance was ever more based on artificial scholarships and decorums at third or fourth removes he calls it culture and built up from them it is always a make never an unconscious growth it is the porcelain figure or statuette of lion or stag or indian hunterand a very choice statuette tooappropriate for the rosewood or marble bracket of parlor or library never the animal itself or the hunter himself indeed who wants the real animal or hunter what would that do amid astral and bricabrac and tapestry and ladies and gentlemen talking in subdued tones of browning and longfellow and art the least suspicion of such actual bull or indian or of nature carrying out itself would put all those good people to instant terror and flight  emerson in my opinion is not most eminent as poet or artist or teacher though valuable in all those he is best as critic or diagnoser not passion or imagination or warp or weakness or any pronounced cause or specialty dominates him cold and bloodless intellectuality dominates him i know the fires emotions love egotisms glow deep perennial as in all new englandersbut the facade hides them wellthey give no sign he does not see or take one side one presentation only or mainly as all the poets or most of the fine writers anyhowhe sees all sides his final influence is to make his students cease to worship anythingalmost cease to believe in anything outside of themselves these books will fill and well fill certain stretches of life certain stages of development are like the tenets or theology the author of them preachd when a young man unspeakably serviceable and precious as a stage but in old or nervous or solemnest or dying hours when one needs the impalpably soothing and vitalizing influences of abysmic nature or its affinities in literature or human society and the soul resents the keenest mere intellection they will not be sought for  for a philosopher emerson possesses a singularly dandified theory of manners he seems to have no notion at all that manners are simply the signs by which the chemist or metallurgist knows his metals to the profound scientist all metals are profound as they really are the little one like the conventional world will make much of gold and silver only then to the real artist in humanity what are called bad manners are often the most picturesque and significant of all suppose these books becoming absorbd the permanent chyle of american general and particular characterwhat a wellwashd and grammatical but bloodless and helpless race we should turn out no no dear friend though the states want scholars undoubtedly and perhaps want ladies and gentlemen who use the bath frequently and never laugh loud or talk wrong they dont want scholars or ladies and gentlemen at the expense of all the rest they want good farmers sailors mechanics clerks citizensperfect business and social relationsperfect fathers and mothers if we could only have these or their approximations plenty of them fine and large and sane and generous and patriotic they might make their verbs disagree from their nominatives and laugh like volleys of musketeers if they should please of course these are not all america wants but they are first of all to be provided on a large scale and with tremendous errors and escapades this substantially is what the states seem to have an intuition of and to be mainly aiming at the plan of a select class superfined demarcated from the rest the plan of old world lands and literatures is not so objectionable in itself but because it chokes the true plan for us and indeed is death to it as to such special class the united states can never produce any equal to the splendid show far far beyond comparison or competition here of the principal european nations both in the past and at the present day but an immense and distinctive commonalty over our vast and varied area west and east south and northin fact for the first time in history a great aggregated real people worthy the name and made of developd heroic individuals both sexesis americas principal perhaps only reason for being if ever accomplishd it will be at least as much i lately think doubly as much the result of fitting and democratic sociologies literatures and artsif we ever get themas of our democratic politics  at times it has been doubtful to me if emerson really knows or feels what poetry is at its highest as in the bible for instance or homer or shakspere i see he covertly or plainly likes best superb verbal polish or something old or oddwallers go lovely rose or lovelaces lines to lucustathe quaint conceits of the old french bards and the like of power he seems to have a gentlemans admirationbut in his inmost heart the grandest attribute of god and poets is always subordinate to the octaves conceits polite kinks and verbs  the reminiscence that years ago i began like most youngsters to have a touch though it came late and was only on the surface of emersononthebrainthat i read his writings reverently and addressd him in print as master and for a month or so thought of him as suchi retain not only with composure but positive satisfaction i have noticed that most young people of eager minds pass through this stage of exercise  the best part of emersonianism is it breeds the giant that destroys itself who wants to be any mans mere follower lurks behind every page no teacher ever taught that has so provided for his pupils setting up independentlyno truer evolutionist   ventures on an old theme  a dialogue  one party sayswe arrange our liveseven the best and boldest men and women that exist just as much as the most limitedwith reference to what society conventionally rules and makes right we retire to our rooms for freedom to undress bathe unloose everything in freedom these and much else would not be proper in society  other party answerssuch is the rule of society not always so and considerable exceptions still exist however it must be called the general rule sanctiond by immemorial usage and will probably always remain so  first partywhy not then respect it in your poems  answerone reason and to me a profound one is that the soul of a man or woman demands enjoys compensation in the highest directions for this very restraint of himself or herself leveld to the average or rather mean low however eternally practical requirements of societys intercourse to balance this indispensable abnegation the free minds of poets relieve themselves and strengthen and enrich mankind with free flights in all the directions not tolerated by ordinary society  first partybut must not outrage or give offence to it  answerno not in the deepest senseand do not and cannot the vast averages of time and the race en masse settle these things only understand that the conventional standards and laws proper enough for ordinary society apply neither to the action of the soul nor its poets in fact the latter know no laws but the laws of themselves planted in them by god and are themselves the last standards of the law and its final exponentsresponsible to him directly and not at all to mere etiquette often the best service that can be done to the race is to lift the veil at least for a time from these rules and fossiletiquettes   new poetrycalifornia canada texasin my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry i say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character regardless of rhyme and the measurementrules of iambic spondee dactyl c and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue to furnish the medium for inferior writers and themes especially for persiflage and the comic as there seems henceforward to the perfect taste something inevitably comic in rhyme merely in itself and anyhow the truest and greatest poetry while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic and distinguishable easily enough can never again in the english language be expressd in arbitrary and rhyming metre any more than the greatest eloquence or the truest power and passion while admitting that the venerable and heavenly forms of chiming versification have in their time playd great and fitting partsthat the pensive complaint the ballads wars amours legends of europe c have many of them been inimitably renderd in rhyming versethat there have been very illustrious poets whose shapes the mantle of such verse has beautifully and appropriately enveloptand though the mantle has fallen with perhaps added beauty on some of our own ageit is notwithstanding certain to me that the day of such conventional rhyme is ended in america at any rate and as a medium of highest esthetic practical or spiritual expression present or future it palpably fails and must fail to serve the muse of the prairies of california canada texas and of the peaks of colorado dismissing the literary as well as social etiquette of oversea feudalism and caste joyfully enlarging adapting itself to comprehend the size of the whole people with the free play emotions pride passions experiences that belong to them body and soulto the general globe and all its relations in astronomy as the savans portray them to usto the modern the busy nineteenth century as grandly poetic as any only different with steamships railroads factories electric telegraphs cylinder pressesto the thought of the solidarity of nations the brotherhood and sisterhood of the entire earthto the dignity and heroism of the practical labor of farms factories foundries workshops mines or on shipboard or on lakes and riversresumes that other medium of expression more flexible more eligiblesoars to the freer vast diviner heaven of prose  of poems of the third or fourth class perhaps even some of the second it makes little or no difference who writes themthey are good enough for what they are nor is it necessary that they should be actual emanations from the personality and life of the writers the very reverse sometimes gives piquancy but poems of the first class poems of the depth as distinguished from those of the surface are to be sternly tallied with the poets themselves and tried by them and their lives who wants a glorification of courage and manly defiance from a coward or a sneaka ballad of benevolence or chastity from some rhyming hunks or lascivious glib roue  in these states beyond all precedent poetry will have to do with actual facts with the concrete states andfor we have not much more than begunwith the definitive getting into shape of the union indeed i sometimes think it alone is to define the union namely to give it artistic character spirituality dignity what american humanity is most in danger of is an overwhelming prosperity business worldliness materialism what is most lacking east west north south is a fervid and glowing nationality and patriotism cohering all the parts into one who may fend that danger and fill that lack in the future but a class of loftiest poets  if the united states havent grown poets on any scale of grandeur it is certain they import print and read more poetry than any equal number of people elsewhereprobably more than all the rest of the world combined  poetry like a grand personality is a growth of many generationsmany rare combinations  to have great poets there must be great audiences too   british literature  to avoid mistake i would say that i not only commend the study of this literature but wish our sources of supply and comparison vastly enlarged american students may well derive from all former landsfrom forenoon greece and rome down to the perturbd mediaeval times the crusades and so to italy the german intellectall the older literatures and all the newer onesfrom witty and warlike france and markedly and in many ways and at many different periods from the enterprise and soul of the great spanish racebearing ourselves always courteous always deferential indebted beyond measure to the motherworld to all its nations dead as all its nations livingthe offspring this america of ours the daughter not by any means of the british isles exclusively but of the continent and all continents indeed it is time we should realize and fully fructify those germs we also hold from italy france spain especially in the best imaginative productions of those lands which are in many ways loftier and subtler than the english or british and indispensable to complete our service proportions education reminiscences c the british element these states hold and have always held enormously beyond its fit proportions i have already spoken of shakspere he seems to me of astral genius first class entirely fit for feudalism his contributions especially to the literature of the passions are immense forever dear to humanityand his name is always to be reverenced in america but there is much in him ever offensive to democracy he is not only the tally of feudalism but i should say shakspere is incarnated uncompromising feudalism in literature then one seems to detect something in himi hardly know how to describe iteven amid the dazzle of his genius and in inferior manifestations it is found in nearly all leading british authors perhaps we will have to import the words snob snobbish c after all while of the great poems of asian antiquity the indian epics the book of job the ionian iliad the unsurpassedly simple loving perfect idyls of the life and death of christ in the new testament indeed homer and the biblical utterances intertwine familiarly with us in the main and along down of most of the characteristic imaginative or romantic relics of the continent as the cid cervantes don quixote c i should say they substantially adjust themselves to us and far off as they are accord curiously with our bed and board today in new york  washington canada ohio texas californiaand with our notions both of seriousness and of fun and our standards of heroism manliness and even the democratic requirementsthose requirements are not only not fulfilld in the shaksperean productions but are insulted on every page  i add thatwhile england is among the greatest of lands in political freedom or the idea of it and in stalwart personal character cthe spirit of english literature is not great at least is not greatestand its products are no models for us with the exception of shakspere there is no firstclass genius in that literaturewhich with a truly vast amount of value and of artificial beauty largely from the classics is almost always material sensual not spiritualalmost always congests makes plethoric not frees expands dilatesis cold antidemocratic loves to be sluggish and stately and shows much of that characteristic of vulgar persons the dread of saying or doing something not at all improper in itself but unconventional and that may be laughd at in its best the sombre pervades it it is moody melancholy and to give it its due expresses in characters and plots those qualities in an unrivald manner yet not as the black thunderstorms and in great normal crashing passions of the greek dramatistsclearing the air refreshing afterward bracing with power but as in hamlet moping sick uncertain and leaving ever after a secret taste for the blues the morbid fascination the luxury of wo  i strongly recommend all the young men and young women of the united states to whom it may be eligible to overhaul the wellfreighted fleets the literatures of italy spain france germany so full of those elements of freedom selfpossession gayheartedness subtlety dilation needed in preparations for the future of the states i only wish we could have really good translations i rejoice at the feeling for oriental researches and poetry and hope it will go on   darwinismthen furthermore  running through prehistoric agescoming down from them into the daybreak of our records founding theology suffusing literature and so brought onwarda sort of verteber and marrow to all the antique races and lands egypt india greece rome the chinese the jews c and giving cast and complexion to their art poems and their politics as well as ecclesiasticism all of which we more or less inherit appear those venerable claims to origin from god himself or from gods and goddessesancestry from divine beings of vaster beauty size and power than ours but in current and latest times the theory of human origin that seems to have most made its mark curiously reversing the antique is that we have come on originated developt from monkeys baboonsa theory more significant perhaps in its indirections or what it necessitates than it is even in itself of the twain far apart as they seem and angrily as their conflicting advocates today oppose each other are not both theories to be possibly reconcild and even blended can we indeed spare either of them better still out of them is not a third theory the real one or suggesting the real one to arise  of this old theory evolution as broachd anew trebled with indeed alldevouring claims by darwin it has so much in it and is so needed as a counterpoise to yet widely prevailing and unspeakably tenacious enfeebling superstitionsis fused by the new man into such grand modest truly scientific accompanimentsthat the world of erudition both moral and physical cannot but be eventually betterd and broadend in its speculations from the advent of darwinism nevertheless the problem of origins human and other is not the least whit nearer its solution in due time the evolution theory will have to abate its vehemence cannot be allowd to dominate every thing else and will have to take its place as a segment of the circle the clusteras but one of many theories many thoughts of profoundest valueand readjusting and differentiating much yet leaving the divine secrets just as inexplicable and unreachable as beforemaybe more so  then furthermorewhat is finally to be done by priest or poetand by priest or poet onlyamid all the stupendous and dazzling novelties of our century with the advent of america and of science and democracyremains just as indispensable after all the work of the grand astronomers chemists linguists historians and explorers of the last hundred yearsand the wondrous german and other metaphysicians of that timeand will continue to remain needed america and here just the same as in the world of europe or asia of a hundred or a thousand or several thousand years ago i think indeed more needed to furnish statements from the present points the added arriere and the unspeakably immenser vistas of today only the priests and poets of the modern at least as exalted as any in the past fully absorbing and appreciating the results of the past in the commonalty of all humanity all time the main results already for there is perhaps nothing more or at any rate not much strictly new only more important modern combinations and new relative adjustments must indeed recast the old metal the already achievd material into and through new moulds current forms  meantime the highest and subtlest and broadest truths of modern science wait for their true assignment and last vivid flashes of lightas democracy waits for itsthrough firstclass metaphysicians and speculative philosophslaying the basements and foundations for those new more expanded more harmonious more melodious freer american poems   society  i have myself little or no hope from what is technically called society in our american cities new york of which place i have spoken so sharply still promises something in time out of its tremendous and varied materials with a certain superiority of intuitions and the advantage of constant agitation and ever new and rapid dealings of the cards of boston with its circles of social mummies swathed in cerements harder than brassits bloodless religion unitarianism its complacent vanity of scientism and literature lots of grammatical correctness mere knowledge always wearisome in itselfits zealous abstractions ghosts of reformsi should say ever admitting its business powers its sharp almost demoniac intellect and no lack in its own way of courage and generositythere is at present little of cheering satisfying sign in the west california c society is yet unformd puerile seemingly unconscious of anything above a driving business or to liberally spend the money made by it in the usual rounds and shows  then there is to the humorous observer of american attempts at fashion according to the models of foreign courts and saloons quite a comic sideparticularly visible at washington citya sort of highlifebelowstairs business as if any farce could be funnier for instance than the scenes of the crowds winter nights meandering around our presidents and their wives cabinet officers western or other senators representatives c born of good laboring mechanic or farmer stock and antecedents attempting those fulldress receptions finesse of parlors foreign ceremonies etiquettes c  indeed considerd with any sense of propriety or any sense at all the whole of this illyplayd fashionable play and display with their absorption of the best part of our wealthier citizens time money energies c is ridiculously out of place in the united states as if our proper man and woman far far greater words than gentleman and lady could still fail to see and presently achieve not this spectral business but something truly noble active sane americanby modes perfections of character manners costumes social relations c adjusted to standards far far different from those  eminent and liberal foreigners british or continental must at times have their faith fearfully tried by what they see of our new world personalities the shallowest and least american persons seem surest to push abroad and call without fail on wellknown foreigners who are doubtless affected with indescribable qualms by these queer ones then more than half of our authors and writers evidently think it a great thing to be aristocratic and sneer at progress democracy revolution etc if some international literary snobs gallery were establishd it is certain that america could contribute at least her full share of the portraits and some very distinguishd ones observe that the most impudent slanders low insults c on the great revolutionary authors leaders poets c of europe have their origin and main circulation in certain circles here the treatment of victor hugo living and byron dead are samples both deserving so well of america and both persistently attempted to be soild here by unclean birds male and female  meanwhile i must still offset the like of the foregoing and all it infers by the recognition of the fact that while the surfaces of current society here show so much that is dismal noisome and vapory there are beyond question inexhaustible supplies as of true gold ore in the mines of americas general humanity let us not ignoring the dross give fit stress to these precious immortal values also let it be distinctly admitted thatwhatever may be said of our fashionable society and of any foul fractions and episodesonly here in america out of the long history and manifold presentations of the ages has at last arisen and now stands what never before took positive form and sway the peopleand that viewd en masse and while fully acknowledging deficiencies dangers faults this people inchoate latent not yet come

pastthe stablest solidestbased government of the worldthe most assured in a futurethe beaming pharos to whose perennial light all earnest eyes the world over are tendingand that already in and from it the democratic principle having been mortally tried by severest tests fatalities of war and peace now issues from the trial unharmd treblyinvigorated perhaps to commence forthwith its finally triumphant march around the globe   the tramp and strike questions part of a lecture proposed never deliverd  two grim and spectral dangersdangerous to peace to health to social security to progresslong known in concrete to the governments of the old world and there eventuating more than once or twice in dynastic overturns bloodshed days months of terrorseem of late years to be nearing the new world nay to be gradually establishing themselves among us what mean these phantoms here i personify them in fictitious shapes but they are very real is the fresh and broad demesne of america destined also to give them foothold and lodgment permanent domicile  beneath the whole political world what most presses and perplexes today sending vastest results affecting the future is not the abstract question of democracy but of social and economic organization the treatment of workingpeople by employers and all that goes along with itnot only the wagespayment part but a certain spirit and principle to vivify anew these relations all the questions of progress strength tariffs finance c really evolving themselves more or less directly out of the poverty question the science of wealth and a dozen other names are given it but i prefer the severe one just used i will begin by calling the readers attention to a thought upon the matter which may not have struck you beforethe wealth of the civilized world as contrasted with its povertywhat does it derivatively stand for and represent a rich person ought to have a strong stomach as in europe the wealth of today mainly results from and represents the rapine murder outrages treachery hoggishness of hundreds of years ago and onward later so in america after the same tokennot yet so bad perhaps or at any rate not so palpablewe have not existed long enoughbut we seem to be doing our best to make it up  curious as it may seem it is in what are calld the poorest lowest characters you will sometimes nay generally find glints of the most sublime virtues eligibilities heroisms then it is doubtful whether the state is to be saved either in the monotonous long run or in tremendous special crises by its good people only when the storm is deadliest and the disease most imminent help often comes from strange quartersthe homoeopathic motto you remember cure the bite with a hair of the same dog  the american revolution of 1776 was simply a great strike successful for its immediate objectbut whether a real success judged by the scale of the centuries and the longstriking balance of time yet remains to be settled the french revolution was absolutely a strike and a very terrible and relentless one against ages of bad pay unjust division of wealthproducts and the hoggish monopoly of a few rolling in superfluity against the vast bulk of the workpeople living in squalor  if the united states like the countries of the old world are also to grow vast crops of poor desperate dissatisfied nomadic miserablywaged populations such as we see looming upon us of late yearssteadily even if slowly eating into them like a cancer of lungs or stomachthen our republican experiment notwithstanding all its surfacesuccesses is at heart an unhealthy failure  feb 79i saw today a sight i had never seen beforeand it amazed and made me serious three quite goodlooking american men of respectable personal presence two of them young carrying chiffonierbags on their shoulders and the usual long iron hooks in their hands plodding along their eyes cast down spying for scraps rags bones c   democracy in the new world  estimated and summdup today having thoroughly justified itself the past hundred years as far as growth vitality and power are concernd by severest and most varied trials of peace and war and having establishd itself for good with all its necessities and benefits for time to come is now to be seriously considerd also in its pronouncd and already developt dangers while the battle was raging and the result suspended all defections and criticisms were to be hushd and everything bent with vehemence unmitigated toward the urge of victory but that victory settled new responsibilities advance i can conceive of no better service in the united states henceforth by democrats of thorough and heartfelt faith than boldly exposing the weakness liabilities and infinite corruptions of democracy by the unprecedented openingup of humanity enmasse in the united states the last hundred years under our institutions not only the good qualities of the race but just as much the bad ones are prominently brought forward man is about the same in the main whether with despotism or whether with freedom  the ideal form of human society canon kingsley declares is democracy a nationand were it even possible a whole worldof free men lifting free foreheads to god and nature calling no man master for one is their master even god knowing and doing their duties toward the maker of the universe and therefore to each other not from fear nor calculation of profit or loss but because they have seen the beauty of righteousness and trust and peace because the law of god is in their hearts such a nationsuch a societywhat nobler conception of moral existence can we form would not that indeed be the kingdom of god come on earth  to this faith founded in the ideal let us holdand never abandon or lose it then what a spectacle is practically exhibited by our american democracy today   foundation stagesthen others  though i think i fully comprehend the absence of moral tone in our current politics and business and the almost entire futility of absolute and simple honor as a counterpoise against the enormous greed for worldly wealth with the trickeries of gaining it all through society our day i still do not share the depression and despair on the subject which i find possessing many good people the advent of america the history of the past century has been the first general aperture and openingup to the average human commonalty on the broadest scale of the eligibilities to wealth and worldly success and eminence and has been fully taken advantage of and the example has spread hence in ripples to all nations to these eligibilitiesto this limitless aperture the race has tended enmasse roaring and rushing and crude and fiercely turbidly hasteningand we have seen the first stages and are now in the midst of the result of it all so far but there will certainly ensue other stages and entirely different ones in nothing is there more evolution than the american mind soon it will be fully realized that ostensible wealth and moneymaking show luxury c imperatively necessitate something beyondnamely the sane eternal moral and spiritualesthetic attributes elements we cannot have even that realization on any less terms than the price we are now paying for it soon it will be understood clearly that the state cannot flourish nay cannot exist without those elements they will gradually enter into the chyle of sociology and literature they will finally make the blood and brawn of the best american individualities of both sexesand thus with them to a certainty through these very processes of today dominate the new world   general suffrage elections etc  it still remains doubtful to me whether these will ever secure officially the best wit and capacitywhether through them the firstclass genius of america will ever personally appear in the high political stations the presidency congress the leading state offices c those offices or the candidacy for them arranged won by caucusing money the favoritism or pecuniary interest of rings the superior manipulation of the ins over the outs or the outs over the ins are indeed at best the mere business agencies of the people are useful as formulating neither the best and highest but the average of the public judgment sense justice or sometimes want of judgment sense justice we elect presidents congressmen c not so much to have them consider and decide for us but as surest practical means of expressing the will of majorities on mooted questions measures c  as to general suffrage after all since we have gone so far the more general it is the better i favor the widest opening of the doors let the ventilation and area be wide enough and all is safe we can never have a born penitentiarybird or panelthief or lowest gamblinghell or groggery keeper for presidentthough such may not only emulate but get high offices from localitieseven from the proud and wealthy city of new york   who gets the plunder  the protectionists are fond of flashing to the public eye the glittering delusion of great moneyresults from manufactures mines artificial exportsso many millions from this source and so many from thatsuch a seductive unanswerable showan immense revenue of annual cash from iron cotton woollen leather goods and a hundred other things all bolstered up by protection but the really important point of all is into whose pockets does this plunder really go it would be some excuse and satisfaction if even a fair proportion of it went to the masses of laboringmenresulting in homesteads to such men women childrenmyriads of actual homes in fee simple in every state not the false glamour of the stunning wealth reported in the census in the statistics or tables in the newspapers but a fair division and generous average to those workmen and workwomenthat would be something but the fact itself is nothing of the kind the profits of protection go altogether to a few score select personswho by favors of congress state legislatures the banks and other special advantages are forming a vulgar aristocracy full as bad as anything in the british or european castes of blood or the dynasties there of the past as sismondi pointed out the true prosperity of a nation is not in the great wealth of a special class but is only to be really attaind in having the bulk of the people provided with homes or land

great masses of the unsuccessful the poor as a mixed political and social question is not this full of dark significance is it not worth considering as a problem and puzzle in our democracyan indispensable want to be supplied   rulers strictly out of the masses  in the talk which i welcome about the need of men of training thoroughly schoold and experienced men for statesmen i would present the following as an offset it was written by me twenty years agoand has been curiously verified since  i say no body of men are fit to make presidents judges and generals unless they themselves supply the best specimens of the same and that supplying one or two such specimens illuminates the whole body for a thousand years i expect to see the day when the like of the present personnel of the governments federal state municipal military and naval will be lookd upon with derision and when qualified mechanics and young men will reach congress and other official stations sent in their working costumes fresh from their benches and tools and returning to them again with dignity the young fellows must prepare to do credit to this destiny for the stuff is in them nothing gives

of action even the broadest and highest now among the american mechanics and young men than in all the official persons in these states legislative executive judicial military and naval and more than among all the literary persons i would be much pleasd to see some heroic shrewd fullyinformd healthybodied middleaged beardfaced american blacksmith or boatman come down from the west across the alleghanies and walk into the presidency dressd in a clean suit of working attire and with the tan all over his face breast and arms i would certainly vote for that sort of man possessing the due requirements before any other candidate  the facts of rankandfile workingmen mechanics lincoln johnson grant garfield brought forward from the masses and placed in the presidency and swaying its

storytelling was often with president lincoln a weapon which he employd with great skill very often he could not give a pointblank reply or commentand these indirections sometimes funny but not always so were probably the best responses possible in the gloomiest period of the war he had a call from a large delegation of bank presidents in the talk after business was settled one of the big dons asked mr lincoln if his confidence in the permanency of the union was not beginning to be shakenwhereupon the homely president told a little story when i was a young man in illinois said he i boarded for a time with a deacon of the presbyterian church one night i was roused from my sleep by a rap at the door and i heard the deacons voice exclaiming arise abraham the day of judgment has come i sprang from my bed and rushed to the window and saw the stars falling in great showers but looking back of them in the heavens i saw the grand old constellations with which i was so well acquainted fixed and true in their places gentlemen the world did not come to an end then nor will the union now   freedom  it is not only true that most people entirely misunderstand freedom but i sometimes think i have not yet met one person who rightly understands it the whole universe is absolute law freedom only opens entire activity and license under the law to the degraded or undeveloptand even to too many othersthe thought of freedom is a thought of escaping from lawwhich of course is impossible more precious than all worldly riches is freedomfreedom from the painful constipation and poor narrowness of ecclesiasticismfreedom in manners habiliments furniture from the silliness and tyranny of local fashionsentire freedom from party rings and mere conventions in politicsand better than all a general freedom of onesself from the tyrannic domination of vices habits appetites under which nearly every man of us often the greatest brawler for freedom is enslavd can we attain such enfranchisementthe true democracy and the height of it while we are from birth to death the subjects of irresistible law enclosing every movement and minute we yet escape by a paradox into true free will strange as it may seem we only attain to freedom by a knowledge of and implicit obedience to law greatunspeakably greatis the will the free soul of man at its greatest understanding and obeying the laws it can then and then only maintain true liberty for there is to the highest that law as absolute as anymore absolute than anythe law of liberty the shallow as intimated consider liberty a release from all law from every constraint the wise see in it on the contrary the potent law of laws namely the fusion and combination of the conscious will or partial individual law with those universal eternal unconscious ones which run through all time pervade history prove immortality give moral purpose to the entire objective world and the last dignity to human life   bookclassesamericas literature  for certain purposes literary productions through all the recorded ages may be roughly divided into two classes the first consisting of only a score or two perhaps less of typical primal representative works different from any before and embodying in themselves their own main laws and reasons for being then the second class books and writings innumerable incessantto be briefly described as radiations or offshoots or more or less imitations of the first the works of the first class as said have their own laws and may indeed be described as making those laws and amenable only to them the sharp warning of margaret fuller unquelld for thirty years yet sounds in the air it does not follow that because the united states print and read more books magazines and newspapers than all the rest of the world that they really have therefore a literature   our real culmination  the final culmination of this vast and varied republic will be the production and perennial establishment of millions of comfortable city homesteads and moderatesized farms healthy and independent single separate ownership fee simple life in them complete but cheap within reach of all exceptional wealth splendor countless manufactures excess of exports immense capital and capitalists the fivedollaraday hotels well filld artificial improvements even books colleges and the suffrageall in many respects in themselves hard as it is to say so and sharp as a surgeons lance form more or less a sort of antidemocratic disease and monstrosity except as they contribute by curious indirections to that culminationseem to me mainly of value or worth consideration only with reference to it  there is a subtle something in the common earth crops cattle air trees c and in having to do at first hand with them that forms the only purifying and perennial element for individuals and for society i must confess i want to see the agricultural occupation of america at first hand permanently broadend its gains are the only ones on which god seems to smile what otherswhat business profit wealth without a taint what fortune elsewhat dollardoes not stand for and come from more or less imposition lying unnaturalness   an american problem  one of the problems presented in america these times is how to combine ones duty and policy as a member of associations societies brotherhoods or what not and ones obligations to the state and nation with essential freedom as an individual personality without which freedom a man cannot grow or expand or be full modern heroic democratic american with all the necessities and benefits of association and the world cannot get along without it the true nobility and satisfaction of a man consist in his thinking and acting for himself the problem i say is to combine the two so as not to ignore either   the last collective compaction  i like well our polyglot constructionstamp and the retention thereof in the broad the

fact  tingalinglingling went the little bell on the teachers desk of a villageschool one morning when the studies of the earlier part of the day were about half completed it was well understood that this was a command for silence and attention and when these had been obtained the master spoke he was a low thickset man and his name was lugare  boys said he i have had a complaint enterd that last night some of you were stealing fruit from mr nicholss garden i rather think i know the thief tim barker step up here sir  the one to whom he spoke came forward he was a slight fairlooking boy of about thirteen and his face had a laughing goodhumord expression which even the charge now preferrd against him and the stern tone and threatening look of the teacher had not entirely dissipated the countenance of the boy however was too unearthly fair for health it had notwithstanding its fleshy cheerful look a singular cast as if some inward disease and that a fearful one were seated within as the stripling stood before that place of judgmentthat place so often made the scene of heartless and coarse brutality of timid innocence confused helpless childhood outraged and gentle feelings crush dlugare looked on him with a frown which plainly told that he felt in no very pleasant mood happily a worthier and more philosophical system is proving to men that schools can be better governd than by lashes and tears and sighs we are waxing toward that consummation when one of the oldfashiond schoolmasters with his cowhide his heavy birchrod and his many ingenious methods of childtorture will be gazed upon as a scornd memento of an ignorant cruel and exploded doctrine may propitious gales speed that day  were you by mr nicholss gardenfence last night said lugare  yes sir answerd the boy i was  well sir im glad to find you so ready with your confession and so you thought you could do a little robbing and enjoy yourself in a manner you ought to be ashamed to own without being punishd did you  i have not been robbing replied the boy quickly his face was suffused whether with resentment or fright it was difficult to tell and i didnt do anything last night that i am ashamed to own  no impudence exclaimd the teacher passionately as he graspd a long and heavy ratan give me none of your sharp speeches or ill thrash you till you beg like a dog  the youngsters face paled a little his lip quiverd but he did not speak  and pray sir continued lugare as the outward signs of wrath disappeard from his features what were you about the garden for perhaps you only receivd the plunder and had an accomplice to do the more dangerous part of the job  i went that way because it is on my road home i was there again afterwards to meet an acquaintance andandbut i did not go into the garden nor take anything away from it i would not stealhardly to save myself from starving  you had better have stuck to that last evening you were seen tim barker to come from under mr nicholss gardenfence a little after nine oclock with a bag full of something or other over your shoulders the bag had every appearance of being filled with fruit and this morning the melonbeds are found to have been completely cleard now sir what was there in that bag  like fire itself glowd the face of the detected lad he spoke not a word all the school had their eyes directed at him the perspiration ran down his white forehead like raindrops  speak sir exclaimed lugare with a loud strike of his ratan on the desk  the boy lookd as though he would faint but the unmerciful teacher confident of having brought to light a criminal and exulting in the idea of the severe chastisement he should now be justified in inflicting kept working himself up to a still greater and greater degree of passion in the meantime the child seemd hardly to know what to do with himself his tongue cleavd to the roof of his mouth either he was very much frightend or he was actually unwell  speak i say again thunderd lugare and his hand grasping his ratan towerd above his head in a very significant manner  i hardly can sir said the poor fellow faintly his voice was husky and thick i will tell you somesome other time please let me go to my seati ant well  oh yes thats very likely and mr lugare bulged out his nose and cheeks with contempt do you think to make me believe your lies ive found you out sir plainly enough and i am satisfied that you are as precious a little villain as there is in the state but i will postpone settling with you for an hour yet i shall then call you up again and if you dont tell the whole truth then i will give you something thatll make you remember mr nicholss melons for many a month to comego to your seat  glad enough of the ungracious permission and answering not a sound the child crept tremblingly to his bench he felt very strangely dizzilymore as if he was in a dream than in real life and laying his arms on his desk bowd down his face between them the pupils turnd to their accustomd studies for during the reign of lugare in the villageschool they had been so used to scenes of violence and severe chastisement that such things made but little interruption in the tenor of their way  now while the intervening hour is passing we will clear up the mystery of the bag and of young barker being under the garden fence on the preceding night the boys mother was a widow and they both had to live in the very narrowest limits his father had died when he was six years old and little tim was left a sickly emaciated infant whom no one expected to live many months to the surprise of all however the poor child kept alive and seemd to recover his health as he certainly did his size and good looks this was owing to the kind offices of an eminent physician who had a countryseat in the neighborhood and who had been interested in the widows little family tim the physician said might possibly outgrow his disease but everything was uncertain it was a mysterious and baffling malady and it would not be wonderful if he should in some moment of apparent health be suddenly taken away the poor widow was at first in a continual state of uneasiness but several years had now passd and none of the impending evils had fallen upon the boys head his mother seemd to feel confident that he would live and be a help and an honor to her old age and the two struggled on together mutually happy in each other and enduring much of poverty and discomfort without repining each for the others sake  tims pleasant disposition had made him many friends in the village and among the rest a young fanner named jones who with his elder brother workd a large farm in the neighborhood on shares jones very frequently made tim a present of a bag of potatoes or corn or some garden vegetables which he took from his own stock but as his partner was a parsimonious hightempered man and had often said that tim was an idle fellow and ought not to be helpd because he did not work jones generally made his gifts in such a manner that no one knew anything about them except himself and the grateful objects of his kindness it might be too that the widow was both to have it understood by the neighbors that she received food from anyone for there is often an excusable pride in people of her condition which makes them shrink from being considerd as objects of charity as they would from the severest pains on the night in question tim had been told that jones would send them a bag of potatoes and the place at which they were to be waiting for him was fixed at mr nicholss gardenfence it was this bag that tim had been seen staggering under and which caused the unlucky boy to be accused and convicted by his teacher as a thief that teacher was one little fitted for his important and responsible office hasty to decide and inflexibly severe he was the terror of the little world he ruled so despotically punishment he seemed to delight in knowing little of those sweet fountains which in childrens breasts ever open quickly at the call of gentleness and kind words he was feard by all for his sternness and loved by none i would that he were an isolated instance in his profession  the hour of grace had drawn to its close and the time approachd at which it was usual for lugare to give his school a joyfullyreceivd dismission now and then one of the scholars would direct a furtive glance at tim sometimes in pity sometimes in indifference or inquiry they knew that he would have no mercy shown him and though most of them loved him whipping was too common there to exact much sympathy every inquiring glance however remaind unsatisfied for at the end of the hour tim remaind with his face completely hidden and his head bowd in his arms precisely as he had leand himself when he first went to his seat lugare lookd at the boy occasionally with a scowl which seemd to bode vengeance for his sullenness at length the last class had been heard and the last lesson recited and lugare seated himself behind his desk on the platform with his longest and stoutest ratan before him  now barker he said well settle that little business of yours just step up here  tim did not move the schoolroom was as still as the grave not a sound was to be heard except occasionally a longdrawn breath  mind me sir or it will be the worse for you step up here and take off your jacket  the boy did not stir any more than if he had been of wood lugare shook with passion he sat still a minute as if considering the best way to wreak his vengeance that minute passed in deathlike silence was a fearful one to some of the children for their faces whitend with fright it seemd as it slowly droppd away like the minute which precedes the climax of an exquisitelyperformed tragedy when some mighty master of the histrionic art is treading the stage and you and the multitude around you are waiting with stretchd nerves and suspended breath in expectation of the terrible catastrophe  tim is asleep sir at length said one of the boys who sat near him lugare at this intelligence allowd his features to relax from their expression of savage anger into a smile but that smile lookd more malignant if possible than his former scowls it might be that he felt amused at the horror depicted on the faces of those about him or it might be that he was gloating in pleasure on the way in which he intended to wake the slumberer  asleep are you my young gentleman said he let us see if we cant find something to tickle your eyes open theres nothing like making the best of a bad case boys tim here is determind not to be worried in his mind about a little flogging for the thought of it cant even keep the little scoundrel awake  lugare smiled again as he made the last observation he graspd his ratan firmly and descended from his seat with light and stealthy steps he crossd the room and stood by the unlucky sleeper the boy was still as unconscious of his impending punishment as ever he might be dreaming some golden dream of youth and pleasure perhaps he was far away in the world of fancy seeing scenes and feeling delights which cold reality never can bestow lugare lifted his ratan high over his head and with the true and expert aim which he had acquired by long practice brought it down on tims back with a force and whacking sound which seemd sufficient to wake a freezing man in his last lethargy quick and fast blow foliowd blow without waiting to see the effect of the first cut the brutal wretch plied his instrument of torture first on one side of the boys back and then on the other and only stopped at the end of two or three minutes from very weariness but still tim showd no signs of motion and as lugare provoked at his torpidity jerkd away one of the childs arms on which he had been leaning over the desk his head droppd down on the board with a dull sound and his face lay turnd up and exposed to view when lugare saw it he stood like one transfixd by a basilisk his countenance turnd to a leaden whiteness the ratan droppd from his grasp and his eyes stretchd wide open glared as at some monstrous spectacle of horror and death the sweat started in great globules seemingly from every pore in his face his skinny lips contracted and showd his teeth and when he at length stretchd forth his arm and with the end of one of his fingers touchd the childs cheek each limb quiverd like the tongue of a snake and his strength seemed as though it would momentarily fail him the boy was dead he had probably been so for some time for his eyes were turnd up and his body was quite cold death was in the schoolroom and lugare had been flogging a corpse  democratic review august 1841   one wicked impulse  that section of nassau street which runs into the great mart of new york brokers and stockjobbers has for a long time been much occupied by practitioners of the law tolerably wellknown amid this class some years since was adam covert a middleaged man of rather limited means who to tell the truth gained more by trickery than he did in the legitimate and honorable exercise of his profession he was a tall biliousfaced widower the father of two children and had lately been seeking to better his fortunes by a rich marriage but somehow or other his wooing did not seem to thrive well and with perhaps one exception the lawyers prospects in the matrimonial way were hopelessly gloomy  among the early clients of mr covert had been a distant relative named marsh who dying somewhat suddenly left his son and daughter and some little property to the care of covert under a will drawn out by that gentleman himself at no time caught without his eyes open the cunning lawyer aided by much sad confusion in the emergency which had caused his services to be called for and disguising his object under a cloud of technicalities inserted provisions in the will giving himself an almost arbitrary control over the property and over those for whom it was designed this control was even made to extend beyond the time when the children would arrive at mature age the son philip a spirited and hightemperd fellow had some time since passd that age esther the girl a plain and somewhat devotional young woman was in her nineteenth year  having such power over his wards covert did not scruple openly to use his advantage in pressing his claims as a suitor for esthers hand since the death of marsh the property he left which had been in real estate and was to be divided equally between the brother and sister had risen to very considerable value and esthers share was to a man in coverts situation a prize very well worth seeking all this time while really owning a respectable income the young orphans often felt the want of the smallest sum of moneyand esther on philips account was more than once driven to various contrivancesthe pawnshop sales of her own little luxuries and the like to furnish him with means  though she had frequently shown her guardian unequivocal evidence of her aversion esther continued to suffer from his persecutions until one day he proceeded farther and was more pressing than usual she possessd some of her brothers mettlesome temper and gave him an abrupt and most decided refusal with dignity she exposed the baseness of his conduct and forbade him ever again mentioning marriage to her he retorted bitterly vaunted his hold on her and philip and swore an oath that unless she became his wife they should both thenceforward become penniless losing his habitual selfcontrol in his exasperation he even added insults such as woman never receives from any one deserving the name of man and at his own convenience left the house that day philip returnd to new york after an absence of several weeks on the business of a mercantile house in whose employment he had lately engaged  toward the latter part of the same afternoon mr covert was sitting in his office in nassau street busily at work when a knock at the door announcd a visitor and directly afterward young marsh enterd the room his face exhibited a peculiar pallid appearance that did not strike covert at all agreeably and he calld his clerk from an adjoining room and gave him something to do at a desk near by  i wish to see you alone mr covert if convenient said the newcomer  we can talk quite well enough where we are answerd the lawyer indeed i dont know that i have any leisure to talk at all for just now i am very much pressd with business  but i must speak to you rejoined philip sternly at least i must say one thing and that is mr covert that you are a villain  insolent exclaimed the lawyer rising behind the table and pointing to the door do you see that sir let one minute longer find you the other side or your feet may reach the landing by quicker method begone sir  such a threat was the more harsh to philip for he had rather highstrung feelings of honor he grew almost livid with suppressd agitation  i will see you again very soon said he in a low but distinct manner his lips trembling as he spoke and left the office  the incidents of the rest of that pleasant summer day left little impression on the young mans mind he roamd to and fro without any object or destination along south street and by whitehall he watchd with curious eyes the movements of the shipping and the loading and unloading of cargoes and listend to the merry heaveyo of the sailors and stevedores there are some minds upon which great excitement produces the singular effect of uniting two utterly inconsistent facultiesa sort of cold apathy and a sharp sensitiveness to all that is going on at the same time philips was one of this sort he noticed the various differences in the apparel of a gang of wharflaborersturnd over in his brain whether they receivd wages enough to keep them comfortable and their families alsoand if they had families or not which he tried to tell by their looks in such petty reflections the daylight passed away and all the while the master wish of philips thoughts was a desire to see the lawyer covert for what purpose he himself was by no means clear  nightfall came at last still however the young man did not direct his steps homeward he felt more calm however and entering an eating house orderd something for his supper which when it was brought to him he merely tasted and strolld forth again there was a kind of gnawing sensation of thirst within him yet and as he passd a hotel he bethought him that one little glass of spirits would perhaps be just the thing he drank and hour after hour wore away unconsciously he drank not one glass but three or four and strong glasses they were to him for he was habitually abstemious  it had been a hot day and evening and when philip at an advanced period of the night emerged from the barroom into the street he found that a thunderstorm had just commenced he resolutely walkd on however although at every step it grew more and more blustering  the rain now pourd down a cataract the shops were all shut few of the street lamps were lighted and there was little except the frequent flashes of lightning to show him his way when about half the length of chatham street which lay in the direction he had to take the momentary fury of the tempest forced him to turn aside into a sort of shelter formd by the corners of the deep entrance to a jew pawnbrokers shop there he had hardly drawn himself in as closely as possible when the lightning revealed to him that the opposite corner of the nook was tenanted also  a sharp rain this said the other occupant who simultaneously beheld philip  the voice sounded to the young mans ears a note which almost made him sober again it was certainly the voice of adam covert he made some commonplace reply and waited for another flash of lightning to show him the strangers face it came and he saw that his companion was indeed his guardian  philip marsh had drank deeplylet us plead all that may be possible to you stern moralist upon his mind came swarming and he could not drive them away thoughts of all those insults his sister had told him of and the bitter words covert had spoken to her he reflected too on the injuries esther as well as himself had receivd and were still likely to receive at the hands of that bold bad man how mean selfish and unprincipled was his characterwhat base and cruel advantages he had taken of many poor people entangled in his power and of how much wrong and suffering he had been the author and might be again through future years the very turmoil of the elements the harsh roll of the thunder the vindictive beating of the rain and the fierce glare of the wild fluid that seemd to riot in the ferocity of the storm around him kindled a strange sympathetic fury in the young mans mind heaven itself so deranged were his imaginations appeard to have provided a fitting scene and time for a deed of retribution which to his disorderd passion half wore the semblance of a divine justice he rememberd not the ready solution to be found in coverts pressure of business which had no doubt kept him later than usual but fancied some mysterious intent in the ordaining that he should be there and that they two should meet at that untimely hour all this whirl of influence came over philip with startling quickness at that horrid moment he steppd to the side of his guardian  ho said he have we met so soon mr covert you traitor to my dead fatherrobber of his children i fear to think on what i think now  the lawyers natural effrontery did not desert him  unless youd like to spend a night in the watchhouse young gentleman said he after a short pause move on your father was a weak man i remember as for his son his own wicked heart is his worst foe i have never done wrong to eitherthat i can say and swear it  insolent liar exclaimed philip his eye flashing out sparks of fire in the darkness  covert made no reply except a cool contemptuous laugh which stung the excited young man to double fury he sprang upon the lawyer and clutchd him by the neckcloth  take it then he cried hoarsely for his throat was impeded by the fiendish rage which in that black hour possessd him you are not fit to live  he draggd his guardian to the earth and fell crushingly upon him choking the shriek the poor victim but just began to utter then with monstrous imprecations he twisted a tight knot around the gasping creatures neck drew a clasp knife from his pocket and touching the spring the long sharp blade too eager for its bloody work flew open  during the lull of the storm the last strength of the prostrate man burst forth into one short loud cry of agony at the same instant the arm of the murderer thrust the blade once twice thrice deep in his enemys bosom not a minute had passed since that fatal exasperating laughbut the deed was done and the instinctive thought which came at once to the guilty one was a thought of fear and escape  in the unearthly pause which followd philips eyes gave one long searching sweep in every direction above and around him above god of the allseeing eye what and who was that figure there  forbear in jehovahs name forbear cried a shrill but clear and melodious voice  it was as if some accusing spirit had come down to bear witness against the deed of blood leaning far out of an open window appear d a white draperied shape its face possessd of a wonderful youthful beauty long vivid glows of lightning gave philip a full opportunity to see as clearly as though the sun had been shining at noonday one hand of the figure was raised upward in a deprecating attitude and his large bright black eyes bent down upon the scene below with an expression of horror and shrinking pain such heavenly looks and the peculiar circumstance of the time filld philips heart with awe  oh if it is not yet too late spoke the youth again spare him in gods voice i command thou shalt do no murder  the words rang like a knell in the ear of the terrorstricken and already remorseful philip springing from the body he gave a second glance up and down the walk which was totally lonesome and deserted then crossing into reade street he made his fearful way in a half state of stupor halfbewilderment by the nearest avenues to his home  when the corpse of the murderd lawyer was found in the morning and the officers of justice commenced their inquiry suspicion immediately fell upon philip and he was arrested the most rigorous search however brought to light nothing at all implicating the young man except his visit to coverts office the evening before and his angry language there that was by no means enough to fix so heavy a charge upon him  the second day afterward the whole business came before the ordinary judicial tribunal in order that philip might be either committed for the crime or discharged the testimony of mr coverts clerk stood alone one of his employers who believing in his innocence had deserted him not in this crisis had provided him with the ablest criminal counsel in new york the proof was declared entirely insufficient and philip was discharged  the crowded courtroom made way for him as he came out hundreds of curious looks fixed upon his features and many a jibe passd upon him but of all that arena of human faces he saw only onea sad pale blackeyed one cowering in the centre of the rest he had seen that face twice beforethe first time as a warning spectrethe second time in prison immediately after his arrestnow for the last time this young strangerthe son of a scornd racecoming to the courtroom to perform an unhappy duty with the intention of testifying to what he had seen melted at the sight of philips bloodless cheek and of his sisters convulsive sobs and forbore witnessing against the murderer shall we applaud or condemn him let every reader answer the question for himself  that afternoon philip left new york his friendly employer ownd a small farm some miles up the hudson and until the excitement of the affair was over he advised the young man to go thither philip thankfully accepted the proposal made a few preparations took a hurried leave of esther and by nightfall was settled in his new abode  and how think you rested philip marsh that night rested indeed o if those who clamor so much for the halter and the scaffold to punish crime could have seen that sight they might have learnd a lesson then four days had elapsed since he that lay tossing upon the bed there had slumberd not the slightest intermission had come to his awakend and tensely strung sense during those frightful days disturbd waking dreams came to him as he thought what he might do to gain his lost peace far far away would he go the cold roll of the murderd mans eye as it turnd up its last glance into his facethe shrill exclamation of painall the unearthly vividness of the posture motions and looks of the deadthe warning voice from abovepursued him like tormenting furies and were never absent from his mind asleep or awake that long weary night anything any place to escape such horrid companionship he would travel inlandhire himself to do hard drudgery upon some farmwork incessantly through the wide summer days and thus force nature to bestow oblivion upon his senses at least a little while now and then he would fly on on on until amid different scenes and a new life the old memories were rubbd entirely out he would fight bravely in himself for peace of mind for peace he would labor and strugglefor peace he would pray  at length after a feverish slumber of some thirty or forty minutes the unhappy youth waking with a nervous start raisd himself in bed and saw the blessed daylight beginning to dawn he felt the sweat trickling down his naked breast the sheet where he had lain was quite wet with it dragging himself wearily he opend the window ah that good morning airhow it refreshd himhow he leand out and drank in the fragrance of the blossoms below and almost for the first time in his life felt how beautifully indeed god had made the earth and that there was wonderful sweetness in mere existence and amidst the thousand mute mouths and eloquent eyes which appeard as it were to look up and speak in every direction he fancied so many invitations to come among them  not without effort for he was very weak he dressd himself and issued forth into the open air  clouds of pale gold and transparent crimson draperied the eastern sky but the sun whose face gladdend them into all that glory was not yet above the horizon it was a time and place of such rare such edenlike beauty philip paused at the summit of an upward slope and gazed around him some few miles off he could see a gleam of the hudson river and above it a spur of those rugged cliffs scatterd along its western shores nearer by were cultivated fields the clover grew richly there the young grain bent to the early breeze and the air was filled with an intoxicating perfume at his side was the large wellkept garden of his host in which were many pretty flowers grass plots and a wide avenue of noble trees as philip gazed the holy calming power of naturethe invisible spirit of so much beauty and so much innocence melted into his soul the disturbd passions and the feverish conflict subsided he even felt something like envied peace of minda sort of joy even in the presence of all the unmarrd goodness it was as fair to him guilty though he had been as to the purest of the pure no accusing frowns showd in the face of the flowers or in the green shrubs or the branches of the trees they more forgiving than mankind and distinguishing not between the children of darkness and the children of lightthey at least treated him with gentleness was he then a being so accursd involuntarily he bent over a branch of red roses and took them softly between his handsthose murderous bloody hands but the red roses neither witherd nor smelld less fragiant and as the young man kissd them and droppd a tear upon them it seemd to him that he had found pity and sympathy from heaven itself  though against all the rules of storywriting we continue our narrative of these mainly true incidents for such they are no further only to say that the murderer soon departed for a new field of actionthat he is still livingand that this is but one of thousands of cases of unraveld unpunishd crimeleft not to the tribunals of man but to a wider power and judgment   the last loyalist  she came to me last night the floor gave back no tread the story i am going to tell is a traditional reminiscence of a country place in my rambles about which i have often passed the house now unoccupied and mostly in ruins that was the scene of the transaction i cannot of course convey to others that particular kind of influence which is derived from my being so familiar with the locality and with the very people whose grandfathers or fathers were contemporaries of the actors in the drama i shall transcribe i must hardly expect therefore that to those who hear it thro the medium of my pen the narration will possess as lifelike and interesting a character as it does to myself  on a large and fertile neck of land that juts out in the sound stretching to the east of new york city there stood in the latter part of the last century an oldfashiond countryresidence it had been built by one of the first settlers of this section of the new world and its occupant was originally owner of the extensive tract lying adjacent to his house and pushing into the bosom of the salt waters it was during the troubled times which markd our american revolution that the incidents occurrd which are the foundation of my story some time before the commencement of the war the owner whom i shall call vanhome was taken sick and died for some time before his death he had lived a widower and his only child a lad of ten years old was thus left an orphan by his fathers will this child was placed implicitly under the guardianship of an uncle a middleaged man who had been of late a resident in the family his care and interest however were needed but a little whilenot two years clapsd after the parents were laid away to their last repose before another grave had to be prepared for the sonthe child who had been so haplessly deprived of their fostering care  the period now arrived when the great national convulsion burst forth sounds of strife and the clash of arms and the angry voices of disputants were borne along by the air and week after week grew to still louder clamor families were divided adherents to the crown and ardent upholders of the rebellion were often found in the bosom of the same domestic circle vanhome the uncle spoken of as guardian to the young heir was a man who leand to the stern the highhanded and the severe he soon became known among the most energetic of the loyalists so decided were his sentiments that leaving the estate which he had inherited from his brother and nephew he joind the forces of the british king thenceforward whenever his old neighbors heard of him it was as being engaged in the cruelest outrages the boldest inroads or the most determind attacks upon the army of his countrymen or their peaceful settlements eight years brought the rebel states and their leaders to that glorious epoch when the last remnant of a monarchs rule was to leave their shoreswhen the last waving of the royal standard was to flutter as it should be hauld down from the staff and its place filld by the proud testimonial of our warriors success  pleasantly over the autumn fields shone the november sun when a horseman of somewhat military look plodded slowly along the road that led to the old vanhome farmhouse there was nothing peculiar in his attire unless it might be a red scarf which he wore tied round his waist he was a darkfeatured sulleneyed man and as his glance was thrown restlessly to the right and left his whole manner appeard to be that of a person moving amid familiar and accustomd scenes occasionally he stoppd and looking long and steadily at some object that attracted his attention mutterd to himself like one in whose breast busy thoughts were moving his course was evidently to the homestead itself at which in due time he arrived he dismounted led his horse to the stables and then without knocking though there were evident signs of occupancy around the building the traveler made his entrance as composedly and boldly as though he were master of the whole establishment  now the house being in a measure deserted for many years and the successful termination of the strife rendering it probable that the vanhome estate would be confiscated to the new government an aged povertystricken couple had been encouraged by the neighbors to take possession as tenants of the place their name was gills and these people the traveler found upon his entrance were likely to be his host and hostess holding their right as they did by so slight a tenure they venturd to offer no opposition when the stranger signified his intention of passing several hours there  the day wore on and the sun went down in the west still the interloper gloomy and taciturn made no signs of departing but as the evening advanced whether the darkness was congenial to his sombre thoughts or whether it merely chanced so he seemd to grow more affable and communicative and informed gills that he should pass the night there tendering him at the same time ample remuneration which the latter accepted with many thanks  tell me said he to his aged host when they were all sitting around the ample hearth at the conclusion of their evening meal tell me something to while away the hours  ah sir answered gills this is no place for new or interesting events we live here from year to year and at the end of one we find ourselves at about the same place which we filled in the beginning  can you relate nothing then rejoind the guest and a singular smile passd over his features can you say nothing about your own placethis house or its former inhabitants or former history  the old man glanced across to his wife and a look expressive of sympathetic feeling started in the face of each  it is an unfortunate story sir said gills and may cast a chill upon you instead of the pleasant feeling which it would be best to foster when in strange walls  strange walls echoed he of the red scarf and for the first time since his arrival he half laughed but it was not the laugh which comes from a mans heart  you must know sir continued gills i am myself a sort of intruder here the vanhomesthat was the name of the former residents and ownersi have never seen for when i came to these parts the last occupant had left to join the redcoat soldiery i am told that he is to sail with them for foreign lands now that the war is ended and his property almost certain to pass into other hands  as the old man went on the stranger cast down his eyes and listend with an appearance of great interest though a transient smile or a brightening of the eye would occasionally disturb the serenity of his deportment  the old owners of this place continued the whitehaired narrator were well off in the world and bore a good name among their neighbors the brother of sergeant vanhome now the only one of the name died ten or twelve years since leaving a sona child so small that the fathers willmade provision for his being brought up by his uncle whom i mentiond but now as of the british army he was a strange man this uncle disliked by all who knew him passionate vindictive and it was said very avaricious even from his childhood  well not long after the death of the parents dark stories began to be circulated about cruelty and punishment and whippings and starvation inflicted by the new master upon his nephew people who had business at the homestead would frequently when they came away relate the most fearful things of its manager and how he misused his brothers child it was half hinted that he strove to get the youngster out of the way in order that the whole estate might fall into his own hands as i told you before however nobody liked the man and perhaps they judged him too uncharitably  after things had gone on in this way for some time a countryman a laborer who was hired to do farmwork upon the place one evening observed that the little orphan vanhome was more faint and pale even than usual for he was always delicate and that is one reason why i think it possible that his death of which i am now going to tell you was but the result of his own weak constitution and nothing else the laborer slept that night at the farmhouse just before the time at which they usually retired to bed this person feeling sleepy with his days toil left the kitchen hearth and wended his way to rest in going to his place of repose he had to pass a chamberthe very chamber where you sir are to sleep tonightand there he heard the voice of the orphan child uttering halfsuppressd exclamations as if in pitiful entreaty upon stopping he heard also the tones of the elder vanhome but they were harsh and bitter the sound of blows followed as each one fell it was accompanied by a groan or shriek and so they continued for some time shockd and indignant the countryman would have burst open the door and interfered to prevent this brutal proceeding but he bethought him that he might get himself into trouble and perhaps find that he could do no good after all and so he passed on to his room  well sir the following day the child did not come out among the workpeople as usual he was taken very ill no physician was sent for until the next afternoon and though one arrived in the course of the night it was too latethe poor boy died before morning  people talkd threateningly upon the subject but nothing could be proved against vanhome at one period there were efforts made to have the whole affair investigated perhaps that would have taken place had not every ones attention been swallowd up by the rumors of difficulty and war which were then beginning to disturb the country  vanhome joined the army of the king his enemies said that he feared to be on the side of the rebels because if they were routed his property would be taken from him but events have shown that if this was indeed what he dreaded it has happend to him from the very means which he took to prevent it  the old man paused he had quite wearied himself with so long talking for some minutes there was unbroken silence presently the stranger signified his intention of retiring for the night he rose and his host took a light for the purpose of ushering him to his apartment  when gills returnd to his accustomd situation in the large armchair by the chimneyhearth his ancient helpmate had retired to rest with the simplicity of their times the bed stood in the same room where the three had been seated during the last few hours and now the remaining two talkd together about the singular events of the evening as the time wore on gills showd no disposition to leave his cosy chair but sat toasting his feet and bending over the coals gradually the insidious heat and the lateness of the hour began to exercise their influence over the old man the drowsy indolent feeling which every one has experienced in getting thoroughly heated through by close contact with a glowing fire spread in each vein and sinew and relaxd its tone he leand back in his chair and slept  for a long time his repose went on quietly and soundly he could not tell how many hours elapsed but a while after midnight the torpid senses of the slumberer were awakend by a startling shock it was a cry as of a strong man in his agonya shrill not very loud cry but fearful and creeping into the blood like cold polishd steel the old man raised himself in his seat and listend at once fully awake for a minute all was the solemn stillness of midnight then rose that horrid tone again wailing and wild and making the hearers hair to stand on end one moment more and the trampling of hasty feet sounded in the passage outside the door was thrown open and the form of the stranger more like a corpse than living man rushed into the room  all white yelld the consciencestricken creatureall white and with the graveclothes around him one shoulder was bare and i saw he whisperd i saw blue streaks upon it it was horrible and i cried aloud he steppd toward me he came to my very bedside his small hand almost touchd my face i could not bear it and fled  the miserable man bent his head down upon his bosom convulsive rattlings shook his throat and his whole frame waverd to and fro like a tree in a storm bewilderd and shockd gills lookd at his apparently deranged guest and knew not what answer to make or what course of conduct to pursue  thrusting out his arms and his extended fingers and bending down his eyes as men do when shading them from a glare of lightning the stranger staggerd from the door and in a moment further dashd madly through the passage which led through the kitchen into the outer road the old man heard the noise of his falling footsteps sounding fainter and fainter in the distance and then retreating droppd his own exhausted limbs into the chair from which he had been arousd so terribly it was many minutes before his energies recoverd their accustomed tone again strangely enough his wife unawakend by the strangers ravings still slumberd on as profoundly as ever  pass we on to a far different scenethe embarkation of the british troops for the distant land whose monarch was never more to wield the sceptre over a kingdom lost by his imprudence and tyranny with frowning brow and sullen pace the martial ranks moved on boat after boat was filled and as each discharged its complement in the ships that lay heaving their anchors in the stream it returnd and was soon filled with another load and at length it became time for the last soldier to lift his eye and take a last glance at the broad banner of englands pride which flappd its folds from the top of the highest staff on the battery  as the warning sound of a trumpet called together all who were laggardsthose taking leave of friends and those who were arranging their own private affairs left until the last momenta single horseman was seen furiously dashing down the street a red scarf tightly encircled his waist he made directly for the shore and the crowd there gatherd started back in wonderment as they beheld his disheveld appearance and ghastly face throwing himself violently from his saddle he flung the bridle over the animals neck and gave him a sharp cut with a small riding whip he made for the boat one minute later and he had been left they were pushing the keel from the landingthe stranger spranga space of two or three feet already intervenedhe struck on the gunwaleand the last soldier of king george had left the american shores   wild franks return  as the sun one august day some fifty years ago had just passd the meridian of a country town in the eastern section of long island a single traveler came up to the quaint lowroofd village tavern opend its halfdoor and enterd the common room dust coverd the clothes of the wayfarer and his brow was moist with sweat he trod in a lagging weary way though his form and features told of an age not more than nineteen or twenty years over one shoulder was slung a sailors jacket and in his hand he carried a little bundle sitting down on a rude bench he told a female who made her appearance behind the bar that he would have a glass of brandy and sugar he took off the liquor at a draught after which he lit and began to smoke a cigar with which he supplied himself from his pocketstretching out one leg and leaning his elbow down on the bench in the attitude of a man who takes an indolent lounge  do you know one richard hall that lives somewhere here among you said he  mr halls is down the lane that turns off by that big locust tree answerd the woman pointing to the direction through the open door its about half a mile from here to his house  the youth for a minute or two puffd the smoke from his mouth very leisurely in silence his manner had an air of vacant selfsufficiency rather strange in one of so few years  i wish to see mr hall he said at lengthheres a silver sixpence for any one who will carry a message to him  the folks are all away its but a short walk and your limbs are young replied the female who was not altogether pleased with the easy way of making himself at home which markd her shabbylooking customer that individual however seemd to give small attention to the hint but leand and puffd his cigarsmoke as leisurely as before  unless continued the woman catching a second glance at the sixpence unless old joe is at the stable as hes very likely to be ill go and find out for you and she pushd open a door at her back steppd through an adjoining room into a yard whence her voice was the next moment heard calling the person she had mentiond in accents by no means remarkable for their melody or softness  her search was successful she soon returnd with him who was to act as messengera little witherd ragged old mana hangeron there whose unshaven face told plainly enough the story of his intemperate habitsthose deeply seated habits now too late to be uprooted that would ere long lay him in a drunkards grave the youth informd him what the required service was and promised him the reward as soon as he should return  tell richard hall that i am going to his fathers house this afternoon if he asks who it is that wishes him here say the person sent no name continued the stranger sitting up from his indolent posture as the feet of old joe were about leaving the doorstone and his bleard eyes turned to eaten the last sentence of the mandate  and yet perhaps you may as well added he communing a moment with himself you may tell him his brother frank wild frank it is who wishes him to come  the old man departed on his errand and he who calld himself wild frank tossd his nearly smoked cigar out of the window and folded his arms in thought  no better place than this probably will occur to give a brief account of some former events in the life of the young stranger resting and waiting at the village inn fifteen miles east of that inn lived a farmer named hall a man of good repute welloff in the world and head of a large family he was fond of gainrequired all his boys to labor in proportion to their age and his right hand man if he might not be called favorite was his eldest son richard this eldest son an industrious soberfaced young fellow was invested by his father with the powers of second in command and as strict and swift obedience was a prime tenet in the farmers domestic government the children all tacitly submitted to their brothers swayall but one and that was frank the farmers wife was a quiet woman in rather tender health and though for all her offspring she had a mothers love franks kiss ever seemd sweetest to her lips she favord him more than the restperhaps as in a hundred similar instances for his being so often at fault and so often blamed in truth however he seldom receivd more blame than he deservd for he was a capricious hightemperd lad and up to all kinds of mischief from these traits he was known in the neighborhood by the name of wild frank  among the farmers stock there was a fine young blood marea beautiful creature large and graceful with eyes like darkhued jewels and her color that of the deep night it being the custom of the farmer to let his boys have something about the farm that they could call their own and take care of as such black nell as the mare was called had somehow or other fallen to franks share he was very proud of her and thought as much of her comfort as his own the elder brother however saw fit to claim for himself and several times to exercise a privilege of managing and using black nell notwithstanding what frank considerd his prerogative on one of these occasions a hot dispute arose and after much angry blood it was referrd to the farmer for settlement he decided in favor of richard and added a harsh lecture to his other son the farmer was really unjust and wild franks face paled with rage and mortification that furious temper which he had never been taught to curb now swelld like an overflowing torrent with difficulty restraining the exhibition of his passions as soon as he got by himself he swore that not another sun should roll by and find him under that roof late at night he silently arose and turning his back on what he thought an inhospitable home in mood in which the child should never leave the parental roof bent his steps toward the city  it may well be imagined that alarm and grief pervaded the whole of the family on discovering franks departure and as week after week melted away and brought no tidings of him his poor mothers heart grew wearier and wearier she spoke not much but was evidently sick in spirit nearly two years had clapsd when about a week before the incidents at the commencement of this story the farmers family were joyfully surprised by receiving a letter from the long absent son he had been to sea and was then in new york at which port his vessel had just arrived he wrote in a gay strain appeard to have lost the angry feeling which caused his flight from home and said he heard in the city that richard had married and settled several miles distant where he wished him all good luck and happiness wild frank wound up his letter by promising as soon as he could get through the imperative business of his ship to pay a visit to his parents and native place on tuesday of the succeeding week he said he would be with them  within half an hour after the departure of old joe the form of that ancient personage was seen slowly wheeling round the locusttree at the end of the lane accompanied by a stout young man in primitive homespun apparel the meeting between wild frank and his brother richard though hardly of that kind which generally takes place between persons so closely related could not exactly be calld distant or cool either richard pressd his brother to go with him to the farmhouse and refresh and repose himself for some hours at least but frank declined  they will all expect me home this afternoon he said i wrote to them i would be there today  but you must be very tired frank rejoind the other wont you let some of us harness up and carry you or if you like he stoppd a moment and a trifling suffusion spread over his face if you like ill put the saddle on black nellshes here at my place now and you can ride home like a lord  franks face colord a little too he paused for a moment in thought he was really footsore and exhausted with his journey that hot dayso he accepted his brothers offer  you know the speed of nell as well as i said richard ill warrant when i bring her here youll say shes in good order as ever so telling him to amuse himself for a few minutes as well as he could richard left the tavern  could it be that black nell knew her early master she neighd and rubbd her nose on his shoulder and as he put his foot in the stirrup and rose on her back it was evident that they were both highly pleased with their meeting bidding his brother farewell and not forgetting old joe the young man set forth on his journey to his fathers house as he left the village behind and came upon the long monotonous road before him he thought on the circumstances of his leaving homeand he thought too on his course of life how it was being frittered away and lost very gentle influences doubtless came over wild franks mind then and he yearnd to show his parents that he was sorry for the trouble he had cost them he blamed himself for his former follies and even felt remorse that he had not acted more kindly to richard and gone to his house oh it had been a sad mistake of the farmer that he did not teach his children to love one another it was a foolish thing that he prided himself on governing his little flock well when sweet affection gentle forbearance and brotherly faith were almost unknown among them  the day was now advanced though the heat pourd down with a strength little less oppressive than at noon frank had accomplishd the greater part of his journey he was within two miles of his home the road here led over a high tiresome hill and he determined to stop on the top of it and rest himself as well as give the animal he rode a few minutes breath how well he knew the place and that mighty oak standing just outside the fence on the very summit of the hill often had he reposed under its shade it would be pleasant for a few minutes to stretch his limbs there again as of old he thought to himself and he dismounted from the saddle and led black nell under the tree mindful of the comfort of his favorite he took from his little bundle which he had strapped behind him on the mares back a piece of strong cord four or five yards in length which he tied to the bridle and wound and tied the other end for security over his own wrist then throwing himself at full length upon the ground black nell was at liberty to graze around him without danger of straying away  it was a calm scene and a pleasant there was no rude soundhardly even a chirping insectto break the sleepy silence of the place the atmosphere had a dim hazy cast and was impregnated with overpowering heat the young man lay there minute after minute as time glided away unnoticed for he was very tired and his repose was sweet to him occasionally he raised himself and cast a listless look at the distant landscape veild as it was by the slight mist at length his repose was without such interruptions his eyes closed and though at first they opend languidly again at intervals after a while they shut altogether could it be that he slept it was so indeed yielding to the drowsy influences about him and to his prolongd weariness of travel he had fallen into a deep sound slumber thus he lay and black nell the original cause of his departure from his homeby a singular chance the companion of his returnquietly croppd the grass at his side  an hour nearly passd away and yet the young man slept on the light and heat were not glaring now a change had come over earth and heaven there were signs of one of those thunderstorms that in our climate spring up and pass over so quickly and so terribly masses of vapor loom d up in the horizon and a dark shadow settled on the woods and fields the leaves of the great oak rustled together over the youths head clouds flitted swiftly in the sky like bodies of armed men coming up to battle at the call of their leaders trumpet a thick raindrop fell now and then while occasionally hoarse mutterings of thunder sounded in the distance yet the slumberer was not arousd it was strange that wild frank did not awake perhaps his ocean life had taught him to rest undisturbed amid the jarring of elements though the storm was now coming on in its fury he slept like a babe in its cradle  black nell had ceased grazing and stood by her sleeping master with ears erect and her long mane and tail waving in the wind it seemd quite dark so heavy were the clouds the blast blew sweepingly the lightning flashd and the rain fell in torrents crash after crash of thunder seemd to shake the solid earth and black nell she stood now an image of beautiful terror with her fore feet thrust out her neck archd and her eyes glaring balls of fear at length after a dazzling and lurid glare there came a peala deafening crashas if the great axle was rent god of spirits the startled mare sprang off like a ship in an oceanstorm her eyes were blinded with light she dashed madly down the hill and plunge after plungefar far awayswift as an arrowdragging the hapless body of the youth behind her  in the low oldfashiond dwelling of the farmer there was a large family group the men and boys had gatherd under shelter at the approach of the storm and the subject of their talk was the return of the long absent son the mother spoke of him too and her eyes brightend with pleasure as she spoke she made all the little domestic preparationscookd his favorite dishesand arranged for him his own bed in its own old place as the tempest mounted to its fury they discussd the probability of his getting soakd by it and the provident dame had already selected some dry garments for a change but the rain was soon over and nature smiled again in her invigorated beauty the sun shone out as it was dipping in the west drops sparkled on the leaftipscoolness and clearness were in the air  the clattering of a horses hoofs came to the ears of those who were gatherd there it was on the other side of the house that the wagon road lead and they opend the door and rushd in a tumult of glad anticipations through the adjoining room to the porch what a sight it was that met them there black nell stood a few feet from the door with her neck crouchd down she drew her breath long and deep and vapor rose from every part of her reeking body and with eyes starting from their sockets and mouths agape with stupefying terror they beheld on the ground near her a mangled hideous massthe rough semblance of a human formall batterd and cut and bloody attachd to it was the fatal cord dabbled over with gore and as the mother gazedfor she could not withdraw her eyesand the appalling truth came upon her mind she sank down without shriek or utterance into a deep deathly swoon   the boy lover  listen and the old will speak a chronicle for the young ah youth thou art one day coming to be old too and let me tell thee how thou mayest get a useful lesson for an hour dream thyself old realize in thy thoughts and consciousness that vigor and strength are subdued in thy sinewsthat the color of the shroud is likend in thy very hairsthat all those leaping desires luxurious hopes beautiful aspirations and proud confidences of thy younger life have long been buried a funeral for the better part of thee in that grave which must soon close over thy tottering limbs look back then through the long track of the past years how has it been with thee are there bright beacons of happiness enjoyd and of good done by the way glimmer gentle rays of what was scatterd from a holy heart have benevolence and love and undeviating honesty left tokens on which thy eyes can rest sweetly is it well with thee thus answerest thou it is or answerest thou i see nothing but gloom and shatterd hours and the wreck of good resolves and a broken heart filled with sickness and troubled among its ruined chambers with the phantoms of many follies  o youth youth this dream will one day be a realitya reality either of heavenly peace or agonizing sorrow  and yet not for all is it decreed to attain the neighborhood of the threescore and ten yearsthe span of life i am to speak of one who died young very awkward was his childhoodbut most fragile and sensitive so delicate a nature may exist in a rough unnoticed plant let the boy resthe was not beautiful and droppd away betimes but for the causeit is a singular story to which let crusted worldlings pay the tribute of a light laughlight and empty as their own hollow hearts  love which with its cankerseed of decay within has sent young men and maidens to a longdfor but too premature burial love the childmonarch that death itself cannot conquer that has its tokens on slabs at the head of grasscoverd tombstokens more visible to the eye of the stranger yet not so deeply graven as the face and the remembrances cut upon the heart of the living love the sweet the pure the innocent yet the causer of fierce hate of wishes for deadly revenge of bloody deeds and madness and the horrors of hell love that wanders over battlefields turning up mangled human trunks and parting back the hair from gory faces and daring the points of swords and the thunder of artillery without a fear or a thought of danger  words words i begin to see i am indeed an old man and garrulous let me go backyes i see it must be many years  it was at the close of the last century i was at that time studying law the profession my father followd one of his clients was an elderly widow a foreigner who kept a little alehouse on the banks of the north river at about two miles from what is now the centre of the city then the spot was quite out of town and surrounded by fields and green trees the widow often invited me to come and pay her a visit when i had a leisure afternoonincluding also in the invitation my brother and two other students who were in my fathers office matthew the brother i mention was a boy of sixteen he was troubled with an inward illnessthough it had no power over his temper which ever retain d the most admirable placidity and gentleness  he was cheerful but never boisterous and everybody loved him his mind seemd more developd than is usual for his age though his personal appearance was exceedingly plain wheaton and brown the names of the other students were spirited clever young fellows with most of the traits that those in their position of life generally possess the first was as generous and brave as any man i ever knew he was very passionate too but the whirlwind soon blew over and left everything quiet again frank brown was slim graceful and handsome he professd to be fond of sentiment and used to fall regularly in love once a month  the half of every wednesday we four youths had to ourselves and were in the habit of taking a sail a ride or a walk together one of these afternoons of a pleasant day in april the sun shining and the air clear i bethought myself of the widow and her beerabout which latter article i had made inquiries and heard it spoken of in terms of high commendation i mentiond the matter to matthew and to my fellowstudents and we agreed to fill up our holiday by a jaunt to the alehouse accordingly we set forth and after a fine walk arrived in glorious spirits at our destination  ah how shall i describe the quiet beauties of the spot with its long low piazza looking out upon the river and its clean homely tables and the tankards of real silver in which the ale was given us and the flavor of that excellent liquor itself there was the widow and there was a sober stately old woman half companion half servant margery by name and there was good god my fingers quiver yet as i write the word young ninon the daughter of the widow  o through the years that live no more my memory strays back and that whole scene comes up before me once againand the brightest part of the picture is the strange ethereal beauty of that young girl she was apparently about the age of my brother matthew and the most fascinating artless creature i had ever beheld she had blue eyes and light hair and an expression of childish simplicity which was charming indeed i have no doubt that ere half an hour had elapsed from the time we enterd the tavern and saw ninon every one of the four of us loved the girl to the very depth of passion  we neither spent so much money nor drank as much beer as we had intended before starting from home the widow was very civil being pleased to see us and margery served our wants with a deal of politenessbut it was to ninon that the afternoons pleasure was attributable for though we were strangers we became acquainted at oncethe manners of the girl merry as she was putting entirely out of view the most distant imputation of indecorumand the presence of the widow and margery for we were all in the common room together there being no other company serving to make us all disembarrassd and at ease  it was not until quite a while after sunset that we started on our return to the city we made several attempts to revive the mirth and lively talk that usually signalized our rambles but they seemd forced and discordant like laughter in a sickroom my brother was the only one who preserved his usual tenor of temper and conduct  i need hardly say that thenceforward every wednesday afternoon was spent at the widows tavern strangely neither matthew or my two friends or myself spoke to each other of the sentiment that filled us in reference to ninon yet we all knew the thoughts and feelings of the others and each perhaps felt confident that his love alone was unsuspected by his companions  the story of the widow was a touching yet simple one she was by birth a swiss in one of the cantons of her native land she had grown up and married and lived for a time in happy comfort a son was born to her and a daughter the beautiful ninon by some reverse of fortune the father and head of the family had the greater portion of his possessions swept from him he struggled for a time against the evil influence but it pressd upon him harder and harder he had heard of a people in the western worlda new and swarming landwhere the stranger was welcomd and peace and the protection of the strong arm thrown around him he had not heart to stay and struggle amid the scenes of his former prosperity and he determind to go and make his home in that distant republic of the west so with his wife and children and the proceeds of what little property was left he took passage for new york he was never to reach his journeys end either the cares that weigh d upon his mind or some other cause consignd him to a sick hammock from which he only found relief through the great dismisser he was buried in the sea and in due time his family arrived at the american emporium but there the son too sickenddied ere long and was buried likewise they would not bury him in the city but awayby the solitary banks of the hudson on which the widow soon afterwards took up her abode  ninon was too young to feel much grief at these sad occurrences and the mother whatever she might have sufferd inwardly had a good deal of phlegm and patience and set about making herself and her remaining child as comfortable as might be they had still a respectable sum in cash and after due deliberation the widow purchasd the little quiet tavern not far from the grave of her boy and of sundays and holidays she took in considerable moneyenough to make a decent support for them in their humble way of living french and germans visited the house frequently and quite a number of young americans too probably the greatest attraction to the latter was the sweet face of ninon  spring passed and summer crept in and wasted away and autumn had arrived every new yorker knows what delicious weather we have in these regions of the early october days how calm clear and divested of sultriness is the air and how decently nature seems preparing for her winter sleep  thus it was the last wednesday we started on our accustomed excursion six months had elapsed since our first visit and as then we were full of the exuberance of young and joyful hearts frequent and hearty were our jokes by no means particular about the theme or the method and long and loud the peals of laughter that rang over the fields or along the shore  we took our seats round the same clean white table and received our favorite beverage in the same bright tankards they were set before us by the sober margery no one else being visible as frequently happend we were the only company walking and breathing the keen fine air had made us dry and we soon draind the foaming vessels and calld for more i remember well an animated chat we had about some poems that had just made their appearance from a great british author and were creating quite a public stir there was one a tale of passion and despair which wheaton had read and of which he gave us a transcript wild startling and dreamy perhaps it threw over our minds its peculiar cast an hour moved off and we began to think it strange that neither ninon or the widow came into the room one of us gave a hint to that effect to margery but she made no answer and went on in her usual way as before  the grim old thing said wheaton if she were in spain theyd make her a premier duenna  i askd the woman about ninon and the widow she seemed disturbd i thought but making no reply to the first part of my question said that her mistress was in another part of the house and did not wish to be with company  then be kind enough mrs vinegar resumed wheaton goodnaturedly be kind enough to go and ask the widow if we can see ninon  our attendants face turnd as pale as ashes and she precipitately left the apartment we laughd at her agitation which frank brown assigned to our merry ridicule  quite a quarter of an hour elapsd before margerys return when she appeard she told us briefly that the widow had bidden her obey our behest and now if we desired she would conduct us to the daughters presence there was a singular expression in the womans eyes and the whole affair began to strike us as somewhat odd but we arose and taking our caps followd her as she steppd through the door back of the house were some fields and a path leading into clumps of trees at some thirty rods distant from the tavern nigh one of those clumps the larger tree whereof was a willow margery stoppd and pausing a minute while we came up spoke in tones calm and low  ninon is there  she pointed downward with her finger great god there was a grave new made and with the sods loosely joind and a rough brown stone at each extremity some earth yet lay upon the grass near by if we had lookd we might have seen the restingplace of the widows son ninons brotherfor it was close at hand but amid the whole scene our eyes took in nothing except that horrible covering of deaththe ovenshaped mound my sight seemed to waver my head felt dizzy and a feeling of deadly sickness came over me i heard a stifled exclamation and looking round saw frank brown leaning against the nearest tree great sweat upon his forehead and his cheeks bloodless as chalk wheaton gave way to his agony more fully than ever i had known a man before he had fallensobbing like a child and wringing his hands it is impossible to describe the suddenness and fearfulness of the sickening truth that came upon us like a stroke of thunder  of all of us my brother matthew neither shed tears or turned pale or fainted or exposed any other evidence of inward depth of pain his quiet pleasant voice was indeed a tone lower but it was that which recalld us after the lapse of many long minutes to ourselves  so the girl had died and been buried we were told of an illness that had seized her the very day after our last preceding visit but we inquired not into the particulars  and now come i to the conclusion of my story and to the most singular part of it the evening of the third day afterward wheaton who had wept scalding tears and brown whose cheeks had recovered their color and myself that for an hour thought my heart would never rebound again from the fearful shockthat evening i say we three were seated around a table in another tavern drinking other beer and laughing but a little less cheerfully and as though we had never known the widow or her daughterneither of whom i venture to affirm came into our minds once the whole night or but to be dismissd again carelessly like the remembrance of faces seen in a crowd  strange are the contradictions of the things of life the seventh day after that dreadful visit saw my brother matthewthe delicate one who while bold men writhed in torture had kept the same placid face and the same untrembling fingershim that seventh day saw a claycold corpse carried to the repose of the churchyard the shaft rankling far down and within wrought a poison too great for show and the youth died   the child and the profligate  just after sunset one evening in summerthat pleasant hour when the air is balmy the light loses its glare and all around is imbued with soothing quieton the doorstep of a house there sat an elderly woman waiting the arrival of her son the house was in a straggling village some fifty miles from new york city she who sat on the doorstep was a widow her white cap coverd locks of gray and her dress though clean was exceedingly homely her housefor the tenement she occupied was her ownwas very little and very old trees clustered around it so thickly as almost to hide its colorthat blackish gray color which belongs to old wooden houses that have never been painted and to get in it you had to enter a little rickety gate and walk through a short path borderd by carrot beds and beets and other vegetables the son whom she was expecting was her only child about a year before he had been bound apprentice to a rich farmer in the place and after finishing his daily task he was in the habit of spending half an hour at his mothers on the present occasion the shadows of night had settled heavily before the youth made his appearance when he did his walk was slow and dragging and all his motions were languid as if from great weariness he opend the gate came through the path and sat down by his mother in silence  you are sullen tonight charley said the widow after a moments pause when she found that he return d no answer to her greeting  as she spoke she put her hand fondly on his head it seemd moist as if it had been dippd in the water his shirt too was soakd and as she passd her fingers down his shoulder she left a sharp twinge in her heart for she knew that moisture to be the hard wrung sweat of severe toil exacted from her young child he was but thirteen years old by an unyielding taskmaster  you have workd hard today my son  ive been mowing  the widows heart felt another pang  not all day charley she said in a low voice and there was a slight quiver in it  yes mother all day replied the boy mr ellis said he couldnt afford to hire men for wages are so high ive swung the scythe ever since an hour before sunrise feel of my hands  there were blisters on them like great lumps tears started in the widows eyes she dared not trust herself with a reply though her heart was bursting with the thought that she could not better his condition there was no earthly means of support on which she had dependence enough to encourage her child in the wish she knew he was formingthe wish not utterd for the first timeto be freed from his bondage mother at length said the boy i can stand it no longer i cannot and will not stay at mr elliss ever since the day i first went into his house ive been a slave and if i have to work so much longer i know i shall run off and go to sea or somewhere else id as leave be in my grave as there and the child burst into a passionate fit of weeping  his mother was silent for she was in deep grief herself after some minutes had flown however she gatherd sufficient selfpossession to speak to her son in a soothing tone endeavoring to win him from his sorrows and cheer up his heart she told him that time was swiftthat in the course of a few years he would be his own masterthat all people have their troubleswith many other ready arguments which though they had little effect in calming her own distress she hoped would act as a solace to the disturbd temper of the boy and as the half hour to which he was limited had now elapsd she took him by the hand and led him to the gate to set forth on his return the youth seemed pacified though occasionally one of those convulsive sighs that remain after a fit of weeping would break from his throat at the gate he threw his arms about his mothers neck each pressd a long kiss on the lips of the other and the youngster bent his steps towards his masters house  as her child passd out of sight the widow returnd shut the gate and enterd her lonely room there was no light in the old cottage that nightthe heart of its occupant was dark and cheerless love agony and grief and tears and convulsive wrestlings were there the thought of a beloved son condemned to laborlabor that would break down a manstruggling from day to day under the hard rule of a soulless goldworshipper the knowledge that years must pass thus the sickening idea of her own poverty and of living mainly on the grudged charity of neighborsthoughts too of former happy daysthese rackd the widows heart and made her bed a sleepless one without repose  the boy bent his steps to his employers as has been said in his way down the village street he had to pass a public house the only one the place containd and when he came off against it he heard the sound of a fiddledrownd however at intervals by much laughter and talking the windows were up and the house standing close to the road charles thought it no harm to take a look and see what was going on within half a dozen footsteps brought him to the low casement on which he leand his elbow and where he had a full view of the room and its occupants in one corner was an old man known in the village as black davehe it was whose musical performances had a moment before drawn charless attention to the tavern and he it was who now exerted himself in a violent manner to give with divers flourishes and extra twangs a tune very popular among that thicklippd race whose fondness for melody is so well known in the middle of the room were five or six sailors some of them quite drunk and others in the earlier stages of that process while on benches around were more sailors and here and there a person dressd in landsmans attire the men in the middle of the room were dancing that is they were going through certain contortions and shufflings varied occasionally by exceeding hearty stamps upon the sanded floor in short the whole party were engaged in a drunken frolic which was in no respect different from a thousand other drunken frolics except perhaps that there was less than the ordinary amount of anger and quarreling indeed everyone seem d in remarkably good humor  but what excited the boys attention more than any other object was an individual seated on one of the benches opposite who though evidently enjoying the spree as much as if he were an old hand at such business seem d in every other particular to be far out of his element his appearance was youthful he might have been twentyone or two years old his countenance was intelligent and had the air of city life and society he was dressd not gaudily but in every respect fashionably his coat being of the finest broadcloth his linen delicate and spotless as snow and his whole aspect that of one whose counterpart may now and then be seen upon the pave in broadway of a fine afternoon he laughd and talkd with the rest and it must be confessd his jokeslike the most of those that passd current therewere by no means distinguishd for their refinement or purity near the door was a small table coverd with decanters and glasses some of which had been used but were used again indiscriminately and a box of very thick and very long cigars  one of the sailorsand it was he who made the largest share of the hubbubhad but one eye his chin and cheeks were coverd with huge bushy whiskers and altogether he had quite a brutal appearance come boys said this gentleman come let us take a drink i know youre all a getting dry and he clenchd his invitation with an appalling oath this politeness was responded to by a general moving of the company toward the table holding the beforementiond decanters and glasses clustering there around each one helpd himself to a very handsome portion of that particular liquor which suited his fancy and steadiness and accuracy being at that moment by no means distinguishing traits of the arms and legs of the party a goodly amount of the fluid was spilld upon the floor this piece of extravagance excited the ire of the personage who gave the treat and that ire was still further increasd when he discoverd two or three loiterers who seemd disposed to slight his request to drink charles as we have before mentiond was looking in at the window  walk up boys walk up if there be any skulker among us blast my eyes if he shant go down on his marrow bones and taste the liquor we have spilt hallo he exclaimd as he spied charles hallo you chap in the window come here and take a sup  as he spoke he steppd to the open casement put his brawny hands under the boys arms and lifted him into the room bodily  there my lads said he turning to his companions theres a new recruit for you not so coarse a one either he added as he took a fair view of the boy who though not what is called pretty was fresh and manly looking and large for his age  come youngster take a glass he continued and he pourd one nearly full of strong brandy  now charles was not exactly frightend for he was a lively fellow and had often been at the country merrymakings and at the parties of the place but he was certainly rather abashd at his abrupt introduction to the midst of strangers so putting the glass aside he lookd up with a pleasant smile in his new acquaintances face  ive no need for anything now he said but im just as much obliged to you as if i was  poh man drink it down rejoind the sailor drink it downit wont hurt you  and by way of showing its excellence the oneeyed worthy draind it himself to the last drop then filling it again he renewd his efforts to make the lad go through the same operation  ive no occasion besides my mother has often prayd me not to drink and i promised to obey her  a little irritated by his continued refusal the sailor with a loud oath declared that charles should swallow the brandy whether he would or no placing one of his tremendous paws on the back of the boys head with the other he thrust the edge of the glass to his lips swearing at the same time that if he shook it so as to spill its contents the consequences would be of a nature by no means agreeable to his back and shoulders disliking the liquor and angry at the attempt to overbear him the undaunted child lifted his hand and struck the arm of the sailor with a blow so sudden that the glass fell and was smashd to pieces on the floor while the brandy was about equally divided between the face of charles the clothes of the sailor and the sand by this time the whole of the company had their attention drawn to the scene some of them laughd when they saw charless undisguised antipathy to the drink but they laughd still more heartily when he discomfited the sailor all of them however were content to let the matter go as chance would have itall but the young man of the black coat who has been spoken of  what was there in the words which charles had spoken that carried the mind of the young man back to former timesto a period when he was more pure and innocent than now my mother has often prayd me not to drink ah how the mist of months rolld aside and presented to his souls eye the picture of his mother and a prayer of exactly similar purport why was it too that the young mans heart moved with a feeling of kindness toward the harshly treated child  charles stood his cheek flushd and his heart throbbing wiping the trickling drops from his face with a handkerchief at first the sailor between his drunkenness and his surprise was much in the condition of one suddenly awakend out of a deep sleep who cannot call his consciousness about him when he saw the state of things however and heard the jeering laugh of his companions his dull eye lighting up with anger fell upon the boy who had withstood him he seized charles with a grip of iron and with the side of his heavy boot gave him a sharp and solid kick he was about repeating the performancefor the child hung like a rag in his graspbut all of a sudden his ears rang as if pistols were snappd close to them lights of various hues flickerd in his eye he had but one it will be rememberd and a strong propelling power caused him to move from his position and keep moving until he was brought up by the wall a blow a cuff given in such a scientific manner that the hand from which it proceeded was evidently no stranger to the pugilistic art had been suddenly planted in the ear of the sailor it was planted by the young man of the black coat he had watchd with interest the proceeding of the sailor and the boytwo or three times he was on the point of interfering but when the kick was given his rage was uncontrollable he sprang from his seat in the attitude of a boxerstruck the sailor in a manner to cause those unpleasant sensations which have been describedand would probably have followd up the attack had not charles now thoroughly terrified clung around his legs and prevented his advancing  the scene was a strange one and for the time quite a silent one the company had started from their seats and for a moment held breathless but straind positions in the middle of the room stood the young man in his not at all ungraceful attitudeevery nerve out and his eyes flashing brilliantly  he seemd rooted like a rock and clasping him with an appearance of confidence in his protection clung the boy  you scoundrel cried the young man his voice thick with passion dare to touch the boy again and ill thrash you till no sense is left in your body  the sailor now partially recoverd made some gestures of a belligerent nature  come on drunken brute continued the angry youth i wish you would youve not had half what you deserve  upon sobriety and sense more fully taking their power in the brains of the oneeyed mariner however that worthy determined in his own mind that it would be most prudent to let the matter drop expressing therefore his conviction to that effect adding certain remarks to the purport that he meant no harm to the lad that he was surprised at such a gentleman being angry at a little piece of fun and so forthhe proposed that the company should go on with their jollity just as if nothing had happend in truth he of the single eye was not a bad fellow at heart after all the fiery enemy whose advances he had so often courted that night had stolen away his good feelings and set busy devils at work within him that might have made his hands do some dreadful deed had not the stranger interposed  in a few minutes the frolic of the party was upon its former footing the young man sat down upon one of the benches with the boy by his side and while the rest were loudly laughing and talking they two conversd together the stranger learnd from charles all the particulars of his simple storyhow his father had died years sincehow his mother work d hard for a bare livingand how he himself for many dreary months had been the servant of a hardhearted avaricious master more and more interested drawing the child close to his side the young man listend to his plainly told historyand thus an hour passd away  it was now past midnight the young man told charles that on the morrow he would take steps to relieve him from his servitudethat for the present night the landlord would probably give him a lodging at the innand little persuading did the host need for that  as he retired to sleep very pleasant thoughts filled the mind of the young manthoughts of a worthy action performdthoughts too newly awakened ones of walking in a steadier and wiser path than formerly  that roof then sheltered two beings that nightone of them innocent and sinless of all wrongthe otheroh to that other what evil had not been present either in action or to his desires  who was the stranger to those that from ties of relationship or otherwise felt an interest in him the answer to that question was not pleasant to dwell upon his name was langtonparentlessa dissipated young mana brawlerone whose too frequent companions were rowdies blacklegs and swindlers the new york police offices were not strangers to his countenance he had been bred to the profession of medicine besides he had a very respectable income and his house was in a pleasant street on the west side of the city little of his time however did mr john langton spend at his domestic hearth and the elderly lady who officiated as his housekeeper was by no means surprised to have him gone for a week or a month at a time and she knowing nothing of his whereabouts  living as he did the young man was an unhappy being it was not so much that his associates were below his own capacityfor langton though sensible and well bred was not highly talented or refinedbut that he lived without any steady purpose that he had no one to attract him to his home that he too easily allowd himself to be temptedwhich caused his life to be of late one continued scene of dissatisfaction this dissatisfaction he sought to drive away by the brandy bottle and mixing in all kinds of parties where the object was pleasure on the present occasion he had left the city a few days before and passing his time at a place near the village where charles and his mother lived he fell in during the day with those who were his companions of the tavern spree and thus it happend that they were all together langton hesitated not to make himself at home with any associate that suited his fancy  the next morning the poor widow rose from her sleepless cot and from that lucky trait in our nature which makes one extreme follow another she set about her toil with a lightend heart ellis the farmer rose too short as the nights were an hour before day for his god was gain and a prime article of his creed was to get as much work as possible from every one around him in the course of the day ellis was called upon by young langton and never perhaps in his life was the farmer puzzled more than at the young mans proposalhis desire to provide for the widows family a family that could do him no pecuniary good and his willingness to disburse money for that purpose the widow too was called upon not only on that day but the next and the next  it needs not that i should particularize the subsequent events of langtons and the boys historyhow the reformation of the profligate might be dated to begin from that timehow he gradually severd the guilty ties that had so long galld himhow he enjoyd his own home againhow the friendship of charles and himself grew not slack with timeand how when in the course of seasons he became head of a family of his own he would shudder at the remembrance of his early dangers and his escapes   lingaves temptation  another day utterd the poet lingave as he awoke in the morning and turnd him drowsily on his hard pallet another day comes out burthend with its weight of woes of what use is existence to me crushd down beneath the merciless heel of poverty and no promise of hope to cheer me on what have i in prospect but a life neglected and a death of misery  the youth paused but receiving no answer to his questions thought proper to continue the peevish soliloquy i am a genius they say and the speaker smiled bitterly but genius is not apparel and food why should i exist in the world unknown unloved pressd with cares while so many around me have all their souls can desire i behold the splendid equipages roll byi see the respectful bow at the presence of prideand i curse the contrast between my own lot and the fortune of the rich the lofty airthe show of dressthe aristocratic demeanorthe glitter of jewelsdazzle my eyes and sharptooth d envy works within me i hate these haughty and favord ones why should my path be so much rougher than theirs pitiable unfortunate man that i am to be placed beneath those whom in my heart i despiseand to be constantly tantalized with the presence of that wealth i cannot enjoy and the poet coverd his eyes with his hands and wept from very passion and fretfulness  o lingave be more of a man have you not the treasures of health and untainted propensities which many of those you envy never enjoy are you not their superior in mental power in liberal views of mankind and in comprehensive intellect and even allowing you the choice how would you shudder at changing in total conditions with them besides were you willing to devote all your time and energies you could gain property too squeeze and toil and worry and twist everything into a matter of profit and you can become a great man as far as money goes to make greatness  retreat then man of the polishd soul from those irritable complaints against your lotthose longings for wealth and puerile distinction not worthy your class do justice philosopher to your own powers while the world runs after its shadows and its bubbles thus commune in your own mind we will fold ourselves in our circle of understanding and look with an eye of apathy on those things it considers so mighty and so enviable let the proud man pass with his pompous glancelet the gay flutter in finerylet the foolish enjoy his folly and the beautiful move on in his perishing glory we will gaze without desire on all their possessions and all their pleasures our destiny is different from theirs not for such as we the lowly flights of their crippled wings we acknowledge no fellowship with them in ambition we composedly look down on the paths where they walk and pursue our own without uttering a wish to descend and be as they what is it to us that the mass pay us not that deference which wealth commands we desire no applause save the applause of the good and discriminatingthe choice spirits among men our intellect would be sullied were the vulgar to approximate to it by professing to readily enter in and praising it our pride is a towering and thrice refined pride  when lingave had given way to his temper some half hour or thereabout he grew more calm and bethought himself that he was acting a very silly part he listend a moment to the clatter of the carts and the tramp of early passengers on the pave below as they wended along to commence their daily toil it was just sunrise and the season was summer a little canary bird the only pet poor lingave could afford to keep chirpd merrily in its cage on the wall how slight a circumstance will sometimes change the whole current of our thoughts the music of that bird abstracting the mind of the poet but a moment from his sorrows gave a chance for his natural buoyancy to act again  lingave sprang lightly from his bed and performd his ablutions and his simple toiletthen hanging the cage on a nail outside the window and speaking an endearment to the songster which brought a perfect flood of melody in returnhe slowly passed through his door descended the long narrow turnings of the stairs and stood in the open street undetermind as to any particular destination he folded his hands behind him cast his glance upon the ground and moved listlessly onward  hour after hour the poet walkd alongup this street and down thathe reckd not how or where and as crowded thoroughfares are hardly the most fit places for a man to let his fancy soar in the cloudsmany a push and shove and curse did the dreamer get bestowd upon him  the booming of the city clock sounded forth the hour twelvehigh noon  ho lingave cried a voice from an open basement window as the poet passd  he stoppd and then unwittingly would have walked on still not fully awakend from his reverie  lingave i say cried the voice again and the person to whom the voice belongd stretchd his head quite out into the area in front stop man have you forgotten your appointment  oh ah said the poet and he smiled unmeaningly and descending the steps went into the office of ridman whose call it was that had startled him in his walk  who was ridman while the poet is waiting the convenience of that personage it may be as well to describe him  ridman was a moneymaker he had much penetration considerable knowledge of the world and a disposition to be constantly in the midst of enterprise excitement and stir his schemes for gaining wealth were various he had dippd into almost every branch and channel of business a slight acquaintance of several years standing subsisted between him and the poet the day previous a boy had calld with a note from ridman to lingave desiring the presence of the latter at the moneymakers room the poet returnd for answer that he would be there this was the engagement which he came near breaking  ridman had a smooth tongue all his ingenuity was needed in the explanation to his companion of why and wherefore the latter had been sent for  it is not requisite to state specifically the offer made by the man of wealth to the poet ridman in one of his enterprises found it necessary to procure the aid of such a person as lingavea writer of power a master of elegant diction of fine taste in style passionate yet pure and of the delicate imagery that belongs to the children of song the youth was absolutely startled at the magnificent and permanent remuneration which was held out to him for a moderate exercise of his talents  but the nature of the service required all the sophistry and art of ridman could not veil its repulsiveness the poet was to labor for the advancement of what he felt to be unholyhe was to inculcate what would lower the perfection of man he promised to give an answer to the proposal the succeeding day and left the place  now during the many hours there was a war going on in the heart of the poor poet he was indeed poor often he had no certainty whether he should be able to procure the next days meals and the poet knew the beauty of truth and adored not in the abstract merely but in practice the excellence of upright principles  night came lingave wearied lay upon his pallet again and slept the misty veil thrown over him the spirit of poesy came to his visions and stood beside him and lookd down pleasantly with her large eyes which were bright and liquid like the reflection of stars in a lake  virtue such imagining then seemd conscious to the soul of the dreamer is ever the sinew of true genius together the two in one they are endowd with immortal strength and approach loftily to him from whom both spring yet there are those that having great powers bend them to the slavery of wrong god forgive them for they surely do it ignorantly or heedlessly oh could he who lightly tosses around him the seeds of evil in his writings or his enduring thoughts or his chance wordscould he see how haply they are to spring up in distant time and poison the air and putrefy and cause to sickenwould he not shrink back in horror a bad principle jestingly spokena falsehood but of a wordmay taint a whole nation let the man to whom the great master has given the might of mind beware how he uses that might if for the furtherance of bad ends what can be expected but that as the hour of the closing scene draws nigh thoughts of harm done and capacities distorted from their proper aim and strength so laid out that men must be worse instead of better through the exertion of that strengthwill come and swarm like spectres around him  be and continue poor young man so taught one whose counsels should be graven on the heart of every youth while others around you grow rich by fraud and disloyalty be without place and power while others beg their way upward bear the pain of disappointed hopes while others gain the accomplishment of their flattery forego the gracious pressure of a hand for which others cringe and crawl wrap yourself in your own virtue and seek a friend and your daily bread if you have in such a course grown gray with unblenchd honor bless god and die  when lingave awoke the next morning he despatchd his answer to his wealthy friend and then plodded on as in the days before   little jane  lift up was ejaculated as a signal and click went the glasses in the hands of a party of tipsy men drinking one night at the bar of one of the middling order of taverns and many a wild gibe was utterd and many a terrible blasphemy and many an impure phrase sounded out the pollution of the hearts of these halfcrazed creatures as they tossd down their liquor and made the walls echo with their uproar the first and foremost in recklessness was a girlishfaced fairhaird fellow of twentytwo or three years they called him mike he seemd to be lookd upon by the others as a sort of prompter from whom they were to take cue and if the brazen wickedness evinced by him in a hundred freaks and remarks to his companions during their stay in that place were any test of his capacitythere might hardly be one more fit to go forward as a guide on the road of destruction from the conversation of the party it appeard that they had been spending the early part of the evening in a gambling house  a second third and fourth time were the glasses filld and the effect thereof began to be perceivd in a still higher degree of noise and loquacity among the revellers one of the servingmen came in at this moment and whisperd the barkeeper who went out and in a moment returnd again a person he said wishd to speak with mr michael he waited on the walk in front  the individual whose name was mentiond made his excuses to the others telling them he would be back in a moment and left the room as he shut the door behind him and steppd into the open air he saw one of his brothershis elder by eight or ten yearspacing to and fro with rapid and uneven steps as the man turnd in his walk and the glare of the street lamp fell upon his face the youth halfbenumbd as his senses were was somewhat startled at its paleness and evident perturbation come with me said the elder brother hurriedly the illness of our little jane is worse and i have been sent for you  poh answered the young drunkard very composedly is that all i shall be home byandby and he turnd back again  but brother she is worse than ever before perhaps when you arrive she may be dead  the tipsy one pausd in his retreat perhaps alarmd at the utterance of that dread word which seldom fails to shoot a chill to the hearts of mortals but he soon calmd himself and waving his hand to the other why see said he a score of times at least have i been calld away to the last sickness of our good little sister and each time it proves to be nothing worse than some whim of the nurse or physician three years has the girl been able to live very heartily under her disease and ill be bound shell stay on earth three years longer  and as he concluded this wicked and most brutal reply the speaker opend the door and went into the barroom but in his intoxication during the hour that followd mike was far from being at ease at the end of that hour the words perhaps when you arrive she may be dead were not effaced from his hearing yet and he started for home the elder brother had wended his way back in sorrow  let me go before the younger one awhile to a room in that home a little girl lay there dying she had been ill a long time so it was no sudden thing for her parents and her brethren and sisters to be called for the witness of the death agony the girl was not what might be called beautiful and yet there is a solemn kind of loveliness that always surrounds a sick child the sympathy for the weak and helpless sufferer perhaps increases it in our own ideas the ashiness and the moisture on the brow and the film over the eyeballswhat man can look upon the sight and not feel his heart awed within him children i have sometimes fancied too increase in beauty as their illness deepens  besides the nearest relatives of little jane standing round her bedside was the family doctor he had just laid her wrist down upon the coverlet and the look he gave the mother was a look in which there was no hope my child she cried in uncontrollable agony o my child and the father and the sons and daughters were bowed down in grief and thick tears rippled between the fingers held before their eyes  then there was silence awhile during the hour just bygone jane had in her childish way bestowd a little gift upon each of her kindred as a remembrancer when she should be dead and buried in the grave and there was one of these simple tokens which had not reachd its destination she held it in her hand now it was a very small muchthumbed booka religious story for infants given her by her mother when she had first learnd to read  while they were all keeping this solemn stillnessbroken only by the suppressd sobs of those who stood and watchd for the passing away of the girls soula confusion of some one entering rudely and speaking in a turbulent voice was heard in an adjoining apartment again the voice roughly sounded out it was the voice of the drunkard mike and the father bade one of his sons go and quiet the intruder if nought else will do said he sternly put him forth by strength we want no tipsy brawlers here to disturb such a scene as this for what moved the sick girl uneasily on her pillow and raised her neck and motiond to her mother she would that mike should be brought to her side and it was enjoind on him whom the father had bade to eject the noisy one that he should tell mike his sisters request and beg him to come to her  he came the inebriatehis mind soberd by the deep solemnity of the scenestood there and leaned over to catch the last accounts of one who soon was to be with the spirits of heaven all was the silence of the deepest night the dying child held the young mans hand in one of hers with the other she slowly lifted the trifling memorial she had assigned especially for him aloft in the air her arm shookher eyes now becoming glassy with the deathdamps were cast toward her brothers face she smiled pleasantly and as an indistinct gurgle came from her throat the uplifted hand fell suddenly into the open palm of her brothers depositing the tiny volume there little jane was dead  from that night the young man stepped no more in his wild courses but was reformd   dumb kate  not many years sinceand yet long enough to have been before the abundance of railroads and similar speedy modes of conveyancethe travelers from amboy village to the metropolis of our republic were permitted to refresh themselves and the horses of the stage had a breathing spell at a certain oldfashiond tavern about half way between the two places it was a quaint comfortable ancient house that tavern huge buttonwood trees embowerd it round about and there was a long porch in front the trellisd work whereof though old and moulderd had been and promised still to be for years held together by the tangled folds of a grape vine wreathd about it like a tremendous serpent  how clean and fragrant everything was there how bright the pewter tankards wherefrom cider or ale went into the parchd throat of the thirsty man how pleasing to look into the expressive eyes of kate the landlords lovely daughter who kept everything so clean and bright  now the reason why kates eyes had become so expressive was that besides their proper and natural office they stood to the poor girl in the place of tongue and ears also kate had been dumb from her birth everybody loved the helpless creature when she was a child gentle timid and affectionate was she and beautiful as the lilies of which she loved to cultivate so many every summer in her garden her light hair and the likecolord lashes so long and silky that droopd over her blue eyes of such uncommon size and softnessher rounded shape well set off by a little modest art of dressher smilethe graceful ease of her motions always attracted the admiration of the strangers who stopped there and were quite a pride to her parents and friends  how could it happen that so beautiful and inoffensive a being should taste even to its dregs the bitterest unhappiness oh there must indeed be a mysterious unfathomable meaning in the decrees of providence which is beyond the comprehension of man for no one on earth less deserved or needed the uses of adversity than dumb kate love the mighty and lawless passion came into the sanctuary of the maids pure breast and the dove of peace fled away forever  one of the persons who had occasion to stop most frequently at the tavern kept by dumb kates parents was a young man the son of a wealthy farmer who ownd an estate in the neighborhood he saw kate and was struck with her natural elegance though not of thoroughly wicked propensities the fascination of so fine a prize made this youth determine to gain her love and if possible to win her to himself at first he hardly dared even amid the depths of his own soul to entertain thoughts of vileness against one so confiding and childlike but in a short time such feelings wore away and he made up his mind to become the betrayer of poor kate he was a goodlooking fellow and made but too sure of his victim kate was lost  the villain came to new york soon after and engaged in a business which prosperd well and which has no doubt by this time made him what is calld a man of fortune  not long did sickness of the heart wear into the life and happiness of dumb kate one pleasant spring day the neighbors having been called by a notice the previous morning the old churchyard was thrown open and a coffin was borne over the early grass that seemd so delicate with its light green hue there was a new made grave and by its side the bier was restedwhile they paused a moment until holy words had been said an idle boy calld there by curiosity saw something lying on the fresh earth thrown out from the grave which attracted his attention a little blossom the only one to be seen around had grown exactly on the spot where the sexton chose to dig poor kates last restingplace it was a weak but lovely flower and now lay where it had been carelessly tossd amid the coarse gravel the boy twirld it a moment in his fingersthe bruisd fragments gave out a momentary perfume and then fell to the edge of the pit over which the child at that moment leand and gazed in his inquisitiveness as they droppd they were wafted to the bottom of the grave the last look was bestowd on the dead girls face by those who loved her so well in life and then she was softly laid away to her sleep beneath that green grass covering  yet in the churchyard on the hill is kates grave there stands a little white stone at the head and verdure grows richly there and gossips sometimes of a sabbath afternoon rambling over that gatheringplace of the gone from earth stop a while and con over the dumb girls hapless story   talk to an artunion  a brooklyn fragment  it is a beautiful truth that all men contain something of the artist in them and perhaps it is the case that the greatest artists live and die the world and themselves alike ignorant what they possess who would not mourn that an ample palace of surpassingly graceful architecture filld with luxuries and embellishd with fine pictures and sculpture should stand cold and still and vacant and never be known or enjoyd by its owner would such a fact as this cause your sadness then be sad for there is a palace to which the courts of the most sumptuous kings are but a frivolous patch and though it is always waiting for them not one of its owners ever enters there with any genuine sense of its grandeur and glory  i think of few heroic actions which cannot be traced to the artistical impulse he who does great deeds does them from his innate

goodthe deepest widest most needed goodthough quite certainly not in the ways attemptedwhich have at times something irresistibly comic what can be more farcical for instance than the sight of a worthy gentleman coming three or four thousand miles through wet and wind to speak complacently and at great length on matters of which he both entirely mistakes or knows nothingbefore crowds of auditors equally complacent and equally at fault  yet welcome and thanks we say to those visitors we have and have had from abroad among usand may the procession continue we have had dickens and thackeray froude herbert spencer oscar wilde lord coleridgesoldiers savants poetsand now matthew arnold and irving the actor some have come to make moneysome for a good timesome to help us along and give us adviceand some undoubtedly to investigate bona fide this great problem democratic america looming upon the world with such cumulative power through a hundred years now with the evident intention since the secession war to stay and take a leading hand for many a century to come in civilizations and humanitys eternal game but alas that very investigationthe method of that investigationis where the deficit most surely and helplessly comes in let not lord coleridge and mr arnold to say nothing of the illustrious actor imagine that when they have met and surveyd the etiquettical gatherings of our wealthy distinguishd and suretobeputforwardonsuchoccasions citizens new york boston philadelphia c have certain stereotyped strings of them continually lined and paraded like the lists of dishes at hotel tablesyou are sure to get the same over and over againit is very amusingand the bowing and introducing the receptions at the swell clubs the eating and drinking and praising and praising backand the next day riding about central park or doing the public institutions and so passing through one after another the fulldress coteries of the atlantic cities all grammatical and cultured and correct with the toneddown manners of the gentlemen and the kidgloves and luncheons and fingerglasseslet not our eminent visitors we say suppose that by means of these experiences they have seen america or capturd any distinctive clew or purport thereof not a bit of it of the pulsebeats that lie within and vitalize this commonweal todayof the hardpan purports and idiosyncrasies pursued faithfully and triumphantly by its bulk of men north and south generation after generation superficially unconscious of their own aims yet none the less pressing onward with deathless intuitionthose coteries do not furnish the faintest scintilla in the old world the best flavor and significance of a race may possibly need to be lookd for in its upper classes its gentries its court its etat major in the united states the rule is reversd besides and a point this perhaps deepest of all the special marks of our grouping and design are not going to be understood in a hurry the lesson and scanning right on the ground are difficult i was going to say they are impossible to foreignersbut i have occasionally found the clearest appreciation of all coming from faroff quarters surely nothing could be more apt not only for our eminent visitors present and to come but for home study than the following editorial criticism of the london times on mr froudes visits and lectures here a few years ago and the culminating dinner given at delmonicos with its brilliant array of guests  we read the list says the times of those who assembled to do honor to mr froude there were mr emerson mr beecher mr curtis mr bryant we add the names of those who sent letters of regret that they could not attend in personmr longfellow mr whittier they are names which are well knownalmost as well known and as much honord in england as in america and yet what must we say in the end the american people outside this assemblage of writers is something vaster and greater than they singly or together can comprehend it cannot be said of any or all of them that they can speak for their nation we who look on at this distance are able perhaps on that account to see the more clearly that there are qualities of the american people which find no representation no voice among these their spokesmen and what is true of them is true of the english class of whom mr froude may be said to be the ambassador mr froude is master of a charming style he has the gift of grace and the gift of sympathy taking any single character as the subject of his study he may succeed after a very short time in so comprehending its workings as to be able to present a living figure to the intelligence and memory of his readers but the movements of a nation the voiceless purpose of a people which cannot put its own thoughts into words yet acts upon them in each successive generationthese things do not lie within his grasp the functions of literature such as he represents are limited in their action the influence he can wield is artificial and restricted and while he and his hearers please and are pleasd with pleasant periods his great mass of national life will flow around them unmovd in its tides by action as powerless as that of the dwellers by the shore to direct the currents of the ocean  a thought here that needs to be echoed expanded permanently treasurd by our literary classes and educators the gestation the youth the knitting preparations are now over and it is full time for definite purpose result how few think of it though it is the impetus and background of our whole nationality and popular life in the present brief memorandum i very likely for the first time awake the intelligent reader to the idea and inquiry whether there isnt such a thing as the distinctive genius of our democratic new world universal immanent bringing to a head the best experience of the pastnot specially literary or intellectualnot merely good in the sunday school and temperance society sensesome invisible spine and great sympathetic to these states resident only in the average people in their practical life in their physiology in their emotions in their nebulous yet fiery patriotism in the armies both sides through the whole secession waran identity and character which indeed so far finds no voice among their spokesmen  to my mind america vast and fruitful as it appears today is even yet for its most important results entirely in the tentative state its very formationstir and whirling trials and essays more splendid and picturesque to my thinking than the accomplishd growths and shows of other lands through european history or greece or all the past surely a new world literature worthy the name is not to be if it ever comes some fiction or fancy or bit of sentimentalism or polishd work merely by itself or in abstraction so long as such literature is no born branch and offshoot of the nationality rooted and grown from its roots and fibred with its fibre it can never answer any deep call or perennial need perhaps the untaught republic is wiser than its teachers the best literature is always a result of something far greater than itselfnot the hero but the portrait of the hero before there can be recorded history or poem there must be the transaction beyond the old masterpieces the iliad the interminable hindu epics the greek tragedies even the bible itself range the immense facts of what must have preceded them their sine qua nonthe veritable poems and masterpieces of which grand as they are the wordstatements are but shreds and cartoons  for today and the states i think the vividest rapidest most stupendous processes ever known ever performd by man or nation on the largest scales and in countless varieties are now and here presented not as our poets and preachers are always conventionally putting itbut quite different some colossal foundry the flaming of the fire the melted metal the pounding triphammers the surging crowds of workmen shifting from point to point the murky shadows the rolling haze the discord the crudeness the deafening din the disorder the dross and clouds of dust the waste and extravagance of material the shafts of darted sunshine through the vast open roofscuttles aloftthe mighty castings many of them not yet fitted perhaps delayd long yet each in its due time with definite place and use

castelar tennyson any of the two or three great parisian essayistswere they and we to come face to face how is it possible but that the right understanding would ensue     the bible as poetry   i suppose one cannot at this day say anything new from a literary point of view about those autochthonic bequests of asiathe hebrew bible the mighty hindu epics and a hundred lesser but typical works not now definitely including the iliadthough that work was certainly of asiatic genesis as homer himself wasconsiderations which seem curiously ignored but will there ever be a time or placeever a student however modern of the grand art to whom those compositions will not afford profounder lessons than all else of their kind in the garnerage of the past could there be any more opportune suggestion to the current popular writer and reader of verse what the office of poet was in primeval timesand is yet capable of being anew adjusted entirely to the modern  all the poems of orientalism with the old and new testaments at the centre tend to deep and wide i dont know but the deepest and widest psychological developmentwith little or nothing at all of the mere esthetic the principal verserequirement of our day very late but unerringly comes to every capable student the perception that it is not in beauty it is not in art it is not even in science that the profoundest laws of the case have their eternal sway and outcropping  in his discourse on hebrew poets de sola mendes said the fundamental feature of judaism of the hebrew nationality was religion its poetry was naturally religious its subjects god and providence the covenants with israel god in nature and as reveald god the creator and governor nature in her majesty and beauty inspired hymns and odes to natures god and then the checkerd history of the nation furnishd allusions illustrations and subjects for epic displaythe glory of the sanctuary the offerings the splendid ritual the holy city and lovd palestine with its pleasant valleys and wild tracts dr mendes said that rhyming was not a characteristic of hebrew poetry at all metre was not a necessary mark of poetry great poets discarded it the early jewish poets knew it not compared with the famed epics of greece and lesser ones since the spinal supports of the bible are simple and meagre all its history biography narratives c are as beads strung on and indicating the eternal thread of the deific purpose and power yet with only deepest faith for impetus and such deific purpose for palpable or impalpable theme it often transcends the masterpieces of hellas and all masterpieces  the metaphors daring beyond account the lawless soul extravagant by our standards the glow of love and friendship the fervent kissnothing in argument or logic but unsurpassd in proverbs in religious ecstasy in suggestions of common mortality and death mans great equalizersthe spirit everything the ceremonies and forms of the churches nothing faith limitless its immense sensuousness immensely spiritualan incredible allinclusive nonworldliness and dewscented illiteracy the antipodes of our nineteenth century business absorption and morbid refinementno hairsplitting doubts no sickly sulking and sniffling no hamlet no adonais no thanatopsis no in memoriam  the culminated proof of the poetry of a country is the quality of its personnel which in any race can never be really superior without superior poems the finest blending of individuality with universality in my opinion nothing out of the galaxies of the iliad or shaksperes heroes or from the tennysonian idylls so lofty devoted and starlike typified in the songs of those old asiatic lands men and women as great columnar trees nowhere else the abnegation of self towering in such quaint sublimity nowhere else the simplest human emotions conquering the gods of heaven and fate itself the episode for instance toward the close of the mahabharatathe journey of the wife savitri with the god of death yama      one terrible to seebloodred his garb     his body huge and dark bloodshot his eyes     which flamed like suns beneath his turban cloth     armd was he with a noose  who carries off the soul of the dead husband the wife tenaciously following andby the resistless charm of perfect poetic recitation eventually redeeming her captive mate  i remember how enthusiastically william h seward in his last days once expatiated on these themes from his travels in turkey egypt and asia minor finding the oldest biblical narratives exactly illustrated there today with apparently no break or change along three thousand yearsthe veild women the costumes the gravity and simplicity all the manners just the same the veteran trelawney said he found the only real nobleman of the world in a good average specimen of the midaged or elderly oriental in the east the grand figure always leading is the old man majestic with flowing beard paternal c in europe and america it is as we know the young fellowin novels a handsome and interesting hero more or less juvenilein operas a tenor with blooming cheeks black mustache superficial animation and perhaps good lungs but no more depth than skimmilk but reading folks probably get their information of those bible areas and current peoples as depicted in print by english and french cads the most shallow impudent supercilious brood on earth  i have said nothing yet of the cumulus of associations perfectly legitimate parts of its influence and finally in many respects the dominant parts of the bible as a poetic entity and of every portion of it not the old edifice onlythe congeries also of events and struggles and surroundings of which it has been the scene and motiveeven the horrors dreads deaths how many ages and generations have brooded and wept and agonized over this book what untellable joys and ecstasieswhat support to martyrs at the stakefrom it no really great song can ever attain full purport till long after the death of its singertill it has accrued and incorporated the many passions many joys and sorrows it has itself arousd to what myriads has it been the shore and rock of safetythe refuge from driving tempest and wreck translated in all languages how it has united this diverse world of civilized lands today whose of our retrospects has it not interwoven and linkd and permeated not only does it bring us what is claspd within its covers nay that is the least of what it brings of its thousands there is not a verse not a word but is thickstudded with human emotions successions of fathers and sons mothers and daughters of our own antecedents inseparable from that background of us on which phantasmal as it is all that we are today inevitably dependsour ancestry our past  strange but true that the principal factor in cohering the nations eras and paradoxes of the globe by giving them a common platform of two or three great ideas a commonalty of origin and projecting kosmic brotherhood the dream of all hope all timethat the long trains gestations attempts and failures resulting in the new world and in modern solidarity and politicsare to be identified and resolvd back into a collection of old poetic lore which more than any one thing else has been the axis of civilization and history through thousands of yearsand except for which this america of ours with its polity and essentials could not now be existing  no true bard will ever contravene the bible if the time ever comes when iconoclasm does its extremest in one direction against the books of the bible in its present form the collection must still survive in another and dominate just as much as hitherto or more than hitherto through its divine and primal poetic structure to me that is the living and definite elementprinciple of the work evolving everything else then the continuity the oldest and newest asiatic utterance and character and all between holding together like the apparition of the sky and coming to us the same even to our nineteenth century here are the fountain heads of song     father taylor and oratory   i have never heard but one essentially perfect oratorone who satisfied those depths of the emotional nature that in most cases go through life quite untouchd unfedwho held every hearer by spells which no conventionalist high or lownor any pride or composure nor resistance of intellectcould stand against for ten minutes  and by the way is it not strange of this firstclass genius in the rarest and most profound of humanitys arts that it will be necessary so nearly forgotten and rubbd out is his name by the rushing whirl of the last twentyfive years to first inform current readers that he was an orthodox minister of no particular celebrity who during a long life preachd especially to yankee sailors in an old fourthclass church down by the wharves in bostonhad practically been a seafaring man through his earlier yearsand died april 6 1871 just as the tide turnd going out with the ebb as an old salt should his name is now comparatively unknown outside of bostonand even there though dickens mr jameson dr bartol and bishop haven have commemorated him is mostly but a reminiscence  during my visits to the hub in 1859 and 60 i several times saw and heard father taylor in the spring or autumn quiet sunday forenoons i liked to go down early to the quaint shipcabinlooking church where the old man ministerdto enter and leisurely scan the building the low ceiling everything strongly timberd polishd and rubbd apparently the dark rich colors the gallery all in halflightand smell the aroma of old woodto watch the auditors sailors mates matlows officers singly or in groups as they came intheir physiognomies forms dress gait as they walkd along the aislestheir postures seating themselves in the rude roomy undoord uncushiond pewsand the evident effect upon them of the place occasion and atmosphere  the pulpit rising ten or twelve feet high against the rear wall was back d by a significant mural painting in oilshowing out its bold lines and strong hues through the subdued light of the buildingof a stormy sea the waves highrolling and amid them an oldstyle ship all bent over driving through the gale and in great perila vivid and effectual piece of limning not meant for the criticism of artists though i think it had merit even from that standpoint but for its effect upon the congregation and what it would convey to them  father taylor was a moderatesized man indeed almost small reminded me of old booth the great actor and my favorite of those and preceding days well advanced in years but alert with mild blue or gray eyes and good presence and voice soon as he opend his mouth i ceasd to pay any attention to church or audience or pictures or lights and shades a far more potent charm entirely swayd me in the course of the sermon there was no sign of any ms or reading from notes some of the parts would be in the highest degree majestic and picturesque colloquial in a severe sense it often leand to biblical and oriental forms especially were all allusions to ships and the ocean and sailors lives of unrivald power and lifelikeness  sometimes there were passages of fine language and composition even from the purists point of view a few arguments and of the best but always brief and simple one realized what grip there might have been in such wordsofmouth talk as that of socrates and epictetus in the main i should say of any of these discourses that the old demosthenean rule and requirement of action action action first in its inward and then very moderate and restraind its outward sense was the quality that had leading fulfilment  i remember i felt the deepest impression from the old mans prayers which invariably affected me to tears never on similar or any other occasions have i heard such impassiond pleadingsuch humanharassing reproach like hamlet to his mother in the closetsuch probing to the very depths of that latent conscience and remorse which probably lie somewhere in the background of every life every soul for when father taylor preachd or prayd the rhetoric and art the mere words which usually play such a big part seemd altogether to disappear and the live feeling advanced upon you and seizd you with a power before unknown everybody felt this marvellous and awful influence one young sailor a rhode islander who came every sunday and i got acquainted with and talkd to once or twice as we went away told me that must be the holy ghost we read of in the testament  i should be at a loss to make any comparison with other preachers or public speakers when a child i had heard elias hicksand father taylor though so different in personal appearance for elias was of tall and most shapely form with black eyes that blazed at times like meteors always reminded me of him both had the same inner apparently inexhaustible fund of latent volcanic passionthe same tenderness blended with a curious remorseless firmness as of some surgeon operating on a belovd patient hearing such men sends to the winds all the books and formulas and polishd speaking and rules of oratory  talking of oratory why is it that the unsophisticated practices often strike deeper than the traind ones why do our experiences perhaps of some local country exhorteror often in the west or south at political meetingsbring the most definite results in my time i have heard webster clay edward everett phillips and such celebres yet i recall the minor but lifeeloquence of men like john p hale cassius clay and one or two of the old abolition fanatics ahead of all those stereotyped fames is noti sometimes questionthe first last and most important quality of all in training for a finishd speaker generally unsought unreckd of both by teacher and pupil though maybe it cannot be taught anyhow at any rate we need to clearly understand the distinction between oratory and elocution under the latter art including some of high order there is indeed no scarcity in the united states preachers lawyers actors lecturers c with all there seem to be few real oratorsalmost none  i repeat and would dwell upon it more as suggestion than mere factamong all the brilliant lights of bar or stage i have heard in my time for years in new york and other cities i haunted the courts to witness notable trials and have heard all the famous actors and actresses that have been in america the past fifty years though i recall marvellous effects from one or other of them i never had anything in the way of vocal utterance to shake me through and through and become fixd with its accompaniments in my memory like those prayers and sermonslike father taylors personal electricity and the whole scene therethe prone ship in the gale and dashing wave and foam for backgroundin the little old seachurch in boston those summer sundays just before the secession war broke out     the spanish element in our nationality    our friends at santa fe new mexico have just finishd their longdrawnout anniversary of the 333d year of the settlement of their city by the spanish the good gray walt whitman was asked to write them a poem in commemoration instead he wrote them a letter as followsphiladelphia press august 5 1883  camden new jersey july 20 1883  to messrs griffin martinez prince and other gentlemen at santa fe  dear sirsyour kind invitation to visit you and deliver a poem for the 333d anniversary of founding santa fe has reachd me so late that i have to decline with sincere regret but i will say a few words offhand  we americans have yet to really learn our own antecedents and sort them to unify them they will be found ampler than has been supposed and in widely different sources thus far impressd by new england writers and schoolmasters we tacitly abandon ourselves to the notion that our united states have been fashiond from the british islands only and essentially form a second england onlywhich is a very great mistake many leading traits for our future national personality and some of the best ones will certainly prove to have originated from other than british stock as it is the british and german valuable as they are in the concrete already threaten excess or rather i should say they have certainly reachd that excess today something outside of them and to counterbalance them is seriously needed  the seething materialistic and business vortices of the united states in their present devouring relations controlling and belittling everything else are in my opinion but a vast and indispensable stage in the new worlds development and are certainly to be followd by something entirely differentat least by immense modifications character literature a society worthy the name are yet to be establishd through a nationality of noblest spiritual heroic and democratic attributesnot one of which at present definitely existsentirely different from the past though unerringly founded on it and to justify it  to that composite american identity of the future spanish character will supply some of the most needed parts no stock shows a grander historic retrospectgrander in religiousness and loyalty or for patriotism courage decorum gravity and honor it is time to dismiss utterly the illusioncompound half rawheadandbloodybones and half mysteriesofudolpho inherited from the english writers of the past 200 years it is time to realizefor it is certainly truethat there will not be found any more cruelty tyranny superstition c in the resume of past spanish history than in the corresponding resume of anglonorman history nay i think there will not be found so much  then another point relating to american ethnology past and to come i will here touch upon at a venture as to our aboriginal or indian populationthe aztec in the south and many a tribe in the north and westi know it seems to be agreed that they must gradually dwindle as time rolls on and in a few generations more leave only a reminiscence a blank but i am not at all clear about that as america from its many farback sources and current supplies develops adapts entwines faithfully identifies its ownare we to see it cheerfully accepting and using all the contributions of foreign lands from the whole outside globeand then rejecting the only ones distinctively its ownthe autochthonic ones  as to the spanish stock of our southwest it is certain to me that we do not begin to appreciate the splendor and sterling value of its race element who knows but that element like the course of some subterranean river dipping invisibly for a hundred or two years is now to emerge in broadest flow and permanent action  if i might assume to do so i would like to send you the most cordial heartfelt congratulations of your american fellowcountrymen here you have more friends in the northern and atlantic regions than you suppose and they are deeply interested in the development of the great southwestern interior and in what your festival would arouse to public attention  very respectfully c  walt whitman     what lurks behind shaksperes historical plays   we all know how much mythus there is in the shakspere question as it stands today beneath a few foundations of proved facts are certainly engulf d far more dim and elusive ones of deepest importance tantalizing and half suspectedsuggesting explanations that one dare not put in plain statement but coming at once to the point the english historical plays are to me not only the most eminent as dramatic performances my maturest judgment confirming the impressions of my early years that the distinctiveness and glory of the poet reside not in his vaunted dramas of the passions but those founded on the contests of english dynasties and the french wars but form as we get it all the chief in a complexity of puzzles conceivd out of the fullest heat and pulse of european feudalismpersonifying in unparalleld ways the mediaeval aristocracy its towering spirit of ruthless and gigantic caste with its own peculiar air and arrogance no mere imitationonly one of the wolfish earls so plenteous in the plays themselves or some born descendant and knower might seem to be the true author of those amazing worksworks in some respects greater than anything else in recorded literature  the start and germstock of the pieces on which the present speculation is founded are undoubtedly with at the outset no small amount of bungling work in henry vi it is plain to me that as profound and forecasting a brain and pen as ever appeard in literature after floundering somewhat in the first part of that trilogyor perhaps draughting it more or less experimentally or by accidentafterward developed and defined his plan in the second and third parts and from time to time thenceforward systematically enlarged it to majestic and mature proportions in richard ii richard iii king john henry iv henry v and even in macbeth coriolanus and lear for it is impossible to grasp the whole cluster of those plays however wide the intervals and different circumstances of their composition without thinking of them as in a free sense the result of an essentially controling plan what was that plan or rather what was veild behind itfor to me there was certainly something so veild even the episodes of cade joan of arc and the like which sometimes seem to me like interpolations allowd may be meant to foil the possible sleuth and throw any too cute pursuer off the scent in the whole matter i should specially dwell on and make much of that inexplicable element of every highest poetic nature which causes it to cover up and involve its real purpose and meanings in folded removes and far recesses of this traithiding the nest where common seekers may never find itthe shaksperean works afford the most numerous and markd illustrations known to me i would even call that trait the leading one through the whole of those works  all the foregoing to premise a brief statement of how and where i get my new light on shakspere speaking of the special english plays my friend william oconnor says    they seem simply and rudely historical in their motive as aiming   to give in the rough a tableau of warring dynastiesand carry to   me a lurking sense of being in aid of some ulterior design probably   well enough understood in that age which perhaps time and criticism   will reveal their atmosphere is one of barbarous and tumultuous   gloomthey do not make us love the times they limn and it is   impossible to believe that the greatest of the elizabethan men could   have sought to indoctrinate the age with the love of feudalism which   his own drama in its entirety if the view taken of it herein be true   certainly and subtly saps and mines  reading the justspecified play in the light of mr oconnors suggestion i defy any one to escape such new and deep utterance meanings like magic ink warm d by the fire and previously invisible will it not indeed be strange if the author of othello and hamlet is destind to live in america in a generation or two less as the cunning draughtsman of the passions and more as putting on record the first full exposeand by far the most vivid one immeasurably ahead of doctrinaires and economistsof the political theory and results or the reasonwhy and necessity for them which america has come on earth to abnegate and replace  the summary of my suggestion would be therefore that while the more the rich and tangled jungle of the shaksperean area is traversd and studied and the more baffled and mixd as so far appears becomes the exploring student who at last surmises everything and remains certain of nothing it is possible a future age of criticism diving deeper mapping the land and lines freer completer than hitherto may discover in the plays named the scientific baconian inauguration of modern democracyfurnishing realistic and firstclass artistic portraitures of the mediaeval world the feudal personalities institutes in their morbid accumulations deposits upon politics and sociologymay penetrate to that hardpan far down and back of the ostent of today on which and on which only the progressism of the last two centuries has built this democracy which now holds secure lodgment over the whole civilized world  whether such was the unconscious or as i think likely the more or less conscious purpose of him who fashiond those marvellous architectonics is a secondary question     a thought on shakspere   the most distinctive poemsthe most permanently rooted and with heartiest reason for beingthe copious cycle of arthurian legends or the almost equally copious charlemagne cycle or the poems of the cid or scandinavian eddas or nibelungen or chaucer or spenser or bona fide ossian or infernoprobably had their rise in the great historic perturbations which they came in to sum up and confirm indirectly embodying results to date then however precious to culture the grandest of those poems it may be said preserve and typify results offensive to the modern spirit and long past away to state it briefly and taking the strongest examples in homer lives the ruthless military prowess of greece and of its special goddescended dynastic houses in shakspere the dragonrancors and stormy feudal splendor of mediaeval caste  poetry largely considerd is an evolution sending out improved andeverexpanded typesin one sense the past even the best of it necessarily giving place and dying out for our existing world the bases on which all the grand old poems were built have become vacuumsand even those of many comparatively modern ones are broken and halfgone for us today not their own intrinsic value vast as that is backs and maintains those poemsbut a mountainhigh growth of associations the layers of successive ages everywheretheir own lands includedis there not something terrible in the tenacity with which the one book out of millions holds its gripthe homeric and virgilian works the interminable balladromances of the middle ages the utterances of dante spenser and others are upheld by their cumulusentrenchment in scholarship and as precious always welcome unspeakably valuable reminiscences  even the one who at present reigns unquestiondof shaksperefor all he stands for so much in modern literature he stands entirely for the mighty esthetic sceptres of the past not for the spiritual and democratic the sceptres of the future the inward and outward characteristics of shakspere are his vast and rich variety of persons and themes with his wondrous delineation of each and allnot only limitless funds of verbal and pictorial resource but great excess superfoetationmannerism like a fine aristocratic perfume holding a touch of musk euphues his markwith boundless sumptuousness and adornment real velvet and gems not shoddy nor pastebut a good deal of bombast and fustiancertainly some terrific mouthing in shakspere  superb and inimitable as all is it is mostly an objective and physiological kind of power and beauty the soul finds in shaksperea style supremely grand of the sort but in my opinion stopping short of the grandest sort at any rate for fulfilling and satisfying modern and scientific and democratic american purposes think not of growths as forests primeval or yellowstone geysers or colorado ravines but of costly marble palaces and palace rooms and the noblest fixings and furniture and noble owners and occupants to correspondthink of carefully built gardens from the beautiful but sophisticated gardening art at its best with walks and bowers and artificial lakes and appropriate statuegroups and the finest cultivated roses and lilies and japonicas in plentyand you have the tally of shakspere the low characters mechanics even the loyal henchmenall in themselves nothingserve as capital foils to the aristocracy the comedies exquisite as they certainly are bringing in admirably portrayd common characters have the unmistakable hue of plays portraits made for the divertisement only of the elite of the castle and from its point of view the comedies are altogether nonacceptable to america and democracy  but to the deepest soul it seems a shame to pick and choose from the riches shakspere has left usto criticise his infinitely royal multiform qualityto gauge with optic glasses the dazzle of his sunlike beams  the best poetic utterance after all can merely hint or remind often very indirectly or at distant removes aught of real perfection or the solution of any deep problem or any completed statement of the moral the true the beautiful eludes the greatest deftest poetflies away like an always uncaught bird     robert burns as poet and person   what the future will decide about robert burns and his workswhat place will be assignd them on that great roster of geniuses and genius which can only be finishd by the slow but sure balancing of the centuries with their ample averagei of course cannot tell but as we know him from his recorded utterances and after nearly one century and its diligence of collections songs letters anecdotes presenting the figure of the canny scotchman in a fullness and detail wonderfully complete and the lines mainly by his own hand he forms today in some respects the most interesting personality among singers then there are many things in burnss poems and character that specially endear him to america he was essentially a republicanwould have been at home in the western united states and probably become eminent there he was an average sample of the goodnatured warmblooded proudspirited amative alimentive convivial young and earlymiddleaged man of the decentborn middle classes everywhere and any how without the race of which he is a distinct specimen and perhaps his poems america and her powerful democracy could not exist todaycould not project with unparalleld historic sway into the future  perhaps the peculiar coloring of the era of burns needs always first to be considerd it included the times of the 7683 revolution in america of the french revolution and an unparalleld chaos development in europe and elsewhere in every department shining and strange names like stars some rising some in meridian some decliningvoltaire franklin washington kant goethe fulton napoleon mark the era and while so much and of grandest moment fit for the trumpet of the worlds fame was being transactedthat little tragicomedy of r bs life and death was going on in a country byplace in scotland  burnss correspondence generally collected and publishd since his death gives wonderful glints into both the amiable and weak and worse than weak parts of his portraiture habits good and bad luck ambition and associations his letters to mrs dunlop mrs mclehose clarinda mr thompson dr moore robert muir mr cunningham miss margaret chalmers peter hill richard brown mrs riddel robert ainslie and robert graham afford valuable lights and shades to the outline and with numerous others help to a touch here and fillin there of poet and poems there are suspicions it is true of the genteel letterwriter with scraps and words from the manual of french quotations and in the loveletters some hollow mouthings yet we wouldnt on any account lack the letters a full and true portrait is always what is wanted veracity at every hazard besides do we not all see by this time that the story of burns even for its own sake requires the record of the whole and several with nothing left out completely and every point minutely told out its fullest explains and justifies itselfas perhaps almost any life does he is very close to the earth he pickd up his best words and tunes directly from the scotch homesingers but tells thompson they would not please his ts learnd lugs adding i call them simpleyou would pronounce them silly yes indeed the idiom was undoubtedly his happiest hit yet dr moore in 1789 writes to burns if i were to offer an opinion it would be that in your future productions you should abandon the scotch stanza and dialect and adopt the measure and language of modern english poetry  as the 128th birthanniversary of the poet draws on january 1887 with its increasing clubsuppers vehement celebrations letters speeches and so onmostly as william oconnor says from people who would not have noticed r b at all during his actual life nor kept his company or read his verses on any accountit may be opportune to print some leisurelyjotted notes i find in my budget i take my observation of the scottish bard by considering him as an individual amid the crowded clusters galaxies of the old worldand fairly inquiring and suggesting what out of these myriads he too may be to the western republic in the first place no poet on record so fully bequeaths his own personal magnetism39 nor illustrates more pointedly how ones verses by time and reading can so curiously fuse with the versifiers own life and death and give final light and shade to all  i would say a large part of the fascination of burnss homely simple dialectmelodies is due for all current and future readers to the poets personal errors the general bleakness of his lot his ingraind pensiveness his brief dash into dazzling tantalizing evanescent sunshinefinally culminating in those last years of his life his being tabood and in debt sick and sore yawd as by contending gales deeply dissatisfied with everything most of all with himselfhighspirited toono man ever really higherspirited than robert burns i think it a perfectly legitimate part too at any rate it has come to be an impalpable aroma through which only both the songs and their singer must henceforth be read and absorbd through that viewmedium of misfortuneof a noble spirit in low environments and of a squalid and premature deathwe view the undoubted facts giving as we read them now a sad kind of pungency that burnss were before all else the lyrics of illicit loves and carousing intoxication perhaps even it is this strange impalpable postmortem comment and influence referrd to that gives them their contrast attraction making the zest of their authors after fame if he had lived steady fat moral comfortable welltodo years on his own grade let alone what of course was out of the question the ease and velvet and rosewood and copious royalties of tennyson or victor hugo or longfellow and died wellripend and respectable where could have come in that burst of passionate sobbing and remorse which welld forth instantly and generally in scotland and soon followd everywhere among englishspeaking races on the announcement of his death and which with no sign of stopping only regulated and veind with fitting appreciation flows deeply widely yet  dear rob manly witty fond friendly full of weak spots as well as strong onesessential type of so many thousandsperhaps the average as just said of the decentborn young men and the early midaged not only of the british isles but america too north and south just the same i think indeed one best part of burns is the unquestionable proof he presents of the perennial existence among the laboring classes especially farmers of the finest latent poetic elements in their blood how clear it is to me that the common soil has always been and is now thickly strewn with just such gems he is wellcalled the ploughman holding the plough said his brother gilbert was the favorite situation with robert for poetic compositions and some of his best verses were produced while he was at that exercise i must return to my humble station and woo my rustic muse in my wonted way at the ploughtail 1787 to the earl of buchan he has no high ideal of the poet or the poets office indeed quite a low and contracted notion of both      fortune if thoull but gie me still     hale breeks a scone and whiskey gill     an rowth o rhyme to rave at will     tak a the rest  see also his rhymd letters to robert graham invoking patronage one stronghold lord glencairn being dead now these appeals to fintra my other stay with in one letter a copious shower of vituperation generally in his collected poems there is no particular unity nothing that can be called a leading theory no unmistakable spine or skeleton perhaps indeed their very desultoriness is the charm of his songs i take up one or another he says in a letter to thompson just as the bee of the moment buzzes in my bonnetlug  consonantly with the customs of the timeyet markedly inconsistent in spirit with burnss own case and not a little painful as it remains on record as depicting some features of the bard himself the relation called patronage existed between the nobility and gentry on one side and literary people on the other and gives one of the strongest sidelights to the general coloring of poems and poets it crops out a good deal in burnss letters and even necessitated a certain flunkeyism on occasions through life it probably with its requirements while it helpd in money and countenance did as much as any one cause in making that life a chafed and unhappy one ended by a premature and miserable death  yes there is something about burns peculiarly acceptable to the concrete human points of view he poetizes workaday agricultural labor and life whose spirit and sympathies as well as practicalities are much the same everywhere and treats fresh often coarse natural occurrences loves persons not like many new and some old poets in a genteel style of gilt and china or at second or third removes but in their own born atmosphere laughter sweat unction perhaps no one ever sang lads and lassesthat universal race mainly the same too all ages all landsdown on their own plane as he has he exhibits no philosophy worth mentioning his morality is hardly more than parrottalknot bad or deficient but cheap shopworn the platitudes of old aunts and uncles to the youngsters be good boys and keep your noses clean only when he gets at poosie nansies celebrating the barley bree or among tramps or democratic bouts and drinking generally      freedom and whiskey gang the gither  we have in his own unmistakable color and warmth those interiors of rakehelly life and tavern funthe cantabile of jolly beggars in highest jinkslights and groupings of rank glee and brawny amorousness outvying the best painted pictures of the dutch school or any school  by america and her democracy such a poet i cannot too often repeat must be kept in loving remembrance but it is best that discriminations be made his admirers as at those anniversary suppers over the hot scotch will not accept for their favorite anything less than the highest rank alongside of homer shakspere etc such in candor are not the true friends of the ayrshire bard who really needs a different place quite by himself the iliad and the odyssey express courage craft fullgrown heroism in situations of danger the sense of command and leadership emulation the last and fullest evolution of selfpoise as in kings and godlike even while animal appetites the shaksperean compositions on vertebers and framework of the primary passions portray essentially the same as homers the spirit and letter of the feudal world the norman lord ambitious and arrogant taller and nobler than common menwith much underplay and gusts of heat and cold volcanoes and stormy seas burns and some will say to his credit attempts none of these themes he poetizes the humor riotous blood sulks amorous torments fondness for the tavern and for cheap objective nature with disgust at the grim and narrow ecclesiasticism of his time and land of a young farmer on a bleak and hired farm in scotland through the years and under the circumstances of the british politics of that time and of his short personal career as author from 1783 to 1796 he is intuitive and affectionate and just emerged or emerging from the shackles of the kirk from poverty ignorance and from his own rank appetitesout of which latter however he never extricated himself it is to be said that amid not a little smoke and gas in his poems there is in almost every piece a spark of fire and now and then the real afflatus he has been applauded as democratic and with some warrant while shakspere and with the greatest warrant has been called monarchical or aristocratic which he certainly is but the splendid personalizations of shakspere formulated on the largest freest most heroic most artistic mould are to me far dearer as lessons and more precious even as models for democracy than the humdrum samples burns presents the motives of some of his effusions are certainly discreditable personallyone or two of them markedly so he has moreover little or no spirituality this last is his mortal flaw and defect tried by highest standards the ideal he never reachd and yet i think he leads the way to it he gives melodies and now and then the simplest and sweetest ones but harmonies complications oratorios in words never i do not speak this in any deprecatory sense blessed be the memory of the warmhearted scotchman for what he has left us just as it is he likewise did not know himself in more ways than one though so really fret and independent he prided himself in his songs on being a reactionist and a jacobiteon persistent sentimental adherency to the cause of the stuartsthe weakest thinnest most faithless brainless dynasty that ever held a throne  thus while burns is not at all great for new world study in the sense that isaiah and eschylus and the book of job are unquestionably greatis not to be mentiond with shaksperehardly even with current tennyson or our emersonhe has a nestling niche of his own all fragrant fond and quaint and homelya lodge built near but outside the mighty temple of the gods of song and artthose universal strivers through their works of harmony and melody and power to ever show or intimate mans crowning last victorious fusion in himself of real and ideal precious toofit and precious beyond all singers high or lowwill burns ever be to the native scotch especially to the workingclasses of north britain so intensely one of them and so racy of the soil sights and local customs he often apostrophizes scotland and is or would be enthusiastically patriotic his country has lately commemorated him in a statue40 his aim is declaredly to be a rustic bard his poems were all written in youth or young manhood he was little more than a young man when he died his collected works in giving everything are nearly one half first drafts his brightest hit is his use of the scotch patois so full of terms flavord like wild fruits or berries then i should make an allowance to burns which cannot be made for any other poet curiously even the frequent crudeness haste deficiencies flatness and puerilities by no means absent prove upon the whole not out of keeping in any comprehensive collection of his works heroically printed following copy every piece every line according to originals other poets might tremble for such boldness such rawness in this oddkind chiel such points hardly mar the rest not only are they in consonance with the underlying spirit of the pieces but complete the full abandon and veracity of the farmfields and the homebrewd flavor of the scotch vernacular is there not often something in the very neglect unfinish careless nudity slovenly hiatus coming from intrinsic genius and not put on that secretly pleases the soul more than the wrought and rewrought polish of the most perfect verse mark the native spice and untranslatable twang in the very names of his songso for ane and twenty tam john barleycorn last may a braw wooer rattlin roarin willie o wert thou in the cauld cauld blast gude een to you kimmer merry hae i been teething a heckle o lay thy loof in mine lass and others  the longer and more elaborated poems of burns are just such as would please a natural but homely taste and cute but average intellect and are inimitable in their way the twa dogs one of the best with the conversation between cesar and luath the brigs of ayr the cotters saturday night tam oshanterall will be long read and reread and admired and ever deserve to be with nothing profound in any of them what there is of moral and plot has an inimitably fresh and racy flavor if it came to question literature could well afford to send adrift many a pretensive poem and even book of poems before it could spare these compositions  never indeed was there truer utterance in a certain range of idiosyncrasy than by this poet hardly a piece of his large or small but has snap and raciness he puts in cantering rhyme often doggerel much cutting irony and idiomatic earcuffing of the kirkdeaconsdrilygoodnatured addresses to his cronies he certainly would not stop us if he were here this moment from classing that to the deil among themto mailie and her lambs to auld mare maggie to a mouse      wee sleekit cowrin timrous beastie  to a mountain daisy to a haggis to a louse to the toothache cand occasionally to his brother bards and lady or gentleman patrons often with strokes of tenderest sensibility idiopathic humor and genuine poetic imaginationstill oftener with shrewd original sheeny steelflashes of wit homespun sense or lanceblade puncturing then strangely the basis of burnss character with all its fun and manliness was hypochondria the blues palpable enough in despondency man was made to mourn address to ruin a bards epitaph c from such deepdown elements sprout up in very contrast and paradox those riant utterances of which a superficial reading will not detect the hidden foundation yet nothing is clearer to me than the black and desperate background behind those piecesas i shall now specify them i find his most characteristic natures masterly touch and luxuriant lifeblood color and heat not in tam oshanter the cotters saturday night scots wha hae highland mary the twa dogs and the like but in the jolly beggars rigs of barley scotch drink the epistle to john rankine holy willies prayer and in halloween to say nothing of a certain cluster known still to a small inner circle in scotland but for good reasons not published anywhere in these compositions especially the first there is much indelicacy some editions flatly leave it out but the composer reigns alone with handling free and broad and true and is an artist you may see and feel the man indirectly in his other verses all of them with more or less lifelikenessbut these i have named last call out pronouncedly in his own voice      i rob am here  finally in any summingup of burns though so much is to be said in the way of faultfinding drawing black marks and doubtless severe literary criticismin the present outpouring i have kept myself in rather than allowd any free flowafter full retrospect of his works and life the aforesaid oddkind chiel remains to my heart and brain as almost the tenderest manliest and even if contradictory dearest fleshandblood figure in all the streams and clusters of bygone poets   notes  39 probably no man that ever liveda friend has made the statementwas so fondly loved both by men and women as robert burns the reason is not hard to find he had a real heart of flesh and blood beating in his bosom you could almost hear it throb some one said that if you had shaken hands with him his hand would have burnt yours the gods indeed made him poetical but nature had a hand in him first his heart was in the right place he did not pile up cantos of poetic diction he pluckd the mountain daisy under his feet he wrote of fieldmouse hurrying from its ruind dwelling he held the plough or the pen with the same firm manly grasp and he was loved the simple roll of the women who gave him their affection and their sympathy would make a long manuscript and most of these were of such noble worth that as robert chambers says their character may stand as a testimony in favor of that of burns as i understand the foregoing is from an extremely rare book publishd by mkie in kilmarnock i find the whole beautiful paragraph in a capital paper on burns by amelia barr  40 the dumfries statue of robert burns was successfully unveild april 1881 by lord rosebery the occasion having been made national in its character before the ceremony a large procession paraded the streets of the town all the trades and societies of that part of scotland being represented at the head of which went dairymen and ploughmen the former driving their carts and being accompanied by their maids the statue is of sicilian marble it rests on a pedestal of gray stone five feet high the poet is represented as sitting easily on an old tree root holding in his left hand a cluster of daisies his face is turnd toward the right shoulder and the eyes gaze into the distance near by lie a collie dog a broad bonnet half covering a wellthumbd songbook and a rustic flageolet the costume is taken from the nasmyth portrait which has been followd for the features of the face     a word about tennyson   beautiful as the song was the original locksley hall of half a century ago was essentially morbid heartbroken finding fault with everything especially the fact of moneys being made as it ever must be and perhaps should be the paramount matter in worldly affairs      every door is barrd with gold and opens but to golden keys  first a father having fallen in battle his child the singer      was left a trampled orphan and a selfish uncles ward  of course love ensues the woman in the chant or monologue proves a false one and as far as appears the ideal of woman in the poets reflections is a false oneat any rate for america woman is not the lesser man the heart is not the brain the best of the piece of fifty years since is its concluding line      for the mighty wind arises roaring seaward and i go  then for this current 18867 a justout sequel which as an apparently authentic summary says reviews the life of mankind during the past sixty years and comes to the conclusion that its boasted progress is of doubtful credit to the world in general and to england in particular a cynical vein of denunciation of democratic opinions and aspirations runs throughout the poem in markd contrast with the spirit of the poets youth among the most striking lines of this sequel are the following      envy wears the mask of love and laughing sober fact to scorn     cries to weakest as to strongest ye are equals equal born     equalborn oh yes if yonder hill be level with the flat     charm us orator till the lion look no larger than the cat     till the cat through that mirage of overheated language loom     larger than the lion demoend in working its own doom     tumble nature heel oer head and yelling with the yelling street     set the feet above the brain and swear the brain is in the feet     bring the old dark ages back without the faith without the hope     beneath the state the church the throne and roll their ruins down       the slope  i should say that all this is a legitimate consequence of the tone and convictions of the earlier standards and points of view then some reflections down to the hardpan of this sort of thing  the course of progressive politics democracy is so certain and resistless not only in america but in europe that we can well afford the warning calls threats checks neutralizings in imaginative literature or any department of such deepsounding and highsoaring voices as carlyles and tennysons nay the blindness excesses of the prevalent tendencythe dangers of the urgent trends of our timesin my opinion need such voices almost more than any i should too call it a signal instance of democratic humanitys luck that it has such enemies to contend withso candid so fervid so heroic but why do i say enemies upon the whole is not tennysonand was not carlyle like an honest and stern physicianthe true friend of our age  let me assume to pass verdict or perhaps momentary judgment for the united states on this poeta removd and distant position giving some advantages over a nigh one what is tennysons service to his race times and especially to america first i should sayor at least not forgethis personal character he is not to be mentiondas a rugged evolutionary aboriginal forcebut and a great lesson is in it he has been consistent throughout with the native healthy patriotic spinal element and promptings of himself his moral line is local and conventional but it is vital and genuine he reflects the uppercrust of his time its pale cast of thoughteven its ennui then the simile of my friend john burroughs is entirely true his glove is a glove of silk but the hand is a hand of iron he shows how one can be a royal laureate quite elegant and aristocratic and a little queer and affected and at the same time perfectly manly and natural as to his nondemocracy it fits him well and i like him the better for it i guess we all like to have i am sure i do some one who presents those sides of a thought or possibility different from our owndifferent and yet with a sort of homelikenessa tartness and contradiction offsetting the theory as we view it and construed from tastes and proclivities not at all his own  to me tennyson shows more than any poet i know perhaps has been a warning to me how much there is in finest verbalism there is such a latent charm in mere words cunning collocutions and in the voice ringing them which he has caught and brought out beyond all othersas in the line      and hollow hollow hollow all delight  in the passing of arthur and evidenced in the lady of shalott the deserted house and many other pieces among the best i often linger over them again and again are lucretius the lotos eaters and the northern farmer his mannerism is great but it is a noble and welcome mannerism his very best work to me is containd in the books of the idylls of the king and all that has grown out of them though indeed we could spare nothing of tennyson however small or however peculiarnot break break nor flower in the crannied wall nor the old eternallytold passion of edward gray      love may come and love may go     and fly like a bird from tree to tree     but i will love no more no more     till ellen adair come back to me  yes alfred tennysons is a superb character and will help give illustriousness through the long roll of time to our nineteenth century in its bunch of orbic names shining like a constellation of stars his will be one of the brightest his very faults doubts swervings doublings upon himself have been typical of our age we are like the voyagers of a ship casting off for new seas distant shores we would still dwell in the old suffocating and dead haunts remembering and magnifying their pleasant experiences only and more than once impelld to jump ashore before it is too late and stay where our fathers stayd and live as they lived  maybe i am nonliterary and nondecorous let me at least be human and pay part of my debt in this word about tennyson i want him to realize that here is a great and ardent nation that absorbs his songs and has a respect and affection for him personally as almost for no other foreigner i want this word to go to the old man at farringford as conveying no more than the simple truth and that truth a little christmas gift no slight one either i have written impromptu and shall let it all go at that the readers of more than fifty millions of people in the new world not only owe to him some of their most agreeable and harmless and healthy hours but he has enterd into the formative influences of character here not only in the atlantic cities but inland and far west out in missouri in kansas and away in oregon in farmers house and miners cabin  best thanks anyhow to alfred tennysonthanks and appreciation in americas name     slang in america   viewd freely the english language is the accretion and growth of every dialect race and range of time and is both the free and compacted composition of all from this point of view it stands for language in the largest sense and is really the greatest of studies it involves so much is indeed a sort of universal absorber combiner and conqueror the scope of its etymologies is the scope not only of man and civilization but the history of nature in all departments and of the organic universe brought up to date for all are comprehended in words and their backgrounds this is when words become vitalizd and stand for things as they unerringly and soon come to do in the mind that enters on their study with fitting spirit grasp and appreciation  slang profoundly considerd is the lawless germinal element below all words and sentences and behind all poetry and proves a certain perennial rankness and protestantism in speech as the united states inherit by far their most precious possessionthe language they talk and writefrom the old world under and out of its feudal institutes i will allow myself to borrow a simile even of those forms farthest removed from american democracy considering language then as some mighty potentate into the majestic audiencehall of the monarch ever enters a personage like one of shaksperes clowns and takes position there and plays a part even in the stateliest ceremonies such is slang or indirection an attempt of common humanity to escape from bald literalism and express itself illimitably which in highest walks produces poets and poems and doubtless in prehistoric times gave the start to and perfected the whole immense tangle of the old mythologies for curious as it may appear it is strictly the same impulsesource the same thing slang too is the wholesome fermentation or eructation of those processes eternally active in language by which froth and specks are thrown up mostly to pass away though occasionally to settle and permanently crystallize  to make it plainer it is certain that many of the oldest and solidest words we use were originally generated from the daring and license of slang in the processes of wordformation myriads die but here and there the attempt attracts superior meanings becomes valuable and indispensable and lives forever thus the term right means literally only straight wrong primarily meant twisted distorted integrity meant oneness spirit meant breath or flame a supercilious person was one who raisd his eyebrows to insult was to leap against if you influenced a man you but flowd into him the hebrew word which is translated prophesy meant to bubble up and pour forth as a fountain the enthusiast bubbles up with the spirit of god within him and it pours forth from him like a fountain the word prophecy is misunderstood many suppose that it is limited to mere prediction that is but the lesser portion of prophecy the greater work is to reveal god every true religious enthusiast is a prophet  language be it rememberd is not an abstract construction of the learnd or of dictionarymakers but is something arising out of the work needs ties joys affections tastes of long generations of humanity and has its bases broad and low close to the ground its final decisions are made by the masses people nearest the concrete having most to do with actual land and sea it impermeates all the past as well as the present and is the grandest triumph of the human intellect those mighty works of art says addington symonds which we call languages in the construction of which whole peoples unconsciously cooperated the forms of which were determind not by individual genius but by the instincts of successive generations acting to one end inherent in the nature of the racethose poems of pure thought and fancy cadenced not in words but in living imagery fountainheads of inspiration mirrors of the mind of nascent nations which we call mythologiesthese surely are more marvellous in their infantine spontaneity than any more mature production of the races which evolvd them yet we are utterly ignorant of their embryology the true science of origins is yet in its cradle  daring as it is to say so in the growth of language it is certain that the retrospect of slang from the start would be the recalling from their nebulous conditions of all that is poetical in the stores of human utterance moreover the honest delving as of late years by the german and british workers in comparative philology has piercd and dispersd many of the falsest bubbles of centuries and will disperse many more it was long recorded that in scandinavian mythology the heroes in the norse paradise drank out of the skulls of their slain enemies later investigation proves the word taken for skulls to mean horns of beasts slain in the hunt and what reader had not been exercisd over the traces of that feudal custom by which seigneurs warmd their feet in the bowels of serfs the abdomen being opend for the purpose it now is made to appear that the serf was only required to submit his unharmd abdomen as a foot cushion while his lord supp d and was required to chafe the legs of the seigneur with his hands  it is curiously in embryons and childhood and among the illiterate we always find the groundwork and start of this great science and its noblest products what a relief most people have in speaking of a man not by his true and formal name with a mister to it but by some odd or homely appellative the propensity to approach a meaning not directly and squarely but by circuitous styles of expression seems indeed a born quality of the common people everywhere evidenced by nicknames and the inveterate determination of the masses to bestow subtitles sometimes ridiculous sometimes very apt always among the soldiers during the secession war one heard of little mac gen mcclellan or of uncle billy gen sherman the old man was of course very common among the rank and file both armies it was very general to speak of the different states they came from by their slang names those from maine were calld foxes new hampshire granite boys massachusetts bay

presidents old hickory gen jackson is one case in point tippecanoe and tyler too another  i find the same rule in the peoples conversations everywhere i heard this among the men of the city horsecars where the conductor is often calld a snatcher i e because his characteristic duty is to constantly pull or snatch the bellstrap to stop or go on two young fellows are having a friendly talk amid which says 1st conductor what did you do before you was a snatcher answer of 2d conductor naild translation of answer i workd as carpenter what is a boom says one editor to another esteemd contemporary says the other a boom is a bulge barefoot whiskey is the tennessee name for the undiluted stimulant in the slang of the new york common restaurant waiters a plate of ham and beans is known as stars and stripes codfish balls as sleevebuttons and hash as mystery  the western states of the union are however as may be supposed the special areas of slang not only in conversation but in names of localities towns rivers etc a late oregon traveller says  on your way to olympia by rail you cross a river called the shookumchuck your train stops at places named newaukum tumwater and toutle and if you seek further you will hear of whole counties labell d wahkiakum or snohomish or kitsar or klikatat and cowlitz hookium and nenolelops greet and offend you they complain in olympia that washington territory gets but little immigration but what wonder what man having the whole american continent to choose from would willingly date his letters from the county of snohomish or bring up his children in the city of nenolelops the village of tumwater is as i am ready to bear witness very pretty indeed but surely an emigrant would think twice before he establish d himself either there or at toutle seattle is sufficiently barbarous stelicoom is no better and i suspect that the northern pacific railroad terminus has been fixed at tacoma because it is one of the few places on puget sound whose name does not inspire horror  then a nevada paper chronicles the departure of a mining party from reno the toughest set of roosters that ever shook the dust off any town left reno yesterday for the

are a few of the names of places in butte county cal  perhaps indeed no place or term gives more luxuriant illustrations of the fermentation processes i have mentiond and their froth and specks than

science with its ceaseless evolution its fossils and its numberless submerged layers and hidden strata the infinite gobefore of the present or perhaps language is more like some vast living body or perennial body of bodies and slang not only brings the first feeders of it but is afterward the start of fancy imagination and humor breathing into its nostrils the breath of life     an indian bureau reminiscence   after the close of the secession war in 1865 i workd several months until mr harlan turnd me out for having written leaves of grass in the interior department at washington in the indian bureau along this time there came to see their great father an unusual number of aboriginal visitors delegations for treaties settlement of lands csome young or middleaged but mainly old men from the west north and occasionally from the southparties of from five to twenty eachthe most wonderful proofs of what nature can produce the survival of the fittest no doubtall the frailer samples dropt sorted out by deathas if to show how the earth and woods the attrition of storms and elements and the exigencies of life at first hand can train and fashion men indeed chiefs in heroic massiveness imperturbability muscle and that last and highest beauty consisting of strengththe full exploitation and fruitage of a human identity not from the culminationpoints of culture and artificial civilization but tallying our race as it were with giant vital gnarld enduring trees or monoliths of separate hardiest rocks and humanity holding its own with the best of the said trees or rocks and outdoing them  there were omahas poncas winnebagoes cheyennes navahos apaches and many others let me give a running account of what i see and hear through one of these conference collections at the indian bureau going back to the present tense every head and face is impressive even artistic nature redeems herself out of her crudest recesses most have red paint on their cheeks however or some other paint little hill makes the opening speech which the interpreter translates by scraps many wear head tires of gaudycolord braid wound around thicklysome with circlets of eagles feathers necklaces of bears claws are plenty around their necks most of the chiefs are wrapt in large blankets of the brightest scarlet  two or three have blue and i see one black a wise man calld the flesh now makes a short speech apparently asking something indian commissioner dole answers him and the interpreter translates in scraps again all the principal chiefs have tomahawks or hatchets some of them very richly ornamented and costly plaid shirts are to be observdnone too clean now a tall fellow holeintheday is speaking he has a copious headdress composed of feathers and narrow ribbon under which appears a countenance painted all over a bilious yellow let us note this young chief for all his paint holeintheday is a handsome indian mild and calm dressd in drab buckskin leggings dark gray surtout and a soft black hat his costume will bear full observation and even fashion would accept him his apparel is worn loose and scant enough to show his superb physique especially in neck chest and legs the apollo belvidere was the involuntary exclamation of a famous european artist when he first saw a fullgrown young choctaw  one of the red visitorsa wild leanlooking indian the one in the black woolen wrapperhas an empty buffalo head with the horns on for his personal surmounting i see a markedly bourbonish countenance among the chiefsit is not very uncommon among them i am told most of them avoided resting on chairs during the hour of their talk in the commissioners office they would sit around on the floor leaning against something or stand up by the walls partially wrapt in their blankets though some of the young fellows were as i have said magnificent and beautiful animals i think the palm of unique picturesqueness in body limb physiognomy c was borne by the old or elderly chiefs and the wise men  my herealludedto experience in the indian bureau produced one very definite conviction as follows there is something about these aboriginal americans in their highest characteristic representations essential traits and the ensemble of their physique and physiognomysomething very remote very lofty arousing comparisons with our own civilized idealssomething that our literature portrait painting c have never caught and that will almost certainly never be transmitted to the future even as a reminiscence no biographer no historian no artist has graspd itperhaps could not grasp it it is so different so far outside our standards of eminent humanity their feathers painteven the empty buffalo skulldid not to say the least seem any more ludicrous to me than many of the fashions i have seen in civilized society i should not apply the word savage at any rate in the usual sense as a leading word in the description of those great aboriginal specimens of whom i certainly saw many of the best there were moments as i lookd at them or studied them when our own exemplification of personality dignity heroic presentation anyhow as in the conventions of society or even in the accepted poems and plays seemd sickly puny inferior  the interpreters agents of the indian department or other whites accompanying the bands in positions of responsibility were always interesting to me i had many talks with them occasionally i would go to the hotels where the bands were quarterd and spend an hour or two informally of course we could not have much conversationthough through the interpreters more of this than might be supposed sometimes quite animated and significant i had the good luck to be invariably receivd and treated by all of them in their most cordial manner  letter to w w from an artist b h who has been much among the american indians  i have just receivd your little paper on the indian delegations in the fourth paragraph you say that there is something about the essential traits of our aborigines which will almost certainly never be transmitted to the future if i am so fortunate as to regain my health i hope to weaken the force of that statement at least in so far as my talent and training will permit i intend to spend some years among them and shall endeavor to perpetuate on canvas some of the finer types both men and women and some of the characteristic features of their life it will certainly be well worth the while my artistic enthusiasm was never so thoroughly stirrd up as by the indians they certainly have more of beauty dignity and nobility mingled with their own wild individuality than any of the other indigenous types of man neither black nor afghan arab nor malay and i know them all pretty well can hold a candle to the indian all of the other aboriginal types seem to be more or less distorted from the model of perfect human formas we know itthe blacks thinhipped with bulbous limbs not well markd the arabs largejointed c but i have seen many a young indian as perfect in form and feature as a greek statuevery different from a greek statue of course but as satisfying to the artistic perceptions and demand  and the worst or perhaps the best of it all is that it will require an artistand a good oneto record the real facts and impressions ten thousand photographs would not have the value of one really finely felt painting color is allimportant no one but an artist knows how much an indian is only half an indian without the blueblack hair and the brilliant eyes shining out of the wonderful

partvisit central park almost every day and have for the last three weeks off and on taking observations or short rambles and sometimes riding around i talk quite a good deal with one of the park policemen cc up toward the ninetieth street entrance one day in particular i got him agoing and it proved deeply interesting to me our talk floated into sociology and politics i was curious to find how these things appeard on their surfaces to my friend for he plainly possessd sharp wits and good nature and had been seeing for years broad streaks of humanity somewhat out of my latitude i found that as he took such appearances the inward castespirit of european aristocracy pervaded rich america with cynicism and artificiality at the fore of the bulk of official persons executives congressmen legislators aldermen department heads c c or the candidates for those positions nineteen in twenty in the policemans judgment were just players in a game liberty equality union and all the grand words of the republic were in their mouths but lures decoys chiseld likenesses of dead wood to catch the masses of fine afternoons along the broad tracks of the park for many years had swept by my friend as he stood on guard the carriages c of american gentility not by dozens and scores but by hundreds and thousands lucky brokers capitalists contractors grocerymen successful political strikers rich

few miles from st louis on a charming little river in the wilds of the west near the mississippi i went down that way today by the iron mountain railroadwas switchd off on a sidetrack four miles through woods and ravines to swash creek socalld and there found crystal city and immense glass works built and evidently built to stay right in the pleasant rolling forest spent most of the day and

nothing can exceed the calm fierce golden glistening domination of mars over all the stars in the sky  as we came nearer st louis the night having well set in i saw some to me novel effects in the zinc smelting establishments the tall chimneys belching flames at the top while inside through the openings at the facades of the great tanks burst forth in regular position hundreds of fierce tufts

struck up yankee doodle there were not cannon enough in the southern confederacy to keep him and them in it was when meade fell back k had his large cavalry division perhaps 5000 men but the rebs in superior force had surrounded them things lookd exceedingly desperate k had two fine bands and orderd them up immediately they joind and playd yankee doodle with a will it went through the men like

surrounded by a strong cordon of armd guards and others interspersd between the ranks the government has learnd caution from its experiences there are many hundreds of bounty jumpers and already as i am told eighty thousand deserters next also passing up the avenue a cavalry company young but evidently well drilld and servicehardend men mark the upright posture in their saddles the bronzd and bearded young faces the easy swaying to the motions of the horses and the carbines by their right knees handsome and reckless some eighty of them riding with rapid gait clattering along then the tinkling bells of passing cars the many shops some with large showwindows some with swords straps for the shoulders of different ranks hatcords with acorns or other insignia the military patrol

and handsome regiment 195th pennsylvania were marching byas it happend receivd orders just here to halt and break ranks so that they might rest themselves awhile i thought i never saw a finer set of menso hardy candid bright american looks all weatherbeaten and with warm clothes every man was homeborn my heart was much drawn toward them they seemd very tired red and streaming with sweat it is a oneyear regiment mostly from lancaster county pa have been in shenandoah valley on halting the men unhitchd their knapsacks and sat down to rest themselves some lay flat on the pavement or under trees the fine physical appearance of the whole body was remarkable great very great must be the state where such young farmers and mechanics are the practical average i went around for half an hour and talkd with several of them sometimes squatting down with the groups   lefthand writing by soldiers  april 30 1866here is a single significant fact from which one may judge of the character of the american soldiers in this just concluded war a gentleman in new york city a while since took it into his head to collect specimens of writing from soldiers who had lost their right hands in battle and afterwards learnd to use the left he gave public notice of his desire and offerd prizes for the best of these specimens pretty soon they began to come in and by the time specified for awarding the prizes three hundred samples of such lefthand writing by maimd soldiers had arrived  i have just been looking over some of this writing a great many of the specimens are written in a beautiful manner all are good the writing in nearly all cases slants backward instead of forward one piece of writing from a soldier who had lost both arms was made by holding the pen in his mouth   central virginia in 64  culpepper where i am stopping looks like a place of two or three thousand inhabitants must be one of the pleasantest towns in virginia even now dilapidated fences all broken down windows out it has the remains of much beauty i am standing on an eminence overlooking the town though within its limits to the west the long blue mountain range is very plain looks quite near though from 30 to 50 miles distant with some gray splashes of snow yet visible the show is varied and fascinating i see a great eagle up there in the air sailing with poisd wings quite low squads of redlegged soldiers are drilling i suppose some of the new men of the brooklyn 14th they march off presently with muskets on their shoulders in another place just below me are some soldiers squaring off logs to build a shantychopping away and the noise of the axes sounding sharp i hear the bellowing unmusical screech of the mule i mark the thin blue smoke rising from camp fires just below me is a collection of hospital tents with a yellow flag elevated on a stick and moving languidly in the breeze two discharged men i know them both are just leaving one is so weak he can hardly walk the other is stronger and carries his comrades musket they move slowly along the muddy road toward the depot the scenery is full of breadth and spread on the most generous scale everywhere in virginia this thought filld me the sights the scenes the groups have been varied and picturesque here beyond description and remain so  i heard the men return in force the other nightheard the shouting and got up and went out to hear what was the matter that night scene of so many hundred tramping steadily by through the mud some big flaring torches of pine knots i shall never forget i like to go to the paymasters tent and watch the men getting paid off some have furloughs and start at once for home sometimes amid great chaffing and blarneying there is every day the sound of the woodchopping axe and the plentiful sight of negroes crows and mud i note large droves and pens of cattle the teamsters have camps of their own and i go often among them the officers occasionally invite me to dinner or supper at headquarters the fare is plain but you get something good to drink and plenty of it gen meade is absent sedgwick is in command   paying the 1st u s c t  one of my war time reminiscences comprises the quiet side scene of a visit i made to the first regiment u s colord troops at their encampment and on the occasion of their first paying off july 11 1863 though there is now no difference of opinion worth mentioning there was a powerful opposition to enlisting blacks during the earlier years of the secession war even then however they had their champions that the colord race said a good authority is capable of military training and efficiency is demonstrated by the testimony of numberless witnesses and by the eagerness displayd in the raising organizing and drilling of african troops few white regiments make a better appearance on parade than the first and second louisiana native guards the same remark is true of other colord regiments at millikens bend at vicksburg at port hudson on morris island and wherever tested they have exhibited determind bravery and compelld the plaudits alike of the thoughtful and thoughtless soldiery during the siege of port hudson the question was often askd those who beheld their resolute charges how the niggers behavd under fire and without exception the answer was complimentary to them o tiptop firstrate bully were the usual replies but i did not start out to argue the caseonly to give my reminiscence literally as jotted on the spot at the time  i write this on masons otherwise analostan island under the fine shade trees of an old white stucco house with big rooms the white stucco house originally a fine country seat tradition says the famous virginia mason author of the fugitive slave law was born here i reachd the spot from my washington quarters by ambulance up pennsylvania avenue through georgetown across the aqueduct bridge and around through a cut and winding road with rocks and many bad gullies not lacking after reaching the island we get presently in the midst of the camp of the 1st regiment u s c t the tents look clean and good indeed altogether in locality especially the pleasantest camp i have yet seen the spot is umbrageous high and dry with distant sounds of the city and the puffing steamers of the potomac up to georgetown and back again birds are singing in the trees the warmth is endurable here in this moist shade with the fragrance and freshness a hundred rods across is georgetown the river between is swelld and muddy from the late rains up country so quiet here yet full of vitality all around in the far distance glimpses as i sweep my eye of hills verdureclad and with plenteous trees right where i sit locust sassafras spice and many other trees a few with huge parasitic vines just at hand the banks sloping to the river wild with beautiful free vegetation superb weeds better in their natural growth and forms than the best garden lots of luxuriant grape vines and trumpet flowers the river flowing far down in the distance  now the paying is to begin the major paymaster with his clerk seat themselves at a tablethe rolls are before themthe money box is opendthere are packages of five ten twentyfive cent pieces here comes the first company b some 82 men all blacks certes we cannot find fault with the appearance of this crowdnegroes though they be they are manly enough bright enough look as if they had the soldierstuff in them look hardy patient many of them real handsome young fellows the paying i say has begun the men are marchd up in close proximity the clerk calls off name after name and each walks up receives his money and passes along out of the way it is a real study both to see them come close and to see them pass away stand counting their cashnearly all of this company get ten dollars and three cents each the clerk calls george washington that distinguishd personage steps from the ranks in the shape of a very black man good sized and shaped and aged about 30 with a military mustache he takes his ten three and goes off evidently well pleasd there are about a dozen washingtons in the company let us hope they will do honor to the name at the table how quickly the major handles the bills counts without trouble everything going on smoothly and quickly the regiment numbers today about 1000 men including 20 officers the only whites  now another company these get 536 each the men look well they too have great names besides the washingtons aforesaid john quincy adams daniel webster calhoun james madison alfred tennyson john brown benj g tucker horace greeley c the men step off aside count their money with a pleasd halfpuzzled look occasionally but not often there are some thoroughly african physiognomies very black in color large protruding lips low forehead c but i have to say that i do not see one utterly revolting face  then another company each man of this getting 1003 also the pay proceeds very rapidly the calculation rollsigning c having been arranged beforehand then some trouble one company by the rigid rules of official computation gets only 23 cents each man the company k is indignant and after two or three are paid the refusal to take the paltry sum is universal and the company marches off to quarters unpaid  another company i gets only 70 cents the sullen lowering disappointed look is general half refuse it in this case company g in full dress with brass scales on shoulders lookd perhaps as well as any of the companiesthe men had an unusually alert look these then are the black troopsor the beginning of them well no one can see them even under these circumstancestheir military career in its novitiatewithout feeling well pleasd with them  as we enterd the island we saw scores at a little distance bathing washing their clothes c the officers as far as looks go have a fine appearance have good faces and the air military altogether it is a significant show and brings up some abolition thoughts the scene the porch of an old virginia slaveowners house the potomac rippling near the capitol just down three or four miles there seen through the pleasant blue haze of this july day  after a couple of hours i get tired and go off for a ramble i write these concluding lines on a rock under the shade of a tree on the banks of the island it is solitary here the birds singing the sluggish muddyyellow waters pouring down from the late rains of the upper potomac the green heights on the south side of the river before me the single cannon from a neighboring fort has just been fired to signal high noon i have walkd all around analostan enjoying its luxuriant wildness and stopt in this solitary spot a water snake wriggles down the bank disturbd into the water the bank near by is fringed with a dense growth of shrubbery vines c     five thousand poems   there have been collected in a cluster nearly five thousand big and little american poemsall that diligent and longcontinued research could lay hands on the author of old grimes is dead commenced it more than fifty years ago then the cluster was passd on and accumulated by c f harris then further passd on and added to by the late senator anthony from whom the whole collection has been bequeathd to brown university a catalogue such as it is has been made and publishd of these five thousand poemsand is probably the most curious and suggestive part of the whole affair at any rate it has led me to some abstract reflection like the following  i should like for myself to put on record my devout acknowledgment not only of the great masterpieces of the past but of the benefit of all poets past and present and of all poetic utterancein its entirety the dominant moral factor of humanitys progress in view of that progress and of evolution the religious and esthetic elements the distinctive and most important of any seem to me more indebted to poetry than to all other means and influences combined in a very profound sense religion is the poetry of humanity then the points of union and rapport among all the poems and poets of the world however wide their separations of time and place and theme are much more numerous and weighty than the points of contrast without relation as they may seem at first sight the whole earths poets and poetryen massethe oriental the greek and what there is of romanthe oldest mythsthe interminable balladromances of the middle agesthe hymns and psalms of worshipthe epics plays swarms of lyrics of the british islands or the teutonic old or newor modern frenchor what there is in america bryants for instance or whittiers or longfellowsthe verse of all tongues and ages all forms all subjects from primitive times to our own day inclusivereally combine in one aggregate and electric globe or universe with all its numberless parts and radiations held together by a common centre or verteber to repeat it all poetry thus has to the point of view comprehensive enough more features of resemblance than difference and becomes essentially like the planetary globe itself compact and orbic and whole nature seems to sow countless seedsmakes incessant crude attemptsthankful to get now and then even at rare and long intervals something approximately good     the old bowery   a reminiscence of new york plays and acting fifty years ago   in an article not long since mrs siddons as lady macbeth in the nineteenth century after describing the bitter regretfulness to mankind from the loss of those firstclass poems temples pictures gone and vanishd from any record of men the writer fleeming jenkin continues    if this be our feeling as to the more durable works of art what   shall we say of those triumphs which by their very nature la   no longer than the action which creates themthe triumphs of the   orator the singer or the actor there is an anodyne in the words   must be so inevitable and there is even some absurdity in   longing for the impossible this anodyne and our sense of humor   temper the unhappiness we feel when after hearing some great   performance we leave the theatre and think well this great thing   has been and all that is now left of it is the feeble print up   my brain the little thrill which memory will send along my nerves   mine and my neighbors as we live longer the print and thrill must   be feebler and when we pass away the impress of the great artist   will vanish from the world the regret that a great art should in   its nature be transitory explains the lively interest which many   feel in reading anecdotes or descriptions of a great actor  all this is emphatically my own feeling and reminiscence about the best dramatic and lyric artists i have seen in bygone daysfor instance marietta alboni the elder booth forrest the tenor bettini the baritone badiali old man clarkei could write a whole paper on the latters peerless rendering of the ghost in hamlet at the park when i was a young fellowan actor named ranger who appeard in america forty years ago in genre characters henry placide and many others but i will make a few memoranda at least of the best one i knew  for the elderly new yorker of today perhaps nothing were more likely to start up memories of his early manhood than the mention of the bowery and the elder booth at the date given the more stylish and select theatre prices 50 cents pit 1 boxes was the park a large and wellappointed house on park row opposite the present postoffice english opera and the old comedies were often given in capital style the principal foreign stars appeard here with italian opera at wide intervals the park held a large part in my boyhoods and young manhoods life here i heard the english actor anderson in charles de moor and in the fine part of gisippus here i heard fanny kemble charlotte cushman the seguins daddy rice hackett as falstaff nimrod wildfire rip van winkle and in his yankee characters see pages 19 20 specimen days it was here some years later than the date in the headline i also heard mario many times and at his best in such parts as gennaro in lucrezia borgia he was inimitablethe sweetest of voices a pure tenor of considerable compass and respectable power his wife grisi was with him no longer firstclass or younga fine norma though to the last  perhaps my dearest amusement reminiscences are those musical ones i doubt if ever the senses and emotions of the future will be thrilld as were the auditors of a generation ago by the deep passion of albonis contralto at the broadway theatre south side near pearl streetor by the trumpet notes of badialis baritone or bettinis pensive and incomparable tenor in fernando in favorita or marinis bass in faliero among the havana troupe castle garden  but getting back more specifically to the date and theme i started fromthe heavy tragedy business prevaild more decidedly at the bowery theatre where booth and forrest were frequently to be heard though booth pere then in his prime ranging in age from 40 to 44 years he was born in 1796 was the loyal child and continuer of the traditions of orthodox english playacting he stood out himself alone in many respects beyond any of his kind on record and with effects and ways that broke through all rules and all traditions he has been well describd as an actor whose instant and tremendous concentration of passion in his delineations overwhelmd his audience and wrought into it such enthusiasm that it partook of the fever of inspiration surging through his own veins he seems to have been of beautiful private character very honorable affectionate goodnatured no arrogance glad to give the other actors the best chances he knew all stage points thoroughly and curiously ignored the mere dignities i once talkd with a man who had seen him do the second actor in the mock play to charles keans hamlet in baltimore he was a marvellous linguist he playd shylock once in london giving the dialogue in hebrew and in new orleans oreste racines andromaque in french one trait of his habits i have heard was strict vegetarianism he was exceptionally kind to the brute creation every once in a while he would make a break for solitude or wild freedom sometimes for a few hours sometimes for days he illustrated platos rule that to the forming an artist of the very highest rank a dash of insanity or what the world calls insanity is indispensable he was a smallsized manyet sharp observers noticed that however crowded the stage might be in certain scenes booth never seemd overtopt or hidden he was singularly spontaneous and fluctuating in the same part each rendering differd from any and all others he had no stereotyped positions and made no arbitrary requirements on his fellowperformers  as is well known to old playgoers booths most effective part was richard iii either that or lago or shylock or pescara in the apostate was sure to draw a crowded house remember heavy pieces were much more in demand those days than now he was also unapproachably grand in sir giles overreach in a new way to pay old debts and the principal character in the iron chest  in any portraiture of booth those years the bowery theatre with its leading lights and the lessee and manager thomas hamblin cannot be left out it was at the bowery i first saw edwin forrest the play was john howard paynes brutus or the fall of tarquin and it affected me for weeks or rather i might say permanently filterd into my whole nature then in the zenith of his fame and ability sometimes perhaps a veterans benefit night the bowery would group together five or six of the firstclass actors of those daysbooth forrest cooper hamblin and john r scott for instance at that time and here george jones count joannes was a young handsome actor and quite a favorite i remember seeing him in the title role in julius caesar and a capital performance it was  to return specially to the manager thomas hamblin made a firstrate foil to booth and was frequently cast with him he had a large shapely imposing presence and dark and flashing eyes i remember well his rendering of the main role in maturins bertram or the castle of st aldobrand but i thought tom hamblins best acting was in the comparatively minor part of faulconbridge in king johnhe himself evidently revelld in the part and took away the houses applause from young kean the king and ellen tree constance and everybody else on the stagesome time afterward at the park some of the bowery actresses were remarkably good i remember mrs pritchard in tour de nesle and mrs mcclure in fatal curiosity and as millwood in george barnwell i wonder what old fellow reading these lines will recall the fine comedietta of the youth that never saw a woman and the jolly acting in it of mrs herring and old gates  the bowery now and then was the place too for spectacular pieces such as the last days of pompeii the liondoomd and the yet undying mazeppa at one time jonathan bradford or the murder at the roadside inn had a long and crowded run john sefton and his brother william acted in it i remember well the frenchwoman celeste a splendid pantomimist and her emotional wept of the wishtonwish but certainly the main reason for being of the bowery theatre those years was to furnish the public with forrests and booths performancesthe latter having a popularity and circles of enthusiastic admirers and critics fully equal to the formerthough people were divided as always for some reason or other neither forrest nor booth would accept engagements at the more fashionable theatre the park and it is a curious reminiscence but a true one that both these great actors and their performances were tabood by polite society in new york and boston at the timeprobably as being too robustuous but no such scruples affected the bowery  recalling from that period the occasion of either forrest or booth any good night at the old bowery packd from ceiling to pit with its audience mainly of alert welldressd fullblooded young and middleaged men the best average of americanborn mechanicsthe emotional nature of the whole mass arousd by the power and magnetism of as mighty mimes as ever trod the stagethe whole crowded auditorium and what seethd in it and flushd from its faces and eyes to me as much a part of the show as anybursting forth in one of those longkeptup tempests of handclapping peculiar to the boweryno dainty kidglove business but electric force and muscle from perhaps 2000 fullsinewd menthe inimitable and chromatic tempest of one of those ovations to edwin forrest welcoming him back after an absence comes up to me this momentsuch sounds and scenes as here resumed will surely afford to many old new yorkers some fruitful recollections  i can yet remember for i always scannd an audience as rigidly as a play the faces of the leading authors poets editors of those timesfenimore cooper bryant paulding irving charles king watson webb n p willis hoffman halleck mumford morris leggett l g clarke r a locke and others occasionally peering from the first tier boxes and even the great national eminences presidents adams jackson van buren and tyler all made short visits there on their eastern tours  awhile after 1840 the character of the bowery as hitherto described completely changed cheap prices and vulgar programmes came in people who of after years saw the pandemonium of the pit and the doings on the boards must not gauge by them the times and characters i am describing not but what there was more or less rankness in the crowd even then for types of sectional new york those daysthe streets east of the bowery that intersect division grand and up to third avenuetypes that never found their dickens or hogarth or balzac and have passd away unportraituredthe young shipbuilders cartmen butchers firemen the oldtime soaplock or exaggerated mose or sikesey of chanfraus plays they too were always to be seen in these audiences racy of the east river and the dry dock slang wit occasional shirt sleeves and a picturesque freedom of looks and manners with a rude goodnature and restless movement were generally noticeable yet there never were audiences that paid a good actor or an interesting play the compliment of more sustaind attention or quicker rapport then at times came the exceptionally decorous and intellectual congregations i have hinted it for the bowery really furnishd plays and players you could get nowhere else notably booth always drew the best hearers and to a specimen of his acting i will now attend in some detail  i happend to see what has been reckond by experts one of the most marvellous pieces of histrionism ever known it must have been about 1834 or 35 a favorite comedian and actress at the bowery thomas flynn and his wife were to have a joint benefit and securing booth for richard advertised the fact many days beforehand the house filld early from top to bottom there was some uneasiness behind the scenes for the afternoon arrived and booth had not come from down in maryland where he lived however a few minutes before ringingup time he made his appearance in lively condition  after a oneact farce over as contrast and prelude the curtain rising for the tragedy i can from my good seat in the pit pretty well front see again booths quiet entrance from the side as with head bent he slowly and in silence amid the tempest of boisterous handclapping walks down the stage to the footlights with that peculiar and abstracted gesture musingly kicking his sword which he holds off from him by its sash though fifty years have passd since then i can hear the clank and feel the perfect following hush of perhaps three thousand people waiting i never saw an actor who could make more of the said hush or wait and hold the audience in an indescribable halfdelicious halfirritating suspense and so throughout the entire play all parts voice atmosphere magnetism from      now is the winter of our discontent  to the closing death fight with richmond were of the finest and grandest the latter character was playd by a stalwart young fellow named ingersoll indeed all the renderings were wonderfully good but the great spell cast upon the mass of hearers came from booth especially was the dream scene very impressive a shudder went through every nervous system in the audience it certainly did through mine  without question booth was royal heir and legitimate representative of the garrickkemblesiddons dramatic traditions but he vitalized and gave an unnamable race to those traditions with his own electric personal idiosyncrasy as in all artutterance it was the subtle and powerful something special to the individual that really conquerd  to me too booth stands for much else besides theatricals i consider that my seeing the man those years glimpsd for me beyond all else that inner spirit and formthe unquestionable charm and vivacity but intrinsic sophistication and artificialitycrystallizing rapidly upon the english stage and literature at and after shaksperes time and coming on accumulatively through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to the beginning fifty or forty years ago of those disintegrating decomposing processes now authoritatively going on yes although booth must be classd in that antique almost extinct school inflated stagy rendering shakspere perhaps inevitably appropriately from the growth of arbitrary and often cockney conventions his genius was to me one of the grandest revelations of my life a lesson of artistic expression the words fire energy abandon found in him unprecedented meanings i never heard a speaker or actor who could give such a sting to hauteur or the taunt i never heard from any other the charm of unswervingly perfect vocalization without trenching at all on mere melody the province of music  so much for a thespian temple of new york fifty years since where sceptred tragedy went trailing by under the gaze of the dry dock youth and both players and auditors were of a character and like we shall never see again and so much for the grandest histrion of modern times as near as i can deliberately judge and the phrenologists put my caution at 7grander i believe than kean in the expression of electric passion the prime eligibility of the tragic artist for though those brilliant years had many fine and even magnificent actors undoubtedly at booths death in 1852 went the last and by far the noblest roman of them all     notes to late english books   preface to the reader in

described how during those years i partially recuperated in 1876 from my worst paralysis by going down to timber creek living close to nature and domiciling with my dear friends george and susan stafford from 1877 or 8 to 83 or 4 i was well enough to travel around considerablyjourneyd westward to kansas leisurely exploring the prairies and on to denver and the rocky mountains another time north to canada where i spent most of the summer with my friend dr bucke and jaunted along the great lakes and the st lawrence and saguenay rivers another time to boston to properly print the final edition of my poems i was there over two months and had a good time i have so brought out the completed leaves of grass during this period also specimen days of which the foregoing is a transcript collected and reedited the democratic vistas cluster see companion volume to the presentcommemorated abraham lincolns death on the successive anniversaries of its occurrence by delivering my lecture on it ten or twelve times and put in through many a month and season the aimless and resultless ways of most human lives  thus the last 14 years have passd at present enddays of march 1887i am nigh entering my 69th year i find myself continuing on here quite dilapidated and even wreckd bodily from the paralysis cbut in good heart to use a long island country phrase and with about the same mentality as ever the worst of it is i have been growing feebler quite rapidly for a year and now cant walk aroundhardly from one room to the next i am forced to stay indoors and in my big chair nearly all the time we have had a sharp dreary winter too and it has pinchd me i am alone most of the time every week indeed almost every day write somereminiscences essays sketches for the magazines and read or rather i should say dawdle over books and papers a good dealspend half the day at that  nor can i finish this note without putting on recordwafting over sea from hencemy deepest thanks to certain friends and helpers i would specify them all and each by name but imperative reasons outside of my own wishes forbid in the british islands as well as in america dear even in the abstract is such flattering unction always no doubt to the soul nigher still if possible i myself have been and am today indebted to such help for my very sustenance clothing shelter and continuity and i would not go to the grave without briefly but plainly as i here do acknowledgingmay i not say even glorying in it   preface to democratic vistas with other papersenglish edition  mainly i think i should base the request to weigh the following pages on the assumption that they present however indirectly some views of the west and modern or of a distinctly western and modern american tendency about certain matters then too the pages include by attempting to illustrate it a theory herein immediately mentioned for another and different point of the issue the enlightenment democracy and fairshow of the bulk the common people of america from sources representing not only the british islands but all the world means at least eligibility to enlightenment democracy and fairshow for the bulk the common people of all civilized nations  that positively the dry land has appeared at any rate is an important fact  america is really the great test or trial case for all the problems and promises and speculations of humanity and of the past and present  i say too we41 are not to look so much to changes ameliorations and adaptations in politics as to those of literature and thence domestic sociology i have accordingly in the following melange introduced many themes besides political ones  several of the pieces are ostensibly in explanation of my own writings but in that very process they best include and set forth their side of principles and generalities pressing vehemently for consideration our age  upon the whole it is on the atmosphere they are born in and i hope give out more than any specific piece or trait i would care to rest  i think literaturea new superb democratic literatureis to be the medicine and lever and with art the chief influence in modern civilization i have myself not so much made a dead set at this theory or attempted to present it directly as admitted it to color and sometimes dominate what i had to say in both europe and america we have serried phalanxes who promulge and defend the political claims i go for an equal force to uphold the other  walt whitman  camden new jersey april 1888    note  41 we who in many departments ways make the building up of the masses by building up grand individuals our shibboleth and in brief that is the marrow of this book     abraham lincoln   glad am i to givewere anything better lackingeven the most brief and shorn testimony of abraham lincoln everything i heard about him authentically and every time i saw him and it was my fortune through 1862 to 65 to see or pass a word with or watch him personally perhaps twenty or thirty times added to and anneald my respect and love at the moment and as i dwell on what i myself heard or saw of the mighty westerner and blend it with the history and literature of my age and of what i can get of all ages and conclude it with his death it seems like some tragic play superior to all else i knowvaster and fierier and more convulsionary for this america of ours than eschylus or shakspere ever drew for athens or for england and then the moral permeating underlying all the lesson that none so remotenone so illiterateno age no classbut may directly or indirectly read  abraham lincolns was really one of those characters the best of which is the result of long trains of cause and effectneeding a certain spaciousness of time and perhaps even remoteness to properly enclose themhaving unequald influence on the shaping of this republic and therefore the world as today and then far more important in the future thus the time has by no means yet come for a thorough measurement of him nevertheless we who live in his erawho have seen him and heard him face to face and are in the midst of or just parting from the strong and strange events which he and we have had to do withcan in some respects bear valuable perhaps indispensable testimony concerning him  i should first like to give a very fair and characteristic likeness of lincoln as i saw him and watchd him one afternoon in washington for nearly half an hour not long before his death it was as he stood on the balcony of the national hotel pennsylvania avenue making a short speech to the crowd in front on the occasion either of a set of new colors presented to a famous illinois regiment or of the daring capture by the western men of some flags from the enemy which latter phrase by the by was not used by him at all in his remarks how the picture happend to be made i do not know but i bought it a few days afterward in washington and it was endorsd by every one to whom i showd it though hundreds of portraits have been made by painters and photographers many to pass on by copies to future times i have never seen one yet that in my opinion deservd to be called a perfectly good likeness nor do i believe there is really such a one in existence may i not say too that as there is no entirely competent and emblematic likeness of abraham lincoln in picture or statue there is notperhaps cannot beany fully appropriate literary statement or summingup of him yet in existence  the best way to estimate the value of lincoln is to think what the condition of america would be today if he had never livednever been president his nomination and first election were mainly accidents experiments severely viewd one cannot think very much of american political parties from the beginning after the revolutionary war down to the present time doubtless while they have had their useshave been and are the grass on which the cow feedsand indispensable economies of growthit is undeniable that under flippant names they have merely identified temporary passions or freaks or sometimes prejudice ignorance or hatred the only thing like a great and worthy idea vitalizing a party and making it heroic was the enthusiasm in 64 for reelecting abraham lincoln and the reason behind that enthusiasm  how does this man compare with the acknowledgd father of his country washington was modeld on the best saxon and franklinof the age of the stuarts rooted in the elizabethan periodwas essentially a noble englishman and just the kind needed for the occasions and the times of 177683 lincoln underneath his practicality was far less european was quite thoroughly western original essentially nonconventional and had a certain sort of outdoor or prairie stamp one of the best of the late commentators on shakspere professor dowden makes the height and aggregate of his quality as a poet to be that he thoroughly blended the ideal with the practical or realistic if this be so i should say that what shakspere did in poetic expression abraham lincoln essentially did in his personal and official life i should say the invisible foundations and vertebra of his character more than any mans in history were mystical abstract moral and spiritualwhile upon all of them was built and out of all of them radiated under the control of the average of circumstances what the vulgar call horsesense and a life often bent by temporary but most urgent materialistic and political reasons  he seems to have been a man of indomitable firmness even obstinacy on rare occasions involving great points but he was generally very easy flexible tolerant almost slouchy respecting minor matters i note that even those reports and anecdotes intended to level him down all leave the tinge of a favorable impression of him as to his religious nature it seems to me to have certainly been of the amplest deepestrooted loftiest kind  already a new generation begins to tread the stage since the persons and events of the secession war i have more than once fancied to myself the time when the present century has closed and a new one opend and the men and deeds of that contest have become somewhat vague and mythicalfancied perhaps in some great western city or group collected together or public festival where the days of old of 1863 and 4 and 5 are discussdsome ancient soldier sitting in the background as the talk goes on and betraying himself by his emotion and moist eyeslike the journeying ithacan at the banquet of king alcinoiis when the bard sings the contending warriors and their battles on the plains of troy      so from the sluices of ulysses eyes     fast fell the tears and sighs succeeded sighs  i have fancied i say some such venerable relic of this time of ours preservd to the next or still the next generation of america i have fancied on such occasion the young men gathering around the awe the eager questions what have you seen abraham lincolnand heard him speakand touchd his hand have you with your own eyes lookd on grant and lee and sherman  dear to democracy to the very last and among the paradoxes generated by america not the least curious was that spectacle of all the kings and queens and emperors of the earth many from remote distances sending tributes of condolence and sorrow in memory of one raisd through the commonest average of lifea railsplitter and flatboatman  considerd from contemporary points of viewwho knows what the future may decideand from the points of view of current democracy and the union the only thing like passion or infatuation in the man was the passion for the union of these states abraham lincoln seems to me the grandest figure yet on all the crowded canvas of the nineteenth century      new orleans in 1848  walt whitman gossips of his sojourn here years ago as a newspaper writer notes of his trip up the mississippi and to new york  among the letters brought this morning camden new jersey jan 15 1887 by my faithful postoffice carrier jg is one as follows  new orleans jan 11 87we have been informed that when you were younger and less famous than now you were in new orleans and perhaps have helped on the picayune if you have any remembrance of the picayunes young days or of journalism in new orleans of that era and would put it in writing verse or prose for the picayunes fiftieth year edition jan 25 we shall be pleased etc  in response to which i went down to new orleans early in 1848 to work on a daily newspaper but it was not the picayune though i saw quite a good deal of the editors of that paper and knew its personnel and ways but let me indulge my pen in some gossipy recollections of that time and place with extracts from my journal up the mississippi and across the great lakes to the hudson  probably the influence most deeply pervading everything at that time through the united states both in physical facts and in sentiment was the mexican war then just ended following a brilliant campaign in which our troops had marchd to the capital city mexico and taken full possession we were returning after our victory from the situation of the country the city of new orleans had been our channel and entrepot for everything going and returning it had the best news and war correspondents it had the most to say through its leading papers the picayune and delta especially and its voice was readiest listend to from it chapparal had gone out and his army and battle letters were copied everywhere not only in the united states but in europe then the social cast and results no one who has never seen the society of a city under similar circumstances can understand what a strange vivacity and rattle were given throughout by such a situation i remember the crowds of soldiers the gay young officers going or coming the receipt of important news the many discussions the returning wounded and so on  i remember very well seeing gen taylor with his staff and other officers at the st charles theatre one evening after talking with them during the day there was a short play on the stage but the principal performance was of dr colyers troupe of model artists then in the full tide of their popularity they gave many fine groups and solo shows the house was crowded with uniforms and shoulderstraps gen t himself if i remember right was almost the only officer in civilian clothes he was a jovial old rather stout plain man with a wrinkled and darkyellow face and in ways and manners showd the least of conventional ceremony or etiquette i ever saw he laughd unrestrainedly at everything comical he had a great personal resemblance to fenimore cooper the novelist of new york i remember gen pillow and quite a cluster of other militaires also present  one of my choice amusements during my stay in new orleans was going down to the old french market especially of a sunday morning the show was a varied and curious one among the rest the indian and negro hucksters with their wares for there were always fine specimens of indians both men and women young and old i remember i nearly always on these occasions got a large cup of delicious coffee with a biscuit for my breakfast from the immense shining copper kettle of a great creole mulatto woman i believe she weighd 230 pounds i never have had such coffee since about nice drinks anyhow my recollection of the cobblers with strawberries and snow on top of the large tumblers and also the exquisite wines and the perfect and mild french brandy help the regretful reminiscence of my new orleans experiences of those days and what splendid and roomy and leisurely barrooms particularly the grand ones of the st charles and st louis bargains auctions appointments business conferences c were generally held in the spaces or recesses of these barrooms  i used to wander a midday hour or two now and then for amusement on the crowded and bustling levees on the banks of the river the diagonally wedgdin boats the stevedores the piles of cotton and other merchandise the carts mules negroes etc afforded neverending studies and sights to me i made acquaintances among the captains boatmen or other characters and often had long talks with themsometimes finding a real rough diamond among my chance encounters sundays i sometimes went forenoons to the old catholic cathedral in the french quarter i used to walk a good deal in this arrondissement and i have deeply regretted since that i did not cultivate while i had such a good opportunity the chance of better knowledge of french and spanish creole new orleans people i have an idea that there is much and of importance about the latin race contributions to american nationality in the south and southwest that will never be put with sympathetic understanding and tact on record  let me say for better detail that through several months 1848 i workd on a new daily paper the crescent my situation rather a pleasant one my young brother jeff was with me and he not only grew very homesick but the climate of the place and especially the water seriously disagreed with him from this and other reasons although i was quite happily fixd i made no very long stay in the south in due time we took passage northward for st louis in the pride of the west steamer which left her wharf just at dusk my brother was unwell and lay in his berth from the moment we left till the next morning he seemd to me to be in a fever and i felt alarmd however the next morning he was all right again much to my relief  our voyage up the mississippi was after the same sort as the voyage some months before down it the shores of this great river are very monotonous and dullone continuous and rank flat with the exception of a meagre stretch of bluff about the neighborhood of natchez memphis c fortunately we had good weather and not a great crowd of passengers though the berths were all full the pride joggd along pretty well and put us into st louis about noon saturday after looking around a little i secured passage on the steamer prairie bird to leave late in the afternoon bound up the illinois river to la salle where we were to take canal for chicago during the day i rambled with my brother over a large portion of the town searchd after a refectory and after much trouble succeeded in getting some dinner  our prairie bird started out at dark and a couple of hours after there was quite a rain and blow which made them haul in along shore and tie fast we made but thirty miles the whole night the boat was excessively crowded with passengers and had withal so much freight that we could hardly turn around i slept on the floor and the night was uncomfortable enough the illinois river is spotted with little villages with big names marseilles naples etc its banks are low and the vegetation excessively rank peoria some distance up is a pleasant town i went over the place the country back is all rich land for sale cheap three or four miles from p land of the first quality can be bought for 3 or 4 an acre i am transcribing from my notes written at the time  arriving at la salle tuesday morning we went on board a canalboat had a detention by sticking on a mud bar and then joggd along at a slow trot some seventy of us on a moderatesized boat if the weather hadnt been rather cool particularly at night it would have been insufferable illinois is the most splendid agricultural country i ever saw the land is of surpassing richness the place par excellence for farmers we stopt at various points along the canal some of them pretty villages  it was 10 oclock am when we got in chicago too late for the steamer so we went to an excellent public house the american temperance and i spent the time that day and till next morning looking around chicago  at 9 the next forenoon we started on the griffith on board of which i am now inditing these memoranda up the blue waters of lake michigan i was delighted with the appearance of the towns along wisconsin at milwaukee i went on shore and walkd around the place they say the country back is beautiful and rich it seems to me that if we should ever remove from long island wisconsin would be the proper place to come to the towns have a remarkable appearance of good living without any penury or want the country is so good naturally and labor is in such demand  about 5 oclock one afternoon i heard the cry of a woman overboard it proved to be a crazy lady who had become so from the loss of her son a couple of weeks before the small boat put off and succeeded in picking her up though she had been in the water 15 minutes she was dead her husband was on board they went off at the next stopping place while she lay in the water she probably recoverd her reason as she tossd up her arms and lifted her face toward the boat  sunday morning june 11we passd down lake huron yesterday and last night and between 4 and 5 oclock this morning we ran on the flats and have been vainly trying with the aid of a steam tug and a lumbering lighter to get clear again the day is beautiful and the water clear and calm night before last we stopt at mackinaw the island and town and i went up on the old fort one of the oldest stations in the northwest we expect to get to buffalo by tomorrow the tug has fastend lines to us but some have been snapt and the others have no effect we seem to be firmly imbedded in the sand with the exception of a larger boat and better accommodations it amounts to about the same thing as a becalmment i underwent on the montauk voyage east long island last summer laterwe are off againexpect to reach detroit before dinner  we did not stop at detroit we are now on lake erie jogging along at a good round pace a couple of hours since we were on the river above detroit seemd to me a pretty place and thrifty i especially liked the looks of the canadian shore opposite and of the little village of windsor and indeed all along the banks of the river from the shrubbery and the neat appearance of some of the cottages i think it must have been settled by the french while i now write we can see a little distance ahead the scene of the battle between perrys fleet and the british during the last war with england the lake looks to me a fine sheet of water we are having a beautiful day  june 12we stopt last evening at cleveland and though it was dark i took the opportunity of rambling about the place went up in the heart of the city and back to what appeard to be the courthouse the streets are unusually wide and the buildings appear to be substantial and comfortable we went down through main street and found some distance along several squares of ground very prettily planted with trees and looking attractive enough returnd to the boat by way of the lighthouse on the hill  this morning we are making for buffalo being i imagine a little more than half across lake erie the water is rougher than on michigan or huron on st clair it was smooth as glass the day is bright and dry with a stiff head wind  we arrivd in buffalo on monday evening spent that night and a portion of next day going round the city exploring then got in the cars and went to niagara went under the fallssaw the whirlpool and all the other sights  tuesday night started for albany traveld all night from the time daylight afforded us a view of the country all seemd very rich and well cultivated every few miles were large towns or villages  wednesday late we arrivd at albany spent the evening in exploring there was a political meeting hunker at the capitol but i passd it by next morning i started down the hudson in the alida arrivd safely in new york that evening  from the new orleans picayune jan 25 1887     small memoranda  thousands losthere one or two preservd   attorney generals office washington aug 22 1865as i write this about noon the suite of rooms here is filld with southerners standing in squads or streaming in and out some talking with the pardon clerk some waiting to see the attorney general others discussing in low tones among themselves all are mainly anxious about their pardons the famous 13th exception of the presidents amnesty proclamation of  makes it necessary that every secessionist whose property is worth 20000 or over shall get a special pardon before he can transact any legal purchase sale c so hundreds and thousands of such property owners have either sent up here for the last two months or have been or are now coming personally here to get their pardons they are from virginia georgia alabama mississippi north and south carolina and every southern state some of their written petitions are very abject secession officers of the rank of brigadier general or higher also need these special pardons they also come here i see streams of the 20000 men and some women every day i talk now and then with them and learn much that is interesting and significant all the southern women that come some splendid specimens mothers c are dressd in deep black  immense numbers several thousands of these pardons have been passd upon favorably the pardon warrants like great deeds have been issued from the state department on the requisition of this office but for some reason or other they nearly all yet lie awaiting the presidents signature he seems to be in no hurry about it but lets them wait  the crowds that come here make a curious study for me i get along very sociably with any of themas i let them do all the talking only now and then i have a long confab or ask a suggestive question or two  if the thing continues as at present the property and wealth of the southern states is going to legally rest for the future on these pardons every single one is made out with the condition that the grantee shall respect the abolition of slavery and never make an attempt to restore it  washington sept 8 9 c 1865the arrivals swarms c of the 20000 men seeking pardons still continue with increasd numbers and pertinacity i yesterday i am a clerk in the u s attorney generals office here made out a long list from alabama nearly 200 recommended for pardon by the provisional governor this list in the shape of a requisition from the attorney general goes to the state department there the pardon warrants are made out brought back here and then sent to the president where they await his signature he is signing them very freely of late  the president indeed as at present appears has fixd his mind on a very generous and forgiving course toward the returnd secessionists he will not countenance at all the demand of the extreme philoafrican element of the north to make the right of negro voting at elections a condition and sine qua non of the reconstruction of the united states south and of their resumption of coequality in the union   a glint inside of abraham lincolns cabinet appointments one item of many  while it was hanging in suspense who should be appointed secretary of the interior to take the place of caleb smith the choice was very close between mr harlan and col jesse k dubois of illinois the latter had many friends he was competent he was honest and he was a man mr harlan in the race finally gaind the methodist interest and got himself to be considerd as identified with it and his appointment was apparently askd for by that powerful body bishop simpson of philadephia came on and spoke for the selection the president was much perplexd the reasons for appointing col dubois were very strong almost insuperableyet the argument for mr harlan under the adroit position he had placd himself was heavy those who pressd him adducd the magnitude of the methodists as a body their loyalty more general and genuine than any other sectthat they represented the west and had a right to be heardthat all or nearly all the other great denominations had their representatives in the heads of the governmentthat they as a body and the great sectarian power of the west formally askd mr harlans appointmentthat he was of them having been a methodist ministerthat it would not do to offend them but was highly necessary to propitiate them  mr lincoln thought deeply over the whole matter he was in more than usual tribulation on the subject let it be enough to say that though mr harlan finally receivd the secretaryship col dubois came as near being appointed as a man could and not be the decision was finally made one night about 10 oclock bishop simpson and other clergymen and leading persons in mr harlans behalf had been talking long and vehemently with the president a member of congress who was pressing col duboiss claims was in waiting the president had told the bishop that he would make a decision that evening and that he thought it unnecessary to be pressd any more on the subject that night he calld in the mc above alluded to and said to him tell uncle jesse that i want to give him this appointment and yet i cannot i will do almost anything else in the world for him i am able i have thought the matter all over and under the circumstances think the methodists too good and too great a body to be slighted they have stood by the government and helpd us their very best i have had no better friends and as the case stands i have decided to appoint mr harlan   note to a friend  written on the flyleaf of a copy of

good time  ww   the place gratitude fills in a fine character  from the philadelphia press nov 27 1884 thanksgiving number  scenea large family supper party a night or two ago with voices and laughter of the young mellow faces of the old and a byandby pause in the general joviality now mr whitman spoke up one of the girls what have you to say about thanksgiving wont you give us a sermon in advance to sober us down the sage nodded smilingly lookd a moment at the blaze of the great wood fire ran his forefinger right and left through the heavy white mustache that might have otherwise impeded his voice and began thanksgiving goes probably far deeper than you folks suppose i am not sure but it is the source of the highest poetryas in parts of the bible ruskin indeed makes the central source of all great art to be praise gratitude to the almighty for life and the universe with its objects and play of action  we americans devote an official day to it every year yet i sometimes fear the real article is almost dead or dying in our selfsufficient independent republic gratitude anyhow has never been made half enough of by the moralists it is indispensable to a complete character mans or womansthe disposition to be appreciative thankful that is the main matter the element inclinationwhat geologists call the trend of my own life and writings i estimate the giving thanks part with what it infers as essentially the best item i should say the quality of gratitude rounds the whole emotional nature i should say love and faith would quite lack vitality without it there are peopleshall i call them even religious people as things gowho have no such trend to their disposition     last of the war cases  memorandized at the time washington 186566   of reminiscences of the secession war after the rest is said i have thought it remains to give a few special wordsin some respects at the time the typical words of all and most definiteof the samples of the killd and wounded in action and of soldiers who lingerd afterward from these wounds or were laid up by obstinate disease or prostration the general statistics have been printed already but can bear to be briefly stated again there were over 3000000 men for all periods of enlistment large and small furnishd to the union army during the war new york state furnishing over 500000 which was the greatest number of any one state the losses by disease wounds killd in action accidents c were altogether about 600000 or approximating to that number over 4000000 cases were treated in the main and adjudicatory army hospitals the number sounds strange but it is true more than twothirds of the deaths were from prostration or disease today there lie buried over 300000 soldiers in the various national army cemeteries more than half of them and that is really the most significant and eloquent bequest of the war markd unknown in full mortuary statistics of the war the greatest deficiency arises from our not having the rolls even as far as they were kept of most of the southern military prisonsa gap which probably both adds to and helps conceal the indescribable horrors of those places it is however restricting one vivid point only certain that over 30000 union soldiers died largely of actual starvation in them and now leaving all figures and their sum totals i feel sure a few genuine memoranda of such thingssome cases jotted down 64 65 and 66made at the time and on the spot with all the associations of those scenes and places brought back will not only go directest to the right spot but give a clearer and more actual sight of that period than anything else before i give the last cases i begin with verbatim extracts from letters home to my mother in brooklyn the second year of the warww  washington oct 13 1863there has been a new lot of wounded and sick arriving for the last three days the first and second days long strings of ambulances with the sick yesterday the worst many with bad and bloody wounds inevitably long neglected i thought i was cooler and more used to it but the sight of some cases brought tears into my eyes i had the luck yesterday however to do lots of good had provided many nourishing articles for the men for another quarter but fortunately had my stores where i could use them at once for these newcomers as they arrived faint hungry faggd out from their journey with soild clothes and all bloody i distributed these articles gave partly to the nurses i knew or to those in charge as many as possible i fed myself then i found a lot of oyster soup handy and bought it all at once  it is the most pitiful sight this when the men are first brought in from some camp hospital broke up or a part of the army moving these who arrived yesterday are cavalry men our troops had fought like devils but got the worst of it they were kilpatricks cavalry were in the rear part of meades retreat and the reb cavalry knowing the ground and taking a favorable opportunity dashd in between cut them off and shelld them terribly but kilpatrick turnd and brought them out mostly it was last sunday one of the most terrible sights and tasks is of such receptions  oct 27 1863if any of the soldiers i know or their parents or folks should call upon youas they are often anxious to have my address in brooklynyou just use them as you know how and if you happen to have potluck and feel to ask them to take a bite dont be afraid to do so i have a friend thomas neat 2d ny cavalry wounded in leg now home in jamaica on furlough he will probably call then possibly a mr haskell or some of his folks from western new york he had a son died here and i was with the boy a good deal the old man and his wife have written me and askd me my brooklyn address he said he had children in new york and was occasionally down there when i come home i will show you some of the letters i get from mothers sisters fathers c they will make you cry  how the time passes away to think it is over a year since i left home suddenlyand have mostly been down in front since the year has vanishd swiftly and oh what scenes i have witnessd during that time and the war is not settled yet and one does not see anything certain or even promising of a settlement but i do not lose the solid feeling in myself that the union triumph is assured whether it be sooner or whether it be later or whatever roundabout way we may be led there and i find i dont change that conviction from any reverses we meet nor delays nor blunders one realizes here in washington the great labors even the negative ones of lincoln that it is a big thing to have just kept the united states from being thrown down and having its throat cut i have not waverd or had any doubt of the issue since gettysburg  8th september 63here now is a specimen army hospital case lorenzo strong co a 9th united states cavalry shot by a shell last sunday right leg amputated on the field sent up here monday night 14th seemd to be doing pretty well till wednesday noon 16th when he took a turn for the worse and a strangely rapid and fatal termination ensued though i had much to do i staid and saw all it was a deathpicture characteristic of these

the doctor comes in and gives him a little chloroform one of the nurses constantly fans him for it is fearfully hot he asks to be raisd up and they put him in a halfsitting posture he calld for mark repeatedly halfdeliriously all day life ebbs runs now with the speed of a mill race his splendid neck as it lays all open works still slightly his eyes turn back a religious person coming in offers a prayer in subdued tones bent at the foot of the bed and in the space of the aisle a crowd including two or three doctors several students and many soldiers has silently gatherd it is very still and warm as the struggle goes on and dwindles a little more and a little moreand then welcome oblivion painlessness death a pause the crowd drops away a white bandage is bound around and under the jaw the propping pillows are removed the limpsy head falls down the arms are softly placed by the side all composed all stilland the broad white sheet is thrown over everything  april 10 1864unusual agitation all around concentrated here exciting times in congress the copperheads are getting furious and want to recognize the southern confederacy this is a pretty time to talk of recognizing such said a pennsylvania officer in hospital to me today after what has transpired the last three years after first fredericksburg i felt discouraged myself and doubted whether our rulers could carry on the war but that has passd away the war must be carried on i would willingly go in the ranks myself if i thought it would profit more than as at present and i dont know sometimes but i shall as it is then there is certainly a strange deep fervid feeling formd or arousd in the land hard to describe or name it is not a majority feeling but it will make itself felt m you dont know what a nature a fellow gets not only after being a soldier a while but after living in the sights and influences of the camps the wounded ca nature he never experienced before the stars and stripes the tune of yankee doodle and similar things produce such an effect on a fellow as never before i have seen them bring tears on some mens cheeks and others turn pale with emotion i have a little flag it belongd to one of our cavalry regiments presented to me by one of the wounded it was taken by the secesh in a fight and rescued by our men in a bloody skirmish following it cost three mens lives to get back that fourbythree flagto tear it from the breast of a dead rebelfor the name of getting their little rag back again the man that secured it was very badly wounded and they let him keep it i was with him a good deal he wanted to give me some keepsake he saidhe didnt expect to liveso he gave me that flag the best of it all is dear m there isnt a regiment cavalry or infantry that wouldnt do the like on the like occasion  april 12i will finish my letter this morning it is a beautiful day i was up in congress very late last night the house had a very excited night session about expelling the men that proposed recognizing the southern confederacy you ought to hear as i do the soldiers talk they are excited to madness we shall probably have hot times here not in the military fields alone the body of the army is true and firm as the north star  may 6 64m the poor soldier with diarrhoea is still living but oh what a looking object death would be a relief to himhe cannot last many hours cunningham the ohio soldier with leg amputated at thigh has pickd up beyond expectation now looks indeed like getting well he died a few weeks afterwards the hospitals are very full i am very well indeed hot here today  may 23 64sometimes i think that should it come when it must to fall in battle ones anguish over a son or brother killd might be temperd with much to take the edge off lingering and extreme suffering from wounds or sickness seem to me far worse than death in battle i can honestly say the latter has no terrors for me as far as i myself am concernd then i should say too about death in war that our feelings and imaginations make a thousand times too much of the whole matter of the many i have seen die or known of the past year i have not seen or known one who met death with terror in most cases i should say it was a welcome relief and release yesterday i spent a good part of the afternoon with a young soldier of seventeen charles cutter of lawrence city massachusetts 1st massachusetts heavy artillery battery m he was brought to one of the hospitals mortally wounded in abdomen well i thought to myself as i sat looking at him it ought to be a relief to his folks if they could see how little he really sufferd he lay very placid in a half lethargy with his eyes closed as it was extremely hot and i sat a good while silently fanning him and wiping the sweat at length he opend his eyes quite wide and clear and lookd inquiringly around i said what is it my boy do you want anything he answerd quietly with a goodnatured smile oh nothing i was only looking around to see who was with me his mind was somewhat wandering yet he lay in an evident peacefulness that sanity and health might have envied i had to leave for other engagements he died i heard afterward without any special agitation in the course of the night  washington may 26 63m i think something of commencing a series of lectures readings talks c through the cities of the north to supply myself with funds for hospital ministrations i do not like to be so beholden to others i need a pretty free supply of money and the work grows upon me and fascinates me it is the most magnetic as well as terrible sight the lots of poor wounded and helpless men depending so much in one ward or another upon my soothing or talking to them or rousing them up a little or perhaps petting or feeding them their dinner or supper here is a patient for instance wounded in both arms or giving some trifle for a novelty or changeanything however trivial to break the monotony of those hospital hours  it is curious when i am present at the most appalling scenes deaths operations sickening wounds perhaps full of maggots i keep cool and do not give out or budge although my sympathies are very much excited but often hours afterward perhaps when i am home or out walking alone i feel sick and actually tremble when i recall the case again before me  sunday afternoon opening of 1865passd this afternoon among a collection of unusually bad cases wounded and sick secession soldiers left upon our hands i spent the previous sunday afternoon there also at that time two were dying two others have died during the week several of them are partly deranged i went around among them elaborately poor boys they all needed to be cheerd up as i sat down by any particular one the eyes of all the rest in the neighboring cots would fix upon me and remain steadily riveted as long as i sat within their sight nobody seemd to wish anything special to eat or drink the main thing askd for was postage stamps and paper for writing i distributed all the stamps i had tobacco was wanted by some  one calld me over to him and askd me in a low tone what denomination i belongd to he said he was a catholicwishd to find some one of the same faithwanted some good reading i gave him something to read and sat down by him a few minutes moved around with a word for each they were hardly any of them personally attractive cases and no visitors come here of course they were all destitute of money i gave small sums to two or three apparently the most needy the men are from quite all the southern states georgia mississippi louisiana c  wrote several letters one for a young fellow named thomas j byrd with a bad wound and diarrhoea was from russell county alabama been out four years wrote to his mother had neither heard from her nor written to her in nine months was taken prisoner last christmas in tennessee sent to nashville then to camp chase ohio and kept there a long time all the while not money enough to get paper and postage stamps was paroled but on his way home the wound took gangrene had diarrhoea also had evidently been very low demeanor cool and patient a darkskinnd quaint young fellow with strong southern idiom no education  another letter for john w morgan aged 18 from shellot brunswick county north carolina been out nine months gunshot wound in right leg above knee also diarrhoea wound getting along well quite a gentle affectionate boy wishd me to put in the letter for his mother to kiss his little brother and sister for him i put strong envelopes on these and two or three other letters directed them plainly and fully and dropt them in the washington postoffice the next morning myself  the large ward i am in is used for secession soldiers exclusively one man about forty years of age emaciated with diarrhoea i was attracted to as he lay with his eyes turnd up looking like death his weakness was so extreme that it took a minute or so every time for him to talk with anything like consecutive meaning yet he was evidently a man of good intelligence and education as i said anything he would lie a moment perfectly still then with closed eyes answer in a low very slow voice quite correct and sensible but in a way and tone that wrung my heart he had a mother wife and child living or probably living in his home in mississippi it was long long since he had seen them had he causd a letter to be sent them since he got here in washington no answer i repeated the question very slowly and soothingly he could not tell whether he had or notthings of late seemd to him like a dream after waiting a moment i said well i am going to walk down the ward a moment and when i come back you can tell me if you have not written i will sit down and write a few minutes after i returnd he said he rememberd now that some one had written for him two or three days before the presence of this man impressd me profoundly the flesh was all sunken on face and arms the eyes low in their sockets and glassy and with purple rings around them two or three great tears silently flowd out from the eyes and rolld down his temples he was doubtless unused to be spoken to as i was speaking to himsickness imprisonment exhaustion c had conquerd the body yet the mind held mastery still and calld even wandering remembrance back  there are some fifty southern soldiers here all sad sad cases there is a good deal of scurvy i distributed some paper envelopes and postage stamps and wrote addresses full and plain on many of the envelopes  i returnd again tuesday august 1 and moved around in the same manner a couple of hours  september 22 65afternoon and evening at douglas hospital to see a friend belonging to 2d new york artillery hiram w frazee sergt down with an obstinate compound fracture of left leg receivd in one of the last battles near petersburg after sitting a while with him went through several neighboring wards in one of them found an old acquaintance transferrd here lately a rebel prisoner in a dying condition poor fellow the look was already on his face he gazed long at me i askd him if he knew me after a moment he utterd something but inarticulately i have seen him off and on for the last five months he has sufferd very much a bad wound in left leg severely fractured several operations cuttings extractions of bone splinters c i remember he seemd to me as i used to talk with him a fair specimen of the main strata of the southerners those without property or education but still with the stamp which comes from freedom and equality i liked him jonathan wallace of hurd co georgia age 30 wife susan f wallace houston hurd co georgia if any good soul of that county should see this i hope he will send her this word had a family had not heard from them since taken prisoner now six months i had written for him and done trifles for him before he came here he made no outward show was mild in his talk and behavior but i knew he worried much inwardly but now all would be over very soon i half sat upon the little stand near the head of the bed wallace was somewhat restless i placed my hand lightly on his forehead and face just sliding it over the surface in a moment or so he fell into a calm regularbreathing lethargy or sleep and remaind so while i sat there it was dark and the lights were lit i hardly know why death seemd hovering near but i stayd nearly an hour a sister of charity dressd in black with a broad white linen bandage around her head and under her chin and a black crape over all and flowing down from her head in long wide pieces came to him and moved around the bed she bowd low and solemn to me for some time she moved around there noiseless as a ghost doing little things for the dying man  december 65the only remaining hospital is now harewood out in the woods northwest of the city i have been visiting there regularly every sunday during these two months  january 24 66went out to harewood early today and remaind all day  sunday february 4 1866harewood hospital again walkd out this afternoon bright dry ground frozen hard through the woods ward 6 is filld with blacks some with wounds some ill two or three with limbs frozen the boys made quite a

supper is being given out the liquid calld tea a thick slice of bread and some stewd apples  that was about the last i saw of the regular army hospitals  illustration here is a portrait of eh from life by henry inman in new york about 1827 or 28 the painting was finely copperplated in 1830 and the present is a fac simile looks as i saw him in the following narrative  the time was signalized by the separation of the society of friends so greatly talked ofand continuing yetbut so little really explaind all i give of this separation is in a note following     notes such as they are founded on  elias hicks   prefatory noteas myself a little boy hearing so much of eh at that time long ago in suffolk and queens and kings countiesand more than once personally seeing the old manand my dear dear father and mother faithful listeners to him at the meetingsi remember how i dreamd to write perhaps a piece about eh and his look and discourses however long afterwardfor my parents sakeand the dear friends too and the following is what has at last but all come out of itthe feeling and intention never forgotten yet  there is a sort of nature of persons i have compared to little rills of water fresh from perennial springsand the comparison is indeed an appropriate onepersons not so very plenty yet some few certainly of them running over the surface and area of humanity all times all lands it is a specimen of this class i would now present i would sum up in eh and make his case stand for the class the sort in all ages all lands sparse not numerous yet enough to irrigate the soilenough to prove the inherent moral stock and irrepressible devotional aspirations growing indigenously of themselves always advancing and never utterly gone under or lost  always eh gives the service of pointing to the fountain of all naked theology all religion all worship all the truth to which you are possibly eligiblenamely in yourself and your inherent relations others talk of bibles saints churches exhortations vicarious atonementsthe canons outside of yourself and apart from maneh to the religion inside of mans very own nature this he incessantly labors to kindle nourish educate bring forward and strengthen he is the most democratic of the religioniststhe prophets  i have no doubt that both the curious fate and death of his four sons and the facts and dwelling on them of george foxs strange early life and permanent conversion had much to do with the peculiar and sombre ministry and style of eh from the first and confirmed him all through one must not be dominated by the mans almost absurd saturation in cut and dried biblical phraseology and in ways talk and standard regardful mainly of the one need he dwelt on above all the rest this main need he drove home to the soul the canting and sermonizing soon exhale away to any auditor that realizes what eh is for and after the present paper a broken memorandum of his formation his earlier life is the crossnotch that rude wanderers make in the woods to remind them afterward of some matter of firstrate importance and full investigation remember too that eh was a thorough believer in the hebrew scriptures in his way  the following are really but disjointed fragments recalld to serve and eke out here the lank printed pages of what i commencd unwittingly two months ago now as i am well in for it comes an old attack the

radiating from him  elias hicks was born march 19 1748 in hempstead township queens county long island new york state near a village bearing the old scripture name of jericho a mile or so north and east of the present hicksville on the li railroad his father and mother were friends of that class working with their own hands and markd by neither riches nor actual poverty elias as a child and youth had small education from letters but largely learnd from natures schooling he grew up even in his ladhood a thorough gunner and fisherman the farm of his parents lay on the south or seashore side of long island they had early removed from jericho one of the best regions in the world for wild fowl and for fishing elias became a good horseman too and knew the animal well riding races also a singer fond of vain songs as he afterwards calls them a dancer too at the country balls when a boy of 13 he had gone to live with an elder brother and when about 17 he changed again and went as apprentice to the carpenters trade the time of all this was before the revolutionary war and the locality 30 to 40 miles from new york city my greatgrandfather whitman was often with elias at these periods and at merrymakings and sleighrides in winter over the plains  how well i remember the regionthe flat plains of the middle of long island as then with their prairielike vistas and grassy patches in every direction and the killcalf and herds of cattle and sheep then the south bay and shores and the salt meadows and the sedgy smell and numberless little bayous and hummockislands in the waters the habitat of every sort of fish and aquatic fowl of north america and the bay mena strong wild peculiar racenow extinct or rather entirely changed and the beach outside the sandy bars sometimes many miles at a stretch with their old history of wrecks and stormsthe weird whitegray beachnot without its tales of pathostales too of grandest heroes and heroisms in such scenes and elements and influencesin the midst of nature and along the shores of the seaelias hicks was fashiond through boyhood and early manhood to maturity but a moral and mental and emotional change was imminent along at this time he says    my apprenticeship being now expird i gradually withdrew from   the company of my former associates became more acquainted with   friends and was more frequent in my attendance of meetings and   although this was in some degree profitable to me yet i made but   slow progress in my religious improvement the occupation of part of   my time in fishing and fowling had frequently tended to preser   me from falling into hurtful associations but through the rising   intimations and reproofs of divine grace in my heart i now began to   feel that the manner in which i sometimes amusd myself with my gun   was not without sin for although i mostly preferrd going alone   and while waiting in stillness for the coming of the fowl   mind was at times so taken up in divine meditations that the   opportunities were seasons of instruction and comfort to me yet on   other occasions when accompanied by some of my acquaintances and   when no fowls appeard which would be useful to us after being   obtaind we sometimes from wantonness or for mere diversion would   destroy the small birds which could be of no service to us this   cruel procedure affects my heart while penning these lines  in his 23d year elias was married by the friends ceremony to jemima seaman his wife was an only child the parents were well off for common people and at their request the soninlaw movd home with them and carried on the farmwhich at their decease became his own and he livd there all his remaining life of this matrimonial part of his career it continued and with unusual happiness for 58 years he says giving the account of his marriage    on this important occasion we felt the clear and consoling evidence   of divine truth and it remaind with us as a seal upon our spirits   strengthening us mutually to bear with becoming fortitude the   vicissitudes and trials which fell to our lot and of which we h   a large share in passing through this probationary state my wife   although not of a very strong constitution livd to be the mother   of eleven children four sons and seven daughters our second   daughter a very lovely promising child died when young with the   smallpox and the youngest was not living at its birth the rest   all arrivd to years of discretion and afforded us considerable   comfort as they provd to be in a good degree dutiful children all   our sons however were of weak constitutions and were not able to   take care of themselves being so enfeebld as not to be able to   walk after the ninth or tenth year of their age the two eldest died   in the fifteenth year of their age the third in his seventeenth   year and the youngest was nearly nineteen when he died but   although thus helpless the innocency of their lives and the   resignd cheerfulness of their dispositions to their allotments   made the labor and toil of taking care of them agreeable and   pleasant and i trust we were preservd from murmuring or repining   believing the dispensation to be in wisdom and according to the   will and gracious disposing of an allwise providence for purposes   best known to himself and when i have observd the great anxiety   and affliction which many parents have with undutiful children who   are favord with health especially their sons i could perceive   very few whose troubles and exercises on that account did not far   exceed ours the weakness and bodily infirmity of our sons tended to   keep them much out of the way of the troubles and temptations   the world and we believd that in their death they were happy and   admitted into the realms of peace and joy a reflection the most   comfortable and joyous that parents can have in regard to their   tender offspring  of a serious and reflective turn by nature and from his reading and surroundings elias had more than once markedly devotional inward intimations these feelings increasd in frequency and strength until soon the following    about the twentysixth year of my age i was again brought by the   operative influence of divine grace under deep concern of mind and   was led through adorable mercy to see that although i had ceasd   from many sins and vanities of my youth yet there were many   remaining that i was still guilty of which were not yet atond for   and for which i now felt the judgments of god to rest upon m   this causd me to cry earnestly to the most high for pardon and   redemption and he graciously condescended to hear my cry and to   open a way before me wherein i must walk in order to experience   reconciliation with him and as i abode in watchfulness and deep   humiliation before him light broke forth out of obscurity and my   darkness became as the noonday i began to have openings leading to   the ministry which brought me under close exercise and deep travail   of spirit for although i had for some time spoken on subjects of   business in monthly and preparative meetings yet the prospe   of opening my mouth in public meetings was a close trial but i   endeavord to keep my mind quiet and resign d to the heavenly call   if it should be made clear to me to be my duty nevertheless   i was soon after sitting in a meeting in much weightiness of   spirit a secret though clear intimation accompanied me to spe   a few words which were then given to me to utter yet fear so   prevaild that i did not yield to the intimation for this   omission i felt close rebuke and judgment seemd for some time   to cover my mind but as i humbld myself under the lords mighty   hand he again lifted up the light of his countenance upon me and   enabld me to renew covenant with him that if he would pass by this   my offence i would in future be faithful if he should again   require such a service of me  the revolutionary war following tried the sect of friends more than any the difficulty was to steer between their convictions as patriots and their pledges of nonwarring peace here is the way they solvd the problem    a war with all its cruel and destructive effects having raged for   several years between the british colonies in north america and the   mother country friends as well as others were expos d to many   severe trials and sufferings yet in the colony of new york   friends who stood faithful to their principles and did not meddle   in the controversy had after a short period at first considerable   favor allowd them the yearly meeting was held steadily duri   the war on long island where the kings party had the rule yet   friends from the main where the american army ruled had free   passage through both armies to attend it and any other meetings   they were desirous of attending except in a few instances this was   a favor which the parties would not grant to their best friends who   were of a warlike disposition which shows what great advantages   would redound to mankind were they all of this pacific spirit i   passd myself through the lines of both armies six times during the   war without molestation both parties generally receiving me with   openness and civility and although i had to pass over a tract of   country between the two armies sometimes more than thirty miles in   extent and which was much frequented by robbers a set in general   of cruel unprincipled banditti issuing out from both partie   yet excepting once i met with no interruption even from the   but although friends in general experiencd many favors and   deliverances yet those scenes of war and confusion occasion   many trials and provings in various ways to the faithful one   circumstance i am willing to mention as it causd me considerable   exercise and concern there was a large cellar under the new   meetinghouse belonging to friends in new york which was generally   let as a store when the kings troops enterd the city they took   possession of it for the purpose of depositing their warlike stores   and ascertaining what friends had the care of letting it their   commissary came forward and offerd to pay the rent and those   friends for want of due consideration accepted it this causd   great uneasiness to the concernd part of the society who   apprehended it not consistent with our peaceable principles to   receive payment for the depositing of military stores in our houses   the subject was brought before the yearly meeting in 1779 and   engagd its careful attention but those friends who had been   active in the reception of the money and some few others were not   willing to acknowledge their proceedings to be inconsistent nor to   return the money to those from whom it was receivd and in order to   justify themselves therein they referrd to the conduct of friends   in philadelphia in similar cases matters thus appearing very   difficult and embarrassing it was unitedly concluded to refer the   final determination thereof to the yearly meeting of pennsylvania   and several friends were appointed to attend that meeting in   relation thereto among whom i was one of the number we accordingly   set out on the 9th day of the 9th month 1779 and i was accompanied   from home by my beloved friend john willis who was likewise on the   appointment we took a solemn leave of our families they feeling   much anxiety at parting with us on account of the dangers we were   exposd to having to pass not only the lines of the two armies but   the deserted and almost uninhabited country that lay between them   in many places the grass being grown up in the streets and many   houses desolate and empty believing it however my duty to proceed   in the service my mind was so settled and trustfixd in the divine   arm of power that faith seemd to banish all fear and cheerfulness   and quiet resignation were i believe my constant companions during   the journey we got permission with but little difficulty to pass   the outguards of the kings army at kingsbridge and proceeded to   westchester we afterwards attended meetings at harrisons purchase   and oblong having the concurrence of our monthly meeting to take   some meetings in our way a concern leading thereto having for some   time previously attended my mind we passd from thence to nine   partners and attended their monthly meeting and then turnd our   faces towards philadelphia being joind by several others of the   committee we attended new marlborough hardwick and kingswood   meetings on our journey and arrivd at philadelphia on the 7th day   of the week and 25th of 9th month on which day we attended the   yearly meeting of ministers and elders which began at the eleventh   hour i also attended all the sittings of the yearly meeting until   the 4th day of the next week and was then so indisposd with a   fever which had been increasing on me for several days that i was   not able to attend after that time i was therefore not present when   the subject was discuss d which came from our yearly meeting but i   was informd by my companion that it was a very solemn opportunity   and the matter was resulted in advising that the money should be   returnd into the office from whence it was receivd accompanied   with our reasons for so doing and this was accordingly done by the   direction of our yearly meeting the next year  then season after season when peace and independence reignd year following year this remains to be 1791 a specimen of his personal labors    i was from home on this journey four months and eleven days rode   about one thousand five hundred miles and attended fortynine   particular meetings among friends three quarterly meetings six   monthly meetings and forty meetings among other people  and again another experience    in the forepart of this meeting my mind was reducd into such a   state of great weakness and depression that my faith was almost   ready to fail which producd great searchings of heart so that i   was led to call in question all that i had ever before experiencd   in this state of doubting i was ready to wish myself at home from   an apprehension that i should only expose myself to reproach and   wound the cause i was embarkd in for the heavens seemd like   brass and the earth as iron such coldness and hardness i thought   could scarcely have ever been experiencd before by any creature so   great was the depth of my baptism at this time nevertheless as i   endeavord to quiet my mind in this conflicting dispensation and   be resignd to my allotment however distressing towards the latter   part of the meeting a ray of light broke through the surrounding   darkness in which the shepherd of israel was pleasd to arise and   by the light of his glorious countenance to scatter those clouds of   opposition then ability was receivd and utterance given to speak   of his marvellous works in the redemption of souls and to op   the way of life and salvation and the mysteries of his glorious   kingdom which are hid from the wise and prudent of this world and   reveald only unto those who are reducd into the state of little   children and babes in christ  and concluding another jaunt in 1794    i was from home in this journey about five months and travell   by land and water about two thousand two hundred and eightythree   miles having visited all the meetings of friends in the new england   states and many meetings amongst those of other professions and   also visited many meetings among friends and others in the upper   part of our own yearly meeting and found real peace in my labors  another tramp in 1798    i was absent from home in this journey about five months and two   weeks and rode about sixteen hundred miles and attended about one   hundred and fortythree meetings  here are some memoranda of 1813 near home    first day our meeting this day passd in silent labor the cloud   rested on the tabernacle and although it was a day of much rain   outwardly yet very little of the dew of hermon appeard to distil   among us nevertheless a comfortable calm was witnessd towards the   close which we must render to the account of unmerited mercy and   love    second day most of this day was occupied in a visit to a sick   friend who appeared comforted therewith spent part of the evening   in reading part of pauls epistle to the romans    third day i was busied most of this day in my common vocations   spent the evening principally in reading paul found considerable   satisfaction in his first epistle to the corinthians in which he   shows the danger of some in setting too high a value on those who   were instrumental in bringing them to the knowledge of the truth   without looking through and beyond the instrument to the great   first cause and author of every blessing to whom all the praise and   honor are due    fifth day 1st of 4th month at our meeting today found it as   usual a very close steady exercise to keep the mind center   where it ought to be what a multitude of intruding thoughts   imperceptibly as it were steal into the mind and turn it from its   proper object whenever it relaxes its vigilance in watching against   them felt a little strength just at the close to remind friends   of the necessity of a steady perseverance by a recapitulation of   the parable of the unjust judge showing how men ought always to   pray and not to faint    sixth day nothing material occurrd but a fear lest the cares of   the world should engross too much of my time    seventh day had an agreeable visit from two ancient friends which   i have long lovd the rest of the day i employd in manual labor   mostly in gardening  but we find if we attend to records and details we shall lay out an endless task we can briefly say summarily that his whole life was a long religious missionary life of method practicality sincerity earnestness and pure pietyas near to his time here as one in judea far backor in any life any age the reader who feels interested must getwith all its dryness and mere dates absence of emotionality or literary quality and whatever abstract attraction with even a suspicion of cant sniffling the journal of the life and religious labours of elias hicks written by himself at some quaker bookstore it is from this headquarters i have extracted the preceding quotations during e hs matured life continued from fifty to sixty yearswhile working steadily earning his living and paying his way without intermissionhe makes as previously memorandized several hundred preaching visits not only through long island but some of them away into the middle or southern states or north into canada or the then far westextending to thousands of miles or filling several weeks and sometimes months these religious journeysscrupulously accepting in payment only his transportation from place to place with his own food and shelter and never receiving a dollar of money for salary or preachingelias through good bodily health and strength continues till quite the age of eighty it was thus at one of his latest jaunts in brooklyn city i saw and heard him this sight and hearing shall now be described  elias hicks was at this period in the latter part november or december of 1829 it was the last tour of the many missions of the old mans life he was in the 8lst year of his age and a few months before he had lost by death a beloved wife with whom he had lived in unalloyed affection and esteem for 58 years but a few months after this meeting elias was paralyzed and died though it is sixty years ago sinceand i a little boy at the time in brooklyn new yorki can remember my father coming home toward sunset from his days work as carpenter and saying briefly as he throws down his armful of kindlingblocks with a bounce on the kitchen floor come mother elias preaches tonight then my mother hastening the supper and the tablecleaning afterward gets a neighboring young woman a friend of the family to step in and keep house for an hour or soputs the two little ones to bedand as i had been behaving well that day as a special reward i was allowd to go also  we start for the meeting though as i said the stretch of more than half a century has passd over me since then with its war and peace and all its joys and sins and deaths and what a half century how it comes up sometimes for an instant like the lightning flash in a storm at night i can recall that meeting yet it is a strange place for religious devotions elias preaches anywhereno respect to buildingsprivate or public houses schoolrooms barns even theatresanything that will accommodate this time it is in a handsome ballroom on brooklyn heights overlooking new york and in full sight of that great city and its north and east rivers filld with shipsis to specify more particularly the second story of morrisons hotel used for the most genteel concerts balls and assembliesa large cheerful gaycolord room with glass chandeliers bearing myriads of sparkling pendants plenty of settees and chairs and a sort of velvet divan running all round the sidewalls before long the divan and all the settees and chairs are filld many fashionables out of curiosity all the principal dignitaries of the town gen jeremiah johnson judge furman george hall mr willoughby mr pierrepont nb morse cyrus p smith and fc tucker many young folks too some richly dressd women i remember i noticed with one party of ladies a group of uniformd officers either from the us navy yard or some ship in the stream or some adjacent fort on a slightly elevated platform at the head of the room facing the audience sit a dozen or more friends most of them elderly grim and with their broadbrimmd hats on their heads three or four women too in their characteristic quaker costumes and bonnets all still as the grave  at length after a pause and stillness becoming almost painful elias rises and stands for a moment or two without a word a tall straight figure neither stout nor very thin dressd in drab cloth cleanshaved face forehead of great expanse and large and clear black eyes42 long or middlinglong white hair he was at this time between 80 and 81 years of age his head still wearing the broadbrim a moment looking around the audience with those piercing eyes amid the perfect stillness i can almost see him and the whole scene now then the words come from his lips very emphatically and slowly pronouncd in a resonant grave melodious voice what is the chief end of man i was told in my early youth it was to glorify god and seek and enjoy him forever  i cannot follow the discourse it presently becomes very fervid and in the midst of its fervor he takes the broadbrim hat from his head and almost dashing it down with violence on the seat behind continues with uninterrupted earnestness but i say i cannot repeat hardly suggest his sermon though the differences and disputes of the formal division of the society of friends were even then under way he did not allude to them at all a pleading tender nearly agonizing conviction and magnetic stream of natural eloquence before which all minds and natures all emotions high or low gentle or simple yielded entirely without exception was its cause method and effect many very many were in tears years afterward in boston i heard father taylor the sailors preacher and found in his passionate unstudied oratory the resemblance to elias hickssnot argumentative or intellectual but so penetratingso different from anything in the booksdifferent as the fresh air of a may morning or seashore breeze from the atmosphere of a perfumers shop  while he goes on he falls into the nasality and singsong tone sometimes heard in such meetings but in a moment or two more as if recollecting himself he breaks off stops and resumes in a natural tone this occurs three or four times during the talk of the evening till all concludes  now and then at the many scores and hundredseven thousandsof his discoursesas at this onehe was very mystical and radical43 and had much to say of the light within very likely this same inner light so dwelt upon by newer men as by fox and barclay at the beginning and all friends and deep thinkers since and now is perhaps only another name for the religious conscience in my opinion they have all diagnosd like superior doctors the real inmost disease of our times probably any times amid the huge inflammation calld society and that other inflammation calld politics what is there today of moral power and ethic sanity as antiseptic to them and all though i think the essential elements of the moral nature exist latent in the good average people of the united states of today and sometimes break out strongly it is certain that any markd or dominating national morality if i may use the phrase has not only not yet been developd but thatat any rate when the point of view is turnd on business politics competition practical life and in character and manners in our new worldthere seems to be a hideous depletion almost absence of such moral nature elias taught throughout as george fox began it or rather reiterated and verified it the platonic doctrine that the ideals of character of justice of religious action whenever the highest is at stake are to be conformd to no outside doctrine of creeds bibles legislative enactments conventionalities or even decorums but are to follow the inward deityplanted law of the emotional soul in this only the true quaker or friend has faith and it is from rigidly perhaps strainingly carrying it out that both the old and new england records of quakerdom show some unseemly and insane acts  in one of the lives of ralph waldo emerson is a list of lessons or instructions seald orders the biographer calls them prepard by the sage himself for his own guidance here is one      go forth with thy message among thy fellowcreatures teach them that     they must trust themselves as guided by that inner light which dwells     with the pure in heart to whom it was promisd of old that they shall     see god  how thoroughly it fits the life and theory of elias hicks then in omar khayyam      i sent my soul through the invisible       some letter of that afterlife to spell     and byandby my soul returnd to me       and answerd i myself am heaven and hell  indeed of this important element of the theory and practice of quakerism the difficulttodescribe light within or inward law by which all must be either justified or condemnd i will not undertake where so many have faildthe task of making the statement of it for the average comprehension we will give partly for the matter and partly as specimen of his speaking and writing style what elias hicks himself says in allusion to itone or two of very many passages most of his discourses like those of epictetus and the ancient peripatetics have left no record remainingthey were extempore and those were not the times of reporters of one however deliverd in chester pa toward the latter part of his career there is a careful transcript and from it even if presenting you a sheaf of hidden wheat that may need to be pickd and thrashd out several times before you get the grain we give the following extract    i dont want to express a great many words but i want you to be   calld home to the substance for the scriptures and all the   books in the world can do no more jesus could do no more than to   recommend to this comforter which was the light in him god is   light and in him is no darkness at all and if we walk in the   light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another   because the light is one in all and therefore it binds us together   in the bonds of love for it is not only light but lovethat love   which casts out all fear so that they who dwell in god dwell in   love and they are constraind to walk in it and if they walk in   it they have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus   christ his son cleanseth us from all sin    but what blood my friends did jesus christ the saviour ever have   any material blood not a drop of it my friendsnot a drop of it   that blood which cleanseth from the life of all sin was the life of   the soul of jesus the soul of man has no material blood but as the   outward material blood created from the dust of the earth is the   life of these bodies of flesh so with respect to the soul the   immortal and invisible spirit its blood is that life which god   breathd into it    as we read in the beginning that god formd man of the dust of   the ground and breathd into him the breath of life and man became   a living soul he breathd into that soul and it became alive to   god  then from one of his many letters for he seems to have delighted in correspondence    some may query what is the cross of christ to these i answer it   is the perfect law of god written on the tablet of the hear   and in the heart of every rational creature in such indelible   characters that all the power of mortals cannot erase nor obliterate   it neither is there any power or means given or dispensd to the   children of men but this inward law and light by which the true   and saving knowledge of god can be obtain d and by this inward law   and light all will be either justified or condemnd and all made   to know god for themselves and be left without excuse agreeably to   the prophecy of jeremiah and the corroborating testimony of jesus   in his last counsel and command to his disciples not to depart from   jerusalem till they should receive power from on high assuring them   that they should receive power when they had receivd the pouring   forth of the spirit upon them which would qualify them to bear   witness of him in judea jerusalem samaria and to the uttermost   parts of the earth which was verified in a marvellous manner on the   day of pentecost when thousands were converted to the christian   faith in one day    by which it is evident that nothing but this inward light and law   as it is heeded and obeyd ever did or ever can make a true   and real christian and child of god and until the professors   of christianity agree to lay aside all their nonessentials in   religion and rally to this unchangeable foundation and standard of   truth wars and fightings confusion and error will prevail and   the angelic song cannot be heard in our landthat of glory to god   in the highest and on earth peace and good will to men    but when all nations are made willing to make this inward law and   light the rule and standard of all their faith and works then we   shall be brought to know and believe alike that there is but one   lord one faith and but one baptism one god and father that is   above all through all and in all    and then will all those glorious and consoling prophecies recorded   in the scriptures of truth be fulfilldhe the lord shall   judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they   shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into   pruninghooks nation shall not lift up the sword against nation   neither shall they learn war any more the wolf also shall dwell   with the lamb and the cow and the bear shall feed and the lion   shall eat straw like the ox and the sucking child shall play   the hole of the asp and the weand child put his hand on the   cockatrices den they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy   mountain for the earth that is our earthly tabernacle shall be   full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea  the exposition in the last sentence that the terms of the texts are not to be taken in their literal meaning but in their spiritual one and allude to a certain wondrous exaltation of the body through religious influences is significant and is but one of a great number of instances of much that is obscure to the worlds people in the preachings of this remarkable man  then a word about his physical oratory connected with the preceding if there is as doubtless there is an unnameable something behind oratory a fund within or atmosphere without deeper than art deeper even than proof that unnameable constitutional something elias hicks emanated from his very heart to the hearts of his audience or carried with him or probed into and shook and arousd in thema sympathetic germ probably rapport lurking in every human eligibility which no book no rule no statement has given or can give inherent knowledge intuitionnot even the best speech or best put forth but launchd out only by powerful human magnetism      unheard by sharpest earunformed in clearest eye or cunningest       mind     nor lore nor fame nor happiness nor wealth     and yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world       incessantly     which you and i and all pursuing ever ever miss     open but still a secretthe real of the realan illusion     costless vouchsafed to each yet never man the owner     which poets vainly seek to put in rhymehistorians in prose     which sculptor never chiseld yet nor painter painted     which vocalist never sung nor orator nor actor ever utter d  that remorse too for a mere worldly lifethat aspiration towards the ideal which however overlaid lies folded latent hidden in perhaps every character more definitely as near as i remember aided by my dear mother long afterward elias hickss discourse there in the brooklyn ballroom was one of his old neverremitted appeals to that moral mystical portion of human nature the inner light but it is mainly for the scene itself and eliass personnel that i recall the incident  soon afterward the old man died    on first day morning the 14th of 2d month february 1830 he was   engaged in his room writing to a friend until a little after ten   oclock when he returnd to that occupied by the family apparently   just attackd by a paralytic affection which nearly deprived h   of the use of his right side and of the power of speech being   assisted to a chair near the fire he manifested by signs that the   letter which he had just finishd and which had been droppd   the way should be taken care of and on its being brought to him   appeard satisfied and manifested a desire that all should sit down   and be still seemingly sensible that his labours were brought to a   close and only desirous of quietly waiting the final change the   solemn composure at this time manifest in his countenance w   very impressive indicating that he was sensible the time of his   departure was at hand and that the prospect of death brought no   terrors with it during his last illness his mental faculti   were occasionally obscured yet he was at times enabled to give   satisfactory evidence to those around him that all was well and   that he felt nothing in his way    his funeral took place on fourth day the 3rd of 3rd month it was   attended by a large concourse of friends and others and a solid   meeting was held on the occasion after which his remains were   interrd in friends burialground at this place jericho queens   county new york  i have thought even presented so incompletely with such fearful hiatuses and in my own feebleness and waning life one might well memorize this life of elias hicks though not eminent in literature or politics or inventions or business it is a token of not a few and is significant such men do not cope with statesmen or soldiersbut i have thought they deserve to be recorded and kept up as a samplethat this one specially does i have already compared it to a little flowing liquid rill of natures life maintaining freshness as if indeed under the smoke of battles the blare of trumpets and the madness of contending hoststhe screams of passion the groans of the suffering the parching of struggles of money and politics and all hells heat and noise and competition above and aroundshould come melting down from the mountains from sources of unpolluted snows far up there in gods hidden untrodden recesses and so rippling along among us low in the ground at mens very feet a curious little brook of clear and cool and everhealthy everliving water  notethe separationthe division vulgarly calld between orthodox and hicksites in the society of friends took place in 1827 8 and 9 probably it had been preparing some time one who was present has since described to me the climax at a meeting of friends in philadelphia crowded by a great attendance of both sexes with elias as principal speaker in the course of his utterance or argument he made use of these words the blood of christthe blood of christwhy my friends the actual blood of christ in itself was no more effectual than the blood of bulls and goatsnot a bit morenot a bit at these words after a momentary hush commenced a great tumult hundreds rose to their feet canes were thumpd upon the floor from all parts of the house angry mutterings some left the place but more remaind with exclamations flushd faces and eyes this was the definite utterance the overt act which led to the separation families divergdeven husbands and wives parents and children were separated  of course what elias promulgd spread a great commotion among the friends sometimes when he presented himself to speak in the meeting there would be oppositionthis led to angry words gestures unseemly noises recriminations elias at such times was deeply affectedthe tears rolld in streams down his cheekshe silently waited the close of the dispute let the friend speak let the friend speak he would say when his supporters in the meeting tried to bluff off some violent orthodox person objecting to the new doctrinaire but he never recanted  a reviewer of the old dispute and separation made the following comments on them in a paper ten years ago it was in america where there had been no persecution worth mentioning since mary dyer was hangd on boston common that about fifty years ago differences arose singularly enough upon doctrinal points of the divinity of christ and the nature of the atonement whoever would know how bitter was the controversy and how much of human infirmity was found to be still lurking under broadbrim hats and drab coats must seek for the information in the lives of elias hicks and of thomas shillitoe the latter an english friend who visited us at this unfortunate time and who exercised his gifts as a peacemaker with but little success the meetings according to his testimony were sometimes turnd into mobs the disruption was wide and seems to have been final six of the ten yearly meetings were divided and since that time various subdivisions have come four or five in number there has never however been anything like a repetition of the excitement of the hicksite controversy and friends of all kinds at present appear to have settled down into a solid steady comfortable state and to be working in their own way without troubling other friends whose ways are different  noteold persons who heard this man in his day and who gleand impressions from what they saw of him judgd from their own points of views have in their conversation with me dwelt on another point they think elias hicks had a large element of personal ambition the pride of leadership of establishing perhaps a sect that should reflect his own name and to which he should give especial form and character very likely such indeed seems the means all through progress and civilization by which strong men and strong convictions achieve anything definite but the basic foundation of elias was undoubtedly genuine religious fervor he was like an old hebrew prophet he had the spirit of one and in his later years lookd like one what carlyle says of john knox will apply to him    he is an instance to us how a man by sincerity itself becomes   heroic it is the grand gift he has we find in him a good honest   intellectual talent no transcendent onea narrow inconsiderable   man as compared with luther but in heartfelt instinctive adherence   to truth in sincerity as we say he has no superior nay one   might ask what equal he has the heart of him is of the true   prophet cast he lies there said the earl of morton at knoxs   grave who never feard the face of man he resembles more than   any of the moderns an old hebrew prophet the same inflexibility   intolerance rigid narrowlooking adherence to gods truth  a note yet the united states todaywhile under all previous conditions even convictions of society oriental feudal ecclesiastical and in all past or present despotisms through the entire past there existed and exists yet in ally and fusion with them and frequently forming the main part of them certain churches institutes priesthoods fervid beliefs c practically promoting religious and moral action to the fullest degrees of which humanity there under circumstances was capable and often conserving all there was of justice art literature and good mannersit is clear i say that under the democratic institutes of the united states now and henceforth there are no equally genuine fountains of fervid beliefs adapted to produce similar moral and religious results according to our circumstances i consider that the churches sects pulpits of the present day in the united states exist not by any solid convictions but by a sort of tacit supercilious scornful suffrance few speak openlynone officiallyagainst them but the ostent continuously imposing who is not aware that any such living fountains of belief in them are now utterly ceasd and departed from the minds of men  a lingering notein the making of a full man all the other consciences the emotional courageous intellectual esthetic c are to be crownd and effused by the religious conscience in the higher structure of a human self or of community the moral the religious the spiritual is strictly analogous to the subtle vitalization and antiseptic play calld health in the physiologic structure to person or state the main verteber or rather the verteber is morality  that is indeed the only real vitalization of character and of all the supersensual even heroic and artistic portions of man or nationality it is to run through and knit the superior parts and keep man or state vital and upright as health keeps the body straight and blooming of course a really grand and strong and beautiful character is probably to be slowly grown and adjusted strictly with reference to itself its own personal and social spherewith paradox though it may be the clear understanding that the conventional theories of life worldly ambition wealth office fame c are essentially but glittering mayas delusions  doubtless the greatest scientists and theologians will sometimes find themselves saying it isnt only those who know most who contribute most to gods glory doubtless these very scientists at times stand with bared heads before the humblest lives and personalities for there is something greater is there not than all the science and poems of the worldabove all else like the stars shining eternalabove shaksperes

life each case after its own concomitantsthe intuitive blending of divine love and faith in a human emotional characterblending for all for the unlearnd the common and the poor  i dont know in what book i once read possibly the remark has been made in books all ages that no life ever lived even the most uneventful but probed to its centre would be found in itself as subtle a drama as any that poets have ever sung or playwrights fabled often too in size and weight that life supposd obscure for it isnt only the palpable stars astronomers say there are dark or almost dark unnoticd orbs and suns like the dusky companions of sirius seven times as large as our own sun rolling through space real and potent as anyperhaps the most real and potent yet none recks of them in the bright lexicon

walter scotts reminiscences he speaks of burns as having the most eloquent glowing flashing illuminated darkorbed eyes he ever beheld in a human face and i think elias hickss must have been like them  43 the true christian religion such was the teaching of elias hicks consists neither in rites or bibles or sermons or sundaysbut in noiseless secret ecstasy and unremitted aspiration in purity in a good practical life in charity to the poor and toleration to all he said a man may keep the sabbath may belong to a church and attend all the observances have regular family prayer keep a wellbound copy of the hebrew scriptures in a conspicuous place in his house and yet not be a truly religious person at all e believd little in a church as organizdeven his ownwith houses ministers or with

pithy proverbs he said it matters not where you live but how you live he said once to my father they talk of the devili tell thee walter there is no worse devil than man   george fox and shakspere  while we are about it we must almost inevitably go back to the origin of the society of which elias hicks has so far provd to be the most markd individual result we must revert to the latter part of the 16th and all or nearly all of that 17th century crowded with so many important historical events changes and personages throughout europe and especially in what we call our mother country men were unusually arousdsome would say demented it was a special age of the insanity of witchtrials and witchhangings in one year 60 were hung for witchcraft in one english county alone it was peculiarly an age of militaryreligious conflict protestantism and catholicism were wrestling like giants for the mastery straining every nerve only to think of itthat age its events personsshakspere just dead his folios publishd completecharles 1st the shadowy spirit and the solid block to sum up all it was the age of cromwell  as indispensable foreground indeed for elias hicks and perhaps sine qua non to an estimate of the kind of man we must briefly transport ourselves back to the england of that period as i say it is the time of tremendous moral and political agitation ideas of conflicting forms governments theologies seethe and dash like ocean storms and ebb and flow like mighty tides it was or had been the time of the long feud between the parliament and the crown in the midst of the sprouts began george foxborn eight years after the death of shakspere he was the son of a weaver himself a shoemaker and was converted before the age of 20 but o the sufferings mental and physical through which those years of the strange youth passd he claimd to be sent by god to fulfill a mission i come he said to direct people to the spirit that gave forth the scriptures the range of his thought even then coverd almost every important subject of after times antislavery womens rights c though in a low sphere and among the masses he forms a markd feature in the age  and how indeed beyond all any that stormy and perturbd age the foundations of the old the superstitious the conventionally poetic the credulous all breakingthe light of the new and of science and democracy definitely beginninga mad fierce almost crazy age the political struggles of the reigns of the charleses and of the protectorate of cromwell heated to frenzy by theological struggles those were the years following the advent and practical working of the reformationbut catholicism is yet strong and yet seeks supremacy we think our age full of the flush of men and doings and culminations of war and peace and so it is but there could hardly be a grander and more picturesque and varied age than that  born out of and in this age when milton bunyan dryden and john locke were still livingamid the memories of queen elizabeth and james first and the events of their reignswhen the radiance of that galaxy of poets warriors statesmen captains lords explorers wits and gentlemen that crowded the courts and times of those sovereigns still filld the atmospherewhen america commencing to be explord and settled commencd also to be suspected as destind to overthrow the old standards and calculationswhen feudalism like a sunset seemd to gather all its glories reminiscences personalisms in one last gorgeous effort before the advance of a new day a new incipient geniusamid the social

and goldwith all the richest mere poetry old or new even shakesperes with all that statue play painting music architecture oratory can effect ceases to satisfy and pleasewhen the eager chase after wealth flags and beauty itself becomes a loathingand when all worldly or carnal or esthetic or even scientific values having done their office to the human character and ministerd their part to its developmentthen if not before comes forward this overarching thought and brings its eligibilities germinations most neglected in life of all humanitys attributes easily coverd with crust deluded and abused rejected yet the only certain source of what all are seeking but few or none finding it i for myself clearly see the first the last the deepest depths and highest heights of art of literature

fancy    an old mans rejoinder  in the domain of literature loftily considerd an accomplishd and veteran critic in his just out work44 now says the kingdom of the father has passd the kingdom of the son is passing the kingdom of the spirit begins leaving the reader to chew on and extract the juice and meaning of this i will proceed to say in melanged form what i have had brought out by the english authors essay he discusses the poetic art mostly on my own real or by him supposed views and purports if i give any answers to him or explanations of what my books intend they will be not direct but indirect and derivative of course this brief jotting is personal something very like querulous egotism and growling may break through the narrative for i have been and am rejected by all the great magazines carry now my 72d annual burden and have been a paralytic for 18 years  no great poem or other literary or artistic work of any scope old or new can be essentially considerd without weighing first the age politics or want of politics and aim visible forms unseen soul and current times out of the midst of which it rises and is formulated as the biblic canticles and their days and spiritas the homeric or dantes utterance or shaksperes or the old scotch or irish ballads or ossian or omar khayyam so i have conceivd and launchd and workd for years at my leaves of grasspersonal emanations only at best but with specialty of emergence and backgroundthe ripening of the nineteenth century the thought and fact and radiation of individuality of america the secession war and showing the democratic conditions supplanting everything that insults them or impedes their aggregate way doubtless my poems illustrate one of novel thousands to come for a long period those conditions but democratic art will have to wait long before it is satisfactorily formulated and definedif it ever is  i will now for one indicative moment lock horns with what many think the greatest thing the question of art socalld i have not seen without learning something therefrom how with hardly an exception the poets of this age devote themselves always mainly sometimes altogether to fine rhyme spicy verbalism the fabric and cut of the garment jewelry concetti style art today these adjuncts are certainly the effort beyond all else yet the lesson of nature undoubtedly is to proceed with single purpose toward the result necessitated and for which the time has arrived utterly regardless of the outputs of shape appearance or criticism which are always left to settle themselves i have not only not botherd much about style form art etc but confess to more or less apathy i believe i have sometimes caught myself in decided aversion toward them throughout asking nothing of them but negative advantagesthat they should never impede me and never under any circumstances or for their own purposes only assume any mastery over me  from the beginning i have watchd the sharp and sometimes heavy and deeppenetrating objections and reviews against my work and i hope entertaind and audited them for i have probably had an advantage in constructing from a central and unitary principle since the first but at long intervals and stagessometimes lapses of five or six years or peace or war ruskin the englishman charges as a fearful and serious lack that my poems have no humor a profound german critic complains that compared with the luxuriant and wellaccepted songs of the world there is about my verse a certain coldness severity absence of spice polish or of consecutive meaning and plot the book is autobiographic at bottom and maybe i do not exhibit and make ado about the stock passions i am partly of quaker stock then ec stedman finds or found markd fault with me because while celebrating the common people en masse i do not allow enough heroism and moral merit and good intentions to the choicer classes the collegebred the etatmajor it is quite probable that s is right in the matter in the main i myself look and have from the first lookd to the bulky democratic torso of the united states even for esthetic and moral attributes of serious accountand refused to aim at or accept anything less if america is only for the rule and fashion and small typicality of other lands the rule of the etatmajor it is not the land i take it for and should today feel that my literary aim and theory had been blanks and misdirections strictly judged most modern poems are but larger or smaller lumps of sugar or slices of toothsome sweet cakeeven the banqueters dwelling on those glucose flavors as a main part of the dish which perhaps leads to something to have great heroic poetry we need great readersa heroic appetite and audience have we at present any such  then the thought at the centre never too often repeated boundless material wealth free political organization immense geographic area and unprecedented business and productseven the most active intellect and culturewill not place this commonwealth of ours on the topmost range of history and humanityor any eminence of democratic artto say nothing of its pinnacle only the production and on the most copious scale of loftiest moral spiritual and heroic personal illustrationsa great native literature headed with a poetry stronger and sweeter than any yet if there can be any such thing as a kosmic modern and original song america needs it and is worthy of it  in my opinion today bitter as it is to say so the outputs through civilized nations everywhere from the great words literature art religion c with their conventional administerers stand squarely in the way of what the vitalities of those great words signify more than they really prepare the soil for themor plant the seeds or cultivate or garner the crop my own opinion has long been that for new world service our ideas of beauty inherited from the greeks and so on to shaksperequeryperverted from them need to be radically changed and made anew for todays purposes and finer standards but if so it will all come in due timethe real change will be an autochthonic interior constitutional even local one from which our notions of beauty lines and colors are wondrous lovely but character is lovelier will branch or offshoot  so much have i now rattled off old ages garrulity that there is not space for explaining the most important and pregnant principle of all viz that art is one is not partial but includes all times and forms and sortsis not exclusively aristocratic or democratic or oriental or occidental my favorite symbol would be a good font of type where the impeccable longprimer rejects nothing or the old dutch flourmiller who said i never bother myself what road the folks comei only want good wheat and rye  the font is about the same forever democratic art results of democratic development from tinge true nationality belief in the one setting up from it   note  44 two new volumes essays speculative and suggestive by

certain that all this then inevitable train of calamity hung on arrogant and peremptory phrases in the prepared and written missive of the british minister to america which the queen and prince albert latent positively and promptly cancelld and which her firm attitude did alone actually erase and leave out against all the other official prestige and court of st jamess on such minor and personal incidents so to call them often depend the great growths and turns of civilization this moment of a woman and a queen surely swung the grandest oscillation of modern historys pendulum many sayings and doings of that period from foreign potentates and powers might well be dropt in oblivion by americabut never this if i could have my way w w     american national literature  is there any such thingor can there ever be   so you want an essay about american national literature tremendous and fearful subject do you46 well if you will let me put down some melanged cogitations regarding the matter haphazard and from my own points of view i will try horace greeley wrote a book named hints toward reforms and the titleline was considerd the best part of all in the present case i will give a few thoughts and suggestions of good and ambitious intent enough anyhowfirst reiterating the question right out plainly american national literatureis there distinctively any such thing or can there ever be first to me comes an almost indescribably august form the people with varied typical shapes and attitudesthen the divine mirror literature  as things are probably no more puzzling question ever offerd itself than going back to old nile for a trope what breadseeds of printed mentality shall we cast upon americas waters to grow and return after many days is there for the future authorship of the united states any better way than submission to the teeming facts events activities and importations already vital through and beneath them all i have often ponderd it and felt myself disposed to let it go at that indeed are not those facts and activities and importations potent and certain to fulfil themselves all through our commonwealth irrespective of any attempt from individual guidance but allowing all and even at that a good part of the matter being honest discussion examination and earnest personal presentation we may even for sanitary exercise and contact plunge boldly into the spread of the many waves and crosstides as follows or to change the figure i will present my varied little collation what is our country itself but an infinitely vast and varied collation in the hope that the show itself indicates a duty getting more and more incumbent every day  in general civilizations totality or real representative national literature formates itself like language or the weather not from two or three influences however important nor from any learned syllabus or criticism or what ought to be nor from any minds or advice of toploftical quartersand indeed not at all from the influences and ways ostensibly supposed though they too are adopted after a sortbut slowly slowly curiously from many more and more deeper mixings and siftings especially in america and generations and years and races and what largely appears to be chancebut is not chance at all first of all for future national literature in america new england the technically moral and schoolmaster region as a cynical fellow i know calls it and the three or four great atlanticcoast cities highly as they today suppose they dominate the whole will have to haul in their horns ensemble is the taproot of national literature america is become already a huge world of peoples rounded and orbic climates idiocrasies and geographiesfortyfour nations curiously and irresistibly blent and aggregated in one nation with one imperial language and one unitary set of social and legal standards over alland i predict a yet to be national literature in my mind this last if it ever comes is to prove grander and more important for the commonwealth than its politics and material wealth and trade vast and indispensable as those are  think a moment what must beyond peradventure be the real permanent subbases or lack of them books profoundly considered show a great nation more than anything elsemore than laws or manners this is of course probably the deepdown meaning of that wellburied but evervital platitude let me sing the peoples songs and i dont care who makes their laws books too reflect humanity en masse and surely show them splendidly or the reverse and prove or celebrate their prevalent traits these last the main things homer grew out of and has held the ages and holds today by the universal admiration for personal prowess courage rankness amour propre leadership inherent in the whole human race shakspere concentrates the brilliancy of the centuries of feudalism on the proud personalities they produced and paints the amorous passion the books of the bible stand for the final superiority of devout emotions over the rest and of religious adoration and ultimate absolute justice more powerful than haughtiest kings or millionaires or majorities  what the united states are working out and establishing needs imperatively the connivance of something subtler than ballots and legislators the goethean theory and lesson if i may briefly state it so of the exclusive sufficiency of artistic scientific literary equipment to the character irrespective of any strong claims of the political ties of nation state or city could have answerd under the conventionality and pettiness of weimar or the germany or even europe of those times but it will not do for america today at all we have not only to exploit our own theory above any that has preceded us but we have entirely different and deeperrooted and infinitely broader themes  when i have had a chance to see and observe a sufficient crowd of american boys or maturer youths or wellgrown men all the states as in my experiences in the secession war among the soldiers or west east north or south or my wanderings and loiterings through cities especially new york and in washington i have invariably found coming to the front three prevailing personal traits to be named here for brevitys sake under the heads goodnature decorum and intelligence i make goodnature first as it deserves to beit is a splendid resultant of all the rest like health or fine weather essentially these lead the inherent list of the high average personal born and bred qualities of the young fellows everywhere through the united states as any sharp observer can find out for himself surely these make the vertebral stock of superbest and noblest nations may the destinies show it so forthcoming i mainly confide the whole future of our commonwealth to the fact of these three bases need i say i demand the same in the elements and spirit and fruitage of national literature  another perhaps a born root or branch comes under the words noblesse oblige even for a national rule or motto my opinion is that this foregoing phrase and its spirit should influence and permeate official america and its representatives in congress the executive departments the presidency and the individual statesshould be one of their chiefest mottoes and be carried out practically i got the idea from my dear friend the democratic englishwoman mrs anne gilchrist now dead the beautiful words noblesse oblige said she to me once are not best for some developd gentleman or lord but some rich and developd nationand especially for your america  then another and very grave point for this discussion is deep deepnot for trifles or pretty seemings i am not sure but the establishd and old and superb and profound and one may say needed as old conception of deity as mainly of moral constituency goodness purity sinlessness c has been undermined by nineteenthcentury ideas and science what does this immense and almost abnormal development of philanthropy mean among the moderns one doubts if there ever will come a day when the moral laws and moral standards will be supplanted as over all while time proceeds i find it so myself they will probably be intrenchd deeper and expanded wider then the expanded scientific and democratic and truly philosophic and poetic quality of modernism demands a deific identity and scope superior to all limitations and essentially including just as well the socalld evil and crime and criminalsall the malformations the defective and abortions of the universe  sometimes the bulk of the common people who are far more cute than the critics suppose relish a wellhidden allusion or hint carelessly dropt faintly indicated and left to be disinterrd or not some of the very old ballads have delicious morsels of this kind greek aristophanes and pindar abounded in them i sometimes fancy the old hellenic audiences must have been as generally keen and knowing as any of their poets shakspere is full of them tennyson has them it is always a capital compliment from author to reader and worthy the peering brains of america the mere smartness of the common folks however does not need encouraging but qualities more solid and opportune  what are now deepest wanted in the states as roots for their literature are patriotism nationality ensemble or the ideas of these and the uncompromising genesis and saturation of these not the mere bawling and braggadocio of them but the radical emotionfacts the fervor and perennial fructifying spirit at fountainhead and at the risk of being misunderstood i should dwell on and repeat that a great imaginative literatus for america can never be merely good and moral in the conventional method puritanism and what radiates from it must always be mentiond by me with respect then i should say for this vast and varied commonwealth geographically and artistically the puritanical standards are constipated narrow and nonphilosophic  in the main i adhere to my positions in democratic vistas and especially to my summingup of american literature as far as today is concernd in scientism the medical profession practical inventions and journalism the united states have pressd forward to the glorious front rank of advanced civilized lands as also in the popular dissemination of printed matter of a superficial nature perhaps but that is an indispensable preparatory stage and have gone in common education socalld far beyond any other land or age yet the highpitchd taunt of margaret fuller forty years ago still sounds in the air it does not follow because the united states print and read more books magazines and newspapers than all the rest of the world that they really have therefore a literature for perhaps it is not alone the free schools and newspapers nor railroads and factories nor all the iron cotton wheat pork and petroleum nor the gold and silver nor the surplus of a hundred or several hundred millions nor the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments nor the last national census that can put this commonweal high or highest on the cosmical scale of history something else is indispensable all that record is lofty but there is a loftier  the great current points are perhaps simple after all first that the highest developments of the new world and democracy and probably the best society of the civilized world all over are to be only reachd and spinally nourishd in my notion by a new evolutionary sense and treatment and secondly that the evolutionprinciple which is the greatest law through nature and of course in these states has now reachd us markedly for and in our literature  in other writings i have tried to show how vital to any aspiring nationality must ever be its autochthonic song and how for a really great people there can be no complete and glorious name short of emerging out of and even raisd on such born poetic expression coming from its own soil and soul its area spread idiosyncrasies and like showers of rain originally rising impalpably distilld from land and sea duly returning there again nor do i forget what we all owe to our ancestry though perhaps we are apt to forgive and bear too much for that alone  one part of the national american literatuss task is and it is not an easy one to treat the old hereditaments legends poems theologies and even customs with fitting respect and toleration and at the same time clearly understand and justify and be devoted to and exploit our own day its diffused light freedom responsibilities with all it necessitates and that our newworld circumstances and stages of development demand and make proper for american literature we want mighty authors not even carlyle and heinelike born and brought up in and more or less essentially partaking and giving out that vast abnormal ward or hysterical sickchamber which in many respects europe with all its glories would seem to be the greatest feature in current poetry perhaps in literature anyhow is the almost total lack of firstclass power and simple natural health flourishing and produced at first hand typifying our own era modern verse generally lacks quite altogether the modern and is oftener possessd in spirit with the past and feudal dressed maybe in late fashions for novels and plays often the plots and surfaces are contemporarybut the spirit even the fun is morbid and effete  there is an essential difference between the old and new the poems of asia and europe are rooted in the long past they celebrate man and his intellections and relativenesses as they have been but america in as high a strain as ever is to sing them all as they are and are to be i know of course that the past is probably a main factor in what we are and know and must be at present the states are absorbd in business moneymaking politics agriculture the development of mines intercommunications and other material attentswhich all shove forward and appear at their heightas consistently with modern civilization they must be and should be then even these are but the inevitable precedents and providers for homeborn transcendent democratic literatureto be shown in superior more heroic more spiritual more emotional personalities and songs a national literature is of course in one sense a great mirror or reflector there must however be something beforesomething to reflect i should say now since the secession war there has been and today unquestionably exists that something  certainly anyhow the united states do not so far utter poetry firstrate literature or any of the socalld arts to any lofty admiration or advantageare not dominated or penetrated from actual inherence or plain bent to the said poetry and arts other work other needs current inventions productions have occupied and today mainly occupy them they are very cute and imitative and proudcant bear being left too glaringly away far behind the other highclass nationsand so we set up some home poets artists painters musicians literati and so forth all our own thus claimd the whole matter has gone on and exists today probably as it should have been and should be as for the present it must be to all which we conclude and repeat the terrible query american national literatureis there distinctively any such thing or can there ever be   note  46 the essay was for the north american review in answer to the

odor of spiritual heroism afterward for i am probably fond of viewing all really great themes indirectly and by sideways and suggestions certain music from wondrous voices or skilful playersthen poetic glints still moreput the soul in rapport with death or toward it hear a strain from tennysons late crossing the bar      twilight and evening bell         and after that the dark     and may there be no sadness of farewell         when i embark      for tho from out our bourne of time and place         the floods may bear me far     i hope to see my pilot face to face         when i have crost the bar  am i starting the sailcraft of poets in line here then a quatrain of phrynichus long ago to one of old athens favorites      thricehappy sophocles in good old age     blessd as a man and as a craftsman blessd     he died his many tragedies were fair     and fair his end nor knew he any sorrow  certain music indeed especially voluntaries by a good player at twilightor idle rambles alone by the shore or over prairie or on mountain road for that matterfavor the right mood words are difficulteven impossible no doubt any one will recall ballads or songs or hymns maybe instrumental performances that have arousd so curiously yet definitely the thought of death the mystic the afterrealm as no statement or sermon couldand brought it hovering near a happy to call it so and easy death is at least as much a physiological result as a pyschological one the foundation of it really begins before birth and is thence directly or indirectly shaped and affected even constituted the base stomachic by every thing from that minute till the time of its occurrence and yet here is something whittiers burning driftwood of an opposite coloring      i know the solemn monotone         of waters calling unto me     i know from whence the airs have blown         that whisper of the eternal sea     as low my fires of driftwood burn         i hear that seas deep sounds increase     and fair in sunset light discern         its miragelifted isles of peace  like an invisible breeze after a long and sultry day death sometimes sets in at last soothingly and refreshingly almost vitally in not a few cases the termination even appears to be a sort of ecstasy of course there are painful deaths but i do not believe such is at all the general rule of the many hundreds i myself saw die in the fields and hospitals during the secession war the cases of mark d suffering or agony in extremis were very rare it is a curious suggestion of immortality that the mental and emotional powers remain to their clearest through all while the senses of pain and flesh volition are blunted or even gone  then to give the following and cease before the thought gets threadbare      now land and life finale and farewell     now voyager depart much much for thee is yet in store     often enough hast thou adventurd oer the seas     cautiously cruising studying the charts     duly again to port and hawsers tie returning     but now obey thy cherishd secret wish     embrace thy friendsleave all in order     to port and hawsers tie no more returning     depart upon thy endless cruise old sailor      some laggards yet   the perfect human voice  stating it briefly and pointedly i should suggest that the human voice is a cultivation or formd growth on a fair native foundation this foundation probably exists in nine cases out of ten sometimes nature affords the vocal organ in perfection or rather i would say near enough to whet ones appreciation and appetite for a voice that might be truly calld perfection to me the grand voice is mainly physiologicalby which i by no means ignore the mental help but wish to keep the emphasis where it belongs emerson says manners form the representative apex and final charm and captivation of humanity but he might as well have changed the typicality to voice  of course there is much taught and written about elocution the best reading speaking c but it finally settles down to best human vocalization beyond all other power and beauty there is something in the quality and power of the right voice timbre the schools call it that touches the soul the abysms it was not for nothing that the greeks depended at their highest on poetrys and wisdoms vocal utterance by teteatete lecturesindeed all the ancients did  of celebrated people possessing this wonderful vocal power patent to me in former days i should specify the contralto alboni elias hicks father taylor the tenor bettini fanny kemble and the old actor booth and in private life many cases often women i sometimes wonder whether the best philosophy and poetry or something like the best after all these centuries perhaps waits to be rousd out yet or suggested by the perfect physiological human voice   shakspere for america  let me send you a supplementary word to that view of shakspere attributed to me publishd in your july number47 and so courteously worded by the reviewer thanks dear friend but you have left out what perhaps is the main point as follows  even the one who at present reigns unquestiondof shaksperefor all he stands for so much in modern literature he stands entirely for the mighty esthetic sceptres of the past not for the spiritual and democratic the sceptres of the future see pp 5558 in november boughs and also some of my further notions on shakspere  the old world europe and asia is the region of the poetry of concrete and real thingsthe past the esthetic palaces etiquette the literature of war and love the mythological gods and the myths anyhow but the new world america is the region of the future and its poetry must be spiritual and democratic evolution is not the rule in nature in politics and inventions only but in verse i know our age is greatly materialistic but it is greatly spiritual too and the future will be too even what we moderns have come to mean by spirituality while including what the hebraic utterers and mainly perhaps all the greek and other old typical poets and also the later ones meant has so expanded and colord and vivified the comprehension of the term that it is quite a different one from the past then science the final critic of all has the casting vote for future poetry   note  47 this bit was in poetlore monthly for september 1890   unassaild renown  the n y critic nov 24 1889 propounded a circular to several persons and giving the responses says walt whitmans views as follow are naturally more radical than those of any other contributor to the discussion  briefly to answer impromptu your request of oct 19the question whether i think any american poet not now living deserves a place among the thirteen english inheritors of unassaild renown chaucer spenser shakspere milton dryden pope gray burns wordsworth coleridge byron shelley and keatsand which american poets would be truly worthy c though to me the deep of the matter goes down down beneath i remember the london times at the time in opportune profound and friendly articles on bryants and longfellows deaths spoke of the embarrassment warping effect and confusion on america her poets and poetic students coming in possession of a great estate they had never lifted a hand to form or earn and the further contingency of the english language ever having annexd to it a lot of firstclass poetry that would be american not europeanproving then something precious over all and beyond valuation but perhaps that is venturing outside the question of the thirteen british immortals mentiondafter placing shakspere on a sort of preeminence of fame not to be invaded yetthe names of bryant emerson whittier and longfellow with even added names sometimes southerners sometimes western or other writers of only one or two pieces deserve in my opinion an equally high niche of renown as belongs to any on the dozen of that glorious list   inscription for a little book on giordano bruno  as americas mental courage the thought comes to me today is so indebted above all current lands and peoples to the noble army of oldworld martyrs past how incumbent on us that we clear those martyrs lives and names and hold them up for reverent admiration as well as beacons and typical of this and standing for it and all perhaps giordano bruno may well be put today and to come in our new worlds

consideration out of all that has had to do with it has been the consideration of the publicat any rate as it now exists strange as it may sound for a democrat to say so i am clear that no free and original and loftysoaring poem or one ambitious of those achievements can possibly be fulfilld by any writer who has largely in his thought the publicor the question what will establishd

nature too but i had to choosei could not give both besides the gardens are well represented in poetry while nature in letter and in spirit in the divine essence little if at all  certainly while i have not hit it by a long shot i have aimd at the most ambitious the bestand sometimes feel to advance that aim even with all its arrogance as the most redeeming part of my books i have never so much cared to feed the esthetic or intellectual palatesbut if i could arouse from its slumbers that eligibility in every soul for its own true exercise if i could only wield that lever  out from the

1890 says a correspondent of the boston transcript april 19 might not have thought that w w crawld out of a sick bed a few hours before crying      dangers retreat when boldly theyre confronted  and went over hoarse and half blind to deliver his memoranda and essay on the death of abraham lincoln on the twentyfifth anniversary of that tragedy he led off with the following new paragraph  of abraham lincoln bearing testimony twentyfive years after his deathand of that deathi am now my friends before you few realize the days the great historic and esthetic personalities with him in the centre we passd through abraham lincoln familiar our own an illinoisian modern yet tallying ancient moses joshua ulysses or later cromwell and grander in some respects than any of them abraham lincoln that makes the like of homer plutarch shakspere eligible our day or any day my subject this evening for forty or fifty minutes talk is the death of this man and how that death will really filter into america i am not going to tell you anything new and it is doubtless nearly altogether because i ardently wish to commemorate the hour and martyrdom and name i am here oft as the rolling years bring back this hour let it again however briefly be dwelt upon for my own part i hope and intend till my own dying day whenever the 14th and 15th of april comes to annually gather a few friends and hold its tragic reminiscence no narrow or sectional reminiscence it belongs to these states in their entiretynot the north only but the southperhaps belongs most tenderly and devoutly to the south of all for there really this mans birthstock there and then his antecedent stamp why should i not say that thence his manliest traits his universality his canny easy ways and words upon the surfacehis inflexible determination at heart have you ever realized it my friends that lincoln though grafted on the west is essentially in personnel and character a southern contribution  the most of the poets address was devoted to the actual occurrences and details of the murder we believe the delivery on tuesday was whitmans thirteenth of it the old poet is now physically wreckd but his voice and magnetism are the same for the last month he has been under a severe attack of the lately prevailing influenza the grip in accumulation upon his previous ailments and above all that terrible paralysis the bequest of secession war times he was dressd last tuesday night in an entire suit of french canadian grey wool cloth with broad shirt collar with no necktie long white hair red face full beard and moustache and lookd as though he might weigh two hundred pounds he had to be helpd and led every step in five weeks more he will begin his seventysecond year he is still writing a little   ingersolls speech  from the camden post nj june 2 1890 he attends and makes a speech at the celebration of walt whitmans birthdaywalt whitman is now in his seventysecond year his younger friends literary and personal men and women gave him a complimentary supper last saturday night to note the close of his seventyfirst year and the late curious and unquestionable boom of the old mans widespreading popularity and that of his leaves of grass there were thirtyfive in the room mostly young but some old or beginning to be the great feature was ingersolls utterance it was probably in its way the most admirable specimen of modern oratory hitherto delivered in the english language immense as such praise may sound it was 40 to 50 minutes long altogether without notes in a good voice low enough and not too low style easy rather colloquial over and over again saying you to whitman who sat opposite sometimes markedly impassiond once or twice humorousamid his whole speech from interior fires and volition pulsating and swaying like a firstclass andalusian dancer  and such a critical dissection and flattering summary the whitmanites for the first time in their lives were fully satisfied and that is saying a good deal for they have not put their claims low by a long shot indeed it was a tremendous talk physically and mentally ingersoll he had been working all day in new york talking in court and in his office is now at his best like mellowd wine or a just ripe apple to the artistsense too looks at his bestnot merely like a bequeathd roman bust or fine smooth marble cicerohead or even greek plato for he is modern and vital and veind and american and far more than the age knows justifies us all  we cannot give a full report of this most remarkable talk and supper which was curiously conversational and greeklike but must add the following significant bit of it  after the speaking and just before the close mr whitman reverted to colonel ingersolls tribute to his poems pronouncing it the capsheaf of all commendation that he had ever receivd then his mind still dwelling upon the colonels religious doubts he went on to say that what he himself had in his mind when he wrote leaves of grass was not only to depict american life as it existed and to show the triumphs of science and the poetry in common things and the full of an individual democratic humanity for the aggregate but also to show that there was behind all something which rounded and completed it for what he askd would this life be without immortality it would be as a locomotive the greatest triumph of modern science with no train to draw after it if the spiritual is not behind the material to what purpose is the material what is this world without a further divine purpose in it all  colonel

great fine roses white and red blooming fragrant sent by mail by w s k and wife mass are in a glass of water on the table before me  am now in my 72d year   old brooklyn days  it must have been in 1822 or 3 that i first came to live in brooklyn lived first in front street not far from what was then calld the new ferry wending the river from the foot of catharine or main street to new york city  i was a little child was born in 1819 but trampd freely about the neighborhood and town even then was often on the aforesaid new ferry remember how i was petted and deadheaded by the gatekeepers and deckhands all such fellows are kind to little children and remember the horses that seemd to me so queer as they trudgd around in the central houses of the boats making the waterpower for it was just on the eve of the steamengine which was soon after introduced on the ferries edward copeland afterward mayor had a grocery store then at the corner of front and catharine streets  presently we whitmans all moved up to tillary street near adams where my father who was a carpenter built a house for himself and us all it was from here i assisted the personal coming of lafayette in 18245 to brooklyn he came over the old ferry as the now fulton ferry partly navigated quite up to that day by horse boats though the first steamer had begun to be used hereabouts was then calld and was receivd at the foot of fulton street it was on that occasion that the cornerstone of the apprentices library at the corner of cranberry and henry streetssince pulld downwas laid by lafayettes own hands numerous children arrived on the grounds of whom i was one and were assisted by several gentlemen to safe spots to view the ceremony among others lafayette also helping the children took me upi was five years old pressd me a moment to his breastgave me a kiss and set me down in a safe spot lafayette was at that time between sixtyfive and seventy years of age with a manly figure and a kind face   two questions  an editor of or in a leading monthly magazine harpers monthly july 1890 asks a hundred years from now will ww be popularly rated a great poetor will he be forgotten  a mighty ticklish questionwhich can only be left for a hundred years henceperhaps more than that but whether ww has been mainly rejected by his own times is an easier question to answer  all along from 1860 to 91 many of the pieces in l of g and its annexes were first sent to publishers or magazine editors before being printed in the l and were peremptorily rejected by them and sent back to their author the eidolons was sent back by dr h of scribners monthly with a lengthy very insulting and contemptuous letter to the sunset breeze was rejected by the editor of harpers monthly as being an improvisation only on on ye jocund twain was rejected by the century editor as being personal merely several of the pieces went the rounds of all the monthlies to be thus summarily rejected  june 90therejects and sends back my little poem so i am now set out in the cold by every big magazine and publisher and may as well understand and admit itwhich is just as well for i find i am palpably losing my sight and ratiocination   preface  to a volume of essays and tales by wm d oconnor pubd posthumously in 1891  a hasty memorandum not particularly for preface to the following tales but to put on record my respect and affection for as sane beautiful cute tolerant loving candid and free and fairintentiond a nature as ever vivified our race  in boston 1860 i first met william douglas oconnor48 as i saw and knew him then in his 29th year and for twentyfive further years along he was a gallant handsome gayhearted finevoiced glowingeyed man lithemoving on his feet of healthy and magnetic atmosphere and presence and the most welcome company in the world he was a thoroughgoing antislavery believer speaker and writer doctrinaire and though i took a fancy to him from the first i remember i feard his ardent abolitionismwas afraid it would probably keep us apart i was a decided and outspoken antislavery believer myself then and always but shyd from the extremists the redhot fellows of those times oc was then correcting the proofs of harrington an eloquent and fiery novel he had written and which was printed just before the commencement of the secession war he was already married the father of two fine little children and was personally and intellectually the most attractive man i had ever met  last of 62 i found myself led towards the warfieldwent to washington cityto become absorbd in the armies and in the big hospitals and to get work in one of the departmentsand there i met and resumed friendship and found warm hospitality from oc and his noble new england wife they had just lost by death their little childboy phillip and oc was yet feeling serious about it the youngster had been vaccinated against the threatening of smallpox which alarmd the city but somehow it led to worse results than it was intended to ward offor at any rate oc thought that proved the cause of the boys death he had one child left a fine bright little daughter and a great comfort to her parents dear jeannie she grew up a most accomplishd and superior young womandeclined in health and died about 1881  on through for months and years to 73 i saw and talkd with oc almost daily i had soon got employment first for a short time in the indian bureau in the interior department and then for a long while in the attorney generals office the secession war with its tide of varying fortunes excitementspresident lincoln and the daily sight of himthe doings in congress and at the state capitolsthe news from the fields and campaigns and from foreign governmentsmy visits to the army hospitals daily and nightly soon absorbing everything elsewith a hundred matters occurrences personaltiesgreeley wendell phillips the parties the abolitionists cwere the subjects of our talk and discussion i am not sure from what i heard then but oc was cut out for a firstclass public speaker or forensic advocate no audience or jury could have stood out against him he had a strange charm of physiologic voice he had a power and sharpcut faculty of statement and persuasiveness beyond any mans else i know it well for i have felt it many a time if not as orator his forte was as critic newer deeper than any also as literary author one of his traits was that while he knew all and welcomd all sorts of great genre literature all lands and times from all writers and artists and not only tolerated each and defended every attackd literary person with a skill or heartcatholicism that i never saw equaldinvariably advocated and excused themhe kept an idiosyncrasy and identity of his own very markd and without special tinge or undue color from any source he always applauded the freedom of the masters whence and whoever i remember his special defences of byron burns poe rabelais victor hugo george sand and others there was always a little touch of pensive cadence in his superb voice and i think there was something of the same sadness in his temperament and nature perhaps too in his literary structure but he was a very buoyant jovial goodnatured companion  so much for a hasty melanged reminiscence and note of william oconnor my dear dear friend and staunch probably my staunchest literary believer and champion from the first and throughout without halt or demur for twentyfive years no better friendnone more reliable through this life of ones ups and downs on the occurrence of the latter he would be sure to make his appearance on the scene eager hopeful full of fight like a perfect knight of chivalry for he was a born sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol

washington d c and became a us clerk first in the lighthouse bureau and then in the us lifesaving service in which branch he was assistant superintendent for many yearssickend in 1887died there at washington may 9th 1889   an engineers obituary  from the engineering record new york dec 13 1890  thomas jefferson whitman was born july 18 1833 in brooklyn n y from a father of english stock and mother louisa van velsor descended from dutch holland immigration his early years were spent on long island either in the country or brooklyn as a lad he showd a tendency for surveying and civil engineering and about at 19 went with chief kirkwood who was then prospecting and outlining for the great city waterworks he remaind at that construction throughout was a favorite and confidant of the chief and was successively promoted he continued also under chief moses lane he married in 1859 and not long after was invited by the board of public works of st louis missouri to come there and plan and build a new and fitting waterworks for that great city whitman accepted the call and moved and settled there and had been a resident of st louis ever since he plannd and built the works which were very successful and remaind as superintendent and chief for nearly 20 years  of the last six years he has been largely occupied as consulting engineer divested of his cares and position in st louis and has engaged in public constructions bridges sewers c west and southwest and especially the memphis tenn city waterworks  thomas j whitman was a theoretical and practical mechanic of superior order founded in the soundest personal and professional integrity he was a great favorite among the young engineers and students not a few of them yet remaining in kings and queens counties and new york city will remember jeff with oldtime goodwill and affection he was mostly selftaught and was a hard student  he had been troubled of late years from a bad throat and from gastric affection tending on typhoid and had been rather seriously ill with the last malady but was getting over the worst of it when he succumbd under a sudden and severe attack of the heart he died at st louis november 25 1890 in his 58th year of his family the wife died in 1873 and a daughter mannahatta died two years ago another daughter jessie louisa the only child left is now living in st louis  when jeff was born i was in my 15th year and had much care of him for many years afterward and he did not separate from me he was a very handsome healthy affectionate smart child and would sit on my lap or hang on my neck half an hour at a time as he grew a big boy he liked outdoor and water sports especially boating we would often go down summers to peconic bay east end of long island and over to shelter island i loved long rambles and he carried his fowlingpiece o what happy times weeks then in brooklyn and new york city he learnd printing and workd awhile at it but eventually with my approval he went to employment at land surveying and merged in the studies and work of topographical engineer this satisfied him and he continued at it he was of noble nature from the first very goodnatured very plain very friendly o how we loved each otherhow many jovial good times we had once we made a long trip from new york city down over the allegheny mountains the national road and via the ohio and mississippi rivers from cairo to new orleans  gods blessing on your name and memory dear brother jeff  w w   old actors singers shows c in new york  flitting mentionwith much left out  seems to me i ought acknowledge my debt to actors singers public speakers conventions and the stage in new york my youthful days from 1835 onwardsay to 60 or 61and to plays and operas generally which nudges a pretty big disquisition of course it should be all elaborated and penetrated more deeplybut i will here give only some flitting mentionings of my youth seems to me now when i look back the italian contralto marietta alboni she is living yet in paris 1891 in good condition good voice yet considering with the then prominent histrions booth edwin forrest and fanny kemble and the italian singer bettini have had the deepest and most lasting effect upon me i should like well if madame alboni and the old composer verdi and bettini the tenor if he is living could know how much noble pleasure and happiness they gave me and how deeply i always remember them and thank them to this day for theatricals in literature and doubtless upon me personally including opera have been of course serious factors the experts and musicians of my present friends claim that the new wagner and his pieces belong far more truly to me and i to them likely but i was fed and bred under the italian dispensation and absorbd it and doubtless show it  as a young fellow when possible i always studied a play or libretto quite carefully over by myself sometimes twice through before seeing it on the stage read it the day or two days before tried both waysnot reading some beforehand but i found i gaind most by getting that sort of mastery first if the piece had depth surface effects and glitter were much less thought of i am sure those times there were many fine old plays neither tragedies nor comediesthe names of them quite unknown to todays current audiences all is not gold that glitters in which charlotte cushman had a superbly enacted part was of that kind c c who reveld in them was great in such pieces i think better than in the heavy popular roles  we had some fine music those days we had the english opera of cinderella with henry placide as the pompous old father an unsurpassable bit of comedy and music we had bombastes furioso must have been in 1844 or 5 i saw charles kean and mrs kean ellen treesaw them in the park in shaksperes king john he of course was the chief character she playd queen constance tom hamblin was faulconbridge and probably the best ever on the stage it was an immense showpiece too lots of grand set scenes and fine armorsuits and all kinds of appointments imported from london where it had been first renderd the large brass bandsthe three or four hundred supesthe interviews between the french and english armiesthe talk with hubert and the hot irons the delicious acting of prince arthur mrs richardson i thinkand all the fine blare and court pompi remember to this hour the deathscene of the king in the orchard of swinstead abbey was very effective kean rushd in graypale and yellow and threw himself on a lounge in the open his pangs were horribly realistic he must have taken lessons in some hospital  fanny kemble playd to wonderful effect in such pieces as fazio or the italian wife the turningpoint was jealousy it was a rapidrunning yet heavytimberd tremendous wrenching passionate play such old pieces always seemd to me built like an ancient ship of the line solid and lockd from keel upoak and metal and knots one of the finest characters was a great court lady aldabella enacted by mrs sharpe o how it all entranced us and knockd us about as the scenes swept on like a cyclone  saw hackett at the old park many times and remember him well his renderings were firstrate in everything he inaugurated the true rip van winkle and lookd and acted and dialogued it to perfection he was of dutch breed and brought up among old holland descendants in kings and queens counties long island the play and the acting of it have been adjusted to please popular audiences since but there was in that original performance certainly something of a far higher order more art more reality more resemblance a bit of fine pathos a lofty brogue beyond anything afterward  one of my big treats was the rendering at the old park of shaksperes tempest in musical version there was a very fine instrumental band not numerous but with a capital leader mrs austin was the ariel and peter richings the caliban both excellent the drunken song of the latter has probably been never equald the perfect actor clarke old clarke was prospero  yes there were in new york and brooklyn some fine nontechnical singing performances concerts such as the hutchinson band three brothers and the sister the redcheekd new england carnation sweet abby sometimes plaintive and balladicsometimes antislavery anticalomel and comic there were concerts by templeton russell dempster the old alleghanian band and many others then we had lots of negro minstrels with capital character songs and voices i often saw rice the original jim crow at the old park theatre filling up the gap in some short billand the wild chants and dances were admirableprobably ahead of anything since every theatre had some superior voice and it was common to give a favorite song between the acts the sea at the bijou olympic broadway near grand was always welcome from a little englishman named edwin a good balladist at the bowery the loves of sweet william      when on the downs the fleet was moord  always brot an encore and sometimes a treble  i remember jenny lind and heard her 1850 i think several times she had the most brilliant captivating popular musical style and expression of any one known the canary and several other sweet birds are wondrous finebut there is something in song that goes deeperisnt there  the great egyptian collection was well up in broadway and i got quite acquainted with dr abbott the proprietorpaid many visits there and had long talks with him in connection with my readings of many books and reports on egyptits antiquities history and how things and the scenes really look and what the old relics stand for as near as we can now get dr a was an englishman of say 54had been settled in cairo as physician for 25 years and all that time was collecting these relics and sparing no time or money seeking and getting them by advice and for a change of base for himself he brought the collection to america but the whole enterprise was a fearful disappointment in the pay and commercial part as said i went to the egyptian museum many many times sometimes had it all to myselfdelved at the formidable catalogueand on several occasions had the invaluable personal talk correction illustration and guidance of dr a himself he was very kind and helpful to me in those studies and examinations once by appointment he appeard in full and exact turkish cairo costume which long usage there had made habitual to him  one of the choice places of new york to me then was the phrenological cabinet of fowler  wells nassau street near beekman here were all the busts examples curios and books of that study obtainable i went there often and once for myself had a very elaborate and leisurely examination and chart of bumps written out i have it yet by nelson fowler or was it sizer there  and who remembers the renownd new york tabernacle of those days before the war it was on the east side of broadway near pearl streetwas a great turtleshaped hall and you had to walk back from the street entrance thro a long wide corridor to get to itwas very stronghad an immense galleryaltogether held three or four thousand people here the huge annual conventions of the windy and cyclonic reformatory societies of those times were heldespecially the tumultuous antislavery ones i remember hearing wendell phillips emerson cassius clay john p hale beecher fred douglas the burleighs garrison and others sometimes the hutchinsons would singvery fine sometimes there were angry rows a chap named isaiah rhynders a fierce politician of those days with a band of robust supporters would attempt to contradict the speakers and break up the meetings but the antislavery and quaker and temperance and missionary and other conventicles and speakers were tough tough and always maintained their ground and carried out their programs fully i went frequently to these meetings may after maylearnd much from themwas sure to be on hand when j p hale or cash clay made speeches  there were also the smaller and handsome halls of the historical and athensum societies up on broadway i very well remember wc bryant lecturing on homoeopathy in one of them and attending two or three addresses by rw emerson in the other  there was a series of plays and dramatic genre characters by a gentleman billd as rangervery fine better than merely technical full of exquisite shades like the light touches of the violin in the hands of a master there was the actor anderson who brought us gerald griffins gysippus and playd it to admiration among the actors of those times i recall cooper wallack tom hamblin adams several old gates scott wm sefton john sefton geo jones mitchell seguin old clarke richings fisher h placide t placide thorne ingersoll gale mazeppa edwin horncastle some of the women hastily rememberd were mrs vernon mrs pritchard mrs mcclure mary taylor clara fisher mrs richardson mrs flynn then the singers english italian and other mrs wood mrs seguin mrs austin grisi la grange steffanone bosio truffi parodi vestvali bertucca jenny lind gazzaniga laborde and the opera men bettini badiali marini mario brignoli amodio beneventano and many many others whose names i do not at this moment recall  in another paper i have described the elder booth and the bowery theatre of those times afterward there was the chatham the elder thorne mrs thorne william and john sefton kirby brougham and sometimes edwin forrest himself playd there i remember them all and many more and especially the fine theatre on broadway near pearl in 1855 and 6  there were very good circus performances or horsemanship in new york and brooklyn every winter in the firstnamed city a regular place in the bowery nearly opposite the old theatre fine animals and fine riding which i often witnessd remember seeing near here a young fierce splendid lion presented by an african barbary sultan to president andrew jackson the gift comprised also a lot of jewels a fine steel sword and an arab stallion and the lion was made over to a showman  if it is worth while i might add that there was a small but wellappointed amateurtheatre up broadway with the usual stage orchestra pit boxes c and that i was myself a member for some time and acted parts in it several timessecond parts as they were calld perhaps it too was a lesson or helpd that way at any rate it was full of fun and enjoyment  and so let us turn off the gas out in the brilliancy of the footlightsfilling the attention of perhaps a crowded audience and making many a breath and pulse swell and riseo so much passion and imparted lifeover and over again the season throughwalking gesticulating singing reciting his or her partbut then sooner or later inevitably wending to the flies or exit doorvanishing to sight and earand never materializing on this earths stage again   some personal and oldage jottings  anything like unmitigated acceptance of my leaves of grass book and heartfelt response to it in a popular however faint degree bubbled forth as a fresh spring from the ground in england in 1876 the time was a critical and turning point in my personal and literary life let me revert to my memorandum book camden new jersey that year filld with addresses receipts purchases c of the two volumes pubd then by myselfthe leaves and the two rivuletssome home customers for them but mostly from the british islands i was seriously paralyzed from the secession war poor in debt was expecting death the doctors put four chances out of five against meand i had the books printed during the lingering interim to occupy the tediousness of glum days and nights curiously the sale abroad proved prompt and what one might call copious the names came in lists and the money with them by foreign mail the price was 10 a set both the cash and the emotional cheer were deep medicines many paid double or treble price tennyson and ruskin did and many sent kind and eulogistic letters ladies clergymen social leaders persons of rank and high officials those blessed gales from the british islands probably certainly saved me here are some of the names for i wd like

have a biographer i charge him to put it in the narrative i have had the noblest friends and backers in america wm oconnor dr rm bucke john burroughs geow childs good ones in boston and carnegie and rg ingersoll in new york and yet perhaps the tenderest and gratefulest breath of my heart has gone and ever goes over the seagales across the big pond  about myself at present i will soon enter upon my 73d year if i livehave passd an active life as country schoolteacher gardener printer carpenter author and journalist domicild in nearly all the united states and principal cities north and southwent to the front moving about and occupied as army nurse and missionary during the secession war 1861 to 65 and in the virginia hospitals and after the battles of that time tending the northern and southern wounded alikeworkd down south and in washington city arduously three yearscontracted the paralysis which i have sufferd ever sinceand now live in a little cottage of my own near the delaware in new jersey my chief book unrhymd and unmetrical it has taken thirty years peace and war a borning has its aim as once said to utter the same old human critterbut now in democratic american modern and scientific conditions then i have publishd two prose works specimen days and a late one november boughs a little volume goodbye my fancy is soon to be out wh will finish the matter i do not propose here to enter the muchfought field of the literary criticism of any of those works  but for a few portraiture or descriptive bits today in the upper story of a little wooden house of two stories near the delaware river east shore sixty miles up from the sea is a rather large 20by20 low ceilingd room something like a big old ships cabin the floor three quarters of it with an ingrain carpet is half coverd by a deep litter of books papers magazines throwndown letters and circulars rejected manuscripts memoranda bits of light or strong twine a bundle to be expressd and two or three venerable scrap books in the room stand two large tables one of ancient st domingo mahogany with immense leaves coverd by a jumble of more papers a varied and copious array of writing materials several glass and china vessels or jars some with colognewater others with real honey granulated sugar a large bunch of beautiful fresh yellow chrysanthemums some letters and envelopt papers ready for the post office many photographs and a hundred indescribable things besides there are all around many books some quite handsome editions some half coverd by dust some within reach evidently used goodsized print no type less than long primer some maps the bible the strong cheap edition of the english crown homer shakspere walter scott emerson ticknors spanish literature john carlyles dante feltons greece george sands consuelo avery choice little epictetus some novels the latest foreign and american monthlies quarterlies and so on there being quite a strew of printers proofs and slips and the daily papers the place with its quaint old fashiond calmness has also a smack of something alert and of current work there are several trunks and depositaries back d up at the walls one wellbound and big box came by express lately from washington city after storage there for nearly twenty years indeed the whole room is a sort of result and storage collection of my own past life i have here various editions of my own writings and sell them upon request one is a big volume of complete poems and prose 1000 pages autograph essays speeches portraits from life c another is a little leaves of grass latest date six portraits morocco bound in pocketbook form  fortunately the apartment is quite roomy there are three windows in front at one side is the stove with a cheerful fire of oak wood near by a good supply of fresh sticks whose faint aroma is plain on another side is the bed with white coverlid and woollen blankets toward the windows is a huge armchair a christmas present from thomas donaldsons young daughter and son philadelphia timberd as by some stout ships spars yellow polishd ample with rattanwoven seat and back and over the latter a great wide wolfskin of hairy black and silver spread to guard against cold and draught a timeworn look and scent of old oak attach both to the chair and the person occupying it  but probably even at the charge of parrot talk i can give no more authentic brief sketch than from an old remembrance copy where i have lately put myself on record as follows was born may 31 1819 in my fathers farmhouse at west hills li new york state my parents folks mostly farmers and sailorson my fathers side of englishon my mothers van velsors from hollandic immigration there was first and last a large family of children i was the second we moved to brooklyn while i was still a little one in frocksand there in b i grew up out of frocksthen as child and boy went to the public schoolsthen to work in a printing office when only sixteen or seventeen years old and for three years afterward i went to teaching country schools down in queens and suffolk counties long island and boarded round then returning to new york workd as printer and writer with an occasional shy at poetry  18489about this timeafter ten or twelve years of experiences and work and lots of fun in new york and brooklynwent off on a leisurely journey and working expedition my brother jeff with me through all the middle states and down the ohio and mississippi rivers lived a while in new orleans and workd there have lived quite a good deal in the southern states after a time plodded back northward up the mississippi the missouri c and around to and by way of the great lakes michigan huron and erie to niagara falls and lower canadafinally returning through central new york and down the hudson 185254occupied in housebuilding in brooklyn for a little while of the first part of that time in printing a daily and weekly paper  1855lost my dear father this year by death commenced putting leaves of grass to press for goodafter many mss doings and undoingsi had great trouble in leaving out the stock poetical touchesbut succeeded at last the book has since had some eight hitches or stages of growth with one annex and another to come out in 1891 which will complete it  1862in december of this year went down to the field of war in virginia my brother george reported badly wounded in the fredericksburg fight for 1863 and 64 see specimen days 1865 to 71had a place as clerk till well on in 73 in the attorney  generals office washington new york and brooklyn seem more like home as i was born near and brought up in them and lived man and boy for 30 years but i lived some years in washington and have visited and partially lived in most of the western and eastern cities  1873this year lost by death my dear dear motherand just before my sister marthathe two best and sweetest women i have ever seen or known or ever expect to see same year february a sudden climax and prostration from paralysis had been simmering inside for several years broke out during those times temporarily and then went over but now a serious attack beyond cure dr drinkard my washington physician and a firstrate one said it was the result of too extreme bodily and emotional strain continued at washington and down in front in 1863 4 and 5 i doubt if a heartier stronger healthier physique more balanced upon itself or more unconscious more sound ever lived from 1835 to 72 my greatest call quaker to go around and do what i could there in those warscenes where i had fallen among the sick and wounded was that i seemd to be so strong and well i considerd myself invulnerable but this last attack shatterd me completely quit work at washington and moved to camden new jerseywhere i have lived since receiving many buffets and some precious caressesand now write these lines since then 187491 a long stretch of illness or halfillness with occasional lulls during these latter have revised and printed over all my booksbrot out november boughsand at intervals leisurely and exploringly traveld to the prairie states the rocky mountains canada to new york to my birthplace in long island and to boston but physical disability and the warparalysis above alluded to to have settled upon me more and more the last year or so am now 1891 domicild and have been for some years in this little old cottage and lot in mickle street camden with a housekeeper and man nurse bodily i am completely disabled but still write for publication i keep generally buoyant spirits write often as there comes any lull in physical sufferings get in the sun and down to the river whenever i can retain fair appetite assimilation and digestion sensibilities acute as ever the strength and volition of my right arm good eyesight dimming but brain normal and retain my hearts and souls unmitigated faith not only in their own original literary plans but in the essential bulk of american humanity east and west north and south city and country through thick and thin to the last nor must i forget in conclusion a special prayerful thankful gods blessing to my dear firm friends and personal helpers men and women home and foreign old and young   out in the open again  from the camden post april 16 91  walt whitman got out in the midapril sun and warmth of yesterday propelled in his wheel chair the first time after four months of imprisonment in his sick room he has had the worst winter yet mainly from grippe and gastric troubles and threatend blindness but keeps good spirits and has a new little forthcoming book in the printers hands   americas bulk average  if i were askd persona to specify the one point of americas people on which i mainly rely i should say the final average or bulk quality of the whole  happy indeed wd i consider myself to give a fair reflection and representation of even a portion of shows questions humanity events unfoldings thoughts c c my age in these states  the great social political historic function of my time has been of course the attempted secession war  and was there not something grand and an inside proof of perennial grandeur in that war we talk of our ages and the states materialismand it is too true but how amid the whole sordidnessthe entire devotion of america at any price to pecuniary success merchandisedisregarding all but business and profitthis war for a bare idea and abstractiona mere at bottom heroic dream and reminiscenceburst forth in its great devouring flame and conflagration quickly and fiercely spreading and raging and enveloping all defining in two conflicting ideasfirst the union causesecond the other a strange deadly interrogation point hard to definecan we not now safely confess itwith magnificent rays streaks of noblest heroism fortitude perseverance and even conscientiousness through its pervadingly malignant darkness what an area and rounded field upon the wholethe spirit arrogance grim tenacity of the souththe long stretches of murky gloomthe general national will below and behind and comprehending allnot once really wavering not a day not an hourwhat could be or even can be grander  as in that war its four yearsas through the whole history and development of the new worldthese states through all trials processes eruptions deepest dilemmas often straining tugging at societys heartstrings as if some divine curiosity would find out how much this democracy could stand have so far finally and for more than a century best justified themselves by the average impalpable quality and personality of the bulk the people en masse i am not sure but my main and chief however indefinite claim for any page of mine wd be its derivation or seeking to derive itself fm that average quality of the american bulk the people and getting back to it again   last saved items  im a vast batch left to oblivion  in its highest aspect and striking its grandest average essential poetry expresses and goes along with essential religionhas been and is more the adjunct and more serviceable to that true religion for of course there is a false one and plenty of it than all the priests and creeds and churches that now exist or have ever existedeven while the temporary prevalent theory and practice of poetry is merely oneside and ornamental and daintya lovesigh a bit of jewelry a feudal conceit an ingenious tale or intellectual finesse adjusted to the low taste and calibre that will always sufficiently generally prevailranges of stairs necessary to ascend the higher  the sectarian church and doctrinal follies crimes fanaticisms aggregate and individual so rife all thro history are proofs of the radicalness and universality of the indestructible element of humanitys religion just as much as any and are the other side of it just as disease proves health and is the other side of it the philosophy of greece taught normality and the beauty of life christianity teaches how to endure illness and death i have wonderd whether a third philosophy fusing both and doing full justice to both might not be outlined  it will not be enough to say that no nation ever achievd materialistic political and moneymaking successes with general physical comfort as fully as the united states of america are today achieving them i know very well that those are the indispensable foundationsthe sine qua non of moral and heroic poetic fruitions to come for if those presuccesses were allif they ended at thatif nothing more were yielded than so far appearsa gross materialistic prosperity onlyamerica tried by subtlest tests were a failurehas not advanced the standard of humanity a bit further than other nations or in plain terms has but inherited and enjoyd the results of ordinary claims and preceding ages  nature seemd to use me a long whilemyself all well able strong and happyto portray power freedom health but after a while she seems to fancy maybe i can see and understand it all better by being deprived of most of those  how difficult it is to add anything more to literatureand how unsatisfactory for any earnest spirit to serve merely the amusement of the multitude it even seems to me said h heine more invigorating to accomplish something bad than something empty  the highest said dont let us begin so lowisnt our range too coarsetoo gross the soul answerd no not when we consider what it is all forthe end involved in time and space  essentially my own printed records all my volumes are doubtless but offhand utterances fm personality spontaneous following implicitly the inscrutable command dominated by that personality vaguely even if decidedly and with little or nothing of plan art erudition c if i have chosen to hold the reins the mastery it has mainly been to give the way the power the road to the invisible steeds i wanted to see how a person of america the last half of the 19th century wd appear but quite freely and fairly in honest type  havent i given specimen clues if no more at any rate i have written enough to weary myselfand i will dispatch it to the printers and cease but how muchhow many topics of the greatest pointand cogency i am leaving untouchd     walt whitmans last 49    goodbye my fancyconcluding annex to leaves of grass  the highest said dont let us begin so lowisnt our range too coarsetoo gross the soul answerd no not when we consider what it is all forthe end involved in time and spacean item from last page of goodbye  h heines first principle of criticising a book was what motive is the author trying to carry out or express or accomplish and the second has he achievd it  the theory of my leaves of grass as a composition of verses has been from first to last if i am to give impromptu a hint of the spinal marrow of the business and sign it with my name to thoroughly possess the mind memory cognizance of the author himself with everything beforehanda full armory of concrete actualities observations humanity past poems ballads facts technique war and peace politics north and south east and west nothing too large or too small the sciences as far as possibleand above all america and the presentafter and out of which the subject of the poem long or short has been invariably turned over to his emotionality even personality to be shaped thence and emerges strictly therefrom with all its merits and demerits on its head every page of my poetic or attempt at poetic utterance therefore smacks of the living physical identity date environment individuality probably beyond anything known and in style often offensive to the conventions  this new last cluster goodby my fancy follows suit and yet with a difference the clef is here changed to its lowest and the little book is a lot of tremolos about old age death and faith the physical just lingers but almost vanishes the book is garrulous irascible like old lear and has various breaks and even tricks to avoid monotony it will have to be ciphered and ciphered out longand is probably in some respects the most curious part of its authors baffling works  walt whitman   note  49 published in lippincotts magazine august 1891 with the following note added by the editor of the magazine with goodbye my fancy walt whitman has rounded out his lifework this book is his last message and of course a great deal will be said about it by critics all over the world both in praise and dispraise but probably nothing that the critics will say will be as interesting as this characteristic utterance upon the book by the poet himself it is the subjective view as opposed to the objective views of the critics briefly whitman gives as he puts it a hint of the spinal marrow of the business not only of goodbye my fancy but also of the leaves of grass  it was only after considerable persuasion on the editors part that mr whitman consented to write the above as a concise explanation of the poets lifework it must have great value to his readers and admirers after the critics have ciphered and ciphered out long they will probably have nothing better to say
