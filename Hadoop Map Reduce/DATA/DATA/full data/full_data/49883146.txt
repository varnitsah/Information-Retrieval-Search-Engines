   chapter i  without   snow everywhere as far as the eye could reachfifty miles looking southward from the highest white peakfilling ravines and gulches and dropping from the walls of cañons in white shroudlike drifts fashioning the dividing ridge into the likeness of a monstrous grave hiding the bases of giant pines and completely covering young trees and larches rimming with porcelain the bowllike edges of still cold lakes and undulating in motionless white billows to the edge of the distant horizon snow lying everywhere over the california sierras on the 15th day of march 1848 and still falling  it had been snowing for ten days snowing in finely granulated powder in damp spongy flakes in thin feathery plumes snowing from a leaden sky steadily snowing fiercely shaken out of purpleblack clouds in white flocculent masses or dropping in long level lines like white lances from the tumbled and broken heavens but always silently the woods were so choked with itthe branches were so laden with itit had so permeated filled and possessed earth and sky it had so cushioned and muffled the ringing rocks and echoing hills that all sound was deadened the strongest gust the fiercest blast awoke no sigh or complaint from the snowpacked rigid files of forest there was no cracking of bough nor crackle of underbrush the overladen branches of pine and fir yielded and gave way without a sound the silence was vast measureless complete nor could it be said that any outward sign of life or motion changed the fixed outlines of this stricken landscape above there was no play of light and shadow only the occasional deepening of storm or night below no bird winged its flight across the white expanse no beast haunted the confines of the black woods whatever of brute nature might have once inhabited these solitudes had long since flown to the lowlands  there was no track or imprint whatever foot might have left its mark upon this waste each succeeding snowfall obliterated all trace or record every morning the solitude was virgin and unbroken a million tiny feet had stepped into the track and filled it up and yet in the centre of this desolation in the very stronghold of this grim fortress there was the mark of human toil a few trees had been felled at the entrance of the cañon and the freshlycut chips were but lightly covered with snow they served perhaps to indicate another tree blazed with an axe and bearing a rudelyshaped wooden effigy of a human hand pointing to the cañon below the hand was a square strip of canvas securely nailed against the bark and bearing the following inscription                              notice      captain conroys party of emigrants are lost in the snow and     camped up in this cañon out of provisions and

but i think that rhetoric could not improve this actual record so i let it stand even as it stood this 15th day of march 1848 halfhidden by a thin film of damp snow the snowwhitened hand stiffened and pointing rigidly to the fateful cañon like the finger of death  at noon there was a lull in the storm and a slight brightening of the sky toward the east the grim outlines of the distant hills returned and the starved white flank of the mountain began to glisten across its gaunt hollow some black object was movingmoving slowly and laboriously moving with such an uncertain mode of progression that at first it was difficult to detect whether it was brute or humansometimes on all fours sometimes erect again hurrying forward like a drunken man but always with a certain definiteness of purpose towards the cañon as it approached nearer you saw that it was a mana haggard man ragged and enveloped in a tattered buffalo robe but still a man and a determined one a young man despite his bent figure and wasted limbsa young man despite the premature furrows that care and anxiety had set upon his brow and in the corners of his rigid moutha young man notwithstanding the expression of savage misanthropy with which suffering and famine had overlaid the frank impulsiveness of youth when he reached the tree at the entrance of the cañon he brushed the film of snow from the canvas placard and then leaned for a few moments exhaustedly against its trunk there was something in the abandonment of his attitude that indicated even more pathetically than his face and figure his utter prostrationa prostration quite inconsistent with any visible cause when he had rested himself he again started forward with a nervous intensity shambling shuffling falling stooping to replace the rudely extemporised snowshoes of fir bark that frequently slipped from his feet but always starting on again with the feverishness of one who doubted even the sustaining power of his will  a mile beyond the tree the cañon narrowed and turned gradually to the south and at this point a thin curling cloud of smoke was visible that seemed to rise from some crevice in the snow as he came nearer the impression of recent footprints began to show there was some displacement of the snow around a low mound from which the smoke now plainly issued here he stopped or rather lay down before an opening or cavern in the snow and uttered a feeble shout it was responded to still more feebly presently a face appeared above the opening and a ragged figure like his own then another and then another until eight human creatures men and women surrounded him in the snow squatting like animals and like animals lost to all sense of decency and shame  they were so haggard so faded so forlorn so wanso piteous in their human aspect or rather all that was left of a human aspectthat they might have been wept over as they sat there they were so brutal so imbecile unreasoning and grotesque in these newer animal attributes that they might have provoked a smile they were originally country people mainly of that social class whose selfrespect is apt to be dependent rather on their circumstances position and surroundings than upon any individual moral power or intellectual force they had lost the sense of shame in the sense of equality of suffering there was nothing within them to take the place of the material enjoyments they were losing they were childish without the ambition or emulation of childhood they were men and women without the dignity or simplicity of man and womanhood all that had raised them above the level of the brute was lost in the snow even the characteristics of sex were gone an old woman of sixty quarrelled fought and swore with the harsh utterance and ungainly gestures of a man a young man of scorbutic temperament wept sighed and fainted with the hysteria of a woman so profound was their degradation that the stranger who had thus evoked them from the earth even in his very rags and sadness seemed of another race  they were all intellectually weak and helpless but one a woman appeared to have completely lost her mind she carried a small blanket wrapped up to represent a childthe tangible memory of one that had starved to death in her arms a few days beforeand rocked it from side to side as she sat with a faith that was piteous but even more piteous was the fact that none of her companions took the least notice either by sympathy or complaint of her aberration when a few moments later she called upon them to be quiet for that baby was asleep they glared at her indifferently and went on a redhaired man who was chewing a piece of buffalo hide cast a single murderous glance at her but the next moment seemed to have forgotten her presence in his more absorbing occupation  the stranger paused a moment rather to regain his breath than to wait for their more orderly and undivided attention then he uttered the single word  nothing  nothing they all echoed the word simultaneously but with different inflection and significanceone fiercely another gloomily another stupidly another mechanically the woman with the blanket baby explained to it he says nothing and laughed  nonothing repeated the speaker yesterdays snow blocked up the old trail again the beacon on the summits burnt out i left a notice at the divide do that again dumphy and ill knock the top of your ugly head off  dumphy the redhaired man had rudely shoved and stricken the woman with the babyshe was his wife and this conjugal act may have been partly habitas she was crawling nearer the speaker she did not seem to notice the blow or its giverthe apathy with which these people received blows or slights was more terrible than wranglingbut said assuringly when she had reached the side of the young man  tomorrow then  the face of the young man softened as he made the same reply he had made for the last eight days to the same question  tomorrow surely  she crawled away still holding the effigy of her dead baby very carefully and retreated down the opening  pears to me you dont do much anyway out scouting pears to me you aint worth shucks said the harshvoiced woman glancing at the speaker why dont some on ye take his place why do you trust your lives and the lives of women to that thar ashley she continued with her voice raised to a strident bark  the hysterical young man henry march who sat next to her turned a wild scared face upon her and then as if fearful of being dragged into the conversation disappeared hastily after mrs dumphy  ashley shrugged his shoulders and replying to the group rather than any individual speaker said curtly  theres but one chanceequal for allopen to all you know what it is to stay here is death to go cannot be worse than that  he rose and walked slowly away up the cañon a few rods to where another mound was visible and disappeared from their view when he had gone a querulous chatter went around the squatting circle  gone to see the old doctor and the gal were no account  thars two too many in this yer party  yesthe crazy doctor and ashley  theyre both interlopers any way  jonahs  said no good could come of it ever since we picked him up  but the capn invited the ol doctor and took all his stock at sweetwater and ashley put in his provisions with the rest  the speaker was mccormick somewhere in the feeble depths of his consciousness there was still a lingering sense of justice he was hungry but not unreasonable besides he remembered with a tender regret the excellent quality of provision that ashley had furnished  whats that got to do with it screamed mrs brackett he brought the bad luck with him aint my husband dead and isnt that skunkan entire strangerstill livin  the voice was masculine but the logic was feminine in cases of great prostration with mental debility in the hopeless vacuity that precedes death by inanition or starvation it is sometimes very effective they all assented to it and by a singular intellectual harmony the expression of each was the same it was simply an awful curse  what are you goin to do  if i was a man id know  knife him  kill him and  the remainder of this sentence was lost to the others in a confidential whisper between mrs brackett and dumphy after this confidence they sat and wagged their heads together like two unmatched but hideous chinese idols  look at his strength and he not a workin man like us said dumphy dont tell me he dont get suthin reglar  suthin what  suthin to eat  but it is impossible to convey even by capitals the intense emphasis put upon this verb it was followed by a horrible pause  lets go and see  and kill him suggested the gentle mrs brackett  they all rose with a common interest almost like enthusiasm but after they had tottered a few steps they fell yet even then there was not enough selfrespect left among them to feel any sense of shame or mortification in their baffled design they stoppedall except dumphy  wots that dream you was talkin bout jess now said mr mccormick sitting down and abandoning the enterprise with the most shameless indifference  bout the dinner at st jo asked the person addresseda gentleman whose faculty of alimentary imagination had been at once the bliss and torment of his present social circle  yes  they all gathered eagerly around mr mccormick even mr dumphy who was still moving away stopped  well said mr march it began with beefsteak and injinsbeefsteak you know juicy and cut very thick and jess squashy with gravy and injins there was a very perceptible watering of the mouth in the party and mr march with the genius of a true narrator under the plausible disguise of having forgotten his story repeated the last sentencejess squashy with gravy and injins and tatersbaked  you said fried beforeand dripping with fat interposed mrs brackett hastily  for them as likes friedbut baked goes furderskins and alland sassage and coffee and flapjacks  at this magical word they laughed not mirthfully perhaps but eagerly and expectantly and said go on  and flapjacks  you said that afore said mrs brackett with a burst of passion go on with an oath  the giver of this barmecide feast saw his dangerous position and looked around for dumphy but he had disappeared     chapter ii  within   the hut into which ashley descended was like a greenlanders iglook below the surface of the snow accident rather than design had given it this arctic resemblance as snow upon snow had blocked up its entrance and reared its white ladders against its walls and as the strength of its exhausted inmates slowly declined communication with the outward world was kept up only by a single narrow passage excluded from the air it was close and stifling but it had a warmth that perhaps the thin blood of its occupants craved more than light or ventilation  a smouldering fire in a wooden chimney threw a faint flicker on the walls by its light lying on the floor were discernible four figuresa young woman and a child of three or four years wrapped in a single blanket near the fire nearer the door two men separately enwrapped lay apart they might have been dead so deep and motionless were their slumbers  perhaps some fear of this filled the mind of ashley as he entered for after a moments hesitation without saying a word he passed quickly to the side of the young woman and kneeling beside her placed his hand upon her face slight as was the touch it awakened her i know not what subtle magnetism was in that contact but she caught the hand in her own sat up and before the eyes were scarcely opened uttered the single word  philip  gracehush  he took her hand kissed it and pointed warningly toward the other sleepers  speak low i have much to say to you  the young girl seemed to be content to devour the speaker with her eyes  you have come back she whispered with a faint smile and a look that showed too plainly the predominance of that fact above all others in her mind i dreamt of you philip  dear gracehe kissed her hand again listen to me darling i have come back but only with the old storyno signs of succour no indications of help from without my belief is grace he added in a voice so low as to be audible only to the quick ear to which it was addressed that we have blundered far south of the usual travelled trail nothing but a miracle or a misfortune like our own would bring another train this way we are alone and helplessin an unknown region that even the savage and brute have abandoned the only aid we can calculate upon is from withinfrom ourselves what that aid amounts to he continued turning a cynical eye towards the sleepers you know as well as i  she pressed his hand apologetically as if accepting the reproach herself but did not speak  as a party we have no strengthno discipline he went on since your father died we have had no leader i know what you would say grace dear he continued answering the mute protest of the girls hand but even if it were trueif i were capable of leading them they would not take my counsels perhaps it is as well if we kept together the greatest peril of our situation would be ever presentthe peril from ourselves  he looked intently at her as he spoke but she evidently did not take his meaning grace he said desperately when starving men are thrown together they are capable of any sacrificeof any crime to keep the miserable life that they hold so dear just in proportion as it becomes valueless you have read in booksgrace good god what is the matter  if she had not read his meaning in books she might have read it at that moment in the face that was peering in at the doora face with so much of animal suggestion in its horrible wistfulness that she needed no further revelation a face full of inhuman ferocity and watchful eagerness and yet a face familiar in its outlinesthe face of dumphy even with her danger came the swifter instinct of feminine tact and concealment and without betraying the real cause of her momentary horror she dropped her head upon philips shoulder and whispered i understand when she raised her head again the face was gone  enough i did not mean to frighten you grace but only to show you what we must avoidwhat we have still strength left to avoid there is but one chance of escape you know what it isa desperate one but no more desperate than this passive waiting for a certain end i ask you againwill you share it with me when i first spoke i was less sanguine than now since then i have explored the ground carefully and studied the trend of these mountains it is possible i say no more  but my sister and brother  the child would be a hopeless impediment even if she could survive the fatigue and exposure your brother must stay with her she will need all his remaining strength and all the hopefulness that keeps him up no grace we must go alone remember our safety means theirs their strength will last until we can send relief while they would sink in the attempt to reach it with us i would go alone but i cannot bear dear grace to leave you here  i should die if you left me she said simply  i believe you would grace he said as simply  but can we not wait help may come at any momenttomorrow  tomorrow will find us weaker i should not trust your strength nor my own a day longer  but the old manthe doctor  he will soon be beyond the reach of help said the young man sadly hush he is moving  one of the blanketed figures had rolled over philip walked to the fire threw on a fresh stick and stirred the embers the upspringing flash showed the face of an old man whose eyes were fixed with feverish intensity upon him  what are you doing with the fire he asked querulously with a slight foreign accent  stirring it  leave it alone  philip listlessly turned away  come here said the old man  philip approached  you need say nothing said the old man after a pause in which he examined philips face keenly i read your news in your facethe old storyi know it by heart  well said philip  well said the old man stolidly  philip again turned away  you buried the case and papers asked the old man  yes  through the snowin the earth  yes  securely  securely  how do you indicate it  by a cairn of stones  and the noticesin german and french  i nailed them up wherever i could near the old trail  good  the cynical look on philips face deepened as he once more turned away but before he reached the door he paused and drawing from his breast a faded flower with a few limp leaves handed it to the old man  i found the duplicate of the plant you were looking for  the old man half rose on his elbow breathless with excitement as he clutched and eagerly examined the plant  it is the same he said with a sigh of relief and yet you said there was no news  may i ask what it means said philip with a slight smile  it means that i am right and linnæus darwin and eschscholtz are wrong it means a discovery it means that this which you call an alpine flower is not one but a new species  an important fact to starving men said philip bitterly  it means more continued the old man without heeding philips tone it means that this flower is not developed in perpetual snow it means that it is first germinated in a warm soil and under a kindly sun it means that if you had not plucked it it would have fulfilled its destiny under those conditions it means that in two months grass will be springing where you found iteven where we now lie we are below the limit of perpetual snow  in two months said the young girl eagerly clasping her hands  in two months said the young man bitterly in two months we shall be far from here or dead  probably said the old man coolly but if you have fulfilled my injunctions in regard to my papers and the collection they will in good time be discovered and saved  ashley turned away with an impatient gesture and the old mans head again sank exhaustedly upon his arm under the pretext of caressing the child ashley crossed over to grace uttered a few hurried and almost inaudible words and disappeared through the door when he had gone the old man raised his head again and called feebly  grace  dr devarges  come here  she rose and crossed over to his side  why did he stir the fire grace said devarges with a suspicious glance  i dont know  you tell him everythingdid you tell him that  i did not sir  devarges looked as if he would read the inmost thoughts of the girl and then as if reassured said  take it from the fire and let it cool in the snow  the young girl raked away the embers of the dying fire and disclosed what seemed to be a stone of the size of a hens egg incandescent and glowing with the aid of two halfburnt slicks she managed to extract it and deposited it in a convenient snowdrift near the door and then returned to the side of the old man  grace  sir  you are going away  grace did not speak  dont deny it i overheard you perhaps it is the best that you can do but whether it is or not you will do itof course grace what do you know of that man  neither the contact of daily familiarity the quality of suffering nor the presence of approaching death could subdue the womans nature in grace she instantly raised her shield from behind it she began to fence feebly with the dying man  why what we all know of him sira true friend a man to whose courage intellect and endurance we owe so much and so unselfish sir  humphwhat else  nothingexcept that he has always been your devoted friendand i thought you were his you brought him to us she said a little viciously  yesi picked him up at sweetwater but what do you know of his history what has he told you  he ran away from a wicked stepfather and relations whom he hated he came out west to live aloneamong the indiansor to seek his fortune in oregon he is very proudyou know sir he is as unlike us as you are sirhe is a gentleman he is educated  yes i believe thats what they call it here and he doesnt know the petals of a flower from the stamens muttered devarges well after you run away with him does he propose to marry you  for an instant a faint flush deepened the wan cheek of the girl and she lost her guard but the next moment she recovered it  oh sir said this arch hypocrite sweetly how can you jest so cruelly at such a moment the life of my dear brother and sister the lives of the poor women in yonder hut depend upon our going he and i are the only ones left who have strength enough to make the trial i can assist him for although strong i require less to support my strength than he something tells me we shall be successful we shall return soon with help oh sirit is no time for trifling now our liveseven your own is at stake  my own life said the old man impassively is already spent before you return if you return at all i shall be beyond your help  a spasm of pain appeared to pass over his face he lay still for a moment as if to concentrate his strength for a further effort but when he again spoke his voice was much lower and he seemed to articulate with difficulty  grace he said at last come nearer girli have something to tell you  grace hesitated within the last few moments a shy nervous dread of the man which she could not account for had taken possession of her she looked toward her sleeping brother  he will not waken said devarges following the direction of her eyes the anodyne still holds its effect bring me what you took from the fire  grace brought the stonea dull bluishgrey slag the old man took it examined it and then said to grace  rub it briskly on your blanket  grace did so after a few moments it began to exhibit a faint white lustre on its polished surface  it looks like silver said grace doubtfully  it is silver replied devarges  grace put it down quickly and moved slightly away  take it said the old manit is yours a year ago i found it in a ledge of the mountain range far west of this i know where it lies in bulka fortune grace do you hearhidden in the bluish stone you put in the fire for me last night i can tell you where and how to find it i can give you the title to itthe right of discovery take itit is yours  no no said the girl hurriedly keep it yourself you will live to enjoy it  never grace even were i to live i should not make use of it i have in my life had more than my share of it and it brought me no happiness it has no value to methe rankest weed that grows above it is worth more in my eyes take it to the world it means everythingwealth and position take it it will make you as proud and independent as your loverit will make you always gracious in his eyesit will be a setting to your beautyit will be a pedestal to your virtue take itit is yours  but you have relativesfriends said the girl drawing away from the shining stone with a half superstitious awe there are others whose claims  none greater than yours interrupted the old man with the nervous haste of failing breath call it a reward if you choose look upon it as a bribe to keep your lover to the fulfilment of his promise to preserve my manuscripts and collection think if you like that it is an act of retributionthat once in my life i might have known a young girl whose future would have been blessed by such a gift thinkthink what you likebut take it  his voice had sunk to a whisper a greyish pallor had overspread his face and his breath came with difficulty grace would have called her brother but with a motion of his hand devarges restrained her with a desperate effort he raised himself upon his elbow and drawing an envelope from his pocket put it in her hand  it containsmapdescription of mine and localityyourssay you will take itgrace quick say  his head had again sunk to the floor she stooped to raise it as she did so a slight shadow darkened the opening by the door she raised her eyes quickly and saw the face of dumphy  she did not shrink this time but with a sudden instinct she turned to devarges and said  i will  she raised her eyes again defiantly but the face had disappeared  thank you said the old man his lips moved again but without a sound a strange film had begun to gather in his eyes  dr devarges whispered grace  he did not speak he is dying thought the young girl as a new and sudden fear overcame her she rose quickly and crossed hurriedly to her brother and shook him a prolonged inspiration like a moan was the only response for a moment she glanced wildly around the room and then ran to the door  philip  there was no response she climbed up through the tunnellike opening it was already quite dark and a few feet beyond the hut nothing was distinguishable she cast a rapid backward glance and then with a sudden desperation darted forward into the darkness at the same moment two figures raised themselves from behind the shadow of the mound and slipped down the tunnel into the hutmrs brackett and mr dumphy they might have been the meanest predatory animalsso stealthy so eager so timorous so crouching and yet so agile were their motions they ran sometimes upright and sometimes on all fours hither and thither they fell over each other in their eagerness and struck and spat savagely at each other in the half darkness they peered into corners they rooted in the dying embers and among the ashes they groped among the skins and blankets they smelt and sniffed at every article they paused at last apparently unsuccessful and glared at each other  they must have eaten it said mrs brackett in a hoarse whisper  it didnt look like suthin to eat said dumphy  you saw em take it from the fire  yes  and rub it  yes  fool dont you see  what  it was a baked potato  dumphy sat dumfounded  why should they rub it it takes off the cracklin skins he said  theyve got such fine stomachs answered mrs bracket with an oath  dumphy was still aghast with the importance of his discovery  he said he knew where there was more he whispered eagerly  where  i didnt get to hear  fool why didnt ye rush in and grip his throat until he told yer hissed mrs brackett in a tempest of baffled rage and disappointment ye aint got the spunk of a flea let me get hold of that galhush whats that  hes moving said dumphy  in an instant they had both changed again into slinking crouching baffled animals eager only for escape yet they dared not move  the old man had turned over and his lips were moving in the mutterings of delirium presently he called grace  with a sign of caution to her companion the woman leaned over him  yes deary im here  tell him not to forget make him keep his promise ask him where it is buried  yes deary  hell tell you he knows  yes deary  at the head of monument cañon a hundred feet north of the lone pine dig two feet down below the surface of the cairn  yes  where the wolves cant get it  yes  the stones keep it from ravenous beasts  yes in course  that might tear it up  yes  starving beasts  yes deary  the fire of his wandering eyes went out suddenly like a candle his jaw dropped he was dead and over him the man and woman crouched in fearful joy looking at each other with the first smile that had been upon their lips since they had entered the fateful cañon     chapter iii  gabriel   it was found the next morning that the party was diminished by five philip ashley and grace conroy peter dumphy and mrs brackett were missing dr paul devarges was dead the death of the old man caused but little excitement and no sorrow the absconding of the others was attributed to some information which they had selfishly withheld from the remaining ones and produced a spasm of impotent rage in five minutes their fury knew no bounds the lives and property of the fugitives were instantly declared forfeit steps were takenabout twenty i thinkin the direction of their flight but finally abandoned  only one person knew that philip and grace had gone togethergabriel conroy on awakening early that morning he had found pinned to his blanket a paper with these words in pencil  god bless dear brother and sister and keep them until philip and i come back with help  with it were a few scraps of provisions evidently saved by grace from her scant rations and left as a parting gift these gabriel instantly turned into the common stock then he began to comfort the child added to his natural hopefulness he had a sympathetic instinct with the pains and penalties of childhood not so much a quality of his intellect as of his nature he had all the physical adaptabilities of a nursea large tender touch a low persuasive voice pliant yet unhesitating limbs and broad wellcushioned surfaces during the weary journey women had instinctively entrusted babies to his charge most of the dead had died in his arms all forms and conditions of helplessness had availed themselves of his easy capacity no one thought of thanking him i do not think he ever expected it he always appeared morally irresponsible and quite unconscious of his own importance and as is frequent in such cases there was a tendency to accept his services at his own valuation nay more there was a slight consciousness of superiority in those who thus gave him an opportunity of exhibiting his special faculty  olly he said after an airy preliminary toss would ye like to have a nice dolly  olly opened her wide hungry eyes in hopeful anticipation and nodded assent  a nice dolly with real mamma he continued who plays with it like a true baby would ye like to help her play with it  the idea of a joint partnership of this kind evidently pleased olly by its novelty  well then brother gabe will get you one but gracie will have to go away so that the dolls mamma kin come  olly at first resented this but eventually succumbed to novelty after the fashion of her sex starving or otherwise yet she prudently asked  is it ever hungry  it is never hungry replied gabriel confidently  oh said olly with an air of relief  then gabriel the cunning sought mrs dumphy the mentally alienated  you are jest killin of yourself with the tendin o that child he said after bestowing a caress on the blanket and slightly pinching an imaginary cheek of the effigy it would be likelier and stronger fur a playmate good gracious how thin it is gettin a change will do it good fetch it to olly and let her help you to tend it untiluntiltomorrow tomorrow was the extreme limit of mrs dumphys future  so mrs dumphy and her effigy were installed in gracies place and olly was made happy a finer nature or a more active imagination than gabriels would have revolted at this monstrous combination but gabriel only saw that they appeared contented and the first pressing difficulty of gracies absence was overcome so alternately they took care of the effigy the child simulating the cares of the future and losing the present in them the mother living in the memories of the past perhaps it might have been pathetic to have seen olly and mrs dumphy both saving the infinitesimal remnants of their provisions for the doll but the only spectator was one of the actors gabriel who lent himself to the deception and pathos to be effective must be viewed from the outside  at noon that day the hysterical young man gabriels cousin died gabriel went over to the other hut and endeavoured to cheer the survivors he succeeded in infecting them so far with his hopefulness as to loosen the tongue and imagination of the storyteller but at four oclock the body had not yet been buried it was evening and the three were sitting over the embers when a singular change came over mrs dumphy the effigy suddenly slipped from her hands and looking up gabriel perceived that her arms had dropped to her side and that her eyes were fixed on vacancy he spoke to her but she made no sign nor response of any kind he touched her and found her limbs rigid and motionless olly began to cry  the sound seemed to agitate mrs dumphy without moving a limb she said in a changed unnatural voice hark  olly choked her sobs at a sign from gabriel  theyre coming said mrs dumphy  which said gabriel  the relief party  where  far far away theyre jest setting out i see ema dozen men with pack horses and provisions the leader is an americanthe others are strangers theyre comingbut far oh so far away  gabriel fixed his eyes upon her but did not speak after a deathlike pause she went on  the sun is shining the birds are singing the grass is springing where they ridebut oh so fartoo far away  do you know them asked gabriel  no  do they know us  no  why do they come and how do they know where we are asked gabriel  their leader has seen us  where  in a dreama  footnote a i fear i must task the incredulous readers further patience by calling attention to what may perhaps prove the most literal and thoroughlyattested fact of this otherwise fanciful chronicle the condition and situation of the illfamed donner partythen an unknown unheralded cavalcade of emigrantsstarving in an unfrequented pass of the sierras was first made known to captain yount of napa in a dream the spanish records of california show that the relief party which succoured the survivors was projected upon this spiritual information  gabriel whistled and looked at the rag baby he was willing to recognise something abnormal and perhaps even prophetic in this insane woman but a coincident exaltation in a stranger who was not suffering from the illusions produced by starvation was beyond his credulity nevertheless the instincts of good humour and hopefulness were stronger and he presently asked  how will they come  up through a beautiful valley and a broad shining river then they will cross a mountain until they come to another beautiful valley with steep sides and a rushing river that runs so near us that i can almost hear it now dont you see it it is just beyond the snow peak there a green valley with the rain falling upon it look it is there  she pointed directly north toward the region of inhospitable snow  could you get to it asked the practical gabriel  no  why not  i must wait here for my baby she is coming for us she will find me here  when  tomorrow  it was the last time that she uttered that wellworn sentence for it was only a little past midnight that her baby came to hercame to her with a sudden light that might have been invisible to gabriel but that it was reflected in her own lacklustre eyescame to this poor halfwitted creature with such distinctness that she half rose stretched out her thin yearning arms and received ita corpse gabriel placed the effigy in her arms and folded them over it then he ran swiftly to the other hut for some unexplained reason he did not get further than the door what he saw there he has never told but when he groped his fainting way back to his own hut again his face was white and bloodless and his eyes wild and staring only one impulse remainedto fly for ever from the cursed spot he stopped only long enough to snatch up the sobbing and frightened olly and then with a loud cry to god to help himto help themhe dashed out and was lost in the darkness     chapter iv  nature shows them the way   it was a spur of the long gravelike ridge that lay to the north of the cañon up its gaunt white flank two figures had been slowly crawling since noon until at sunset they at last stood upon its outer verge outlined against the skyphilip and grace  for all the fatigues of the journey the want of nourishing food and the haunting shadow of the suffering she had left the face of grace flushed with the dying sun was very pretty the boys dress she had borrowed was illfitting and made her exquisite little figure still more diminutive but it could not entirely hide its graceful curves here in this rosy light the swooning fringes of her dark eyes were no longer hidden the perfect oval of her face even the few freckles on her short upper lip were visible to philip partly as a physical support partly to reassure her he put his arm tenderly around her waist then he kissed her it is possible that this last act was purely gratuitous  howbeit grace first asked with the characteristic prudence of her sex the question she had already asked many days before that day do you love me philip and philip with the ready frankness of our sex on such occasions had invariably replied i do  nevertheless the young man was preoccupied anxious and hungry it was the fourth day since they had left the hut on the second day they had found some pine cones with the nuts still intact and fresh beneath the snow and later a squirrels hoard on the third day philip had killed the proprietor and eaten him the same evening philip had espied a duck winging his way up the cañon philip strong in the belief that some inland lake was the immediate object of its flight had first marked its course and then brought it down with a long shot then having altered their course in accordance with it suggestion they ate their guide next morning for breakfast  philip was also disappointed the summit of the spur so laboriously attained only showed him the same endless succession of white snow billows stretching rigidly to the horizons edge there was no breakno glimpse of watercourse or lake there was nothing to indicate whence the bird had come or the probable point it was endeavouring to reach he was beginning to consider the feasibility of again changing their course when an unlookedfor accident took that volition from his hands  grace had ventured out to the extreme limit of the rocky cliff and with straining eyes was trying to peer beyond the snow fields when the treacherous ledge on which she was standing began to give way in an instant philip was at her side and had caught her hand but at the same moment a large rock of the ledge dropped from beneath her feet and left her with no support but his grasp the sudden shock loosened also the insecure granite on which philip stood before he could gain secure foothold it also trembled tottered slipped and then fell carrying philip and grace with it luckily this immense mass of stone and ice got fairly away before them and ploughed down the steep bank of the cliff breaking off the projecting rocks and protuberances and cutting a clean though almost perpendicular path down the mountain side even in falling philip had presence of mind enough to forbear clutching at the crumbling ledge and so precipitating the rock that might crush them before he lost his senses he remembered tightening his grip of graces arm and drawing her face and head forward to his breast and even in his unconsciousness it seemed that he instinctively guided her into the smooth passage or shoot made by the plunging rock below them and even then he was half conscious of dashing into sudden material darkness and out again into light and of the crashing and crackling of branches around him and even the brushing of the stiff pine needles against his face and limbs then he felt himself stopped and then and then only everything whirled confusedly by him and his brain seemed to partake of the motion and thenthe relief of utter blankness and oblivion when he regained his senses it was with a burning heat in his throat and the sensation of strangling when he opened his eyes he saw grace bending over him pale and anxious and chafing his hands and temples with snow there was a spot of blood upon her round cheek  you are hurt grace were the first words that philip gasped  nodear brave philipbut only so thankful and happy for your escape yet at the same moment the colour faded from her cheek and even the sunkissed line of her upper lip grew bloodless as she leaned back against a tree  but philip did not see her his eyes were rapidly taking in his strange surroundings he was lying among the broken fragments of pine branches and the débris of the cliff above in his ears was the sound of hurrying water and before him scarce a hundred feet a rushing river he looked up the red glow of sunset was streaming through the broken limbs and shattered branches of the snowthatched roof that he had broken through in his descent here and there along the river the same light was penetrating the interstices and openings of this strange vault that arched above this sunless stream  he knew now whence the duck had flown he knew now why he had not seen the watercourse before he knew now where the birds and beasts had betaken themselveswhy the woods and cañons were trackless here was at last the open road he staggered to his feet with a cry of delight  grace we are saved  grace looked at him with eyes that perhaps spoke more eloquently of joy at his recovery than of comprehension of his delight  look grace this is natures own roadonly a lane perhapsbut a clue to our way out of this wilderness as we descend the stream it will open into a broader valley  i know it she said simply  philip looked at her inquiringly  when i dragged you out of the way of the falling rocks and snow above i had a glimpse of the valley you speak of i saw it from there  she pointed to a ledge of rock above the opening where the great stone that had fallen had lodged  when you dragged me my child  grace smiled faintly  you dont know how strong i am she said and then proved it by fainting dead away  philip started to his feet and ran to her side then he felt for the precious flask that he had preserved so sacredly through all their hardships but it was gone he glanced around him it was lying on the snow empty for the first time in their weary pilgrimage philip uttered a groan at the sound grace opened her sweet eyes she saw her lover with the empty flask in his hand and smiled faintly  i poured it all down your throat dear she said you looked so fainti thought you were dyingforgive me  but i was only stunned and you grace you  am better now she said as she strove to rise but she uttered a weak little cry and fell back again  philip did not hear her he was already climbing the ledge she had spoken of when he returned his face was joyous  i see it grace it is only a few miles away it is still light and we shall camp there tonight  i am afraidnotdear philip said grace doubtfully  why not asked philip a little impatiently  becauseithinkmy leg is broken  grace  but she had fainted     chapter v  out of the woodsinto the shadow   happily grace was wrong her ankle was severely sprained and she could not stand philip tore up his shirt and with bandages dipped in snow water wrapped up the swollen limb then he knocked over a quail in the bushes and another duck and clearing away the brush for a camping spot built a fire and tempted the young girl with a hot supper the peril of starvation passed their greatest danger was overa few days longer of enforced rest and inactivity was the worst to be feared  the air had grown singularly milder with the last few hours at midnight a damp breeze stirred the pine needles above their heads and an ominous muffled beating was heard upon the snowpacked vault it was rain  it is the reveille of spring whispered philip  but grace was in no mood for poetryeven a lovers she let her head drop upon his shoulder and then said  you must go on dear and leave me here  grace  yes philip i can live till you come back i fear no danger now i am so much better off than they are  a few tears dropped on his hand philip winced perhaps it was his conscience perhaps there was something in the girls tone perhaps because she had once before spoken in the same way but it jarred upon a certain quality in his nature which he was pleased to call his common sense philip really believed himself a highsouled thoughtless ardent impetuous temperament saved only from destruction by the occasional dominance of this quality  for a moment he did not speak he thought how at the risk of his own safety he had snatched this girl from terrible death he thought how he had guarded her through their perilous journey taking all the burdens upon himself he thought how happy he had made herhow she had even admitted her happiness to him he thought of her present helplessness and how willing he was to delay the journey on her account he dwelt even upon a certain mysterious illdefined but blissful future with him to which he was taking her and yet here at the moment of their possible deliverance she was fretting about two dying people who without miraculous interference would be dead before she could reach them it was part of philips equitable selfexaminationa fact of which he was very proudthat he always put himself in the position of the person with whom he differed and imagined how he would act under the like circumstances perhaps it is hardly necessary to say that philip always found that his conduct under those conditions would be totally different in the present instance putting himself in graces position he felt that he would have abandoned all and everything for a love and future like hers that she did not was evidence of a moral deficiency or a blood taint logic of this kind is easy and irrefutable it has been known to obtain even beyond the sierras and with people who were not physically exhausted after a pause he said to grace in a changed voice  let us talk plainly for a few moments grace and understand each other before we go forward or backward it is five days since we left the hut were we even certain of finding our wandering way back again we could not reach them before another five days had elapsed by that time all will be over they have either been saved or are beyond the reach of help this sounds harsh grace but it is no harsher than the fact had we stayed we would without helping them have only shared their fate i might have been in your brothers place you in your sisters it is our fortune not our fault that we are not dying with them it has been willed that you and i should be saved it might have been willed that we should have perished in our attempts to succour them and that relief which came to them would have never reached us  grace was no logician and could not help thinking that if philip had said this before she would not have left the hut but the masculine reader will i trust at once detect the irrelevance of the feminine suggestion and observe that it did not refute philips argument she looked at him with a half frightened air perhaps it was the tears that dimmed her eyes but his few words seemed to have removed him to a great distance and for the first time a strange sense of loneliness came over her she longed to reach her yearning arms to him again but with this feeling came a sense of shame that she had not felt before  philip noticed her hesitation and half interpreted it he let her passive head fall  perhaps we had better wait until we are ourselves out of danger before we talk of helping others he said with something of his old bitterness this accident may keep us here some days and we know not as yet where we are go to sleep now he said more kindly and in the morning we will see what can be done  grace sobbed herself to sleep poor poor grace she had been looking for this opportunity of speaking about herselfabout their future this was to have been the beginning of her confidence about dr devargess secret she would have told him frankly all the doctor had said even his suspicions of philip himself and then philip would have been sure to have told her his plans and they would have gone back with help and philip would have been a hero whom gabriel would have instantly recognised as the proper husband for grace and they would have all been very happy and now they were all dead and had died perhaps cursing her andphilipphilip had not kissed her goodnight and was sitting gloomily under a tree  the dim light of a leaden morning broke through the snow vault above their heads it was raining heavily the river had risen and was still rising it was filled with drift and branches and snow and ice the waste and ware of many a mile occasionally a large uprooted tree with a gaunt forked root like a mast sailed by suddenly philip who had been sitting with his chin upon his hands rose with a shout grace looked up languidly he pointed to a tree that floating by had struck the bank where they sat and then drifted broadside against it where for a moment it lay motionless  grace he said with his old spirits nature has taken us in hand herself if we are to be saved it is by her methods she brought us here to the waters edge and now she sends a boat to take us off again come  before grace could reply philip had lifted her gaily in his arms and deposited her between two upright roots of the tree then he placed beside her his rifle and provisions and leaping himself on the bow of this strange craft shoved it off with a broken branch that he had found for a moment it still clung to the bank and then suddenly catching the impulse of the current darted away like a living creature  the river was very narrow and rapid where they had embarked and for a few moments it took all of philips energy and undivided attention to keep the tree in the centre of the current grace sat silent admiring her lover alert forceful and glowing with excitement presently philip called to her  do you see that log we are near a settlement  a freshlyhewn log of pine was floating in the current beside them a ray of hope shot through graces sad fancies if they were so near help might not it have already reached the sufferers but she forbore to speak to philip again upon that subject and in his new occupation he seemed to have forgotten her it was with a little thrill of joy that at last she saw him turn and balancing himself with his bough upon their crank craft walk down slowly toward her when he reached her side he sat down and taking her hand in his for the first time since the previous night he said gently  grace my child i have something to tell you  graces little heart throbbed quickly for a moment she did not dare to lift her long lashes toward his without noticing her embarrassment he went on  in a few hours we shall be no longer in the wilderness but in the world againin a settlement perhaps among men andperhaps women strangers certainlynot the relatives you have known and who know younot the people with whom we have been familiar for so many weeks and daysbut people who know nothing of us or our sufferings  grace looked at him but did not speak  you understand grace that not knowing this they might put their own construction upon our flight  to speak plainly my child you are a young woman and i am a young man your beauty dear grace offers an explanation of our companionship that the world will accept more readily than any other and the truth to many would seem scarcely as natural for this reason it must not be told i will go back alone with relief and leave you here in some safe hands until i return but i leave you here not as grace conroyyou shall take my own name  a hot flush mounted to graces throat and cheek and for an instant with parted lips she hung breathless upon his next word he continued quietly  you shall be my sistergrace ashley  the blood fell from her cheek her eyelids dropped and she buried her face in her hands philip waited patiently for her reply when she lifted her face again it was quiet and calmthere was even a slight flush of proud colour in her cheek as she met his gaze and with the faintest curl of her upper lip said  you are right  at the same moment there was a sudden breaking of light and warmth and sunshine over their heads the tree swiftly swung round a sharp curve in the river and then drifted slowly into a broad overflowed valley sparkling with the emerald of gently sloping hillsides and dazzling with the glow of the noonday sun and beyond from a cluster of willows scarcely a mile away the smoke of a cabin chimney curled in the still air     chapter vi  footprints   for two weeks an unclouded sun rose and set on the rigid outlines of monument point for two weeks there had been no apparent change in the ghastly whiteness of the snowflanked rocks in the white billows that rose rank on rank beyond in the deathlike stillness that reigned above and below it was the first day of april there was the mildness of early spring in the air that blew over this gaunt waste and yet awoke no sound or motion and yet a nearer approach showed that a slow insidious change had been taking place the white flanks of the mountain were more hollow the snow had shrunk visibly away in places leaving the grey rocks naked and protuberant the rigid outlines were there but less full and rounded the skeleton was beginning to show through the wasting flesh there were great patches of snow that had sloughed away leaving the gleaming granite bare below it was the last change of the hippocratic face that nature turned toward the spectator and yet this change had been noiselessthe solitude unbroken  and then one day there suddenly drifted across the deathlike valley the chime of jingling spurs and the sound of human voices down the long defile a cavalcade of mounted men and pack mules made their way plunging through drifts and clattering over rocks the unwonted sound awoke the long slumbering echoes of the mountain brought down small avalanches from cliff and tree and at last brought from some cavern of the rocks to the surface of the snow a figure so wild haggard dishevelled and monstrous that it was scarcely human it crawled upon the snow dodging behind rocks with the timidity of a frightened animal and at last squatting behind a tree awaited in ambush the approach of the party  two men rode ahead one grave preoccupied and reticent the other alert active and voluble at last the reticent man spoke but slowly and as if recalling a memory rather than recording a present impression  they cannot be far away from us now it was in some such spot that i first saw them the place is familiar  heaven send that it may be said the other hastily for to tell you the truth i doubt if we will be able to keep the men together a day longer in this crazy quest unless we discover something  it was here continued the other dreamily not heeding his companion that i saw the figures of a man and woman if there is not a cairn of stone somewhere about this spot i shall believe my dream false and confess myself an old fool  wellas i said before rejoined the other laughing anythinga scrap of paper an old blanket or a broken waggontongue will do columbus helped his course and kept up his crew on a fragment of seaweed but what are the men looking at great god there is something moving by yonder rock  by one common superstitious instinct the whole party had crowded togetherthose who a few moments before had been loudest in their scepticism held their breath with awe and trembled with excitementas the shambling figure that had watched them enter the cañon rose from its lair and taking upon itself a human semblance with uncouth gestures and a strange hoarse cry made towards them it was dumphy  the leader was the first to recover himself he advanced from the rest and met dumphy halfway  who are you  a man  whats the matter  starving  where are the others  dumphy cast a suspicious glance at him and said  who  the others you are not alone  yes i am  how did you get here  whats that to you im here and starving gimme suthin to eat and drink  he sank exhaustedly on all fours again  there was a murmur of sympathy from the men  give him suthin dont you see he cant standmuch less talk wheres the doctor  and then the younger of the leaders thus adjuredleave him to mehe wants my help just now more than yours  he poured some brandy down his throat dumphy gasped and then staggered to his feet  what did you say your name was asked the young surgeon kindly  jackson said dumphy with a defiantly blank look  where from  missouri  how did you get here  strayed from my party  and they are  gone on gimme suthin to eat  take him back to camp and hand him over to sanchez hell know what to do said the surgeon to one of the men well blunt he continued addressing the leader youre savedbut your nine men in buckram have dwindled down to one and not a very creditable specimen at that he said as his eyes followed the retreating dumphy  i wish it were all doctor said blunt simply i would be willing to go back now but something tells me we have only begun this one makes everything else possible what have you there  one of the men was approaching holding a slip of paper with ragged edges as if torn from some position where it had been nailed  a notissfrom a tree me no sabe said the exvaquero  nor i said blunt looking at it it seems to be in german call glohr  a tall swiss came forward blunt handed him the paper the man examined it  it is a direction to find propertyimportant and valuable propertyburied  where  under a cairn of stones  the surgeon and blunt exchanged glances  lead us there said blunt  it was a muffled monotonous tramp of about an hour at the end of that time they reached a spur of the mountain around which the cañon turned abruptly blunt uttered a cry before them was a ruina rude heap of stones originally symmetrical and elevated but now thrown down and dismantled the snow and earth were torn up around and beneath it on the snow lay some scattered papers a portfolio of drawings of birds and flowers a glass case of insects broken and demolished and the scattered feathers of a few stuffed birds at a little distance lay what seemed to be a heap of ragged clothing at the sight of it the nearest horseman uttered a shout and leaped to the ground it was mrs brackett dead     chapter vii  in which the footprints begin to fade   she had been dead about a week the features and clothing were scarcely recognizable the limbs were drawn up convulsively the young surgeon bent over her attentively  starved to death said blunt interrogatively  the surgeon did not reply but rose and examined the scattered specimens one of them he picked up and placed first to his nose and then to his lips after a pause he replied quietly  no poisoned  the men fell back from the body  accidentally i think continued the surgeon coolly the poor creature has been driven by starvation to attack the specimens they have been covered with a strong solution of arsenic to preserve them from the ravages of insects and this starving woman has been the first to fall a victim to the collectors caution  there was a general movement of horror and indignation among the men shoost to keep dem birds said the irate swiss killing women to save his cussed game said another the surgeon smiled it was an inauspicious moment for dr devarges to have introduced himself in person  if this enthusiastic naturalist is still living i hope hell keep away from the men for some hours said the surgeon to blunt privately  who is he asked the other  a foreignera savant of some note i should say in his own country i think i have heard the name beforedevarges replied the surgeon looking over some papers that he had picked up he speaks of some surprising discoveries he has made and evidently valued his collection very highly  are they worth recollecting and preserving asked blunt  not now said the surgeon every moment is precious humanity first science afterward he added lightly and they rode on  and so the papers and collections preserved with such care the evidence of many months of patient study privation and hardship the records of triumph and discovery were left lying upon the snow the wind came down the flanks of the mountain and tossed them hither and thither as if in scorn and the sun already fervid heating the metallic surfaces of the box and portfolio sank them deeper in the snow as if to bury them from the sight for ever  by skirting the edge of the valley where the snow had fallen away from the mountainside they reached in a few hours the blazed tree at the entrance of the fateful cañon the placard was still there but the wooden hand that once pointed in the direction of the buried huts had through some mischance of wind or weather dropped slightly and was ominously pointing to the snow below this was still so deep in drifts that the party were obliged to leave their horses and enter the cañon afoot almost unconsciously this was done in perfect silence walking in single file occasionally climbing up the sides of the cañon where the rocks offered a better foothold than the damp snow until they reached a wooden chimney and part of a roof that now reared itself above the snow here they paused and looked at each other the leader approached the chimney and leaning over it called within  there was no response presently however the cañon took up the shout and repeated it and then there was a silence broken only by the falling of an icicle from a rock or a snow slide from the hill above then all was quiet again until blunt after a moments hesitation walked around to the opening and descended into the hut he had scarcely disappeared as it seemed before he returned looking very white and grave and beckoned to the surgeon he instantly followed after a little the rest of the party one after another went down they stayed some time and then came slowly to the surface bearing three dead bodies they returned again quickly and then brought up the dissevered members of a fourth this done they looked at each other in silence  there should be another cabin here said blunt after a pause  here it is said one of the men pointing to the chimney of the second hut  there was no preliminary hallo or hesitation now the worst was known they all passed rapidly to the opening and disappeared within when they returned to the surface they huddled togethera whispering but excited group they were so much preoccupied that they did not see that their party was suddenly increased by the presence of a stranger     chapter viii  the footprints grow fainter   it was philip ashley philip ashleyfaded travelworn holloweyed but nervously energetic and eager philip who four days before had left grace the guest of a hospitable trappers halfbreed family in the california valley philipgloomy discontented hateful of the quest he had undertaken but still fulfilling his promise to grace and the savage dictates of his own conscience it was philip ashley who now standing beside the hut turned halfcynically halfindifferently toward the party  the surgeon was first to discover him he darted forward with a cry of recognition poinsett arthurwhat are you doing here  ashleys face flushed crimson at the sight of the stranger hush he said almost involuntarily he glanced rapidly around the group and then in some embarrassment replied with awkward literalness i left my horse with the others at the entrance of the cañon  i see said the surgeon briskly you have come with relief like ourselves but you are too late too late  too late echoed ashley  yes they are all dead or gone  a singular expression crossed ashleys face it was unnoticed by the surgeon who was whispering to blunt presently he came forward  captain blunt this is lieutenant poinsett of the fifth infantry an old messmate mine whom i have not met before for two years he is here like ourselves on an errand of mercy it is like him  the unmistakable air of high breeding and intelligence which distinguished philip always and the cordial endorsement of the young surgeon prepossessed the party instantly in his favour with that recognition something of his singular embarrassment dropped away  who are those people he ventured at last to say  their names are on this paper which we found nailed to a tree of course with no survivor present we are unable to identify them all the hut occupied by dr devarges whose body buried in the snow we have identified by his clothing and the young girl grace conroy and her childsister are the only ones we are positive about  philip looked at the doctor  how have you identified the young girl  by her clothing which was marked  philip remembered that grace had changed her clothes for the suit of a younger brother who was dead  only by that he asked  no dr devarges in his papers gives the names of the occupants of the hut we have accounted for all but her brother and a fellow by the name of ashley  how do you account for them asked philip with a dark face  ran away what can you expect from that class of people said the surgeon with a contemptuous shrug  what class asked philip almost savagely  my dear boy said the surgeon you know them as well as i didnt they always pass the fort where we were stationed didnt they beg what they could and steal what they otherwise couldnt get and then report to washington the incompetency of the military werent they always getting up rows with the indians and then sneaking away to let us settle the bill dont you remember themthe men gaunt sickly vulgar lowtoned the women dirty snuffy prematurely old and prematurely prolific  philip tried to combat this picture with his recollection of graces youthful features but somehow failed within the last halfhour his instinctive fastidiousness had increased a hundredfold he looked at the doctor and said yes  of course said the surgeon it was the old lot what could you expect people who could be strong only in proportion to their physical strength and losing everything with the loss of that there have been selfishness crueltygod knowsperhaps murder done here  yes yes said philip hastily but you were speaking of this girl grace conroy what do you know of her  nothing except that she was found lying there dead with her name on her clothes and her sisters blanket in her arms as if the wretches had stolen the dying child from the dead girls arms but you arthur how chanced you to be here in this vicinity are you stationed here  no i have resigned from the army  good and you are here  alone  come we will talk this over as we return you will help me make out my report this you know is an official inquiry based upon the alleged clairvoyant quality of our friend blunt i must say we have established that fact if we have been able to do nothing more  the surgeon then lightly sketched an account of the expedition from its inception in a dream of blunt who was distinctly impressed with the fact that a number of emigrants were perishing from hunger in the sierras to his meeting with philip with such deftness of cynical humour and playful satirequalities that had lightened the weariness of the messtable of fort bobadilthat the young men were both presently laughing two or three of the party who had been engaged in laying out the unburied bodies and talking in whispers hearing these fine gentlemen make light of the calamity in wellchosen epithets were somewhat ashamed of their own awe and less elegantly and i fear less grammatically began to be jocose too whereat the fastidious philip frowned the surgeon laughed and the two friends returned to the entrance of the cañon and thence rode out of the valley together  philips reticence regarding his own immediate past was too characteristic to excite any suspicion or surprise in the mind of his friend in truth the doctor was too well pleased with his presence and the undoubted support which he should have in philips sympathetic tastes and congenial habits to think of much else he was proud of his friendproud of the impression he had made among the rude unlettered men with whom he was forced by the conditions of frontier democracy to associate on terms of equality and philip though young was accustomed to have his friends proud of him indeed he always felt some complacency with himself that he seldom took advantage of this fact satisfied that he might have confided to the doctor the truth of his connection with the illfated party and his flight with grace and that the doctor would probably have regarded him as a hero he felt less compunction at his suppression of the fact  their way lay by monument point and the dismantled cairn philip had already passed it on his way to the cañon and had felt a thankfulness for the unexpected tragedy that had as he believed conscientiously relieved him of a duty to the departed naturalist yet he could not forego a question  is there anything among these papers and collections worth our preserving he asked the surgeon  the doctor who had not for many months had an opportunity to air his general scepticism was nothing if not derogatory  no he answered shortly if there were any way that we might restore them to the living dr devarges they might minister to his vanity and please the poor fellow i see nothing in them that should make them worthy to survive him  the tone was so like dr devarges own manner as philip remembered it that he smiled grimly and felt relieved when they reached the spot nature seemed to have already taken the same cynical view the metallic case was already deeply sunken in the snow the wind had scattered the papers far and wide and even the cairn itself had tumbled into a shapeless meaningless ruin     chapter ix  in which the footprints are lost for ever   a fervid may sun had been baking the adobe walls of the presidio of san ramon firing the red tiles scorching the black courtyard and driving the mules and vaqueros of a train that had just arrived into the shade of the long galleries of the quadrangle when the comandante who was taking his noonday siesta in a low studded chamber beside the guardroom was gently awakened by his secretary for thirty years the noonday slumbers of the commander had never been broken his first thought was the heathenhis first impulse to reach for his trusty toledo but as it so happened the cook had borrowed it that morning to rake tortillas from the presidio oven and don juan salvatierra contented himself with sternly demanding the reason for this unwonted intrusion  a señoritaan americandesires an immediate audience  don juan removed the black silk handkerchief which he had tied round his grizzled brows and sat up before he could assume a more formal attitude the door was timidly opened and a young girl entered for all the disfigurement of scant coarse illfitting clothing or the hollowness of her sweet eyes and even the tears that dimmed their long lashes for all the sorrow that had pinched her young cheek and straightened the corners of her childlike mouth she was still so fair so frank so youthful so innocent and helpless that the comandante stood erect and then bent forward in a salutation that almost swept the floor apparently the prepossession was mutual the young girl took a quick survey of the gaunt but gentlemanlike figure before her cast a rapid glance at the serious but kindly eyes that shone above the commanders irongrey mustachios dropped her hesitating timid manner and with an impulsive gesture and a little cry ran forward and fell upon her knees at his feet the commander would have raised her gently but she restrained his hand  no no listen i am only a poor poor girl without friends or home a month ago i left my family starving in the mountains and came away to get them help my brother came with me god was good to us señor and after a weary tramp of many days we found a trappers hut and food and shelter philip my brother went back alone to succour them he has not returned oh sir he may be dead they all may be deadgod only knows it is three weeks ago since he left me three weeks it is a long time to be alone señor a stranger in a strange land the trapper was kind and sent me here to you for assistance you will help me i know you will you will find them my friends my little sister my brother  the commander waited until she had finished and then gently lifted her to a seat by his side then he turned to his secretary who with a few hurried words in spanish answered the mute inquiry of the commanders eyes the young girl felt a thrill of disappointment as she saw that her personal appeal had been lost and unintelligible it was with a slight touch of defiance that was new to her nature that she turned to the secretary who advanced as interpreter  you are an american  yes said the girl curtly who had taken one of the strange swift instinctive dislikes of her sex to the man  how many years  fifteen  the commander almost unconsciously laid his brown hand on her clustering curls  name  she hesitated and looked at the commander  grace she said  then she hesitated and with a defiant glance at the secretary added  grace ashley  give to me the names of some of your company mees graziashly  grace hesitated  philip ashley gabriel conroy peter dumphy mrs jane dumphy she said at last  the secretary opened a desk took out a printed document unfolded it and glanced over its contents presently he handed it to the commander with the comment bueno the commander said bueno also and glanced kindly and reassuringly at grace  an expedition from the upper presidio has found traces of a party of americans in the sierra said the secretary monotonously there are names like these  it is the sameit is our party said grace joyously  you say so said the secretary cautiously  yes said grace defiantly  the secretary glanced at the paper again and then said looking at grace intently  there is no name of mees graziashly  the hot blood suddenly dyed the cheek of grace and her eyelids dropped she raised her eyes imploringly to the commander if she could have reached him directly she would have thrown herself at his feet and confessed her innocent deceit but she shrank from a confidence that first filtered through the consciousness of the secretary so she began to fence feebly with the issue  it is a mistake she said but the name of philip my brother is there  the name of philip ashley is here said the secretary grimly  and he is alive and safe cried grace forgetting in her relief and joy her previous shame and mortification  he is not found said the secretary  not found said grace with widely opened eyes  he is not there  no of course said grace with a nervous hysterical laugh he was with me but he came backhe returned  on the 30th of april there is no record of the finding of philip ashley  grace groaned and clasped her hands in her greater anxiety now all lesser fears were forgotten she turned and threw herself before the commander  oh forgive me señor but i swear to you i meant no harm philip is not my brother but a friend so kind so good he asked me to take his name poor boy god knows if he will ever claim it again and i did my name is not ashley i know not what is in that paper but it must tell of my brother gabriel my sister of all o señor are they living or dead answer me you mustfori ami am grace conroy  the secretary had refolded the paper he opened it again glanced over it fixed his eyes upon grace and pointing to a paragraph handed it to the commander the two men exchanged glances the commander coughed rose and averted his face from the beseeching eyes of grace a sudden deathlike chill ran through her limbs as at a word from the commander the secretary rose and placed the paper in her hands  grace took it with trembling fingers it seemed to be a proclamation in spanish  i cannot read it she said stamping her little foot with passionate vehemence tell me what it says  at a sign from the commander the secretary opened the paper and arose the commander with his face averted looked through the open window the light streaming through its deep tunnellike embrasure fell upon the central figure of grace with her shapely head slightly bent forward her lips apart and her eager passionate eyes fixed upon the commander the secretary cleared his throat in a perfunctory manner and with the conscious pride of an irreproachable linguist began                              notice         to his excellency the comandante of the presidio of                            san felipe       i have the honour to report that the expedition sent out to      relieve certain distressed emigrants in the fastnesses of the      sierra nevadas said expedition being sent on the information      of don josé bluent of san geronimo found in a cañon east of      the canada del diablo the evidences of the recent existence of      such emigrants buried in the snow and the melancholy and      deeplytobedeplored record of their sufferings abandonment      and death a written record preserved by these miserable and      most infelicitous ones gives the names and history of their      organisation known as captain conroys party a copy of      which is annexed below       the remains of five of these unfortunates were recovered from      the snow but it was impossible to identify but two who were      buried with sacred and reverential rites       our soldiers behaved with that gallantry coolness      patriotism inflexible hardihood and highprincipled devotion      which ever animate the swelling heart of the mexican warrior      nor can too much praise be given to the voluntary efforts of      one don arthur poinsett late lieutenant of the army of the      united states of america who though himself a voyager and a      stranger assisted our commander in the efforts of humanity       the wretched dead appeared to have expired from hunger      although one was evidently a  victim  the tongue of the translator hesitated a moment and then with an air of proud superiority to the difficulties of the english language he resumed       a victim to fly poison it is to be regretted that among the      victims was the famous doctor paul devarges a natural and      collector of the stuffed bird and beast a name most      illustrious in science  the secretary paused his voice dropped its pretentious pitch he lifted his eyes from the paper and fixing them on grace repeated deliberately       the bodies who were identified were those of paul devarges and      grace conroy  oh no no said grace clasping her hands wildly it is a mistake you are trying to frighten me a poor helpless friendless girl you are punishing me gentlemen because you know i have done wrong because you think i have lied oh have pity gentlemen my godsave mephilip  and with a loud despairing cry she rose to her feet caught at the clustering tendrils of her hair raised her little hands palms upward high in the air and then sank perpendicularly as if crushed and beaten flat a pale and senseless heap upon the floor  the commander stooped over the prostrate girl send manuela here he said quickly waving aside the proffered aid of the secretary with an impatient gesture quite unlike his usual gravity as he lifted the unconscious grace in his arms  an indian waitingwoman hurriedly appeared and assisted the commander to lay the fainting girl upon a couch  poor child said the commander as manuela bending over grace unloosed her garments with sympathetic feminine hands poor little one and without a father  poor woman said manuela to herself half aloud and without a husband     book ii  after five years     chapter i  one horse gulch   it was a season of unexampled prosperity in one horse gulch even the despondent original locator who in a fit of depressed alcoholism had given it that infelicitous title would have admitted its injustice but that he fell a victim to the craftily qualified cups of san francisco long before the gulch had become prosperous hed jim stuck to straight whisky he might hev got his pile outer the very ledge whar his cabin stood said a local critic but jim did not after taking a thousand dollars from his claim he had flown to san franciscos where gorgeously arrayed he had flitted from champagne to cognac and from gin to lager beer until he brought his gilded and ephemeral existence to a close in the country hospital  howbeit one horse gulch survived not only its godfather but the baleful promise of its unhallowed christening it had its hotel and its temperance house its express office its saloons its two squares of low wooden buildings in the main street its clustering nests of cabins on the hillsides its freshlyhewn stumps and its latelycleared lots young in years it still had its memories experiences and antiquities the first tent pitched by jim white was still standing the bullet holes were yet to be seen in the shutters of the cachucha saloon where the great fight took place between boston joe harry worth and thompson of angels from the upper loft of watsons emporium a beam still projected from which a year ago a noted citizen had been suspended after an informal inquiry into the ownership of some mules that he was found possessed of near it was a small unpretentious square shed where the famous caucus had met that had selected the delegates who chose the celebrated and honourable blank to represent california in the councils of the nation  it was raining not in the usual direct honest perpendicular fashion of that mountain region but only suggestively and in a vague uncertain sort of way as if it might at any time prove to be fog or mist and any money wagered upon it would be hazardous it was raining as much from below as above and the lower limbs of the loungers who gathered around the square box stove that stood in briggss warehouse exhaled a cloud of steam the loungers in briggss were those who from deficiency of taste or the requisite capital avoided the gambling and drinking saloons and quietly appropriated biscuits from the convenient barrel of the generous briggs or filled their pipes from his open tobacco canisters with the general suggestion in their manner that their company fully compensated for any waste of his material  they had been smoking silentlya silence only broken by the occasional hiss of expectoration against the hot stove when the door of a back room opened softly and gabriel conroy entered  how is he gettin on gabe asked one of the loungers  so so said gabriel youll want to shift those bandages again he said turning to briggs afore the doctor comes id come back in an hour but ive got to drop in and see how steves gettin on and its a matter of two miles from home  but he says he wont let anybody tech him but you said mr briggs  i know he says so said gabriel soothingly but hell get over that thats what stimson sed when he was took worse but he got over that and i never got to see him except in time to lay him out  the justice of this was admitted even by briggs although evidently disappointed gabriel was walking to the door when another voice from the stove stopped him  oh gabe you mind that emigrant family with the sick baby camped down the gulch well the baby up and died last night  i want to know said gabriel with thoughtful gravity  yes and that womans in a heap of trouble couldnt you kinder drop in in passing and look after things  i will said gabriel thoughtfully  i thought youd like to know it and i thought shed like me to tell you said the speaker settling himself back again over the stove with the air of a man who had just fulfilled at great personal sacrifice and labour a work of supererogation  youre always thoughtful of other folks johnson said briggs admiringly  well yes said johnson with a modest serenity i allers allow that men in californy ought to think of others besides themselves a little keer and a little sabe on my part and theres that family in the gulch made comfortable with gabe around em  meanwhile this homely inciter of the unselfish virtues of one horse gulch had passed out into the rain and darkness so conscientiously did he fulfil his various obligations that it was nearly one oclock before he reached his rude hut on the hillside a rough cabin of pine logs so unpretentious and wild in exterior as to be but a slight improvement on nature the vines clambered unrestrainedly over the barkthatched roof the birds occupied the crevices of the walls the squirrel ate his acorns on the ridge pole without fear and without reproach  softly drawing the wooden peg that served as a bolt gabriel entered with that noiselessness and caution that were habitual to him lighting a candle by the embers of a dying fire he carefully looked around him the cabin was divided into two compartments by the aid of a canvas stretched between the walls with a flap for the doorway on a pine table lay several garments apparently belonging to a girl of seven or eighta frock grievously rent and torn a frayed petticoat of white flannel already patched with material taken from a red shirt and a pair of stockings so excessively and sincerely darned as to have lost nearly all of their original fabric in repeated bits of relief that covered almost the entire structure gabriel looked at these articles ruefully and slowly picking them up examined each with the greatest gravity and concern then he took off his coat and boots and having in this way settled himself into an easy dishabille he took a box from the shelf and proceeded to lay out thread and needles when he was interrupted by a childs voice from behind the canvas screen  is that you gabeyes  oh gabe i got tired and went to bed  i see you did said gabriel drily picking up a needle and thread that had apparently been abandoned after a slight excursion into the neighbourhood of a rent and left hopelessly sticking in the petticoat  yes gabe theyre so awfully old  old repeated gabe reproachfully old lettin on a little wear and tear theyre as good as they ever were that petticoat is stronger said gabriel holding up the garment and eyeing the patches with a slight glow of artistic pridestronger olly than the first day you put it on  but thats five years ago gabe  well said gabriel turning round and addressing himself impatiently to the screen wot if it is  and ive growed  growed said gabriel scornfully and havent i let out the tucks and didnt i put three fingers of the best sacking around the waist youll just ruin me in clothes  olly laughed from behind the screen finding however no response from the grim worker presently there appeared a curly head at the flap and then a slim little girl in the scantiest of nightgowns ran and began to nestle at his side and to endeavour to enwrap herself in his waistcoat  oh go way said gabriel with a severe voice and the most shameless signs of relenting in his face go away what do you care here i might slave myself to death to dress you in silks and satins and youd dip into the first ditch or waltz through the first underbrush that you kem across you havent got no sabe in dress olly it aint ten days ago as i ironbound and copperfastened that dress so to speak and look at it now olly look at it now and he held it up indignantly before the maiden  olly placed the top of her head against the breast of her brother as a point dappui and began to revolve around him as if she wished to bore a way into his inmost feelings  oh you aint mad gabe she said leaping first over one knee and then over the other without lifting her head you aint mad  gabriel did not deign to reply but continued mending the frayed petticoat in dignified silence  who did you see down town said olly not at all rebuffed  no one said gabriel shortly  you did you smell of linnyments and peppermint said olly with a positive shake of the head youve been to briggss and the new family up the gulch  yes said gabriel that mexicans legs is better but the babys dead jest remind me tomorrow to look through mothers things for suthin for that poor woman  gabe do you know what mrs markle says of you said olly suddenly raising her head  no replied gabriel with an affectation of indifference that like all his affectations was a perfect failure  she says said olly that you want to be looked after yourself moren all these people she says youre just throwing yourself away on other folks she says i ought to have a woman to look after me  gabriel stopped his work laid down the petticoat and taking the curly head of olly between his knees with one hand beneath her chin and the other on the top of her head turned her mischievous face towards his olly he said seriously when i got you outer the snow at starvation camp when i toted you on my back for miles till we got into the valley when we lay by thar for two weeks and me a felling trees and picking up provisions here and thar in the wood or the river wharever thar was bird or fish i reckon you got along as welli wont say betterez if you had a woman to look arter you when at last we kem here to this camp and i built this yer house i dont think any woman could hev done better if they could im wrong and mrs markles right  olly began to be uncomfortable then the quick instincts of her sex came to her relief and she archly assumed the aggressive  i think mrs markle likes you gabe  gabriel looked down at the little figure in alarm there are some subjects whereof the youngest of womankind has an instinctive knowledge that makes the wisest of us tremble  go to bed olly said the cowardly gabriel  but olly wanted to sit up so she changed the subject  the mexican youre tendin isnt a mexican hes a chileno mrs markle says so  maybe its all the same i call him a mexican he talks too straight anyway said gabriel indifferently  did he ask you any more questions aboutabout old times continued the girl  yes he wanted to know everything that happened in starvation camp he was reklarly took with poor gracie asked a heap o questions about herhow she acted and seemed to feel as bad as we did about never hearing anything from her i never met a man olly afore as seemed to take such an interest in other folks sorrers as he did youd have thot hed been one of the party and he made me tell him all about dr devarges  and philip queried olly  no said gabriel somewhat curtly  gabriel said olly sullenly i wish you didnt talk so to people about those days  why asked gabriel wonderingly  because it aint good to talk about gabriel dear she continued with a slight quivering of the upper lip sometimes i think the people round yer look upon us sorter queer that little boy that came here with the emigrant family wouldnt play with me and mrs markles little girl said that we did dreadful things up there in the snow he said i was a cannonball  a what asked gabriel  a cannonball he said that you and i  hush interrupted gabriel sternly as an angry flush came into his sunburnt cheek ill jest bust that boy if i see him round yer agin  but gabriel persisted olly nobody  will you go to bed olly and not catch your death yer on this cold floor asking ornery and perfectly ridickulus questions said gabriel briskly lifting her to her feet thet markle girl aint got no sense anywayshes allers leading you round in ditches ruinin your best clothes and keepin me up half the night mendin on em  thus admonished olly retreated behind the canvas screen and gabriel resumed his needle and thread but the thread became entangled and was often snappishly broken and gabriel sewed imaginary vindictive stitches in the imaginary calves of an imaginary youthful emigrant until ollys voice again broke the silence  oh gabe  yes said gabriel putting down his work despairingly  do you thinkthat philipate grace  gabriel rose swiftly and disappeared behind the screen as he did so the door softly opened and a man stepped into the cabin the newcomer cast a rapid glance around the dimlylighted room and then remained motionless in the doorway from behind the screen came the sound of voices the stranger hesitated and then uttered a slight cough  in an instant gabriel reappeared the look of angry concern at the intrusion turned to one of absolute stupefaction as he examined the stranger more attentively the newcomer smiled faintly yet politely and then with a slight halt in his step moved towards a chair into which he dropped with a deprecating gesture  i shall sitand you shall pardon me you have surprise yes five six hour ago you leave me very sick on a bedwhere you are so kindso good yes ah you see me here now and you say crazy mad  he raised his right hand with the fingers upward twirled them to signify gabriels supposed idea of a whirling brain and smiled again  listen comes to me an hour ago a message most important most necessary it is i go tonightnow to marysville you see yes i rise and dress myself ha i have great strength for the effort i am better but i say to myself victor you shall first pay your respects to the good pike who have been so kind so good you shall press the hand of the noble grand miner who have recover you bueno i am here  he extended a thin nervous brown hand and for the first time since his entrance concentrated his keen black eyes which had roved over the apartment and taken in its minutest details upon his host gabriel lost in bewilderment could only gaspbut you aint well enough you know you cant walk yet youll kill yourself  the stranger smiled  yesyou thinkyou think look now waits me outside the horse of the liverystable man how many miles you think to the stage town fifteen he emphasized them with his five uplifted fingers it is nothing two hour comes the stage and i am there ha  even as he spoke with a gesture as if brushing away all difficulties his keen eyes were resting upon a little shelf above the chimney whereon stood an oldfashioned daguerreotype case open he rose and with a slight halting step and an expression of pain limped across the room to the shelf and took up the daguerreotype  what have we he asked  it is gracie said gabriel brightening up taken the day we started from st jo  how long  six years ago she was fourteen then said gabriel taking the case in his hand and brushing the glass fondly with his palm thar warnt no puttier gal in all missouri he added with fraternal pride looking down upon the picture with moistened eyes ehwhat did you say  the stranger had uttered a few words hastily in a foreign tongue but they were apparently complimentary for when gabriel looked up at him with an inquiring glance he was smiling and saying beautiful angelic very pretty with eyes still fixed upon the picture and it is likeah i see the brothers face too he said gravely comparing gabriels face with the picture gabriel looked pleased any nature less simple than his would have detected the polite fiction in the square honest face of the brother there was not the faintest suggestion of the delicate girlish poetical oval before him  it is precious said the stranger and it is all ha  all echoed gabriel inquiringly  you have nothing more  no  a line of her writing a letter her private papers would be a treasure eh  she left nothing said gabriel simply but her clothes you know she put on a boys suitjohnnys clotheswhen she left thets how it allus puzzles me thet they knew who she was when they came across the poor child dead  the stranger did not speak and gabriel went on  it was nigh on a

grace how that poor child ever got back thar alone for thar warnt no trace or mention of the man she went away with is what gets me and that theres my trouble mr ramirez to think of thet pooty darlin climbing back to the old nest and finding no one thar to think of her coming back as she allowed to olly and me and findin all her own blood gone is suthin thet at times drives me almost mad she didnt die of starvation she didnt die of cold her heart was broke mr ramirez her little heart was broke  the stranger looked at him curiously but did not speak after a moments pause he lifted his bowed head from his hands wiped his eyes with ollys flannel petticoat and went on  for more than a year i tried to get sight o that report then i tried to find the mission or the presidio that the relief party started from and may be see some of that party but then kem the gold excitement and the americans took possession of the missions and presidios and when i got to sansansan  geronimo interrupted ramirez hastily  did i tell asked gabriel simply i dont remember that  ramirez showed all his teeth in quick assent and motioned him with his finger to go on  when i got to san geronimo there was nobody and no records left then i put a notiss in the san francisco paper for philip ashleythat was the man as helped her awayto communicate with me but thar werent no answer  ramirez rose  you are not rich friend gabriel  no said gabriel  but you expectahyou expect  well i reckon some day to make a strike like the rest  anywhere my friend  anywhere repeated gabriel smiling  adios said the stranger going to the door  adios repeated gabriel must you go tonight whats your hurry youre sure you feel better now  better answered ramirez with a singular smile better look i am so strong  he stretched out his arms and expanded his chest and walked erect to the door  you have cured my rheumatism friend gabriel good night  the door closed behind him in another moment he was in the saddle and speeding so swiftly that in spite of mud and darkness in two hours he had reached the mining town where the wingdam and sacramento stagecoach changed horses the next morning while olly and gabriel were eating breakfast mr victor ramirez stepped briskly from the stage that drew up at marysville hotel and entered the hotel office as the clerk looked up inquiringly mr ramirez handed him a card  send that if you please to miss grace conroy     chapter ii  madame devarges   mr ramirez followed the porter upstairs and along a narrow passage until he reached a larger hall here the porter indicated that he should wait until he returned and then disappeared down the darkened vista of another passage mr ramirez had ample time to observe the freshness of the boarded partitions and scant details of the interior of the international hotel he even had time to attempt to grapple the foreign mystery of the notice conspicuously on the wall gentlemen are requested not to sleep on the stairs before his companion reappeared beckoning to mr ramirez with an air of surly suspicion the porter led him along the darkened passage until he paused before a door at its farther extremity and knocked gently slight as was the knock it had the mysterious effect of causing all the other doors along the passage to open and a masculine head to appear at each opening mr ramirezs brow darkened quickly he was sufficiently conversant with the conditions of that early civilization to know that as a visitor to a lady he was the object of every mans curious envy and aggressive suspicion there was the sound of light footsteps within and the door opened the porter lingered long enough to be able to decide upon the character and propriety of the greeting and then sullenly retired the door closed and mr ramirez found himself face to face with the occupant of the room she was a small slight blonde who when the smile that had lit her mouth and eyes as she opened the door faded suddenly as she closed it might have passed for a plain indistinctive woman but for a certain dangerous submissiveness of mannerwhich i here humbly submit is always to be feared in an allpowerful sexand an address that was rather more deprecatory than occasion called for she would hardly have awakened the admiration of our sex or the fears of her own  as ramirez advanced with both hands impulsively extended she drew back shyly and pointing to the ceiling and walls said quietly cloth and paper  ramirezs dark face grew darker there was a long pause suddenly the lady lightened the shadow that seemed to have fallen upon their interview with both her teeth and eyes and pointing to a chair said  sit down victor and tell me why you have returned so soon  victor sat sullenly down the lady looked all deprecation and submissiveness but said nothing  ramirez would in his sullenness have imitated her but his natural impulsiveness was too strong and he broke out  look from the book of the hotel it is better you should erase the name of grace conroy and put down your own  and why victor  she asks why said victor appealing to the ceiling my god because one hundred miles from here live the brother and sister of grace conroy i have seen him  well  well echoed victor is it well listen you shall hear if it is well  he drew his chair beside her and went on in a low earnest voice  i have at last located the mine i followed the desenothe description of the spot and all its surroundingswhich was in the paper that iifound good it is trueah you begin to be interestedit is true all true of the locality see of the spot i do not know of the mine it has not yet been discovered  it is called one horse gulch whywho knows it is a rich mining camp all around are valuable claims but the mine on the top of the little hill is unknown unclaimed for why you understand it promises not as much as the other claims on the surface it is the sameall as described here  he took from his pocket an envelope and drew out a folded paper the papers given to grace conroy by dr devarges and pointed to the map  the description here leads me to the head waters of the american river i followed the range of foothills for i know every foot every step and i came one day last week to one horse gulch see it is the gulch described hereall the same  he held the paper before her and her thin long fingers closed like a birds claw over its corners  it is necessary i should stay there four or five days to inquire and yet how i am a stranger a foreigner the miners have suspicion of all such and to me they do not talk easily but i hear of one gabriel conroy a good man very kind with the sick good i have sicknessvery sudden very strong my rheumatism takes me here he pointed to his knee i am helpless as a child i have to be taken care of at the house of mr briggs comes to me here gabriel conroy sits by me talks to me tells me everything he brings to me his little sister i go to his cabin on the hill i see the picture of his sister good you understand it is all over  why  eh she asks why this woman said victor appealing to the ceiling is it more you ask then listen the house of gabriel conroy is upon the land the very land you understand of the grant made by the governor to dr devarges he is this gabriel look he is in possession  how does he know of the mine  no it is accidentwhat you call fate  she walked to the window and stood for a few moments looking out upon the falling rain the face that looked out was so old so haggard so hard and set in its outlines that one of the loungers on the sidewalk glancing at the window to catch a glimpse of the pretty french stranger did not recognise her possibly the incident recalled her to herself for she presently turned with a smile of ineffable sweetness and returning to the side of ramirez said in the gentlest of voices then you abandon me  victor did not dare to meet her eyes he looked straight before him shrugged his shoulders and saidit is fate  she clasped her thin fingers lightly before her and standing in front of her companion so as to be level with his eyes saidyou have a good memory victor  he did not reply  let me assist it it is a year ago that i received a letter in berlin signed by a mr peter dumphy of san francisco saying that he was in possession of important papers regarding property of my late husband dr paul devarges and asking me to communicate with him i did not answer his letter i came it is not my way to deliberate or hesitateperhaps a wise man would i am only a poor weak woman so i came i know it was all wrong you sharp bold cautious men would have written first well i came  victor winced slightly but did not speak  i saw mr dumphy in san francisco he showed me some papers that he said he had found in a place of deposit which dr devarges had evidently wished preserved one was a record of a spanish grant others indicated some valuable discoveries he referred me to the mission and presidio of san ysabel that had sent out the relief party for further information he was a tradera mere man of businessit was a question of money with him he agreed to assist me for a percentage is it not so  victor raised his dark eyes to hers and nodded  i came to the mission i saw youthe secretary of the former comandantethe only one left who remembered the expedition and the custodian of the presidio records you showed me the only copy of the report you too would have been cold and businesslike until i told you my story you seemed interested you told me about the young girl this mysterious grace conroy whose name appeared among the dead who you said you thought was an impostor did you not  victor nodded  you told me of her agony on reading the report of her fainting of the discovery of her condition by the women of the comandantes pity of her mysterious disappearance of the comandantes reticence of your own suspicions of the birth of a child did you not victor  he endeavoured to take her hand without altering her gentle manner she withdrew her hand quietly and went on  and then you told me of your finding that paper on the floor where they loosened her dressthe paper you now hold in your hand you told me of your reasons for concealing and withholding it and then victor you proposed to me a plan to secure my own againto personate this girlto outimposture this imposture you did not ask me for a percentage you did not seek to make money out of my needs you asked only for my love well well perhaps i was a fool a weak woman it was a tempting bribe possibly i listened more to the promptings of my heart than my interest i promised you my hand and my fortune when we succeeded you come to me now and ask to be relieved of that obligation no no you have said enough  the now frightened man had seized her by the hand and thrown himself on his knees before her in passionate contrition but with a powerful effort she had wrested herself free  no no she continued in the same deprecatory voice go to this brother whom the chief end of your labours seems to have been to discover go to him now restore to him the paper you hold in your hand say that you stole it from his sister whom you suspected to have been an impostor and that you knew to be the mother of an illegitimate child say that in doing this you took the last hope from the wronged and castoff wife who came thousands of miles to claim something from the man who should have supported her say this and that brother if he is the good and kind man you represent him to be he will rise up and bless you you have only to tell him further that this paper cannot be of any use to him as this property legally belongs to his sisters child if living you have only to hand him the report which declares both of his sisters to be dead and leaves his own identity in doubt to show him what a blessing has fallen upon him  forgive me gasped victor with a painful blending of shame and awesome admiration of the woman before him forgive me julie i am a coward a slave an ingrate i will do anything julie anything you say  madame devarges was too sagacious to press her victory further perhaps she was too cautious to exasperate the already incautiously demonstrative man before her she said hush and permitted him at the same time as if unconsciously to draw her beside him  listen victor what have you to fear from this man she asked after a pause what would his evidence weigh against me when he is in unlawful possession of my property my legally declared properly if i choose to deny his relationship who will identity him as gabriel conroy when his only surviving relative dare not come forward to recognise him when if she did you could swear that she came to you under another name what would this brothers selfinterested evidence amount to opposed to yours that i was the grace conroy who came to the mission to the proof of my identity offered by one of the survivors peter dumphy  dumphy echoed ramirez in amazement  yes dumphy repeated madame devarges when he found that as the divorced wife of dr devarges i could make no legal claim and i told him of your plan he offered himself as witness of my identity ah victor i have not been idle while you have found only obstacles  forgive me he caught and kissed her hands passionately i fly now goodbye  where are you going she asked rising  to one horse gulch he answered  no sit down listen you must go to san francisco and inform dumphy of your discovery it will be necessary perhaps to have a lawyer but we must first see how strong we stand you must find out the whereabouts of this girl grace at once go to san francisco see dumphy and return to me here  but you are alone here and unprotected these men  the quick suspicions of a jealous nature flashed in his eyes  believe me they are less dangerous to our plans than women do you not trust me victor she said with a dazzling smile  he would have thrown himself at her feet but she restrained him with an arch look at the wall and a precautionary uplifted finger  good go now stay this gabrielis he married  no  goodbye  the door closed upon his dark eager face and he was gone a moment later there was a sharp ringing of the bell of no 92 the next room to that occupied by mme devarges  the truculent porter knocked at the door and entered this room respectfully there was no suspicion attached to the character of its occupant he was well known as mr jack hamlin a gambler  why the devil did you keep me waiting said jack reaching from the bed and wrathfully clutching his bootjack  the man murmured some apology  bring me some hot water  the porter was about to hurriedly withdraw when jack stopped him with an oath  youve been long enough coming without shooting off like that who was that man that just left the next room  i dont know sir  find out and let me know  he flung a gold piece at the man beat up his pillow and turned his face to the wall the porter still lingered and jack faced sharply round  not gone yet what the devil  beg your pardon sir do you know anything about her  no said jack raising himself on his elbow but if i catch you hanging round that door as you were five minutes ago ill  here mr hamlin dropped his voice and intimated that he would forcibly dislodge certain vital and necessary organs from the porters body  go  after the door closed again mr hamlin lay silent for an hour at the end of that time he got up and began to dress himself slowly singing softly to himself the while as was his invariable custom in that sweet tenor for which he was famous when he had thus warbled through his toilet replacing a small ivoryhandled pistol in his waistcoatpocket to one of his most heartbreaking notes he put his hat on his handsome head perhaps a trifle more on one side than usual and stepped into the hall as he sharply shut his door and locked it the slight concussion of the thin partitions caused the door of his fair neighbours room to start ajar and mr hamlin looking up mechanically saw the lady standing by the bureau with her handkerchief to her eyes mr hamlin instantly stopped his warbling and walked gravely downstairs at the foot of the steps he met the porter the man touched his hat  he doesnt belong here sir  who doesnt belong here asked mr hamlin coldly  that man  what man  the man you asked about  mr hamlin quietly took out a cigar lit it and after one or two puffs looked fixedly in the mans eyes and said  i havent asked you about any man  i thought sir  you shouldnt begin to drink so early in the day michael said mr hamlin quietly without withdrawing his black eyes from the mans face you cant stand it on an empty stomach take my advice and wait till after dinner     chapter iii  mrs markle   ollys allusion to mrs markle and her criticism had recurred to gabriel more or less uneasily through the night and as he rose betimes the next morning and stood by the table on which lay his handiwork a grim doubt of his proficiency in that branch of domestic economy began to oppress him  like as not i aint doin my duty to that child he said softly to himself as he picked up the garments one by one and deposited them beside the bedside of the still sleeping olly them clothes areleavin out the strength and sayin nothin o durability as materiala trifle oldfashioned and onbecomin not as you requires anything o the kind bless your pooty face he said apostrophising the dewy curls and slumberflushed cheek of the unconscious child but mebbe it does sorter provoke remarks from the other children and the settlements gettin crowded three new families in six months is rather tootoo considered gabriel hesitating for a word rather too popylating and mrs marklegabriel flushed even in the stillness and solitude of his own cabinto think of that little gal not nine years old speaking o that widder in that way it beats everything and to think ive kept clar of that sort o thing jest on ollys account jest that she shouldnt have any woman around to boss her  nevertheless when he and olly sat down to their frugal breakfast he was uneasily conscious of several oddities of her dress not before noticeable and even some peculiarities of manner  ez a gineral thing olly he pointed out with cautious generalisation ez a gineral thing in perlite society young gals dont sit down astraddle of their chairs and dont reach down every five minnits to heave away at their bootstraps  as a general thing gabe girls dont wear boots said olly leaning forward to dip her bread in the fryingpan  artfully evading the question whether high indiarubber boots were an indispensable feature of a girls clothing gabriel continued with easy indifferencei think ill drop in on mrs markle on my way to the gulch this morning  he glanced under his eyelids at as much of his sisters face as was visible behind the slice of bread she was consuming  take me with you gabe  no said gabriel you must stay here and do up the house and mind you keep out o the woods until your works done besides he added loftily ive got some business with mrs markle  oh gabe said olly shining all over her face with gravy and archness  id like to know whats the matter with you olly said gabriel with dignified composure  aint you ashamed gabe  gabriel did not stop to reply but rose gathered up his tools and took his hat from the corner he walked to the door but suddenly turned and came back to olly  olly he said taking her face in both hands after his old fashion ef anything at any time should happen to me i want ye to think my darling ez i always did my best for you olly for you wotever i did was always for the best  olly thought instantly of the river  you aint goin into deep water today gabe are you she asked with a slight premonitory quiver of her short upper lip  pooty deep for me olly but he added hastily with a glance at her alarmed face dont you mind ill come out all safe goodbye he kissed her tenderly she ran her fingers through his sandy curls deftly smoothed his beard and reknotted his neckerchief  you oughter hev put on your other shirt gabe that aint clean and you agoin to mrs markles let me get your straw hat gabe wait she ran in behind the screen but when she returned he was gone  it had been raining the night before but on the earth beneath there was a dewy freshness and in the sky above the beauty of cloud scenerya beauty rare to california except during the rainy season gabriel although not usually affected by meteorological influences nor peculiarly susceptible to the charms of nature felt that the morning was a fine one and was for that reason i imagine more than usually accessible to the blandishments of the fair from admiring a tree a flower or a gleam of sunshine to the entertainment of a dangerous sentimentalism in regard to the other sex is i fear but a facile step to some natures whose only safety is in continuous practicality wherefore gabriel as he approached the cottage of mrs markle was induced to look from nature up tonatures goddessmrs markle as her strong bright face appeared above the dishes she was washing by the kitchen window and here occurred one of those feminine inconsistencies that are charming to the average man but are occasionally inefficient with an exceptional character mrs markle who had always been exceedingly genial gentle and natural with gabriel during his shyness seeing him coming with a certain fell intent of cheerfulness in his face instantly assumed an aggressive manner which for the sake of its probable warning to the rest of her sex i venture to transcribe  ef you want to see me gabriel conroy said mrs markle stopping to wipe the suds from her brown but handsomely shaped arms you must come up to the sink for i cant leave the dishes joe markle always used to say to me sue when youve got work to do you dont let your mind wander round much on anything else sal bring a cheer here for gabrielhe dont come often enough to stand up for a change were hardworking women you and me sal and we dont get time to be sickand sick folks is about the only kind as mr conroy cares to see  thoroughly astonished as gabriel was with this sarcastic reception there was still a certain relief that it brought to him olly was wrong he said to himself that woman only thinks of washing dishes and lookin after her boarders ef she was allus like thisand would leave a man alone never foolin around him but kinder standin off and tendin strictly to the business of the house why it wouldnt be such a bad thing to marry her but like as not shed changeyou cant trust them critters howsomever i can set ollys mind at rest  happily unconscious of the heresies that were being entertained by the silent man before her mrs markle briskly continued her washing and her monologue occasionally sprinkling gabriel with the overflow of each  when i say hardworkin women sal said mrs markle still addressing a gaunt female companion whose sole functions were confined to chuckling at gabriel over the dishes she was wiping and standing with her back to her mistresswhen i say hardworkin women sal i dont forget ez there are men ez is capable of doin all that and moremen ez looks down on you and me here mistress markle broke a plate and then after a pause sighed faced around with a little colour in her cheek and a sharp snap in her black eyes and declared that she was that narvous this morning that she couldnt go on  there was an embarrassing silence luckily for gabriel at this moment the gaunt sal picked up the dropped thread of conversation and with her back to her mistress and profoundly ignoring his presence addressed herself to the wall  narvous you well may be susan and you slavin for forty boarders with transitory meals for travellers and nobody to help you if you was flat on your back with rheumatiz ez you well might be perhaps you might get a hand a death in the family might be of sarvice to you in callin round you friends az couldnt otherwise leave their business that cough that little manty had on to her for the last five weeks would frighten some mothers into a narvous consumption  gabriel at this moment had a vivid and guilty recollection of noticing manty markle wading in the ditch below the house as he entered and of having observed her with the interest of possible paternal relationship that relationship seemed so preposterous and indefensible on all moral grounds now that he began to feel himself in the light of an impostor and was proportionally embarrassed his confusion was shown in a manner peculiarly characteristic of himself drawing a small pocket comb from his pocket he began combing out his sandy curls softly with a perplexed smile on his face the widow had often noticed this action divined its cause and accepted it as a tribute she began to relent by some occult feminine sympathy this relenting was indicated by the other woman  youre out of sorts this morning susan nd if yell take a fools advice yell jest quit work and make yourself comfortable in the settinroom and kinder pass the time o day with gabriel onless hes after waitin to pick up some hints about housework i never could work with a man around ill do up the dishes ef youll excuse my kempany which two is and threes none yer give me this apron you dont hev time i declare sue to tidy yourself up and your hairs comin down  the gaunt sal having recognised gabriels presence to this extent attempted to reorganise mrs markles coiffure but was playfully put aside by that lady with the remark that she had too much to do to think of them things  and its only a mop anyway she added with severe selfdepreciation let it alone will you sal thar i told you now youve done it and she had the infamous sal by some deft trick well known to her deceitful sex had suddenly tumbled the whole wealth of mrs markles black mane over her plump shoulders mrs markle with a laugh would have flown to the chaste recesses of the sittingroom but sal like a true artist restrained her until the full effect of this poetic picture should be impressed upon the unsuspecting gabriels memory  mop indeed said sal its well that many folks is of many minds and selfpraise is open disgrace but when a man like lawyer maxwell sez to me only yesterday sittin at this very table lookin kinder up at you sue as you was passin soup unconscious like and one o em braids droppin down and jest missin the plate when lawyer maxwell sez to me sal thars many a fine lady in frisco ez would give her pile to have susan markles hair  but here sal was interrupted by the bashful escape of mrs markle to the sittingroom ye dont know whether lawyer maxwell has any bisness up this way gabriel do ye said sal resuming her work  no said the unconscious gabriel happily as oblivious of the artful drift of the question as he had been of the dangerous suggestiveness of mrs markles hair  because he does kinder pass here more frequent than he used and hez taken ez menny ez five meals in one day i declare i thought that was him when you kem just now i dont think thet sue notices it not keering much for that kind of build in a man continued sal glancing at gabriels passively powerful shoulders and the placid strength of his long limbs how do you think sues looking nowez a friend interested in the familyhow does she look to you  gabriel hastened to assure sal of the healthful appearance of mrs markle but only extracted from his gaunt companion a long sigh and a shake of the head  its deceitful gabriel no one knows what that poor critter goes through her minds kinder onsettled o late and in that onsettled state she breaks things you see her break that plate just now well perhaps i oughtnt to say itbut you being a friend and in confidence for shed kill me being a proud kind o nater suthin like my own and it may not amount to nothin arter allbut i kin always tell when youve been around by the breakages you was here lets see the week afore last and there wasnt cups enough left to go round that night for supper  maybe its chills said the horrorstricken gabriel his worst fears realised rising from his chair ive got some indian cholagogue over to the cabin and ill jest run over and get it or send it back intent only upon retreat he would have shamelessly flown but sal intercepted him with a face of mysterious awe  ef she should kem in here and find you gone gabriel in that weak state of hersnarvous you may call it but so it isi wouldnt be answerable for that poor critters life ef she should think youd gone arter what has happened arter what has passed between you and her today it would jest kill her  but what has passed said gabriel in vague alarm  it aint for me said the gaunt sal loftily to pass my opinion on other folks conduct or to let on what this means or what thet means or to give my say about people callin on other people and broken crockery hair combsgabriel wincedand people ez is too nice and keerful to open their mouths afore folks it aint for me to get up and say that when a woman is ever so little out of sorts and a man is so far gone ez he allows to rush off like a madman to get her medicines what ez or what eznt in it i keep my own counsel and thets my way manys the time sue hez said to me ef thar ever was a woman ez knowed how to lock herself up and throw away the key its you sal and there you are maam and its high time ez plain help like me stopped talkin while ladies and gentlemen exchanged the time o day  it is hardly necessary to say that the latter part of this speech was addressed to the widow who at that moment appeared at the door of the sittingroom in a new calico gown that showed her plump figure to advantage or that the gaunt sal intended to indicate the serious character of the performance by a show of increased respect to the actors  i hope i aint intrudin on your conversation said the widow archly stopping with a show of consideration on the threshold ef you and sal aint done private matters yetill wait  i dont think ez gabriel hez anything more to say thet you shouldnt hear mrs markle said sal strongly implying a recent confidential disclosure from gabriel which delicacy to gabriel alone prevented her from giving but it aint for me to hear confidence in matters of the feelins  it is difficult to say whether mrs markles archness or sals woeful perspicuity was most alarming to gabriel he rose he would have flown even with the terrible contingency of mrs markles hysterics before his eyes he would have faced even that forcible opposition from sal of which he fully believed her capable but that a dreadful suspicion that he was already hopelessly involved that something would yet transpire that would enable him to explain himself and perhaps an awful fascination of his very danger turned his irresolute feet into mrs markles sittingroom mrs markle offered him a chair he sank helplessly into it while from the other room sal violently clattering her dishes burst into shrill song so palpably done for the purpose of assuring the bashful couple of her inability to overhear their tender confidences that gabriel coloured to the roots of his hair  that evening gabriel returned from his work in the gulch more than usually grave to ollys inquiries he replied shortly and evasively it was not however gabriels custom to remain uncommunicative on even disagreeable topics and olly bided her time it came after their frugal supper was overwhich unlike the morning meal passed without any fastidious criticism on gabriels partand olly had drawn a small box her favourite seat between her brothers legs and rested the back of her head comfortably against his waistcoat when gabriel had lighted his pipe at the solitary candle he gave one or two preliminary puffs and then taking his pipe from his mouth said gently olly it cant be done  what cant be done gabe queried the artful olly with a swift preconception of the answer expanding her little mouth into a thoughtful smile  thet thingwhat thing gabe  this yer marryin o mrs markle said gabriel with an assumption of easy businesslike indifference  why asked olly  she wouldnt hev me  what said olly facing swiftly round  gabriel evaded his sisters eyes and looking in the fire repeated slowly but with great firmness  no not furfurfur a gift  shes a mean stuckup horrid old thing said olly fiercely id jest like towhy there aint a man az kin compare with you gabe like her impudence  gabriel waved his pipe in the air deprecatingly yet with such an evident air of cheerful resignation that olly faced upon him again suspiciously and askedwhat did she say  she said replied gabe slowly thet her heart was given to another i think she struck into poetry and said      my heart it is anothers     and it never can be thine  thet is i think so i disremember her special remark olly but you know women allers spout poetry at sech times ennyhow thats about the way the spring panned out  who was it said olly suddenly  she didnt let on who said gabriel uneasily i didnt think it the square thing to inquire  well said olly  gabriel looked down still more embarrassed and shifted his position well he repeated  what did you say said ollythen  no afore how did you do it gabe said olly comfortably fixing her chin in her hands and looking up in her brothers face  oh the usual way said gabriel with a motion of his pipe to indicate vague and glittering generalities of courtship  but how gabe tell me all about it  well said gabriel looking up at the roof wimmen is bashful ez a general thing and thars about only one way ez a man can get at em and that ez by being kinder keerless and bold ye see olly when i kem inter the house i sorter jest chucked sal under the chinthet way you knowand then went up and put my arm around the widders waist and kissed her two or three times you know jest to be sociable and familiar like  and to think gabe thet after all that she wouldnt hev ye said olly  not at any price said gabriel positively  the disgustin creature said olly id jest like to ketch that manty hangin round yer after that she continued savagely with a vicious shake of her little fist and just to think only today we give her her pick o them pups  hush olly ye mustnt do anythin o the sort said gabriel hastily ye must never let on to any one anything its confidence olly confidence ez these sort o things allus isatween you and me besides he went on reassuringly thats nothin lord afore a mans married he hez to go through this kind o thing a dozen times its expected there was a man as i once knowed continued gabriel with shameless mendacity ez went through it fifty tunes and he was a better man nor me and could shake a thousand dollars in the face of any woman why bless your eyes olly some men jest likes itits excitementlike perspectin  but what did you say gabe said olly returning with fresh curiosity to the central fact and ignoring the pleasures of rejection as expounded by gabriel  well i just up and sez this susan markle sez i the case is just this heres olly and me up there on the hill and jess you and manty down there on the gulch and mountings wild and valleys deep two loving hearts do now divide and theres no reason why it shouldnt be one family and one house and that family and that house mine and its for you to say when and then i kinder slung in a little more poetry and sorter fooled around with that ring said gabriel showing a heavy plain gold ring on his powerful little finger and jest kissed her agin and chucked sally under the chin and thats all  and she wouldnt hev ye gabe said olly thoughtfully after all that well who wants her to i dont  im glad to hear you say that olly said gabriel but ye mustnt let on a word of it to her she talks o coming up on the hill to build and wants to buy that part of the old claim where i perspected last summer sos to be near us and look arter you and olly continued gabriel gravely ef she comes round yer foolin around me ez she used to do ye mustnt mind thatits womens ways  id like to catch her at it said olly  gabriel looked at olly with a guilty satisfaction and drew her toward him and now that its all over olly said he its all the better ez it is you and mell get along together ez comfortable as we kin i talked with some of the boys the other day about sendin for a schoolmarm from marysville and mrs markle thinks its a good idee and youll go to school olly ill run up to marysville next week and get you some better clothes and well be just ez happy ez ever and then some day olly afore you know itthem things come always suddentill jest make a strike outer that ledge and well be rich thars money in that ledge olly ive allus allowed that and then well goyou and meto san francisco and well hev a big house and ill jest invite a lot of little girls the best they is in frisco to play with you and youll hev all the teachers you want and women ez will be glad to look arter ye and then maybe i might make it up with mrs markle  never said olly passionately  never it is said the artful gabriel with a glow of pleasure in his eyes and a slight stirring of remorse in his breast but its time that small gals like you was abed  thus admonished olly retired behind the screen taking the solitary candle and leaving her brother smoking his pipe by the light of the slowly dying fire but olly did not go to sleep and half an hour later peering out of the screen she saw her brother still sitting by the fire his pipe extinguished and his head resting on his hand she went up to him so softly that she startled him shaking a drop of water on the hand that she suddenly threw round his neck  you aint worrying about that woman gabe  no said gabriel with a laugh  olly looked down at her hand gabriel looked up at the roof theres a leak thar thats got to be stopped tomorrow go to bed olly or youll take your death     chapter iv  in which the artful gabriel is discovered   notwithstanding his assumed ease and a certain relief which was real gabriel was far from being satisfied with the result of his visit to mrs markle whatever may have actually occurred not known to the reader except through gabriels own disclosure to olly gabriels manner hardly bore out the boldness and conclusiveness of his statement for a day or two afterwards he resented any allusion to the subject from olly but on the third day he held a conversation with one of the eureka bar miners which seemed to bear some remote reference to his experience  thars a good deal said lately in the papers began gabriel cautiously in regard to breach o promise trials lookin at it by and large thar dont seem to be much show for a fellow ez hez been in enny ways kind to a gal is thar  the person addressed whom rumour declared to have sought one horse gulch as a place of refuge from his wife remarked with an oath that women were blank fools anyway and that on general principles they were not to be trusted  but thar must be a kind o ginral law on the subject urged gabriel now what would be your opinion if you was on a jury onto a case like this it happened to a friend o mine in frisco said gabriel with a marked parenthesis a man ez you dont know thar was a womanwell say a widderez had been kinder hangin round him off and on for two or three year and he hadnt allowed anything to her about marryin one day he goes down thar to her house kinder easylike jest to pass the time o day and be sociable  thats bad interrupted the cynic  yes said gabriel doubtingly praps it does look bad but you see he didnt mean anythin  well said the adviser  well thets all said gabriel  all exclaimed his companion indignantly  yes all now this woman kinder allows shell bring a suit agin him to make him marry her  my opinion is said the adviser bluntly my opinion is that the man was a fool and didnt tell ye the truth nuther and id give damages agin him for being such a fool  this opinion was so crushing to gabriel that he turned hopelessly away nevertheless in his present state of mind he could not refrain from pushing his inquiries further and in a general conversation which took place at briggss store in the afternoon among a group of smokers gabriel artfully introduced the subject of courtship and marriage  thars different ways of getting at the feelins of a woman said the oracular johnson after a graphic statement of his own method of ensnaring the affections of a former sweetheart thars different ways jest as thars different men and women in the world one mans way wont do with some wimmen but thars one way ez is pretty sure to fetch em allers that is to play off indifferentto never let on ye like em to kinder look arter them in a ginral sort o way pretty much as gabe thar looks arter the sickbut not to say anythin particler to make them understand that theyve got to do all the courtin ef thars enny to be done whats the matter gabe ye aint goin  gabriel who had risen in great uneasiness muttered something about its being time to go home and then sat down again looking at johnson in fearful fascination  that kind o thing is pretty sure to fetch almost enny woman continued johnson and a man ez does it orter be looked arter it orter be put down by law its tamperin dont yer see with the holiest affections sich a man orter be spotted wharever found  but mebbe the man dont mean anythinmebbe its jest his way suggested gabriel ruefully looking around in the faces of the party mebbe he dont take to wimmen and marriage natral and its jest his way  way be blowed said the irate johnson scornfully ketch him indeed its jest the artfullest kind o artfulness its jest begging on a full hand  gabriel rose slowly and resisting any further attempts to detain him walked to the door and after a remark on the threatening nature of the weather delivered in a manner calculated to impress his audience with his general indifference to the subject then under discussion melted dejectedly away into the driving rain that had all day swept over one horse gulch and converted its one long narrow street into a ditch of turbulent yellow water  thet gabe seems to be out o sorts today said johnson i heerd lawyer maxwell asking arter him this morning i reckon thars suthin up gabe aint a bad sort of chap hezent got enny too much sabe about him but hes mighty good at looking arter sick folks and thet kind o mans a power o use in this camp hope thar aint anything ez will interfere with his sphere o usefulness  may be a woman scrape suggested briggs he seemed sort o bound up in what you was saying about women jest now thar is folks round yer said briggs dropping his voice and looking about him ez believes that that yer olly which he lets on to be his sister to be actooally his own child no man would tote round a child like that and jest bind himself up in her and give up wimmen and whisky and keerds and kempeny ef it wasnt his own thet aint like brothers in my part of the country  its a mighty queer story he tells ennywaysall this yer stuff about starvation camp and escapin suggested another i never did somehow take enny stock in that  well its his own look out concluded johnson its nothin to me ef ive been any service to him pintin out sick people and kinder makin suggestions here and thar how he should look arter them hes welcome to it i dont go back on my record if he hez got into trouble  and im sure said briggs if i did allow him to come in here and look arter thet sick mexican it aint for me to be expected to look after his moril character too but here the entrance of a customer put a stop to further criticism  meanwhile the unfortunate subject of this discussion by clinging close to the walls of houses had avoided the keen blast that descended from the mountain and had at last reached the little trail that led through the gulch to his cabin on the opposite hillside here gabriel hesitated to follow that trail would lead him past the boardinghouse of mrs markle in the light of the baleful counsel he had just received to place himself as soon again in the way of danger seemed to him to be only a provocation of fate that the widow and sal might swoop down upon him as he passed and compel him to enter that the spectacle of his passing without a visit might superinduce instant hysterics on the part of the widow appeared to his terrorstricken fancy as almost a certainty the only other way home was by a circuitous road along the ridge of the hill at least three miles farther gabriel did not hesitate long but began promptly to ascend the hill this was no easy task in the face of a strong gale and torrents of beating rain but the overcoming of physical difficulties by the exercise of his all conquering muscles and the fact that he was doing something relieved his mind of its absurd terrors when he had reached the summit he noticed for the first time the full power of those subtle agencies that had been silently at work during the last weeks steady rain a thin trickling mountain rill where he had two weeks before slaked his thirst during a ramble with olly was now transformed into a roaring cataract the brook that they had leaped across was now a swollen river there were slowly widening pools in the valleys darkly glancing sheets of water on the distant plains and a monotonous rush and gurgle always in the air it was half an hour later and two miles farther on his rough road that he came in view of the narrow precipitous gorge through which the wingdam stage passed on its way from marysville as he approached nearer he could see that the little mountain stream which ran beside the stage road had already slightly encroached upon the roadbed and that here and there the stage road itself was lost in drifts of standing water it will be pretty rough drivin up that cañon said gabriel to himself as he thought of the incoming wingdam stage now nearly due mighty onpleasant and risky with narvous leaders but thars worse things than that in this yer world he meditated as his mind reverted again to mrs markle and ef i could change places with yuba bill and get on that box and olly insideid do it  but just then the reservoir of the wingdam ditch came in view on the hill beside him and with it a revelation that in a twinkling displaced mrs markle and seemed almost to change the mans entire nature what was it apparently nothing to the eye of the ordinary traveller the dam was full and through a cutoff the overplus water was escaping with a roar nothing more yesto an experienced eye the escaping water was not abating the quantity in the dam was that all no halfway down the rudely constructed adobe bank of the dam the water was slowly oozing and trickling through a slowlywidening crevice over the rocks above the gorge and stage road below the wall of the dam was giving way to tear off coat and all impeding garments to leap from rock to rock and boulder to boulder hanging on by slippery chimisal and the decayed roots of trees to reach at the risk of life and limb the cañon below and then to run at the highest speed to warn the incoming stage of the danger before it should enter the narrow gorge was only the resolve and action of a brave man but to do this without the smallest waste of strength that ought to be preserved to do this with the greatest economy of force to do this with the agility and skill of a mountaineer and the reserved power of a giant to do this with a will so simple direct and unhesitating that the action appeared to have been planned and rehearsed days before instead of being the resolution of the instantthis belonged to gabriel conroy and to have seen him settle into a long swinging trot and to have observed his calm grave earnest but unexcited face and quiet steadfast eye you would have believed him some healthy giant simply exercising himself  he had not gone half a mile before his quick ear caught a dull sound and roar of advancing water yet even then he only slightly increased his steady stride as if he had been quickened and followed by his trainer rather than by approaching death at the same moment there was a quick rattle and clatter in the road aheada halt and turning back for gabriels warning shout had run before him like a bullet but it was too late the roaring water behind him struck him and bore him down and the next instant swept the coach and horses a confused struggling black mass against the rocky walls of the cañon and then it was that the immense reserved strength of gabriel came into play set upon by the almost irresistible volume of water he did not waste his power in useless opposition but allowed himself to be swept hither and thither until he touched a branch of chimisal that depended from the cañon side seizing it with one sudden and mighty effort he raised himself above the sweep and suction of the boiling flood the coach was gone where it had stood a few black figures struggled swirled and circled one of them was a woman in an instant gabriel plunged into the yellow water a few strokes brought him to her side in another moment he had encircled her waist with his powerful arm and lifted her head above the surface when he was seized by two despairing arms from the other side gabriel did not shake them off take hold of me lower down and ill help ye both he shouted as he struck out with his only free arm for the chimisal he reached it drew himself up so that he could grasp it with his teeth and then hanging on by his jaw raised his two clinging companions beside him they had barely grasped it when another ominous roar was heard below and another wall of yellow water swept swiftly up the cañon the chimisal began to yield to their weight gabriel dug his fingers into the soil about its roots clutched the jagged edges of a rock beneath and threw his arm about the woman pressing her closely to the face of the wall as the wave swept over them there was a sudden despairing cry a splash and the man was gone only gabriel and the woman remained they were safe but for the moment only gabriels left hand grasping an insecure projection was all that sustained their united weight gabriel for the first time looked down upon the woman then he said hesitatingly  kin ye hold yourself a minnityes  even at that critical moment some occult quality of sweetness in her voice thrilled him  lock your hands together hard and sling em over my neck she did so gabriel freed his right hand he scarcely felt the weight thus suddenly thrown upon his shoulders but cautiously groped for a projection on the rock above he found it raised himself by a supreme effort until he secured a foothold in the hole left by the uprooted chimisal bush here he paused  kin ye hang on a minnit longer  go on she said  gabriel went on he found another projection and another and gradually at last reached a ledge a foot wide near the top of the cliff here he paused it was the womans turn to speak  can you climb to the top she asked  yesif you  go on she said simply  gabriel continued the ascent cautiously in a few minutes he had reached the top here her hands suddenly relaxed their grasp she would have slipped to the ground had not gabriel caught her by the waist lifted her in his arms and borne her to a spot where a fallen pinetree had carpeted and cushioned the damp ground with its withered tassels here he laid her down with that exquisite delicacy and tenderness of touch which was so habitual to him in his treatment of all helplessness as to be almost unconscious but she thanked him with such a graceful revelation of small white teeth and such a singular look out of her dark grey eyes that he could not help looking at her again she was a small lighthaired woman tastefully and neatly dressed and of a type and class unknown to him but for her smile he would not have thought her pretty but even with that smile on her face she presently paled and fainted at the same moment gabriel heard the sound of voices and looking up saw two of the passengers who had evidently escaped by climbing the cliff coming towards them and theni know not how to tell itbut a sudden and aweinspiring sense of his ambiguous and peculiar situation took possession of him what would they think of it would they believe his statement a sickening recollection of the late conversation at briggs returned to him the indignant faces of the gaunt sal and the plump mrs markle were before him even the questioning eyes of little olly seemed to pierce his inmost soul and alas this hero the victorious giant turned and fled     chapter v  simplicity versus sagacity   when gabriel reached his home it was after dark and olly was anxiously waiting to receive him  youre wet all through you awful gabe and covered with mud into the bargain go and change your clothes or youll get your death as sure as youre a born sinner  the tone and manner in which this was uttered was something unusual with olly but gabriel was too glad to escape further questioning to criticise or rebuke it but when he had reappeared from behind the screen with dry clothes he was surprised to observe by the light of the newlylit candle that olly herself had undergone since morning a decided change in her external appearance not to speak alone of an unusual cleanliness of face and hands and a certain attempt at confining her yellow curls with a vivid pink ribbon there was an unwonted neatness in her attire and some essay at adornment in a faded threadlace collar which she had found among her mothers things in the family bag and a purple neckribbon  it seems to me said the delighted gabriel that somebody else hez been dressin up and makin a toylit sence ive been away hev you been in the ditches agin olly  no said olly with some dignity of manner as she busied herself in setting the table for supper  but i reckon i never seen ye look so peart afore olly whos been here he added with a sudden alarm  nobody said olly i reckon some folks kin get along and look decent without the help of other folks leastways of susan markle  at this barbed arrow gabriel winced slightly see yer olly said gabriel ye mustnt talk thet way about thet woman youre only a chileand ef yer brother did let on to ye in confidence certing things ez a brother may say to his sister ye oughtnt say anythin about it  say anythin echoed olly scornfully do you think id ever let on to thet woman ennything ketch me  gabriel looked up at his sister in awful admiration and felt at the depths of his consciencestricken and selfdeprecatory nature that he didnt deserve so brave a little defender for a moment he resolved to tell her the truth but a fear of ollys scorn and a desire to bask in the sunshine of her active sympathy withheld him besides he added to himself in a single flash of selfsatisfaction this yer thing may be the makin o thet gal yet look at thet collar gabriel look at thet hair gabriel all your truthtellin never fetched outer thet purty child what thet one yarn did  nevertheless as gabriel sat down to his supper he was still haunted by the ominous advice and counsel he had heard that day when olly had finished her meal he noticed that she had forborne evidently at great personal sacrifice to sop the fryingpan with her bread he turned to her gravely  ef you wus ever asked olly ef i had been sweet upon mrs markle wot would ye say  say said olly savagely id say that if there ever was a woman ez had run arter a man with less call to do itit was mrs marklethat same old disgustin susan markle thets wot id say and id say itto her face gabe see here  well said the delighted gabriel  ef that schoolmaam comes up here do you jest make up to her  olly ejaculated the alarmed gabriel  you jest go for her you jest do for her what you did for that susan markle and jest you do it if you can gabewhen mrs markles aroundor afore little mantyshell go and tell her mothershe tells her everything ive heerd gabe that some o them schoolmaams is nice  in his desire to please olly gabriel would have imparted to her the story of his adventure in the cañon but a vague fear that olly might demand from him an instant offer of his hand and heart to the woman he had saved checked the disclosure and the next moment there was a rap at the door of the cabin  i forgot to say gabe that lawyer maxwell was here today to see ye said olly and i bet you thets him if he wants you to nuss anybody gabe dont ye do it you got enough to do to look arter me  gabriel rose with a perplexed face and opened the door a tall dark man with a beard heavily streaked with grey entered there was something in his manner and dress although both conformed to local prejudices and customs that denoted a type of man a little above the average social condition of one horse gulch unlike gabriels previous evening visitor he did not glance around him but fixed a pair of keen halfhumorous halfinterrogating grey eyes upon his hosts face and kept them there the habitual expression of his features was serious except for a certain halfnervous twitching at the left corner of his mouth which continued usually until he stopped and passed his hand softly across it the impression always left on the spectator was that he had wiped away a smile as some people do a tear  i dont think i ever before met you gabriel he said advancing and offering his hand my name is maxwell i think youve heard of me i have come for a little talk on a matter of business  the blank dismay of gabriels face did not escape him nor the gesture with which he motioned to olly to retire  its quite evident he said to himself that the child knows nothing of this or is unprepared i have taken him by surprise  if i mistake not gabriel said maxwell aloud your littleergirlis as much concerned in this matter as yourself why not let her remain  no no said gabriel now feeling perfectly convinced in the depths of his consciencestricken soul that maxwell was here as the legal adviser of the indignant mrs markle no olly run out and get some chips in the woodhouse agin tomorrow mornings fire run  olly ran maxwell cast a look after the child wiped his mouth and leaning his elbow on the table fixed his eyes on gabriel i have called tonight gabriel to see if we can arrange a certain matter without trouble and evenas i am employed against youwith as little talk as possible to be frank i am entrusted with the papers in a legal proceeding against you now see here is it necessary for me to say what these proceedings are is it even necessary for me to give the name of my client  gabriel dropped his eyes but even then the frank honesty of his nature spoke for him he raised his head and said simplyno  lawyer maxwell was for a moment staggered but only for a moment good he said thoughtfully you are frank let me ask you now if to avoid legal proceedings publicity and scandaland allow me to add the almost absolute certainty of losing in any suit that might be brought against youwould you be willing to abandon this house and claim at once allowing it to go for damages in the past if you would i think i could accept it for such i think i could promise that even this question of a closer relationship would not come up briefly she might keep her name and you might keep yours and you would remain to each other as strangers what do you say  gabriel rose quickly and took the lawyers hands with a tremulous grasp youre a kind man mr maxwell he said shaking the lawyers hand vigorously a good man its a bad business and youve made the best of it ef youd been my own lawyer instead o hers you couldnt hev treated me better ill leave here at once ive been thinking o doing it ever since this yer thing troubled me but ill go tomorrow ye can hev the house and all it contains if i had anything else in a way of a fee to offer ye id do it she kin hev the house and all that they is of it and then nothing will be said  not a word said maxwell examining gabriel curiously  no talknothin in the newspapers continued gabriel  your conduct toward her and your attitude in this whole affair will be kept a profound secret unless you happen to betray it yourself and that is my one reason for advising you to leave here  ill do ittomorrow said gabriel rubbing his hands wouldnt you like to have me sign some bit o paper  no no said the lawyer wiping his mouth with his hand and looking at gabriel as if he belonged to some entirely new species let me advise you as a friend to sign no paper that might be brought against you hereafter your simple abandonment of the claim and house is sufficient for our purposes i will make out no papers in the case until thursday by that time i expect to find no one to serve them on you understand  gabriel nodded and wrung the lawyers hand warmly  maxwell walked toward the door still keeping his glance fixed on gabriels clear honest eyes on the threshold he paused and leaning against it wiped his mouth with a slow gesture and saidfrom all i can hear gabriel you are a simple honest fellow and i frankly confess to you but for the admission you have made to me i would have thought you incapable of attempting to wrong a woman i should have supposed it some mistake i am not a judge of the motives of men i am too old a lawyer and too familiar with things of this kind to be surprised at mens motives or even to judge their rights or wrongs by my own but now that we understand each other would you mind telling me what was your motive for this peculiar and monstrous form of deception understand me it will not alter my opinion of you which is that you are not a bad man but i am curious to know how you could deliberately set about to wrong this woman what was the motive  gabriels face flushed deeply then he lifted his eyes and pointed to the screen the lawyer followed the direction of his finger and saw olly standing in the doorway  lawyer maxwell smiled it is the sex anyway he said to himself perhaps a little younger than i supposed of course his own child he nodded again smiled at olly and with the consciousness of a professional triumph blent with a certain moral satisfaction that did not always necessarily accompany his professional success he passed out into the night  gabriel avoided conversation with olly until late in the evening when she had taken her accustomed seat at his feet before the fire she came directly to the point what did he want gabe  nothing partickler said gabriel with an affectation of supreme indifference i was thinking olly that id tell you a story its a long time since i told one it had been gabriels habit to improve these precious moments by relating the news of the camp or the current topics of the day artfully imparted as pure fiction but since his preoccupation with mrs markle he had lately omitted it  olly nodded her head and gabriel went on  once upon a time they lived a man ez hed lived and would livefor thet was wot was so singler about himall alone cept for a little sister ez this man hed wot he loved very dearly they was no one ez this man would ever let ring in so to speak between him and this little sister and the heaps o private confidence and the private talks about this and thet thet this yer man hed with this little sister was wonderful to behold  was it a real mana pure man queried olly  the man was a real man but the little sister i oughter say was a kind o fairy you know olly ez hed a heap o power to do good to this yer man unbeknownst to him and afore his face they lived in a sorter paliss in the woods this yer man and his sister and one day this yer man hed a heap o troubil come upon him that was sich ez would make him leave this beautiful paliss and he didnt know how to let on to his little sister about it and so he up and he sez to her sez he glorianathet was her namegloriana sez he we must quit this beautiful paliss and wander into furrin parts and the reason why is a secret ez i cant tell ye and this yer little sister jest ups and sez wots agreeable to you brother is agreeable to me for we is everything to each other the wide world over and variety is the spice o life and ill pack my traps tomorrow and she did for why olly why dont ye see this yer little sister was a fairy and knowed it all without bein told and they went away to furrin parts and strange places war they built a more beautiful paliss than the other was and they lived thar peaceful like and happy all the days o their life  and thar wasnt any old witch of a mrs markle to bother them when are ye goin gabe asked the practical olly  i thought tomorrow said gabriel helplessly abandoning all allegory and looking at his sister in respectful awe thet ez i reckoned olly to get to caseys in time to take the arternoon stage up to marysville  well said olly then im goin to bed now  olly said gabriel reproachfully as he watched the little figure disappear behind the canvas ye didnt kiss me fur goodnight  olly came back you ole gabeyou she said patronisingly as she ran her fingers through his tangled curls and stooped to bestow a kiss on his forehead from an apparently immeasurable moral and intellectual heightyou old big gabe what would you do without me id like to know  the next morning gabriel was somewhat surprised at observing olly immediately after the morning meal proceed gravely to array herself in the few more respectable garments that belonged to her wardrobe over a white muslin frock yellow and scant with age she had tied a scarf of glaring cheap pink ribbon and over this again she had secured by the aid of an enormous tortoiseshell brooch a large black and white check shawl of her mothers that even repeated folding could not reduce in size she then tied over her yellow curls a large straw hat trimmed with white and yellow daisies and palegreen ribbon and completed her toilet by unfurling over her shoulder a small yellow parasol gabriel who had been watching these preparations in great concern at last ventured to address the bizarre but pretty little figure before him  war you goin olly  down the gulch to say goodbye to the reed gals taint the square thing to vamose the ranch without lettin on to folks  ye aint goin near mrs markles are ye queried gabriel in deprecatory alarm  olly turned a scornful flash of her clear blue eye upon her brother and said curtly ketch me  there was something so appalling in her quickness such a sudden revelation of quaint determination in the lines of her mouth and eyebrows that gabriel could say no more without a word he watched the yellow sunshade and flapping straw hat with its streaming ribbons slowly disappear down the winding descent of the hill and then a sudden and grotesque sense of dependence upon the childan appreciation of some reserved quality in her nature hitherto unsuspected by himsomething that separated them now and in the years to come would slowly widen the rift between themcame upon him with such a desolating sense of loneliness that it seemed unendurable he did not dare to reenter or look back upon the cabin but pushed on vaguely toward his claim on the hillside on his way thither he had to pass a solitary redwood tree that he had often noticed whose enormous bulk belittled the rest of the forest yet also by reason of its very isolation had acquired a certain lonely pathos that was far beyond the suggestion of its heroic size it seemed so imbecile so gratuitously large so unproductive of the good that might be expected of its bulk so unlike the smart spruces and pert young firs and larches that stood beside it that gabriel instantly accepted it as a symbol of himself and could not help wondering if there were not some other locality where everything else might be on its own plane of existence if i war to go thar said gabriel to himself i wonder if i might not suit better than i do yer and be of some sarvice to thet child he pushed his way through the underbrush and stood upon the ledge that he had first claimed on his arrival at one horse gulch it was drearyit was unpromisinga vast stony field high up in air covered with scattered boulders of dark irongrey rock gabriel smiled bitterly any other man but me couldnt hev bin sich a fool as to preëmpt sich a claim fur gold praps its all for the best that im short of it now said gabriel as he turned away and descended the hill to his later claim in the gulch which yielded him that pittance known in the mining dialect as grub  it was nearly three oclock before he returned to the cabin with the few tools that he had gathered when he did so he found olly awaiting him with a slight flush of excitement on her cheek but no visible evidences of any late employment to be seen in the cabin  ye dont seem to have been doin much packin olly said gabrieltho thar aint so to speak much to pack up  thar aint no use in packin gabe replied olly looking directly into the giants bashful eyes  no use echoed gabriel  no sort o use said olly decidedly we aint goin gabe and thats the end ont ive been over to see lawyer maxwell and ive made it all right  gabriel dropped speechless into a chair and gazed openmouthed at his sister ive made it all right gabe continued olly coolly youll see i jest went over thar this morning and hed a little talk with the lawyer and giv him a piece o my mind about mrs markleand jest settled the whole thing  good lord olly what did you say  say echoed olly i jest up and told him everythin i knew about thet woman and i never told you gabe the half of it i jest sed ez how shed been runnin round arter you ever sence she first set eyes on you when you was nussin her husband wot died how you never ez much ez looked at her ontil i set you up to it how she used to come round yer and sit and sit and look at you gabe and kinder do this et ye over her shoulderhere olly achieved an admirable imitation of certain arch glances of mrs markle that would have driven that estimable lady frantic with rage and even at this moment caused the bashful blood of gabriel to fly into his very eyes and how she used to let on all sorts of excuses to get you over thar and how you refoosed and wot a deceitful old mean disgustin critter she was enny way and here olly paused for want of breath  and wot did he say said the equally breathless gabriel  nothin at first then he laughed and laughed and laughed till i thought hed bust and thenlet me see reflected the conscientious olly he said thar was some absurd blunder and mistakethats jest what he called thet mrs markle gabethose was his very words and then he set up another yell o laughin and somehow gabe i got to laughin and she got to laughin too and olly laughed at the recollection  whos she asked gabriel with a most lugubrious face  o gabe you think everybodys mrs markle said olly swiftly she was a lady ez was with thet lawyer maxwell ez heerd it all why lord she seemed to take ez much interest in it as the lawyer praps said olly with a slight degree of conscious pride as raconteur praps it was the way i told it i was thet mad gabe and sassy  and what did he say continued gabriel still ruefully for to him as to most simple serious natures devoid of any sense of humour all this inconsequent hilarity looked suspicious  why he was fur puttin right over here to explain ez he called it but the lady stopped him and sed somethin low i didnt get to hear oh she must be a partickler friend o his gabefor he did everythin thet she said and she said i was to go back and say thet we neednt hurry ourselves to git away at all and thets the end of it gabe  but didnt he say anythin more olly said gabriel anxiously  no he begin to ask me some questions about old times and starvation camp and id made up my mind to disremember all them things ez i told you gabe fur im jest sick of being called a cannonball so i jest disremembered everything ez fast ez he asked it until he sez sez he to this lady she evidently knows nothin o the whole thing but the lady had been tryin to stop his askin questions and hed been kinder signin to me not to answer too oh shes cute gabe i could see thet ez soon ez i set down  what did she look like olly said gabriel with an affectation of carelessness but still by no means yet entirely relieved in his mind  oh she didnt look like mrs markle gabe or any o thet kind a kinder short woman with white teeth and a small waist and good cloes i didnt sort o take to her much gabe though she was very kind to me i dont know ez i could say ezackly what she did look like i reckon thar aint anybody about yer looks like she saints and goodness gabe thats her now thar she is  something darkened the doorway gabriel looking up beheld the woman he had saved in the cañon it was madame devarges     book iii  the lead     chapter i  an old pioneer of 49   a thick fog dense impenetrable bluishgrey and raw marked the advent of the gentle summer of 1854 on the california coast the brief immature spring was scarcely yet over there were flowers still to be seen on the outlying hills around san francisco and the wild oats were yet green on the contra costa mountains but the wild oats were hidden under a dim indiainky veil and the wild flowers accepted the joyless embraces of the fog with a staring waxen rigidity in short the weather was so uncomfortable that the average californian was more than ever inclined to impress the stranger aggressively with the fact that fogs were healthy and that it was the finest climate on the earth  perhaps no one was better calculated or more accustomed to impress the stranger with this belief than mr peter dumphy banker and capitalist his outspoken faith in the present and future of california was unbounded his sincere convictions that no country or climate was ever before so signally favoured his intoleration of any criticism or belief to the contrary made him a representative man so positive and unmistakable was his habitual expression on these subjects that it was impossible to remain long in his presence without becoming impressed with the idea that any other condition of society climate or civilization than that which obtained in california was a mistake strangers were brought early to imbibe from this fountain timid and weak californians in danger of a relapse had their faith renewed and their eyesight restored by bathing in this pool that mr dumphy kept always replenished unconsciously people at last got to echoing mr dumphys views as their own and much of the large praise that appeared in newspapers public speeches and correspondence was first voiced by dumphy it must not be supposed that mr dumphys positiveness of statement and peremptory manner were at all injurious to his social reputation owing to that suspicion with which most frontier communities regard polite concession and suavity of method mr dumphys brusque frankness was always accepted as genuine you always know what pete dumphy means was the average criticism he aint goin to lie to please any man to a conceit that was so freely and shamelessly expressed as to make hesitating and cautious wisdom appear weak and unmanly beside it mr dumphy added the rare quality of perfect unconscientiousness unmixed with any adulterating virtue it was with such rare combative qualities as these that mr dumphy sat that morning in his private office and generally opposed the fog without or rather its influence upon his patrons and society at large the face he offered to it was a strong one although superficially smooth for since the reader had the honour of his acquaintance he had shaved off his beard as a probably unnecessary indication of character it was still early but he had already despatched much business with that prompt decision which made even an occasional blunder seem heroic he was signing a letter that one of his clerks had brought him when he said briskly without looking upsend mr ramirez in  mr ramirez who had already called for three successive days without obtaining an audience of dumphy entered the private room with an excited sense of having been wronged which however instantly disappeared as far as external manifestation was concerned on his contact with the hardheaded aggressive and prompt dumphy  how do said dumphy without looking up from his desk mr ramirez uttered some objection to the weather and then took a seat uneasily near dumphy go on said dumphy i can listen  it is i who came to listen said mr ramirez with great suavity it is of the news i would hear  yes said mr dumphy signing his name rapidly to several documents yes yes yes he finished them turned rapidly upon ramirez and said yes again in such a positive manner as to utterly shipwreck that gentlemans selfcontrol ramirez said dumphy abruptly how much have you got in that thing  mr ramirez still floating on a sea of conjecture could only say eh ah it is what  how deep are you how much would you lose  mr ramirez endeavoured to fix his eyes upon dumphys howmuchwould i loseif how if what  whatmoneyhaveyougotinit said mr dumphy emphasising each word sharply with the blunt end of his pen on the desk  no money i have much interest in the success of madame devarges  then youre not in much thats lucky for you read that lettershow him in  the last remark was in reply to a mumbled interrogatory of the clerk who had just entered perhaps it was lucky for mr ramirez that mr dumphys absorption with his new visitor prevented his observation of his previous visitors face as he read the letter ramirezs face first turned to an ashengrey hue then to a livid purple then he smacked his dry lips thrice and said carámba then with burning eyes he turned towards dumphy  you have read this he asked shaking the letter towards dumphy  one moment interrupted dumphy finishing the conversation with his latest visitor and following him to the door yes he continued returning to his desk and facing ramirez yes mr ramirez could only shake the letter and smile in a ghastly way at dumphy yes said dumphy reaching forward and coolly taking the letter out of ramirezs hand yes seems she is going to get married he continued consulting the letter going to marry the brother the man in possession that puts you all right any way the cat jumps and it lets you out with the air of having finished the interview mr dumphy quietly returned the letter followed by ramirezs glaring eyes to a pigeonhole in his desk and tapped his desk with his penholder  and youyou gasped ramirez hoarsely you  oh i didnt go into it a dollar yet it was a good investment she could have made out a strong case you had possession of the deed or will hadnt you there was no evidence of the existence of the other woman continued mr dumphy in his usually loud voice overlooking the cautionary gestures of mr ramirez with perfect indifference hello how do he added to another visitor i was sending you a note mr ramirez rose his long finger nails were buried in the yellow flesh of his palms his face was quite bloodless and his lips were dry whats your hurry said dumphy looking up come in again theres another matter i want you to look into ramirez weve got some money out on claim that ought to have one or two essential papers to make it right i daresay theyre lying round somewhere where you can find em draw on me for the expense mr dumphy did not say this slyly nor with any dark significance but with perfect frankness virtually it saidyoure a scamp so am i whether or not this other man who overhears us is one likewise it matters not he took his seat again turned to the latest comer and became oblivious of his previous companion  luckily for mr ramirez when he reached the street he had recovered the control of his features if not his natural colour at least the fog which seemed to lend a bluishgrey shade to all complexions allowed his own livid cheek to pass unnoticed he walked quickly and it appeared almost unconsciously towards the water for it was not until he reached the steamboat wharf that he knew where he was he seemed to have taken one step from mr dumphys office to the pier there was nothing between these two objects in his consciousness the interval was utterly annihilated the steamboat did not leave for sacramento until eight that evening and it was only ten oclock now he had been conscious of this as he walked but he could not have resisted this one movement even if a futile one towards the object of his revengeful frenzy ten hours to waitten hours to be passive inactiveto be doing nothing how could he pass the time he could sharpen his knife he could buy a new one he could purchase a better pistol he remembered passing a gunsmiths shop with a display of glittering weapons in its window he retraced his steps and entered the shop spending some moments in turning over the gunsmiths various wares especially was he fascinated by a long broadbladed bowieknife my own make said the tradesman with professional pride passing a broad leathery thumb along the keen edge of the blade itll split a halfdollar see  he threw a halfdollar on the counter and with a quick straight downdarting stab pierced it in halves mr ramirez was pleased and professed a desire to make the experiment himself but the point slipped sending the halfdollar across the shop and cutting a long splintering furrow in the counter yer narves aint steady and ye try too hard said the man coolly thets the way its apt to be with you gents ye jest work yourself up into a fever bout a little thing like thet ez if everything depended on it dont make sich a big thing of it take it easy like this and with a quick firm workmanlike stroke the tradesman repeated the act successfully mr ramirez bought the knife as the man wrapped it up in paper he remarked with philosophic kindnessi wouldnt try to do it agin this mornin its early in the day and ive noticed thet gents ez hez been runnin free all night aint apt to do theirselves justice next mornin take it quietly alone by yourself this arternoon dont think youre goin to do anythin big and youll fetch it sure  when mr ramirez was in the street again he looked at his watch eleven oclock only one hour gone he buttoned his coat tightly over the knife in his breast pocket and started on again feverishly twelve oclock found him rambling over the sand hills near the mission dolores in one of the bystreets he came upon a woman looking so like the one that filled all his thoughts that he turned to look at her again with a glance so full of malevolence that she turned from him in terror this circumstance his agitation and the continual dryness of his lips sent him into a saloon where he drank freely without however increasing or abating his excitement when he returned to the crowded streets again he walked quickly imagining that his manner was noticed by others in such intervals as he snatched from the contemplation of a single intention there were several ways of doing it one was to tax her with her deceit and then kill her in the tempest of his indignation another and a more favourable thought was to surprise her and her new accomplicefor mr ramirez after the manner of most jealous reasoners never gave her credit for any higher motive than that she had shown to himand kill them both another and a later idea was to spend the strength of his murderous passion upon the man and then to enjoy her discomfiture the failure of her plans and perhaps her appeals for forgiveness but it would still be two days before he could reach them perhaps they were already married perhaps they would be gone in all this wild passionate and tumultuous contemplation of an effect there never had been for a single moment in his mind the least doubt of the adequacy of the cause that he was a dupea hopeless helpless dupewas sufficient since he had read the letter his selfconsciousness had centred upon a single thought expressed to him in a single native word bobo it was continually before his eyes he spelled it on the signs in the street it kept up a dull monotonous echo in his ears bobo ah she should see  it was past noon and the fog had deepened afar from the bay came the sounds of bells and whistles if the steamer should not go if she should be delayed as often happened for several hours he would go down to the wharf and inquire in the meantime let the devil seize the fog might the holy st bartholomew damn for ever the cowardly dog of a captain and the coyote crew who would refuse to go he came sharply enough down commercial street and then when opposite the arcade saloon with the instinct that leads desperate men into desperate places he entered and glared vindictively around him the immense room bright with lights and glittering with gilding and mirrors seemed quiet and grave in contrast with the busy thoroughfare without it was still too early for the usual habitués of the place only a few of the long gambling tables were occupied there was only a single monte bank open and to this ramirez bent his steps with the peculiar predilections of his race it so chanced that mr jack hamlin was temporarily in charge of the interests of this bank and was dealing in a listless perfunctory manner it may be parenthetically remarked that his own game was faro his present position was one of pure friendliness to the absent dealer who was taking his dinner above stairs ramirez flung a piece of gold on the table and lost again he attempted fortune and lost he lost the third time then his pentup feelings found vent in the characteristic carámba mr jack hamlin looked up it was not the oath it was not the expression of illhumour both of which were common enough in mr hamlins experience but a certain distinguishing quality in the voice which awoke jacks peculiarly retentive memory he looked up and to borrow his own dialect at once spotted the owner of the voice he made no outward sign of his recognition but quietly pursued the game in the next deal mr ramirez won mr hamlin quietly extended his croupe and raked down mr ramirezs money with the losers  as mr hamlin doubtless had fully expected mr ramirez rose with a passionate scream of rage whereat mr hamlin coolly pushed back mr ramirezs stake and winnings without looking up leaving it upon the table ramirez leaped to the gamblers side  you would insult me so you would cheeat eh you would take my money so he said hoarsely gesticulating passionately with one hand while with the other he grasped as wildly in his breast  mr jack hamlin turned a pair of dark eyes on the speaker and said quietly sit down johnny  with the pentup passion of the last few hours boiling in his blood with the murderous intent of the morning still darkling in his mind with the passionate sense of a new insult stinging him to madness mr ramirez should have struck the gambler to the earth possibly that was his intention as he crossed to his side possibly that was his conviction as he heard himselfhevictor ramirez whose presence in two days should strike terror to two hearts in one horse gulchaddressed as johnny but he looked into the eyes of mr hamlin and hesitated what he saw there i cannot say they were handsome eyes clear and well opened and had been considered by several members of a fond and confiding sex as peculiarly arch and tender but it must be confessed mr ramirez returned to his seat without doing anything  ye dont know that man said mr hamlin to the two players nearest him in a tone of the deepest confidence which was however singularly enough to be heard distinctly by every one at the table including ramirez you dont know him but i do hes a desprit character continued mr hamlin glancing at him and quietly shuffling the cards a very desprit character make your game gentlemen keeps a cattle ranch in sonoma and a private graveyard whar he buries his own dead they call him the yaller hawk of sonoma hes outer sorts jest now probably jest killed some one up thar and smells blood mr ramirez smiled a ghastly smile and affected to examine the game minutely and critically as mr hamlin paused to rake in the gold hes artfulis johnny continued mr hamlin in the interval of shuffling artful and sly partikerly when hes after blood see him sittin thar and smilin he doesnt want to interrupt the game he knows gentlemen thet in five minutes from now jim will be back here and ill be free thets what hes waitin for thets whats the matter with the yaller slaughterer of sonoma got his knife ready in his breast too done up in brown paper to keep it clean hes mighty pertikler bout his weppins is johnny hez a knife for every new man ramirez rose with an attempt at jocularity and pocketed his gains mr hamlin affected not to notice him until he was about to leave the table hes goin to wait for me outside he exclaimed in five minutes johnny he called to ramirezs retreating figure if you cant wait ill expect to see you at the marysville hotel next week room no 95 the next room johnny the next room  the mr ramirez who reached the busy thoroughfare again was so different from the mr ramirez who twenty minutes before had entered the arcade that his identity might have easily been doubted he did not even breathe in the same way his cheek although haggard had resumed its colour his eyes which hitherto had been fixed and contemplative had returned to their usual restless vivacity with the exception that at first he walked quickly on leaving the saloon and once or twice hurriedly turned to see if anybody were following him his manner was totally changed and this without effusion of blood or the indulgence of an insatiable desire for revenge as i prefer to deal with mr ramirez without affecting to know any more of that gentleman than he did himself i am unable to explain any more clearly than he did to himself the reason for this change in his manner or the utter subjection of his murderous passion when it is remembered that for several hours he had had unlimited indulgence without opposition in his own instincts but that for the last twenty minutes he had some reason to doubt their omnipotence perhaps some explanation may be adduced i only know that by halfpast six mr ramirez had settled in his mind that physical punishment of his enemies was not the most efficacious means of revenge and that at halfpast seven he had concluded not to take the sacramento boat and yet for the previous six hours i have reason to believe that mr ramirez was as sincere a murderer as ever suffered the penalty of his act or to whom circumstances had not offered a mr hamlin to at upon a constitutional cowardice  mr ramirez proceeded leisurely down montgomery street until he came to pacific street at the corner of the street his way was for a moment stopped by a rattling team and waggon that dashed off through the fog in the direction of the wharf mr ramirez recognised the express and mail for the sacramento boat but mr ramirez did not know that the express contained a letter which ran as follows       dear madamyours of the 10th received and contents noted      am willing to make our services contingent upon your success      we believe your present course will be quite as satisfactory as      the plan you first proposed would advise you not to give a      personal interview to mr ramirez but refer him to mr gabriel      conroy mr ramirezs manner is such as to lead us to suppose      that he might offer violence unless withheld by the presence      of a third partyyours respectfully       peter dumphy     chapter ii  a cloud of witnesses   the street into which ramirez plunged at first sight appeared almost impassable and but for a certain regularity in the parallels of irregular oddlybuilt houses its original intention as a thoroughfare might have been open to grave doubt it was dirty it was muddy it was illlighted it was rocky and precipitous in some places and sandy and monotonous in others the grade had been changed two or three times and each time apparently for the worse but always with a noble disregard for the dwellings which were invariably treated as an accident in the original design or as obstacles to be overcome at any hazard the near result of this large intent was to isolate some houses completely to render others utterly inaccessible except by scaling ladders and to produce the general impression that they were begun at the top and built down the remoter effect was to place the locality under a social ban and work a kind of outlawry among the inhabitants several of the houses were originally occupied by the spanish native californians who with the conservative instincts of their race still clung to their casas after the americans had flown to pastures new and less rocky and inaccessible beyond their vacant places were again filled by other native californians through that social law which draws the members of an inferior and politically degraded race into gregarious solitude and isolation and the locality became known as the spanish quarter that they lived in houses utterly inconsistent with their habits and tastes that they affected a locality utterly foreign to their inclinations or customs was not the least pathetic and grotesque element to a contemplative observer  before or rather beneath one of these structures mr ramirez stopped and began the ascent of a long flight of wooden steps that at last brought him to the foundations of the dwelling another equally long exterior staircase brought him at last to the verandah or gallery of the second story the first being partly hidden by an embankment here mr ramirez discovered another flight of narrower steps leading down to a platform before the front door it was open in the hallway two or three darkfaced men were lounging smoking cigaritos and enjoying in spite of the fog the apparently unsociable négligé of shirt sleeves and no collars at the open front windows of the parlour two or three women were sitting clad in the lightest and whitest of flounced muslin skirts with heavy shawls over their heads and shoulders as if summer had stopped at their waists like an equator  the house was feebly lighted or rather the gloom of yellowishbrowned walls and dark furniture from which all lustre and polish had been smoked made it seem darker nearly every room and all the piazzas were dim with the yellow haze of burning cigaritos there were light brown stains on the shirt sleeves of the men there were yellowish streaks on the otherwise spotless skirts of the women every masculine and feminine forefinger and thumb was steeped to its first joint with yellow the fumes of burnt paper and tobacco permeated the whole house like some religious incense through which occasionally struggled an inspiration of red peppers and garlic  two or three of the loungers addressed ramirez in terms of grave recognition one of the womenthe stoutestappeared at the doorway holding her shawl tightly over her shoulders with one hand as if to conceal a dangerous dishabille above the waist and playfully shaking a black fan at the young man with the other hand applied to him the various epithets of ingrate traitor and judas with great vivacity and volubility then she faced him coquettishly and after so long whence now thou little blackguard  it is of business my heart and soul exclaimed ramirez with hasty and somewhat perfunctory gallantry who is abovethose who testify  and don pedro  he is there and the señor perkins  good i will go on after a little he nodded apologetically as he hastily ascended the staircase on the first landing above he paused turned doubtfully toward the nearest door and knocked hesitatingly there was no response ramirez knocked again more sharply and decidedly this resulted in a quick rattling of the lock the sudden opening of the door and the abrupt appearance of a man in ragged alpaca coat and frayed trousers he stared fiercely at ramirez said in english what in h next door and as abruptly slammed the door in ramirezs face ramirez entered hastily the room indicated by the savage stranger and was at once greeted by a dense cloud of smoke and the sound of welcoming voices  around a long table covered with quaintlooking legal papers maps and parchments a halfdozen men were seated the greater number were past the middle age darkfeatured and grizzlehaired and one whose wrinkled face was the colour and texture of redwood bark was bowed with decrepitude  he had one hundred and two years day before yesterday he is the principal witness to micheltorrenas signature in the castro claim exclaimed don pedro  is he able to remember asked ramirez  who knows said don pedro shrugging his shoulder he will swear it is enough  what animal have we in the next room asked ramirez is it wolf or bear  the señor perkins said don pedro  why is he  he translates  here ramirez related with some vehemence how he mistook the room and the strangers brusque salutation the company listened attentively and even respectfully an american audience would have laughed the present company did not alter their serious demeanour a breach of politeness to a stranger was a matter of grave importance even to these doubtful characters don pedro explained  ah so it is believed that god has visited him here he tapped his forehead he is not of their country fashion at all he has punctuality he has secrecy he has the habitude when strikes the clock three he is here when it strikes nine he is gone six hours to work in that room ah heavens the quantity of workit is astounding folios volumes good it is done punctually at nine of the night he takes up a paper left on his desk by his padrone in which is enwrapped ten dollarsthe golden eagle and he departs for that day they tell to me that five dollars is gone at the gambling table but no more then five dollars for subsistencealways the same always always he is a scholarso profound so admirable he has the spanish the french perfect he is worth his weight in gold to the lawyersyou understandbut they cannot use him to them he saysi translate lies or what not who knows i care notbut no more he is wonderful  the allusion to the gamingtable revived victors recollection and his intention in his present visit thou hast told me don pedro he said lowering his voice in confidence how much is fashioned the testimony of the witnesses in regard of the old land grants by the governors and alcaldes good is it so  don pedro glanced around the room of those that are here tonight five will swear as they are prepared by meyou comprehendand there is a governor a military secretary an alcalde a comandante and saints preserve us an archbishop they are respectable caballeros but they have been robbed you comprehend by the americanos what matters they have been taught a lesson they will get the best price for their memory eh they will sell it where it pays best believe me victor it is so  good said victor listen if there was a mana brigand a devilan americanwho had extorted from pico a grantyou comprehenda grant formal and regular and recordedaccepted of the land commissionand some one eheven myself should say to you it is all wrong my friend my brotherah  from pico asked don pedro  si from pico in 47 responded victora grant  don pedro rose opened a secretary in the corner and took out some badlyprinted yellowish blanks with a seal in the right hand lower corner  custom house paper from monterey explained don pedro blank with governor picos signature and rubric comprehendest thou victor my friend a second grant is simple enough  victors eyes sparkled  but two for the same land my brother  don pedro shrugged his shoulders and rolled a fresh cigarito  there are two for nearly every grant of his late excellency art thou certain my brave friend there are not three to this of which thou speakest if there be but oneholy mother it is nothing surely the land has no value where is this modest property how many leagues square come we will retire in this room and thou mayest talk undisturbed there is excellent aguardiente too my victor come and don pedro rose conducted victor into a smaller apartment and closed the door  nearly an hour elapsed during that interval the sound of victors voice raised in passionate recital might have been heard by the occupants of the larger room but that they were completely involved in their own smoky atmosphere and were perhaps politely oblivious of the strangers business they chatted compared notes and examined legal documents with the excited and pleased curiosity of men to whom business and the present importance of its results was a novelty at a few minutes before nine don pedro reappeared with victor i grieve to say that either from the reaction of the intense excitement of the morning from the active sympathy of his friend or from the equally soothing anodyne of aguardiente he was somewhat incoherent interjectional and effusive the effect of excessive stimulation on passionate natures like victors is to render them either maudlin or affectionate mr ramirez was both he demanded with tears in his eyes to be led to the ladies he would seek in the company of manuela the stout female before introduced to the reader that sympathy which an injured deceived and confiding nature like his own so deeply craved  on the staircase he ran against a stranger precise dignified accurately clothed and fittedthe señor perkins just released from his slavery a very different person from the one accidentally disclosed to him an hour before on his probable way to the gaming table and his habitual enjoyment on the evening of the day in his maudlin condition victor would have fain exchanged views with him in regard to the general deceitfulness of the fair and the misfortunes that attend a sincere passion but don pedro hurried him below into the parlour and out of the reach of the serenely contemptuous observation of the señor perkinss eye once in the parlour and in the presence of the coquettish manuela who was still closely shawled as if yet uncertain and doubtful in regard to the propriety of her garments above the waist victor after a few vague remarks upon the general inability of the sex to understand a nature so profoundly deep and so wildly passionate as his own eventually succumbed in a large black haircloth armchair and became helplessly and hopelessly comatose  we must find a bed here for him tonight said the sympathising but practical manuela he is not fit poor imbecile to be sent to his hotel mother of god what is this  in lifting him out of the chair into which he had subsided with a fatal tendency to slide to the floor unless held by main force something had fallen from his breast pocket and manuela had picked it up it was the bowieknife he had purchased that morning  ah said manuela desperate little brigand he has been among the americanos look my uncle  don pedro took the weapon quietly from the brown hands of manuela and examined it coolly  it is new my niece he responded with a slight shrug of his shoulders the gloss is still upon its blade we will take him to bed     chapter iii  the charming mrs sepulvida   if there was a spot on earth of which the usual dead monotony of the california seasons seemed a perfectly consistent and natural expression that spot was the ancient and timehonoured pueblo and mission of the blessed st anthony the changeless cloudless expressionless skies of summer seemed to symbolise that aristocratic conservatism which repelled all innovation and was its distinguishing mark the stranger who rode into the pueblo in his own conveyancefor the instincts of san antonio refused to sanction the introduction of a stagecoach or diligence that might bring into the town irresponsible and vagabond travellersread in the faces of the idle lounging peons the fact that the great rancheros who occupied the outlying grants had refused to sell their lands long before he entered the one short walled street and open plaza and found that he was in a town where there was no hotel or tavern and that he was dependent entirely upon the hospitality of some courteous resident for a meal or a nights lodging  as he drew rein in the courtyard of the first large adobe dwelling and received the grave welcome of a strange but kindly face he saw around him everywhere the past unchanged the sun shone as brightly and fiercely on the long red tiles of the low roofs that looked as if they had been thatched with longitudinal slips of cinnamon even as it had shone for the last hundred years the gaunt wolflike dogs ran out and barked at him as their fathers and mothers had barked at the preceding stranger of twenty years before there were the few wild halfbroken mustangs tethered by strong riatas before the verandah of the long low fonda with the sunlight glittering on their silver trappings there were the broad blank expanses of whitewashed adobe walls as barren and guiltless of record as the uneventful days as monotonous and expressionless as the staring sky above there were the white domeshaped towers of the mission rising above the green of olives and peartrees twisted gnarled and knotted with the rheumatism of age there was the unchanged strip of narrow white beach and beyond the seavast illimitable and always the same the steamers that crept slowly up the darkening coast line were something remote unreal and phantasmal since the philippine galleon had left its bleached and broken ribs in the sand in 1640 no vessel had in the memory of man dropped anchor in the open roadstead below the curving point of pines and the white walls and dismounted bronze cannon of the presidio that looked blankly and hopelessly seaward  for all this the pueblo of san antonio was the cynosure of the covetous american eye its vast leagues of fertile soil its countless herds of cattle the semitropical luxuriance of its vegetation the salubrity of its climate and the existence of miraculous mineral springs were at once a temptation and an exasperation to greedy speculators of san francisco happily for san antonio its square leagues were held by only a few of the wealthiest native gentry the ranchos of the bear of the holy fisherman of the blessed trinity comprised all of the outlying lands and their titles were patented and secured to their native owners in the earlier days of the american occupation while their comparative remoteness from the populous centres had protected them from the advances of foreign cupidity but one american had ever entered upon the possession and enjoyment of this californian arcadia and that was the widow of don josé sepulvida eighteen months ago the excellent sepulvida had died at the age of eightyfour and left his charming young american wife the sole mistress of his vast estate attractive of a pleasant social temperament that the donna maria should eventually bestow her hand and the estate upon some loser americano who would bring ruin in the hollow disguise of improvements to the established and conservative life of san antonio was an event to be expected feared and if possible estopped by fasting and prayer  when the donna maria returned from a months visit to san francisco after her years widowhood alone and to all appearances as yet unattached it is said that a te deum was sung at the mission church the possible defection of the widow became still more important to san antonio when it was remembered that the largest estate in the valley the rancho of the holy trinity was held by another member of this deceitful sexthe alleged natural halfbreed daughter of a deceased governorbut happily preserved from the possible fate of the widow by religious preoccupation and the habits of a recluse that the irony of providence should leave the fate and future of san antonio so largely dependent upon the results of levity and the caprice of a susceptible sex gave a sombre tinge to the gossip of the little puebloif the grave decorous discussion of señores and señoras could deserve that name nevertheless it was believed by the more devout that a miraculous interposition would eventually save san antonio from the americanos and destruction and it was alleged that the patron saint himself accomplished in the art of resisting a peculiar form of temptation would not scruple to oppose personally any undue weakness of vanity or the flesh in helpless widowhood yet even the most devout and trustful believers as they slyly slipped aside veil or manta to peep furtively at the donna maria entering chapel in the heathenish abominations of a parisian dress and bonnet and a face rosy with selfconsciousness and innocent satisfaction felt their hearts sink within them and turned their eyes in mute supplication to the gaunt austere patron saint pictured on the chancel wall above them who clutching a skull and crucifix as if for support seemed to glare upon the pretty stranger with some trepidation and a possible doubt of his being able to resist the newer temptation  as far as was consistent with spanish courtesy the donna maria was subject to a certain mild espionage it was even hinted by some of the more conservative that a duenna was absolutely essential to the proper decorum of a lady representing such large social interests as the widow sepulvida although certain husbands who had already suffered from the imperfect protection of this safeguard offered some objection but the pretty widow when this proposition was gravely offered by her ghostly confessor only shook her head and laughed a husband is the best duenna father felipe she said archly and the conversation ended  perhaps it was as well that the gossips of san antonio did not know how imminent was their danger or how closely imperilled were the vast social interests of the pueblo on the 3rd day of june 1854  it was a bright clear morningso clear that the distant peaks of the san bruno mountains seemed to have encroached upon the san antonio valley overnightso clear that the horizon line of the vast pacific seemed to take in half the globe beyond it was a morning cold hard and material as granite yet with a certain mica sparkle in its qualitya morning full of practical animal life in which bodily exercise was absolutely essential to its perfect understanding and enjoyment it was scarcely to be wondered that the donna maria sepulvida who was returning from a visit to her steward and majordomo attended by a single vaquero should have thrown the reins forward on the neck of her yellow mare tita and dashed at a wild gallop down the white strip of beach that curved from the garden wall of the mission to the point of pines a league beyond concho the venerable vaquero after vainly endeavouring to keep pace with his mistresss fiery steed and still more capricious fancy shrugged his shoulders and subsided into a trot and was soon lost among the shifting sand dunes completely carried away by the exhilarating air and intoxication of the exercise the donna mariawith her brown hair shaken loose from the confinement of her little velvet hat the whole of a pretty foot and at times i fear part of a symmetrical ankle visible below the flying folds of her grey ridingskirt flecked here and there with the racing spume of those homeric seasat last reached the point of pines which defined the limits of the peninsula  but when the gentle mistress sepulvida was within a hundred yards of the point she expected to round she saw with some chagrin that the tide was up and that each dash of the breaking seas sent a thin reaching film of shining water up to the very roots of the pines to her still further discomfiture she saw also that a smartlooking cavalier had likewise reined in his horse on the other side of the point and was evidently watching her movements with great interest and as she feared with some amusement to go back would be to be followed by this stranger and to meet the cynical but respectful observation of concho to go forward at the worst could only be a slight wetting and a canter beyond the reach of observation of the stranger who could not in decency turn back after her all this donna maria saw with the swiftness of feminine intuition and without apparently any hesitation in her face of her intent dashed into the surf below the point  alas for feminine logic mistress sepulvidas reasoning was perfect but her premises were wrong titas first dash was a brave one and carried her half round the point the next was a simple flounder the next struggle sunk her to her knees the next to her haunches she was in a quicksand  let the horse go dont struggle take the end of your riata throw yourself flat on the next wave and let it take you out to sea  donna maria mechanically loosed the coil of hair rope which hung over the pommel of her saddle then she looked around in the direction of the voice but she saw only a riderless horse moving slowly along the point  quick now then the voice was seaward now where to her frightened fancy some one appeared to be swimming donna maria hesitated no longer with the recoil of the next wave she threw herself forward and was carried floating a few yards and dropped again on the treacherous sand  dont move but keep your grip on the riata  the next wave would have carried her back but she began to comprehend and assisted by the yielding sand held her own and her breath until the undertow sucked her a few yards seaward the sand was firmer now she floated a few yards farther when her arm was seized she was conscious of being impelled swiftly through the water of being dragged out of the surge of all her back hair coming down that she had left her boots behind her in the quicksand that her rescuer was a stranger and a young manand then she fainted  when she opened her brown eyes again she was lying on the dry sand beyond the point and the young man was on the beach below her holding both the horseshis own and tita  i took the opportunity of getting your horse out relieved of your weight and loosened by the tide he got his foot over the riata and charley and i pulled him out if i am not mistaken this is mrs sepulvida  donna maria assented in surprise  and i imagine this is your man coming to look for you he pointed to concho who was slowly making his way among the sand dunes towards the point let me assist you on your horse again he need not knownobody need knowthe extent of your disaster  donna maria still bewildered permitted herself to be assisted to her saddle again despite the consequent terrible revelation of her shoeless feet then she became conscious that she had not thanked her deliverer and proceeded to do so with such embarrassment that the strangers laughing interruption was a positive relief  you would thank me better if you were to set off in a swinging gallop over those sunbaked ovenlike sandhills and so stave off a chill for the rest i am mr poinsett one of your late husbands legal advisers here on business that will most likely bring us togetheri trust much more pleasantly to you than this good morning  he had already mounted his horse and was lifting his hat donna maria was not a very clever woman but she was bright enough to see that his business brusquerie was either the concealment of a man shy of women or the impertinence of one too familiar with them in either case it was to be resented  how did she do it ah me she took the most favourable hypothesis she pouted i regret to say then she said  it was all your fault  how  why if you hadnt stood there looking at me and criticising i shouldnt have tried to go round  with this parthian arrow she dashed off leaving her rescuer halting between a bow and a smile     chapter iv  father felipe   when arthur poinsett after an hours rapid riding over the scorching sandhills finally drew up at the door of the mission refectory he had so far profited by his own advice to donna maria as to be quite dry and to exhibit very little external trace of his late adventure it is more remarkable perhaps that there was very little internal evidence either no one who did not know the peculiar selfsufficiency of poinsetts individuality would be able to understand the singular mental and moral adjustment of a man keenly alive to all new and present impressions and yet able to dismiss them entirely without a sense of responsibility or inconsistency that poinsett thought twice of the woman he had rescuedthat he ever reflected again on the possibilities or natural logic of his actduring his ride no one who thoroughly knew him would believe when he first saw mrs sepulvida at the point of pines he was considering the possible evils or advantages of a change in the conservative element of san antonio when he left her he returned to the subject again and it fully occupied his thoughts until father felipe stood before him in the door of the refectory i do not mean to say that he at all ignored a certain sense of selfgratulation in the act but i wish to convey the idea that all other considerations were subordinate to this sense and possibly also the feeling unexpressed however by any look or manner that if he was satisfied everybody else ought to be  if donna maria had thought his general address a little too irreverent she would have been surprised at his greeting with father felipe his whole manner was changed to one of courteous and even reverential consideration of a boyish faith and trustfulness of perfect confidence and selfforgetfulness and moreover was perfectly sincere she would have been more surprised to have noted that the object of arthurs earnestness was an old man and that beyond a certain gentle and courteous manner and refined bearing he was unpicturesque and oddfashioned in dress snuffy in the sleeves and possessed and inhabited a pair of shoes so large shapeless and inconsistent with the usual requirements of that article as to be grotesque  it was evident that arthurs manner had previously predisposed the old man in his favour he held out two soft brown hands to the young man addressed him with a pleasant smile as my son and welcomed him to the mission  and why not this visit before asked father felipe when they were seated upon the little verandah that overlooked the mission garden before their chocolate and cigaritos  i did not know i was coming until the day before yesterday it seems that some new grants of the old exgovernors have been discovered and that a patent is to be applied for my partners being busy i was deputed to come here and look up the matter to tell the truth i was glad of an excuse to see our fair client or at least be disappointed as my partners have been in obtaining a glimpse of the mysterious donna dolores  ah my dear don arturo said the padre with a slightly deprecatory movement of his brown hands i fear you will be no more fortunate than others it is a penitential week with the poor child and at such times she refuses to see any one even on business believe me my dear boy you like the othersmore than the otherspermit your imagination to run away with your judgment donna dolores concealment of her face is not to heighten or tempt the masculine curiosity but alaspoor childis only to hide the heathenish tattooings that deface her cheek you know she is a halfbreed believe me you are all wrong it is foolish perhapsvanitywho knows but she is a womanwhat would you continued the sagacious padre emphasising the substantive with a slight shrug worthy of his patron saint  but they say for all that she is very beautiful continued arthur with that mischievousness which was his habitual method of entertaining the earnestness of others and which he could not entirely forego even with the padre  so so don arturoit is idle gossip said father felipe impatientlya brown indian girl with a cheek as tawny as the summer fields  arthur made a grimace that might have been either of assent or deprecation  well i suppose this means that i am to look over the papers with you alone bueno have them out and let us get over this business as soon as possible  poco tiempo said father felipe with a smile then more gravely but what is this you do not seem to have that interest in your profession that one might expect of the rising young advocatethe junior partner of the great firm you represent your heart is not in your workeh  arthur laughed  why not it is as good as any  but to right the oppressed to do justice to the unjustly accused eh to redress wrongsah my son that is noble that don arturoit is that has made you and your colleagues dear to medear to those who have been the helpless victims of your courtsyour corregidores  yes yes interrupted arthur hastily shedding the fathers praise with an habitual deft ease that was not so much the result of modesty as a certain conscious pride that resented any imperfect tribute yes i suppose it pays as well if not better in the long run honesty is the best policy as our earliest philosophers say  pardon queried the padre  arthur intensely amused made a purposely severe and literal translation of franklins famous apothegm and then watched father felipe raise his eyes and hands to the ceiling in pious protest and mute consternation  and these are your american ethics he said at last  they are and in conjunction with manifest destiny and the star of empire they have brought us here andhave given me the honour of your acquaintance said arthur in english  father felipe looked at his friend in hopeless bewilderment arthur instantly became respectful and spanish to change the subject and relieve the old mans evident embarrassment he at once plunged into a humorous description of his adventure of the morning the diversion was only partially successful father felipe became at once interested but did not laugh when the young man had concluded he approached him and laying his soft hand on arthurs curls turned his face upward toward him with a parental gesture that was at once habitual and professional and said  look at me here i am an old man don arturo pardon me if i think i have some advice to give you that may be worthy your hearing listen then you are one of those men capable of peculiarly affecting and being affected by women so pardon he continued gently as a slight flush rose into arthurs cheek despite the smile that came as quickly to his face is it not so be not ashamed don arturo it is not here he added with a poetical gesture toward the wall of the refectory where hung the painted effigy of the blessed st anthony it is not here that i would undervalue or speak lightly of their influence the widow is rich ehhandsome eh impulsive you have no heart in the profession you have chosen what then you have some in the instinctswhat shall i saythe accomplishments and graces you have not considered worthy of a practical end you are a natural lover pardon you have the four sssáno solo solicito y secreto good take an old mans advice and make good use of them turn your weaknesseseh perhaps it is too strong a wordthe frivolities and vanities of your youth into a power for your old age eh  arthur smiled a superior smile he was thinking of the horror with which the old man had received the axiom he had recently quoted he threw himself back in his chair in an attitude of burlesque sentiment and said with simulated heroics  but what o my father what if a devoted exhausting passion for somebody else already filled my heart you would not advise me to be false to that perish the thought  father felipe did not smile a peculiar expression passed over his broad brown smoothly shaven face and the habitual look of childlike simplicity and deferential courtesy faded from it he turned his small black eyes on arthur and said  do you think you are capable of such a passion my son have you had an attachment that was superior to novelty or selfinterest  arthur rose a little stiffly  as we are talking of one of my clients and one of your parishioners are we not getting a little too serious father at all events save me from assuming a bashful attitude towards the lady with whom i am to have a business interview tomorrow and now about the papers father continued arthur recovering his former ease i suppose the invisible fair one has supplied you with all the necessary documents and the fullest material for a brief go on i am all attention  you are wrong again son said father felipe it is a matter in which she has shown even more than her usual disinclination to talk i believe but for my interference she would have even refused to press the claim as it is i imagine she wishes to make some compromise with the thiefpardon methe what do you say eh the preemptor but i have nothing to do with it all the papers all the facts are in the possession of your friend mrs sepulvida you are to see her believe me my friend if you have been disappointed in not finding your indian client you will have a charming substituteand one of your own race and colourin the donna maria forget if you can what i have saidbut you will not ah don arturo i know you better than yourself come let us walk in the garden you have not seen the vines i have a new variety of grape since you were here before  i find nothing better than the old mission grape father said arthur as they passed down the branching avenue of olives  ah yet the aborigines knew it not and only valued it when found wild for the colouring matter contained in its skin from this with some mordant that still remains a secret with them they made a dye to stain their bodies and heighten their copper hue you are not listening don arturo yet it should interest you for it is the colour of your mysterious client the donna dolores  thus chatting and pointing out the various objects that might interest arthur from the overflowing boughs of a venerable fig tree to the crack made in the adobe wall of the church by the last earthquake father felipe with characteristic courteous formality led his young friend through the ancient garden of the mission by degrees the former ease and mutual confidence of the two friends returned and by the time that father felipe excused himself for a few moments to attend to certain domestic arrangements on behalf of his new guest perfect sympathy had been restored  left to himself arthur strolled back until opposite the open chancel door of the church here he paused and in obedience to a sudden impulse entered the old church was unchangedlike all things in san antoniosince the last hundred years perhaps there was little about it that arthur had not seen at the other missions there were the old rafters painted in barbaric splendour of red and brown stripes there were the hideous waxen glasseyed saints leaning forward helplessly and rigidly from their niches there was the virgin mary in a white dress and satin slippers carrying the infant saviour in the opulence of lace longclothes there was the magdalen in the fashionable costume of a spanish lady of the last century there was the usual quantity of bad pictures the portrait full length of the patron saint himself so hideously and gratuitously old and ugly that his temptation by any selfrespecting woman appeared more miraculous than his resistance the usual martyrdoms in terrible realism the usual last judgments in frightful accuracy of detail  but there was one picture under the nave which attracted arthurs listless eyes it was a fanciful representation of junipero serra preaching to the heathen i am afraid that it was not the figure of that most admirable and heroic missionary which drew arthurs gaze i am quite certain that it was not the moral sentiment of the subject but rather the slim graceful girlish halfnude figure of one of the indian converts who knelt at father junipero serras feet in childlike but touching awe and contrition there was such a depth of penitential supplication in the young girls eyesa penitence so pathetically inconsistent with the absolute virgin innocence and helplessness of the exquisite little figure that arthur felt his heart beat quickly as he gazed he turned quickly to the other picturelook where he would the eyes of the little acolyte seemed to follow and subdue him  i think i have already intimated that his was not a reverential nature with a quick imagination and great poetic sensibility nevertheless the evident intent of the picture or even the sentiment of the place did not touch his heart or brain but he still halfunconsciously dropped into a seat and leaning both arms over the screen before him bowed his head against the oaken panel a soft hand laid upon his shoulder suddenly aroused him  he looked up sharply and met the eyes of the padre looking down on him with a tenderness that both touched and exasperated him  pardon said padre felipe gently i have broken in upon your thoughts child  a little more brusquely than was his habit with the padre arthur explained that he had been studying up a difficult case  so said the padre softly in response with tears in your eyes don arturo not so he added to himself as he drew the young mans arm in his own and the two passed slowly out once more into the sunlight     chapter v  in which the donna maria makes an impression   the rancho of the blessed fisherman looked seaward as became its title if the founder of the rancho had shown a religious taste in the selection of the site of the dwelling his charming widow had certainly shown equal practical taste and indeed a profitable availing of some advantages that the founder did not contemplate in the adornment of the house the lowwalled square adobe dwelling had been relieved of much of its hard practical outline by several feminine additions and suggestions the tiled roof had been carried over a very broad verandah supported by vineclad columns and the lounging corridor had been in defiance of all spanish custom transferred from the inside of the house to the outside the interior courtyard no longer existed the sombreness of the heavy mexican architecture was relieved by bright french chintzes delicate lace curtains and freshcoloured hangings the broad verandah was filled with the latest novelties of chinese bamboo chairs and settees and a striped venetian awning shaded the glare of the seaward front nevertheless donna maria out of respect to the local opinion which regarded these changes as ominous of if not a symbolical putting off the weeds of widowhood still clung to a few of the local traditions it is true that a piano occupied one side of her drawingroom but a harp stood in the corner if a freshlycut novel lay open on the piano a breviary was conspicuous on the marble centretable if on the mantel an elaborate french clock with bronze shepherdesses trifled with time on the wall above it an iron crucifix spoke of eternity  mrs sepulvida was at home that morning expecting a guest she was lying in a manilla hammock swung between two posts of the verandah with her face partially hidden by the netting and the toe of a little shoe just peeping beyond not that donna maria expected to receive her guest thus on the contrary she had given orders to her servants that the moment a stranger caballero appeared on the road she was to be apprised of the fact for i grieve to say that far from taking arthurs advice the details of the adventure at the point of pines had been imparted by her own lips to most of her female friends and even to the domestics of her household in the earlier stages of a womans interest in a man she is apt to be exceedingly communicative it is only when she becomes fully aware of the gravity of the stake involved that she begins to hedge before the public the morning after her adventure donna maria was innocently full of its hero and unreservedly voluble  i have forgotten whether i have described her certainly i could not have a better opportunity than the present in the hammock she looked a little smaller as women are apt to when their length is rigidly defined she had the average quantity of brown hair a little badly treated by her habit of wearing it flat over her templesa tradition of her boardingschool days fifteen years ago she had soft brown eyes with a slight redness of the eyelid not inconsistent nor entirely unbecoming to widowhood a small mouth depressed at the corners with a charming childlike discontent white regular teeth and the eloquence of a complexion that followed unvaryingly the spirits of her physical condition she appeared to be about thirty and had that unmistakable married look which even the most amiable and considerate of us my dear sir are apt to impress upon the one woman whom we choose to elect to years of exclusive intimacy and attention the late don josé sepulvidas private markas well defined as the brand upon his cattlewas a certain rigid line like a grave accent from the angle of this little womans nostril to the corners of her mouth and possibly to an increased peevishness of depression at those corners it bore witness to the fondness of the deceased for bearbaiting and bullfighting and a possible weakness for a certain señora x of san francisco whose reputation was none of the best and was not increased by her distance from san antonio and the surveillance of donna maria  when an hour later pepe appeared to his mistress bearing a salver with arthur poinsetts business card and a formal request for an interview i am afraid donna maria was a little disappointed if he had suddenly scaled the verandah evaded her servants and appeared before her in an impulsive forgivable way it would have seemed consistent with his character as a hero and perhaps more in keeping with the general tenor of her reveries when the servitor entered howbeit after heaving an impatient little sigh and bidding pepe show the gentleman into the drawingroom she slipped quietly down from the hammock in a deft womanish way and whisked herself into her dressingroom  he couldnt have been more formal if don josé had been alive she said to herself as she walked to her glass and dressingtable  arthur poinsett entered the vacant drawingroom not in the best of his many humours he had read in the eyes of the lounging vaqueros in the covert glances of the women servants that the story of his adventure was known to the household habitually petted and spoiled as he had been by the women of his acquaintance he was half inclined to attribute this reference and assignment of his clients business to the hands of mrs sepulvida as the result of a plan of father felipes or absolute collusion between the parties a little sore yet and irritated by his recollection of the padres counsel and more impatient of the imputation of a weakness than anything else arthur had resolved to limit the interview to the practical business on hand and in so doing had for a moment i fear forgotten his native courtesy it did not tend to lessen his irritation and selfconsciousness when mrs sepulvida entered the room without the slightest evidence of her recent disappointment visible in her perfectly easy frank selfpossession and after a conventional half spanish solicitousness regarding his health since their last interview without any further allusions to their adventure begged him to be seated she herself took an easy chair on the opposite of the table and assumed at once an air of respectful but somewhat indifferent attention  i believe said arthur plunging at once into his subject to get rid of his embarrassment and the slight instinct of antagonism he was beginning to feel toward the woman before him i believethat is i am toldthat besides your own business you are intrusted with some documents and facts regarding a claim of the donna dolores salvatierra which shall we have first i am entirely at your service for the next two hours but we shall proceed faster and with less confusion by taking up one thing at a time  then let us begin with donna dolores by all means said donna maria my own affairs can wait indeed she added languidly i daresay one of your clerks could attend to it as well as yourself if your time is valuableas indeed it must bei can put the papers in his hands and make him listen to all my foolish irrelevant talk he can sift it for you don arturo i really am a child about business really  arthur smiled and made a slight gesture of deprecation in spite of his previous resolution donna marias tone of slight pique pleased him yet he gravely opened his notebook and took up his pencil without a word donna maria observed the movements and said more seriously  ah yes how foolish here i am talking about my own affairs when i should be speaking of donna dolores well to begin let me first explain why she has put this matter in my hands my husband and her father were friends and had many business interests in common as you have doubtless heard she has always been very quiet very reserved very religiousalmost a nun i daresay she was driven into this isolation by reason of the delicacy of her position here for you knowdo you notthat her mother was an indian it is only a few years ago that the old governor becoming a widower and childless bethought himself of this indian child dolores he found the mother dead and the girl living somewhere at a distant mission as an acolyte he brought her to san antonio had her christened and made legally his daughter and heiress she was a mere slip of a thing about fourteen or fifteen she might have had a pretty complexion for some of these halfbreeds are nearly white but she had been stained when an infant with some barbarous and indelible dye after the savage custom of her race she is now a light copper colour not unlike those bronze shepherdesses on yonder clock in spite of all this i call her pretty perhaps it is because i love her and am prejudiced but you gentlemen are so critical about complexion and colourno wonder that the poor child refuses to see anybody and never goes into society at all it is a shame butpardon mr poinsett here am i gossiping about your clients looks when i should be stating her grievances  no no said arthur hastily go onin your own way  mrs sepulvida lifted her forefinger archly  ah is it so don arturo i thought so well it is a great shame that she is not here for you to judge for yourself  angry with himself for his embarrassment and for the rising colour on his cheek arthur would have explained himself but the lady with feminine tact did not permit him  to proceed partly because i did not participate in the prejudices with which the old families here regarded her race and colour partly perhaps because we were both strangers here we became friends at first she resisted all my advancesindeed i think she was more shy of me than the others but i triumphed in time and we became good friends friends you understand mr poinsett not confidants you men i know deem this impossible but donna dolores is a singular girl and i have never except upon the most general topics won her from her habitual reserve and i possess perhaps her only friendship  except father felipe her confessor  mrs sepulvida shrugged her shoulders and then borrowed the habitual sceptical formula of san antonio  quien sabe but i am rambling again now for the case  she rose and taking from the drawer of the secretary an envelope drew out some papers it contained and referred to them as she went on  it appears that a grant of micheltorena to salvatierra was discovered recently at monterey a grant of which there was no record among salvatierras papers the explanation given is that it was placed some five years ago in trust with a don pedro ruiz of san francisco as security for a lease now expired the grant is apparently regular properly witnessed and attested don pedro has written that some of the witnesses are still alive and remember it  then why not make the proper application for a patent  true but if that were all don arturo would not have been summoned from san francisco for consultation there is something else don pedro writes that another grant for the same land has been discovered recorded to another party  that is i am sorry to say not a singular experience in our profession said arthur with a smile but salvatierras known reputation and probity would probably be sufficient to outweigh equal documentary evidence on the other side its unfortunate hes dead and the grant was discovered after his death  but the holder of the other grant is dead too said the widow  that makes it about equal again but who is he  mrs sepulvida referred to her papers and then said  dr devarges  who  devarges said mrs sepulvida referring to her notes a singular namea foreigner i suppose no really mr poinsett you shall not look at the paper until i have copied itits written horriblyyou cant understand it im really ashamed of my writing but i was in such a hurry expecting you every moment why la mr poinsett how cold your hands are  arthur poinsett had risen hurriedly and reached out almost brusquely for the paper that she held but the widow had coquettishly resisted him with a mischievous show of force and had caught anddropped his hand  and you are pale too dear me im afraid you took cold that morning said mrs sepulvida i should never forgive myself if you did i should cry my eyes out and donna maria cast a dangerous look from under her slightly swollen lids that looked as if they might threaten a deluge  nothing nothing i have ridden far this morning and rose early said arthur chafing his hands with a slightly embarrassed smile but i interrupted you pray go on has dr devarges any heirs to contest the grant  but the widow did not seem inclined to go on she was positive that arthur wanted some wine would he not let her order some slight repast before they proceeded further in this horrid business she was tired she was quite sure that arthur must be so too  it is my business said arthur a little stiffly but recovering himself again in a sudden and new alarm of the widow he smiled and suggested the sooner the business was over the sooner he would be able to partake of her hospitality  the widow beamed prospectively  there are no heirs that we can find but there is awhat do you call ita something or otherin possession  a squatter said poinsett shortly  yes continued the widow with a light laugh a squatter by the name ofofmy writing is so horridlet me see oh yes gabriel conroy  arthur made an involuntary gesture toward the paper with his hand but the widow mischievously skipped toward the window and luckily for the spectacle of his bloodless face held the paper before her dimpled face and laughing eyes as she did so  gabriel conroy repeated mrs sepulvida andandandhis  his sister said arthur with an effort  no sir responded mrs sepulvida with a slight pout his wife sister indeed as if we married women are always to be ignored by you legal gentlemen  arthur remained silent with his face turned toward the sea when he did speak his voice was quite natural  might i change my mind regarding your offer of a moment ago and take a glass of wine and a biscuit now  mrs sepulvida ran to the door  let me look over your notes while you are gone said arthur  you wont laugh at my writing  no  donna maria tossed him the envelope gaily and flew out of the room arthur hurried to the window with the coveted memoranda there were the names she had given himbut nothing more at least this was some slight relief  the suddenness of the shock rather than any moral sentiment or fear had upset him like most imaginative men he was a trifle superstitious and with the first mention of devargess name came a swift recollection of padre felipes analysis of his own character his sad ominous reverie in the chapel the trifling circumstance that brought him instead of his partner to san antonio and the remoter chance that had discovered the forgotten grant and selected him to prosecute its recovery this conviction entertained and forgotten all the resources of his combative nature returned of course he could not prosecute this claim of course he ought to prevent others from doing it there was every probability that the grant of devarges was a true oneand gabriel was in possession had he really become devargess heir and if so why had he not claimed the grant boldly and where was grace  in this last question there was a slight tinge of sentimental recollection but no remorse or shame that he might in some way be of service to her he fervently hoped that time having blotted out the romantic quality of their early acquaintance there would really be something fine and loyal in so doing he did not for a moment doubt he would suggest a compromise to his fair client himself seek out and confer with grace and gabriel and all should be made right his nervousness and his agitation was he was satisfied only the result of a conscientiousness and a delicately honourable nature perhaps too fine and spiritual for the exigencies of his profession of one thing he was convinced he really ought to carefully consider father felipes advice he ought to put himself beyond the reach of these romantic relapses  in this selfsustained selfsatisfied mood mrs sepulvida found him on her return since she had been gone he said he had been able to see his way quite clearly into this case and he had no doubt his perspicacity was greatly aided by the admirable manner in which she had indicated the various points on the paper she had given him he was now ready to take up her own matters only he begged as clear and concise a brief as she had already made for her friend he was so cheerful and gallant that by the time luncheon was announced the widow found him quite charming and was inclined to forgive him for the disappointment of the morning and when after luncheon he challenged her to a sharp canter with him along the beach by way as he said of keeping her memory from taking cold and to satisfy herself that the point of pines could be doubled without going out to sea i fear that without a prudent consideration of the gossips of san antonio before her eyes she assented there could be no harm in riding with her late husbands legal adviser who had called as everybody knew on business and whose time was so precious that he must return even before the business was concluded and then pepe could follow them to return with her  it did not of course occur to either arthur or donna maria that they might outrun pepe who was fat and indisposed to violent exertion nor that they should find other things to talk about than the details of business nor that the afternoon should be so marvellously beautiful as to cause them to frequently stop and admire the stretch of glittering sea beyond nor that the roar of the waves was so deafening as to oblige them to keep so near each other for the purposes of conversation that the widows soft breath was continually upon arthurs cheek nor that donna marias saddle girth should become so loose that she was forced to dismount while arthur tightened it and that he should be obliged to lift her in his arms to restore her to her seat again but finally when the point of pines was safely rounded and arthur was delivering a few parting words of legal counsel holding one of her hands in his while with the other he was untwisting a long tress of her blown down hair that after buffeting his cheek into colour had suddenly twined itself around his neck an oldfashioned family carriage drawn by four black mules with silver harness passed them suddenly on the road  donna maria drew her head and her hand away with a quick blush and laugh and then gaily kissed her fingertips to the retreating carriage arthur laughed alsobut a little foolishlyand looked as if expecting some explanation  you should have your wits about you sir did you know who that was  arthur sincerely confessed ignorance he had not noticed the carriage until it had passed  think what you have lost that was your fair young client  i did not even see her laughed arthur  but she saw you she never took her eyes off you adios     chapter vi  the lady of grief   you will not go today said father felipe to arthur as he entered the mission refectory early the next morning to breakfast  i shall be on the road in an hour father replied arthur gaily  but not toward san francisco said the padre listen your wish of yesterday has been attained you are to have your desired interview with the fair invisible do you comprehend donna dolores has sent for you  arthur looked up in surprise perhaps his face did not express as much pleasure as father felipe expected who lifted his eyes to the ceiling took a philosophical pinch of snuff and muttered  ah lo que es el mudonow that he has his wishit is nothing mother of god  this is your kindness father  god forbid returned padre felipe hastily believe me my son i know nothing when the donna left here before the angelus yesterday she said nothing of this perhaps it is the office of your friend mrs sepulvida  hardly i think said arthur she was so well prepared with all the facts as to render an interview with donna dolores unnecessary bueno be it so i will go  nevertheless he was ill at ease he ate little he was silent all the fears he had argued away with such selfsatisfied logic the day before returned to him again with greater anxiety could there have been any further facts regarding this inopportune grant that mrs sepulvida had not disclosed was there any particular reason why this strange recluse who had hitherto avoided his necessary professional presence should now desire a personal interview which was not apparently necessary could it be possible that communication had already been established with gabriel or grace and that the history of their previous life had become known to his client had his connexion with it been in any way revealed to the donna dolores  if he had been able to contemplate this last possibility with calmness and courage yesterday when mrs sepulvida first repeated the name of gabriel conroy was he capable of equal resignation now had anything occurred since thenhad any new resolution entered his head to which such a revelation would be fatal nonsense and yet he could not help commenting with more or less vague uneasiness of mind on his chance meeting of donna dolores at the point of pines yesterday and the summons of this morning would not his foolish attitude with donna maria aided perhaps by some indiscreet expression from the wellmeaning but senile padre felipe be sufficient to exasperate his fair client had she been cognizant of his first relations with grace it is not mean natures alone that are the most suspicious a quick generous imagination feverishly excited will project theories of character and intention far more ridiculous and uncomplimentary to humanity than the lowest surmises of ignorance and imbecility arthur was feverish and edited with all the instincts of a contradictory nature his easy sentimentalism dreaded while his combative principles longed for this interview within an hour of the time appointed by donna dolores he had thrown himself on his horse and was galloping furiously toward the rancho of the holy trinity  it was inland and three leagues away under the foothills but as he entered upon the level plain unrelieved by any watercourse and baked and cracked by the fierce sun into narrow gaping chasms and yawning fissures he unconsciously began to slacken pace nothing could be more dreary passionless and resigned than the vast sunlit yet joyless waste it seemed as if it might be some illimitable desolate sea beaten flat by the northwesterly gales that spent their impotent fury on its unopposing levels as far as the eye could reach its dead monotony was unbroken even the black cattle that in the clear distance seemed to crawl over its surface did not animate it rather by contrast brought into relief its fixed rigidity of outline neither wind sky nor sun wrought any change over its blank expressionless face it was the symbol of patiencea hopeless weary helpless patiencebut a patience that was eternal  he had ridden for nearly an hour when suddenly there seemed to spring up from the earth a mile away a dark line of wall terminating in an irregular broken outline against the sky his first impression was that it was the valda or a break of the stiff skirt of the mountain as it struck the level plain but he presently saw the dull red of tiled roofs over the dark adobe wall and as he dashed down into the dry bed of a vanished stream and up again on the opposite bank he passed the low walls of a corral until then unnoticed and a few crows in a rusty halfspanish halfclerical suit uttered a croaking welcome to the rancho of the holy trinity as they rose from the ground before him it was the first sound that for an hour had interrupted the monotonous jingle of his spurs or the hollow beat of his horses hoofs and then after the fashion of the country he rose slightly in his stirrups dashed his spurs into the sides of his mustang swung the long horsehair braided thong of his bridlerein and charged at headlong speed upon the dozen lounging apparently listless vaqueros who for the past hour had nevertheless been watching and waiting for him at the courtyard gate as he rode toward them they separated drew up each side of the gate doffed their glazed stiffbrimmed black sombreros wheeled put spurs to their horses and in another instant were scattered to the four winds when arthur leaped to the brick pavement of the courtyard there was not one in sight  an indian servant noiselessly led away his horse another peon as mutely led the way along a corridor over whose low railings serapes and saddle blankets were hung in a barbaric confusion of colouring and entered a barewalled anteroom where another indianold greyheaded with a face like a wrinkled tobacco leafwas seated on a low wooden settle in an attitude of patient expectancy to arthurs active fancy he seemed to have been sitting there since the establishment of the mission and to have grown grey in waiting for him as arthur entered he rose and with a few grave spanish courtesies ushered him into a larger and more elaborately furnished apartment and again retired with a bow familiar as arthur was with these various formalities at present they seemed to have an undue significance and he turned somewhat impatiently as a door opened at the other end of the apartment at the same moment a subtle strange perfumenot unlike some barbaric spice or odorous indian herbstole through the door and an old woman brownfaced murkyeyed and decrepit entered with a respectful curtsey  it is don arturo poinsett arthur bowed  the donna dolores has a little indisposition and claims your indulgence if she receives you in her own room  arthur bowed assent  bueno this way  she pointed to the open door arthur entered by a narrow passage cut through the thickness of the adobe wall into another room beyond and paused on the threshold  even the gradual change from the glaring sunshine of the courtyard to the heavy shadows of the two rooms he had passed through was not sufficient to accustom his eyes to the twilight of the apartment he now entered for several seconds he could not distinguish anything but a few dimly outlined objects by degrees he saw that there were a bed a priedieu and a sofa against the opposite wall the scant light of two windowsmere longitudinal slits in the deep wallsat first permitted him only this later he saw that the sofa was occupied by a halfreclining figure whose face was partly hidden by a fan and the white folds of whose skirt fell in graceful curves to the floor  you speak spanish don arturo said an exquisitely modulated voice from behind the fan in perfect castilian  arthur turned quickly toward the voice with an indescribable thrill of pleasure in his nerves  a little  he was usually rather proud of his spanish but for once the conventional polite disclaimer was quite sincere  be seated don arturo  he advanced to a chair indicated by the old woman within a few feet of the sofa and sat down at the same instant the reclining figure by a quick dexterous movement folded the large black fan that had partly hidden her features and turned her face toward him  arthurs heart leaped with a sudden throb and then as it seemed to him for a few seconds stopped beating the eyes that met his were large lustrous and singularly beautiful the features were small european and perfectly modelled the outline of the small face was a perfect oval but the complexion was of burnished copper yet even the next moment he found himself halting among a dozen comparisonsa golden sherry a faintly dyed meerschaum an autumn leaf the inner bark of the madroño of only one thing was he certainshe was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen  it is possible that the donna read this in his eyes for she opened her fan again quietly and raised it slowly before her face arthurs eager glance swept down the long curves of her graceful figure to the little foot in the white satin slipper below yet her quaint dress except for its colour might have been taken for a religious habit and had a hood or cape descending over her shoulders not unlike a nuns  you have surprise don arturo she said after a pause that i have sent for you after having before consulted you by proxy good but i have changed my mind since then i have concluded to take no steps for the present toward perfecting the grant  in an instant arthur was himself againand completely on his guard the donnas few words had recalled the past that he had been rapidly forgetting even the perfectly delicious cadence of the tones in which it was uttered had now no power to fascinate him or lull his nervous anxiety he felt a presentiment that the worst was coming he turned toward her outwardly calm but alert eager and watchful  have you any newly discovered evidence that makes the issue doubtful he asked  no said donna dolores  is there anythingany fact that mrs sepulvida has forgotten continued arthur here are i believe the points she gave me he added and with the habit of a welltrained intelligence he put before donna dolores in a few wellchosen words the substance of mrs sepulvidas story nor did his manner in the least betray a fact of which he was perpetually cognisantnamely that his fair client between the sticks of her fan was studying his face with more than feminine curiosity when he paused she said  bueno that is what i told her  is there anything moreperhaps  arthur folded his arms and looked attentive donna dolores began to go over the sticks of her fan one by one as if it were a rosary  i have become acquainted with some facts in this case which may not interest you as a lawyer don arturo but which affect me as a woman when i have told you them you will tell mewho knowsthat they do not alter the legal aspect of mymy fathers claim you will perhaps laugh at me for my resolution but i have given you so much trouble that it is only fair you should know it is not merely caprice that governs methat you should know why your visit here is a barren one why youthe great advocatehave been obliged to waste your valuable time with my poor friend donna maria for nothing  arthur was too much preoccupied to notice the peculiarly feminine significance with which the donna dwelt upon this latter sentencea fact that would not otherwise have escaped his keen observation he slightly stroked his brown moustache and looked out of the window with masculine patience  it is not caprice don arturo but i am a woman and on orphan you know my history the only friend i had has left me here alone the custodian of these vast estates listen to me don arturo and you will understand or at least forgive my foolish interest in the people who contest this claim for what has happened to them to her might have happened to me but for the blessed virgins mediation  to herwho is she asked arthur quietly  pardon i had forgotten you do not know listen you have heard that this grant is occupied by a man and his wifea certain gabriel conroy good you have heard that they have made no claim to a legal title to the land except through preemption good that is not true don arturo  arthur turned to her in undisguised surprise  this is new matter this is a legal point of some importance  who knows said donna dolores indifferently it is not in regard of that that i speak the claim is this the dr devarges who also possesses a grant for the same land made a gift of it to the sister of this gabriel do you comprehend she paused and fixed her eyes on arthur  perfectly said arthur with his gaze still fixed on the window it accounts for the presence of this gabriel on the land but is she living or if not is he her legally constituted heir that is the question andpardon me if i suggest againa purely legal and not a sentimental question was this woman who has disappearedthis sisterthis sole and only legateea married womanhad she a child because that is the heir  the silence that followed this question was so protracted that arthur turned towards donna dolores she had apparently made some sign to her aged waitingwoman who was bending over her between arthur and the sofa in a moment however the venerable handmaid withdrew leaving them alone  you are right don arturo continued donna dolores behind her fan you see that after all your advice is necessary and what i began as an explanation of my folly may be of business importance who knows it is good of you to recall me to that we women are foolish you are sagacious and prudent it was well that i saw you  arthur nodded assent and resumed his professional attitude of patient tolerationthat attitude which the world over has been at once the exasperation and awful admiration of the largely injured client  and the sister the real heiress is gonedisappeared no one knows where all trace of her is lost but now comes to the surface an impostor a woman who assumes the character and name of grace conroy the sister  one moment said arthur quietly how do you know that it is an impostor  howdoiknowit  yes what are the proofs  i am told so  oh said arthur relapsing into his professional attitude again  proofs repeated donna dolores hurriedly is it not enough that she has married this gabriel her brother  that is certainly strong moral proofand perhaps legal corroborative evidence said arthur coolly but it will not legally estop her proving that she is his sisterif she can do so but i ask your pardongo on  that is all said donna dolores sitting up with a slight gesture of impatience  very well then as i understand the case is simply this you hold a grant to a piece of laud actually possessed by a squatter who claims it through his wife or sisterlegally it doesnt matter whichby virtue of a bequest made by one dr devarges who also held a grant to the same property  yes said donna dolores hesitatingly  well the matter lies between you and dr devarges only it is simply a question of the validity of the original grants all that you have told me does not alter that radical fact stay one moment may i ask how you have acquired these later details  by letter  from whom  there was no signature the writer offered to prove all he said it was anonymous  arthur rose with a superior smile  may i ask you further without impertinence if it is upon this evidence that you propose to abandon your claim to a valuable property  i have told you before that it is not a legal question don arturo said donna dolores waving her fan a little more rapidly  good let us take it in the moral or sentimental aspectsince you have purposed to honour me with a request for my counsel to begin you have a sympathy for the orphan who does not apparently exist  but her brother  has already struck hands with the impostor and married her to secure the claim and this brotherwhat proof is there that he is not an impostor too  true said donna dolores musingly  he will certainly have to settle that trifling question with dr devargess heirs whoever they may be  true said donna dolores  in short i see no reason even from your own viewpoint why you should not fight this claim the orphan you sympathise with is not an active party you have only a brother opposed to you who seems to have been willing to barter away a sisters birthright and as i said before your sympathies however kind and commendable they may be will be of no avail unless the courts decide against dr devarges my advice is to fight if the right does not always succeed my experience is that the right at least is apt to play its best card and put forward its best skill and until it does that it might as well be the wrong you know  you are wise don arturo but you lawyers are so often only advocates pardon i mean no wrong but if it were gracethe sister you understandwhat would be your advice  the same fight it out if i could overthrow your grant i should do it the struggle understand me is there and not with this wife and sister but how does it come that a patent for this has not been applied for before by gabriel did your anonymous correspondent explain that fact it is a point in our favour  you forgetour grant was only recently discovered  true it is about equal then ab initio and the absence of this actual legatee is in our favour  why  because there is a certain human sympathy in juries with a pretty orphanparticularly if poor  how do you know she was pretty asked donna dolores quickly  i presume so it is the privilege of orphanage he said with a bow of cold gallantry  you are wise don arturo may you live a thousand years  this time it was impossible but arthur should notice the irony of donna doloress manner all his strong combative instincts rose the mysterious power of her beauty which he could not help acknowledging her tone of superiority whether attributable to a consciousness of this power over him or some knowledge of his pastall aroused his cold pride he remembered the reputation that donna dolores bore as a religious devotee and rigid moralist if he had been taxed with his abandonment of grace with his halfformed designs upon mrs sepulvida he would have coldly admitted them without excuse or argument in doing so he would have been perfectly conscious that he should lose the esteem of donna dolores of whose value he had become within the last few moments equally conscious but it was a part of this young mans singular nature that he would have experienced a certain selfsatisfaction in the act that would have outweighed all other considerations in the ethics of his own consciousness he called this being true to himself in a certain sense he was right  he rose and standing respectfully before his fair client said  have you decided fully do i understand that i am to press this claim with a view of ousting these parties or will you leave them for the present in undisturbed possession of the land  but what do you say continued donna dolores with her eyes fixed upon his face  i have said already returned arthur with a patient smile morally and legally my advice is to press the claim  donna dolores turned her eyes away with the slightest shade of annoyance  bueno we shall see there is time enough be seated don arturo what is this surely you will not refuse our hospitality tonight  i fear said arthur with grave politeness that i must return to the mission at once i have already delayed my departure a day they expect me in san francisco tomorrow  let them wait you shall write that important business keeps you here and diego shall ride my own horse to reach the embarcadero for the steamer tonight tomorrow he will be in san francisco  before he could stay her hand she had rung a small bronze bell that stood beside her  but donna doloresarthur began hastily  i understand interrupted donna dolores diego she continued rapidly as a servant entered the room saddle jovita instantly and make ready for a journey then return here pardon she turned to arthur you would say your time is valuable a large sum depends upon your presence good write to your partners that i will pay allthat no one else can afford to give as large a sum for your services as myself write that here you must stay  annoyed and insulted as arthur felt he could not help gazing upon her with an admiring fascination the imperious habit of command an almost despotic control of a hundred servants a certain barbaric contempt for the unlimited revenues at her disposal that prompted the act became her wonderfully in her impatience the quick blood glanced through her bronzed cheek her little slipper tapped the floor imperiously and her eyes flashed in the darkness suddenly she stopped looked at arthur and hesitated  pardon me i have done wrong forgive me don arturo i am a spoiled woman who for five years has had her own way i am apt to forget there is any world beyond my little kingdom here go since it must be so go at once  she sank back on the sofa half veiled her face with her fan and dropped the long fringes of her eyes with a deprecating and half languid movement  arthur stood for a moment irresolute and hesitating but only for a moment  let me thank you for enabling me to fulfil a duty without foregoing a pleasure if your messenger is trustworthy and fleet it can be done i will stay  she turned towards him suddenly and smiled a smile apparently so rare to that proud little mouth and those dark melancholy eyes a smile that disclosed the smallest and whitest of teeth in such dazzling contrast to the shadow of her face a smile that even after its brightness had passed still left its memory in a dimple in either nutbrown cheek and a glistening moisture in the dark eyesthat arthur felt the warm blood rise to his face  there are writing materials in the other room diego will find you there said donna dolores and i will rejoin you soon thanks  she held out the smallest and brownest of hands arthur bent over it for a single moment and then withdrew with a quickened pulse to the outer room as the door closed upon him donna dolores folded her fan threw herself back upon the sofa and called in a quick whisper  manuela  the old woman reappeared with an anxious face and ran towards the sofa but she was loo late her mistress had fainted     chapter vii  a leaf out of the past   arthurs letter to his partners was a brief explanation of his delay and closed with the following sentence       search the records for any deed or transfer of the grant from      dr devarges  he had scarcely concluded before diego entered ready for the journey when he had gone arthur waited with some impatience the reappearance of donna dolores to his disappointment however only the solemn majordomo strode grimly into the room like a darkcomplexioned ghost and as it seemed to arthur with a strong suggestion of the commander in don giovanni in his manner silently beckoned him to follow to the apartment set aside for his reception in keeping with the sunevading instincts of spanish californian architecture the room was long low and half lighted the two barred windows on either side of the doorway gave upon the corridor and courtyard below the opposite wall held only a small narrow deeplyembrasured loophole through which arthur could see the vast glittering sunillumined plain beyond the hard monotonous unwinking glare without did not penetrate the monastic gloom of this chamber even the insane incessant restlessness of the wind that perpetually beset the bleak walls was unheard and unfelt in the grave contemplative solitude of this religious cell  mingled with this grateful asceticism was the quaint contrast of a peculiar spanish luxuriousness in a curtained recess an immense mahogany bedstead displayed a yellow satin coverlet profusely embroidered with pink and purple silk flowers the borders of the sheets and cases of the satin pillows were deeply edged with the finest lace beside the bed and before a large armchair heavy rugs of barbaric colours covered the dark wooden floor and in front of the deep ovenlike hearth lay an immense bearskin about the hearth hung an ebony and gold crucifix and mingled with a few modern engravings the usual catholic saints and martyrs occupied the walls it struck arthurs observation oddly that the subjects of the secular engravings were snow landscapes the hospice of st bernard in winter a pass in the austrian tyrol the steppes of russia a norwegian plain all to arthurs fancy brought the temperature of the room down considerably a small watercolour of an alpine flower touched him so closely that it might have blossomed from his recollection  dinner which was prefaced by a message from donna dolores excusing herself through indisposition was served in solemn silence a cousin of the late don josé salvatierra represented the family and pervaded the meal with a mild flavour of stale cigaritos and dignified criticism of remote events arthur disappointed at the absence of the donna found himself regarding this gentleman with some degree of asperity and a disposition to resent any reference to his clients business as an unwarrantable impertinence but when the dinner was over and he had smoked a cigar on the corridor without further communication with donna dolores he began to be angry with himself for accepting her invitation and savagely critical of the motives that impelled him to it he was meditating an early retreateven a visit to mrs sepulvidawhen manuela entered  would don arturo grant the donna his further counsel and presence  don arturo was conscious that his cheek was flushing and that his counsel at the present moment would not have been eminently remarkable for coolness or judiciousness but he followed the indian woman with a slight inclination of the head they entered the room where he had first met the donna she might not have moved from the position she had occupied that morning on the couch so like was her attitude and manner as he approached her respectfully he was conscious of the same fragrance and the same mysterious magnetism that seemed to leap from her dark eyes and draw his own resisting and unwilling gaze toward her  you will despise me don arturoyou whose countrywomen are so strong and activebecause i am so little and weak andmother of godso lazy but i am an invalid and am not yet quite recovered but then i am accustomed to it i have lain here for days don arturo doing nothing it is wearyeh you think this watching this waitingday after dayalways the same  there was something so delicately plaintive and tender in the cadence of her speecha cadence that might perhaps have been attributed to the characteristic intonation of the castilian feminine speech but which arthur could not help thinking was peculiar to herself that at the moment he dared not lift his eyes to her although he was conscious she was looking at him but by an impulse of safety he addressed himself to the fan  you have been an invalid thendonna dolores  a sufferer don arturo  have you ever tried the benefit of change of sceneof habits of life your ample means your freedom from the cares of family or kinship offer you such opportunities he continued still addressing the fan  but the fan as if magnetised by his gaze became coquettishly conscious fluttered faltered drooped and then languidly folded its wings arthur was left helpless  perhaps said donna dolores who knows  she paused for an instant and then made a sign to manuela the indian woman rose and left the room  i have something to tell you don arturo she continued something i should have told you this morning it is not too late now but it is a secret it is only that i have questioned my right to tell itnot that i have doubted your honour don arturo that i withheld it then  arthur raised his eyes to hers it was her turn to evade his glance with her long lashes drooped she went on  it is five years ago and my fatherwhom may the saints assoilwas alive came to us then at the presidio of san geronimo a young girlan american a stranger and helpless she had escaped from a lost camp in the snowy mountains where her family and friends were starving that was the story she told my father it was a probable onewas it not  arthur bowed his head but did not reply  but the name that she gave was not a true one as it appeared my father had sent an expedicion to relieve these people and they had found among the dead the person whom this young girlthe strangerassumed to be that was their report the name of the young girl who was found dead and the name of the young girl who came to us was the same it was grace conroy  arthurs face did not move a muscle nor did he once take his eyes from the drooping lids of his companion  it was a grave mattera very grave matter and it was the more surprising because the young girl had at first given another namethe name of grace ashleywhich she afterwards explained was the name of the young man who helped her to escape and whose sister she at first assumed to be my father was a good man a kind mana saint don arturo it was not for him to know if she were grace ashley or grace conroyit was enough for him to know that she was alive weak helpless suffering against the advice of his officers he look her into his own house into his own family into his own fatherly heart to wait until her brother or this philip ashley should return he never returned in six months she was taken illvery illa little child was borndon arturobut in the same moment it died and the mother diedboth you comprehendboth diedin my arms  that was bad said arthur curtly  i do not comprehend said donna dolores  pardon do not misunderstand me i say it was bad for i really believe that this girl the mysterious stranger with the alias was really grace conroy  donna dolores raised her eyes and stared at arthur  and why  because the identification of the bodies by the expedicion was hurried and imperfect  how know you this  arthur arose and drew his chair a little nearer his fair client  you have been good enough to intrust me with an important and honourable secret let me show my appreciation of that confidence by intrusting you with one equally important i knew that the identification was imperfect and hurried because i was present in the report of the expedicion you will find the name if you have not already read it of lieutenant arthur poinsett that was myself  donna dolores raised herself to a sitting posture  but why did you not tell me this before  because first i believed that you knew that i was lieutenant poinsett because secondly i did not believe that you knew that arthur poinsett and philip ashley were one and the same person  i do not understand said donna dolores slowly in a hard metallic voice  i am lieutenant arthur poinsett formerly of the army who under the assumed name of philip ashley brought grace conroy out of starvation camp i am the person who afterwards abandoned herthe father of her child  he had not the slightest intention of saying this when he first entered the room but something in his nature which he had never tried to control brought it out he was neither ashamed of it nor apprehensive of its results but having said it leaned back in his chair proud selfreliant and selfsustained if he had been uttering a moral sentiment he could not have been externally more calm or inwardly less agitated more than that there was a certain injured dignity in his manner as he rose without giving the speechless and astonished woman before him a chance to recover herself and said  you will be able now to know whether your confidence has been misplaced you will be able now to determine what you wish done and whether i am the person best calculated to assist you i can only say donna dolores that i am ready to act either as your witness to the identification of the real grace conroy or as your legal adviser or both when you have decided which you shall give me your further commands or dismiss me until then adios  he bowed waved his hand with a certain grand courtesy and withdrew when donna dolores raised her stupified head the door had closed upon him  when this conceited young gentleman reached his own room he was i grieve to say to some extent mentally and if i may use the word morally exalted by the interview more than that he was in better spirits that he had been since his arrival from his room he strode out into the corridor if his horse had been saddled he would have taken a sharp canter over the low hills for exercise pending the decision of his fair client but it was the hour of the noonday siesta and the courtyard was deserted he walked to the gate and looked across the plain a fierce wind held uninterrupted possession of earth and sky something of its restlessness just at that instant was in arthurs breast and with a glance around the corridor and a momentary hesitation as an opening door in a distant part of the building suggested the possibility of another summons from donna dolores he stepped beyond the walls     chapter viii  the bulls of the blessed trinity   the absolute freedom of illimitable space the exhilaration of the sparkling sunlight and the excitement of the opposing wind which was strong enough to oblige him to exert a certain degree of physical strength to overcome it so wrought upon arthur that in a few moments he had thrown off the mysterious spell which the rancho of the blessed trinity appeared to have cast over his spirits and had placed a material distance between himself and its gloomy towers the landscape which had hitherto seemed monotonous and uninspiring now became suggestive in the low domeshaped hills beyond that were huddled together like halfblown earth bubbles raised by the fiery breath of some longdead volcano he fancied he saw the origin of the mission architecture in the long sweep of the level plain he recognised the calm uneventful life that had left its expression in the patient gravity of the people in the fierce restless wind that blew over ita wind so persistent and perpetual that all umbrage except a narrow fringe of dwarfed willows defining the line of an extract watercourse was hidden in sheltered cañons and the leeward slopes of the hillshe recognized something of his own restless race and no longer wondered at the barrenness of the life that was turned towards the invader i daresay he muttered to himself somewhere in the leeward of these peoples natures may exist a luxurious growth that we shall never know i wonder if the donna has notbut here he stopped angry and if the truth must be told a little frightened at the persistency with which donna dolores obtruded herself into his abstract philosophy and sentiment  possibly something else caused him for the moment to dismiss her from his mind during his rapid walk he had noticed as an accidental and by no means an essential feature of the bleak landscape the vast herds of crawling purposeless cattle an entirely new and distinct impression was now forming itself in his consciousnessnamely that they no longer were purposeless vagrant and wandering but were actually obeying a certain definite law of attraction and were moving deliberately toward an equally definite object and that object was himself  look where he would before behind on either side north east south weston the bleak hilltops on the slope of the falda across the driedup arroyo there were the same converging lines of slowly moving objects towards a single focushimself although walking briskly and with a certain definiteness of purpose he was apparently the only unchanging fixed and limited point in the now active landscape everything that rose above the dead barren level was now moving slowly irresistibly instinctively but unmistakably towards one common centrehimself alone and unsupported he was the helpless unconscious nucleus of a slowly gathering force almost immeasurable in its immensity and power  at first the idea was amusing and grotesque then it became picturesque then it became something for practical consideration and thenbut nowith the quick and unerring instincts of a powerful will he choked down the next consideration before it had time to fasten upon or paralyse his strength he stopped and turned the rancho of the blessed trinity was gone had it suddenly sank in the earth or had he diverged from his path neither he had simply walked over the little elevation in the plain beside the arroyo and corral and had already left the rancho two miles behind him  it was not the only surprise that came upon him suddenly like a blow between the eyes the same mysterious attraction had been operating in his rear and when he turned to retrace his steps towards the mission he faced the staring eyes of a hundred bulls not fifty yards away as he faced them the nearest turned the next rank followed their example the next the same and the next until in the distance he could see the movement repeated with military precision and sequence with a sense of relief that he put aside as quickly as he had the sense of fear he quickened his pace until the nearest bull ahead broke into a gentle trot which was communicated line by line to the cattle beyond until the whole herd before him undulated like a vast monotonous sea he continued on across the arroyo and past the corral until the blinding and penetrating cloud of dust raised by the plunging hoofs of the moving mass before him caused him to stop a dull reverberation of the plaina sound that at first might have been attributed to a passing earthquakenow became so distinct that he turned not twenty yards behind him rose the advance wall of another vast tumultuous sea of tossing horns and undulating backs that had been slowly following his retreat he had forgotten that he was surrounded  the nearest were now so close upon him that he could observe them separately they were neither large powerful vindictive nor ferocious on the contrary they were thin wasted haggard anxious beasts economically equipped and gotten up the better to wrestle with a six months drought occasional famine and the incessant buffeting of the windwild and untamable but their staring eyes and nervous limbs expressed only wonder and curiosity and when he ran toward them with a shout they turned as had the others file by file and rank by rank and in a moment were like the others in full retreat rather let me say retreated as the others had retreated for when he faced about again to retrace his steps toward the mission he fronted the bossy bucklers and inextricable horns of those he had driven only a few moments ago before him they had availed themselves of his diversion with the rearguard to return  with the rapidity of a quick intellect and swift perceptions arthur saw at once the resistless logic and utter hopelessness of his situation the inevitable culmination of all this was only a question of timeand a very brief period would it be sufficient to enable him to reach the casa no could he regain the corral perhaps between it and himself already were a thousand cattle would they continue to retreat as he advanced possibly but would he be overtaken meanwhile by those in his rear  he answered the question himself by drawing from his waistcoat pocket his only weapon a small derringer and taking aim at the foremost bull the shot took effect in the animals shoulder and he fell upon his knees as arthur had expected his nearer comrades stopped and sniffed at their helpless companion but as arthur had not expected the eager crowd pressing behind overbore them and their wounded brother and in another instant the unfortunate animal was prostrate and his life beaten out by the trampling hoofs of the resistless blind and eager crowd that followed with a terrible intuition that it was a foreshadowing of his own fate arthur turned in the direction of the corral and ran for his very life  as he ran he was conscious that the act precipitated the inevitable catastrophebut he could think of nothing better as he ran he felt from the shaking of the earth beneath his feet that the act had once more put the whole herd in equally active motion behind him as he ran he noticed that the cattle before him retreated with something of his own precipitation but as he ran he thought of nothing but the awful fate that was following him and the thought spurred him to an almost frantic effort i have tried to make the reader understand that arthur was quite inaccessible to any of those weaknesses which mankind regard as physical cowardice in the defence of what he believed to be an intellectual truth in the interests of his pride or his selflove or in a moment of passion he would have faced death with unbroken fortitude and calmness but to be the victim of an accident to be the lamentable sequel of a logical succession of chances without motive or purpose to be sacrificed for nothingwithout proving or disproving anything to be trampled to death by idiotic beasts who had not even the instincts of passion or revenge to justify them to die the death of an ignorant tramp or any negligent clowna death that had a ghastly ludicrousness in its method a death that would leave his body a shapeless indistinguishable unrecognisable clod which affection could not idealise nor friendship reverenceall this brought a horror with it so keen so exquisite so excruciating that the fastidious proud intellectual being fleeing from it might have been the veriest dastard that ever turned his back on danger and superadded to it was a superstitious thought that for its very horror perhaps it was a retribution for something that he dared not contemplate  and it was then that his strength suddenly flagged his senses began to reel his breath which had kept pace with the quick beating of his heart intermitted hesitated was lost above the advancing thunder of hoofs behind him he thought he heard a womans voice he knew now he was going crazy he shouted and fell he rose again and staggered forward a few steps and fell again it was over now a sudden sense of some strange subtle perfume beating up through the acrid smarting dust of the plain that choked his mouth and blinded his eyes came swooning over him and then the blessed interposition of unconsciousness and peace  he struggled back to life again with the word philip in his ears a throbbing brow and the sensation of an effort to do something that was required of him of all his experience of the last few moments only the perfume remained he was lying alone in the dry bed of the arroyo on the bank a horse was standing and above him bent the dark face and darker eyes of donna dolores  try to recover sufficient strength to mount that horse she said after a pause  it was a woman before him with that innate dread which all masculine nature has of exhibiting physical weakness before a weaker sex arthur struggled to rise without the assistance offered by the small hand of his friend that however even at that crucial moment he so far availed himself of it as to press it i fear was the fact  you came to my assistance alone asked arthur as he struggled to his feet  why not we are equal now don arturo said donna dolores with a dazzling smile i saw you from my window you were rashpardon mefoolish the oldest vaquero never ventures a foot upon these plains but come you shall ride with me there was no time to saddle another horse and i thought you would not care to let others know of your adventure am i right  there was a slight dimple of mischief in her cheek and a quaint sparkle in her dark eye as she turned her questioning gaze on arthur he caught her hand and raised it respectfully to his lips  you are wise as you are brave donna dolores  we shall see but at present you must believe that i am right and do as i say mount that horsei will help you if you are too weakandleave a space for me behind you  thus adjured arthur leaped into the saddle if his bones had been broken instead of being bruised he would still have found strength for that effort in another instant donna dolores little foot rested on his and she lightly mounted behind him  home now hasten we will be there before any one will know it she said as she threw one arm around his waist with superb unconsciousness  arthur lifted the rein and dropped his heels into the flanks of the horse in five minutesthe briefest as it seemed to him he had ever passedthey were once more within the walls of the blessed trinity     book iv  drifting     chapter i  mr and mrs conroy at home   the manner in which one horse gulch received the news of gabriel conroys marriage was characteristic of that frank and outspoken community without entering upon the question of his previous shameless flirtation with mrs marklethe baleful extent of which was generally unknown to the campthe nearer objections were based upon the fact that the bride was a stranger and consequently an object of suspicion and that gabriels sphere of usefulness in a public philanthropic capacity would be seriously impaired and limited his very brief courtship did not excite any surprise in a climate where the harvest so promptly followed the sowing and the fact now generally known that it was he who saved the womans life after the breaking of the dam at black cañon was accepted as a sufficient reason for his success in that courtship it may be remarked here that a certain grim disbelief in feminine coyness obtained at one horse gulch that the conditions of life there were as near the perfect and original condition of mankind as could be found anywhere and that the hollow shams of society and weak artifices of conventionalism could not exist in that sincere atmosphere were two beliefs that one horse gulch never doubted  possibly there was also some little envy of gabriels success an envy not based upon any evidence of his superior courage skill or strength but only of the peculiar luck opportunity or providence that had enabled him to turn certain qualities very common to one horse gulch to such favourable account  toe think said jo briggs thet i was allowinonly thet very afternoonto go up that cañon arter game and didnt go from some derned foolishness or other and yers gabe hevin no call to go thar jest comes along accidental like and dern my skin but he strikes onto a purty gal and a wife the first lick  thets so responded barker its all luck thars thet cy dudley with plenty o money and wantin a wife bad and ez is goin to sacramento tomorrow to prospect fur one and he hez been up and down that cañon time outer mind and no dam ever said break to him no sir or take my own case ony last week when the fiddletown coach went over the bank at dry creek wasnt i the fust man thar ez cut the leaders adrift and bruk open the coachdoor and helped out the passengers and wot passengers six chinymen by jinksand a greaser thets my luck  there were few preliminaries to the marriage the consent of olly was easily gained as an act of aggression and provocation towards mrs markle nothing could offer greater inducements the superior gentility of the stranger the fact of her being a stranger and the expeditiousness of the courtship coming so hard upon mrs markles fickleness commended itself to the childs sense of justice and feminine retaliation for herself olly hardly knew if she liked her prospective sister she was gentle she was kind she seemed to love gabrielbut olly was often haunted by a vague instinct that mrs markle would have been a better matchand with true feminine inconsistency she hated her the more for it possibly she tasted also something of the disappointment of the baffled matchmaker in the depths of her childish consciousness  it may be fairly presumed that the former mrs devarges had confided to no one but her lawyer the secret of her assumption of the character of grace conroy how far or how much more she had confided to that gentleman was known only to himself he kept her secret whatever might have been its extent and received the announcement of her intended marriage to gabriel with the superior smile of one to whom all things are possible from the unprofessional sex  now that you are about to enter into actual possession said mr maxwell quietly buttoning up his pocket again i suppose you will not require my services immediately  it is said upon what authority i know not that madame devarges blushed slightly heaved the least possible sigh as she shook her head and said i hope not with an evident sincerity that left her legal adviser in some slight astonishment  how far her intended husband participated in this confidence i do not know he was evidently proud of alluding to her in the few brief days of his courtship as the widow of the great doctor devarges and his knowledge of her former husband to some extent mitigated in the public mind the apparent want of premeditation in the courtship  to think of the artfulness of that man said sal confidentially to mrs markle and he agettin up sympathy about his sufferins at starvation camp and all the while acarryin on with the widder of one o them onfortunets no wonder that man was queer wot you allowed in the innocents o yer heart was bashfulness was jest conscience i never let on to ye mrs markle but i allus noticed thet thet gabe never could meet my eye  the flippant mind might have suggested that as both of miss sarahs eyes were afflicted with a cast there might have been a physical impediment to this exchange of frankness but then the flippant mind never enjoyed the confidence of this powerful young woman  it was a month after the wedding and mrs markle was sitting alone in her parlour whither she had retired after the professional duties of supper were over when the front door opened and sal entered it was sunday evening and sal had been enjoying the brief recreation of gossip with the neighbours and as was alleged by the flippant mind before alluded to some coquettish conversation and dalliance with certain youth of one horse gulch  mrs markle watched her handmaid slowly remove an immense straw flat trimmed with tropical flowers and then proceed to fold away an enormous plaid shawl which represented quite another zone and then her curiosity got the better of her prudence  well and how did ye find the young couple gettin on sal  sal too well understood the value of coylywithheld information to answer at once and with the instincts of a true artist she affected to misunderstand her mistress when mrs markle had repeated her question sal replied with a a sarcastic laugh  axin yer pardin fur manners but you let on about the young couple and she forty if shes anythin  oh no sal remonstrated mrs markle with reproachful accents and yet a certain selfsatisfaction youre mistaken sure  well said sal breathlessly slapping her hands on her lap if pearl powder and another womans har and fancy doins beggiles folks it aint sal ez is among the folks fooled no sue markle ef i aint lived long enough with a woman ez owns to thirtythree and hezef it wuz my last words and god is my jedgethe neck and arms of a gal of sixteen not to know when a woman is trying to warm over the scraps of forty year with a kind o hash o twenty then sal clark aint got no eyes thets all  mrs markle blushed slightly under the direct flattery of sal and continued  some folks says shes purty  some mens meat is other mens pizen responded sal sententiously unfastening an enormous black velvet zone and apparently permitting her figure to fall into instant ruin  how did they look said mrs markle after a pause recommencing her darning which she had put down  well purty much as i allowed they would from the first thar aint any love wasted over thar my opinion is thet hes sick of his bargin she runs the house and evry thing thats in it jest look at the critter shes just put that thar gabe up to prospecting all along the ledge here and that fools left his diggins and hez been running hither and yon making ridiklus holes all over the hill jest to satisfy thet woman and she aint satisfied neither take my word for it sue markle thars suthin wrong thar and then thars thet olly  mrs markle raised her eyes quickly and put down her work olly she repeated with great animationpoor little olly whats gone of her  well said sal with an impatient toss of her head i never did see what thar wuz in that peart and sassy piece for any one to take toleastwise a woman with a child of her own the airs and graces thet thet olly would put on wuz too much why she hednt been nigh us for a month and the day afore the wedding what does that limb do but meet me and sez sez she sal ye kin tell mrs markle as my brother gabe ez goin to marry a ladya lady sez she thar aint goin to be enny pikes about our cabin and thet child only eight years oh git out thar i aint no patience  to the infinite credit of a much abused sex be it recorded that mrs markle overlooked the implied slur and asked  but what about olly  i mean to say said sal thet thet child haint no place in thet house and thet gabe is jest thet weak and mean spirited ez to let thet woman have her own way no wonder thet the child was crying when i met her out in the woods yonder  mrs markle instantly flushed and her black eyes snapped ominously i should jest like to ketch she began quickly and then stopped and looked at her companion sal she said with swift vehemence i must see thet child  how  the word in sals dialect had a various large and catholic significance mrs markle understood it and repeated briefly  ollyi must see herright off  which continued sal  here replied mrs markle anywhere fetch her when ye kin  she wont come  then ill go to her said mrs markle with a sudden and characteristic determination that closed the conversation and sent sal back viciously to her unwashed dishes  whatever might have been the truth of sals report there was certainly no general external indication of the facts the newlymarried couple were to all appearances as happy and contented and as enviable to the masculine inhabitants of one horse gulch as any who had ever built a nest within its pastoral close if a majority of gabriels visitor were gentlemen it was easily attributed to the preponderance of males in the settlement if these gentlemen were unanimously extravagant in their praise of mrs conroy it was as easily attributable to the same cause that gabriel should dig purposeless holes over the hillside that he should for the time abandon his regular occupation in his little modest claim in the cañon was quite consistent with the ambition of a newlymarried man  a few evenings after this gabriel conroy was sitting alone by the hearth of that new house which popular opinion and the tastes of mrs conroy seemed to think was essential to his new condition it was a larger more ambitious more expensive and perhaps less comfortable dwelling than the one in which he has been introduced to the reader it was projected upon that credit which a man of family was sure to obtain in one horse gulch where the immigration and establishment of families and household centres were fostered even at pecuniary risks it contained beside the chambers the gratuitous addition of a parlour which at this moment was adorned and made attractive by the presence of mrs conroy who was entertaining a few visitors that under her attractions had prolonged their sitting until late when the laugh had ceased and the door closed on the last lingering imbecile mrs conroy returned to the sittingroom it was dark for gabriel had not lighted a candle yet and he was occupying his favourite seat and attitude before the fire  why are you there said mrs conroy gaily  gabriel looked up and with that seriousness which was habitual to him replied  yes  mrs conroy approached her lord and master and ran her thin clawlike fingers through his hair with married audacity he caught them held them for a moment with a kindly caressing and yet slightly embarrassed air that the lady did not like she withdrew them quickly  why didnt you come into the parlour she said examining him curiously  i didnt admire to tonight returned gabriel with grave simplicity and i reckoned youd get on as well without me  there was not the slightest trace of bitterness nor aggrieved sensitiveness in his tone or manner and although mrs conroy eyed him sharply for any latent spark of jealousy she was forced to admit to herself that it did not exist in the quiet serious man before her vaguely aware of some annoyance in his wifes face gabriel reached out his arm and lightly taking her around her waist drew her to his knee but the very act was so evidently a recognition of a certain kind of physical and moral weakness in the creature before himso professionalso as mrs conroy put it to herselflike as if i were a sick man that her irritation was not soothed she rose quickly and seated herself on the other side of the fireplace with the same implied toleration gabriel had already displayed he now made no attempt to restrain her  mrs conroy did not pout as another woman might have done she only smiled a haggard smile that deepened the line of her nostril into her cheek and pinched her thin straight nose then she said looking at the fire  aint you well  i reckon notnot overly well  there was a silence both looking at the fire  you dont get anything out of that hillside asked mrs conroy at last pettishly  no said gabriel  you have prospected all over the ridge continued the woman impatiently  all over  and you dont find anything  nothin said gabriel nary thet is he added with his usual cautious deliberation thet is nothin o any account the gold ef there is any lies lower down in the gulch whar i used to dig but i kept at it jest to satisfy your whim you know july it was a whim of yours he continued with a certain gentle deprecatoriness of manner  a terrible thought flashed suddenly upon mrs conroy could dr devarges have made a mistake might he not have been delirious or insane when he wrote of the treasure or had the secretary deceived her as to its location a swift and sickening sense that all she had gained or was to gain from her scheme was the man before herand that he did not love her as other men hadasserted itself through her trembling consciousness mrs conroy had already begun to fear that she loved this husband and it was with a new sense of yearning and dependence that she in her turn looked deprecatingly and submissively into his face and said  it was only a whim deari dare say a foolish one its gone now dont mind it  i dont said gabriel simply  mrs conroy winced  i thought you looked disappointed she said after a pause  it aint that i was thinkin on july its olly said gabriel  there is a limit even to a frightened womans submission  of course she said sharply olly olly again and always i ought to have remembered that  thets so said gabriel with the same exasperating quiet i was reckonin jest now ez there dont seem to be any likeliness of you and ollys gettin on together youd better separate thar aint no sense goin on this way julyno sense et all and the worst o the hull thing ez thet olly aint gettin no kinder good outer it no way  mrs conroy was very pale and dangerously quiet as mr conroy went on  ive allers allowed to send that child to school but she dont keer to go shes thet foolish thet olly is thet she doesnt like to leave me and i reckon im thet foolish too thet i dont like to hev her go the only way to put things square ez this  mrs conroy turned and fixed her grey eyes upon her husband but she did not speak  youd better go away continued gabriel quietly for a while ive heerd afore now that its the reglar thing fur a bride to go away and visit her mother you haint got no mother said gabriel thoughtfully hev yethats bad but you was a sayin the other day suthin about some business you had down at frisco now it would be about the nateral sort o thing for ye to go thar fur two or three months jest till things get round square with olly and me  it is probable that gabriel was the only man from whom mrs conroy could have received this humiliating proposition without interrupting him with a burst of indignation yet she only turned a rigid face towards the fire again with a hysterical laugh  why limit my stay to two or three months she said  well it might be four said gabriel simplyit would give me and olly a longer time to get things in shape  mrs conroy rose and walked rigidly to her husbands side  what she said huskily what if i were to refuse  gabriel looked as if this suggestion would not have been startling or inconsistent as an abstract possibility in woman but said nothing  what continued mrs conroy more rapidly and huskily what if i were to tell you and that brat to go what she said suddenly raising her voice to a thin high soprano what if i were to turn you both out of this housemy house off this landmy land eh eh eh she almost screamed emphasising each interrogatory with her thin hand on gabriels shoulder in a desperate but impotent attempt to shake him  certingly certingly said gabriel calmly but thars somebody at the door july he continued quietly as he rose slowly and walked into the hall  his quick ear had detected a knocking without above the truculent pitch of mrs conroys voice he threw open the door and disclosed olly and sal standing upon the threshold  it is scarcely necessary to say that sal was first to recover the use of that noble organ the tongue  with chills and ager in every breathits an hour if its five minutes that weve stood here she began pounding at that door youre interrupting the young couple sal sez i comin yer this time o night breakin in so to speak on the holiest confidences sez i but its business and onless you hev thet to back you sarah clark i sez and you aint a woman ez ever turned her back on thet or them you aint no call there but i was to fetch this child home mrs conroy continued sal pushing her way into the little sittingroom and  she paused for the room was vacant mrs conroy had disappeared  i thought i heerdsaid sal completely taken aback  it was only gabe said olly with the ready mendacity of swift feminine tact i told you so thank you sal for seeing me home good night sal and with a dexterity that smote gabriel into awesome and admiring silence she absolutely led the breathless sal to the door and closed it upon her before that astonished female could recover her speech  then she returned quietly took off her hat and shawl and taking the unresisting hand of her brother led him back to his former seat by the fire drawing a low stool in front of him she proceeded to nestle between his kneesan old trick of hersand once more taking his hand stroked it between her brown fingers looked up into his face and said  dear old gabe  the sudden smile that irradiated gabriels serious face would have been even worse provocation to mrs conroy than his previous conduct  what was the matter gabe said olly what was she saying when we came in  gabriel had not since the entrance of his sister thought of mrs conroys parting speech and manner even now its full significance did not appear to have reached him  i disremember olly he replied looking down into ollys earnest eyes suthin or other she was techy thets all  but wot did she mean by saying that the house and lands was hers persisted the child  married folks olly said gabriel with the lazy easy manner of vast matrimonial experience married folks hev little jokes and ways o thar own bein onmarried yourself ye dont know with all my worldly goods i thee endow thets allthets what she meant olly with all my worldly goods i thee endow did you hev a good time down there  yes said olly  youll hev a nice time here soon olly said gabriel  olly looked incredulously across the hall toward the door of mrs conroys chamber  thets it olly said gabriel mrs conroys goin to frisco to see some friends shes thet bent on goin thet nothin il stop her ye see olly its the fashion fur new married folks to kinder go way and visit absent and sufferin friends thars them little ways about the married state that bein onmarried yourself you dont sabe but its all right shes goin bein a lady and raised so to speak mong fashinble people shes got to folly the fashin shes goin for three months mebbe four i disremember now wots the fashinble time but shell do it olly  olly cast a penetrating look at her brother  she aint goin on my account gabe  lord love the child no wot put thet into your head olly why said gabriel with cheerful mendacity shes been takin a shine to ye o late ony tonight she was wonderin whar you be  as if to give credence to his words and much to his inward astonishment the door of mrs conroys room opened and the lady herself with a gracious smile on her lips and a brightly beaming eye albeit somewhat reddened around the lids crossed the hall and going up to olly kissed her round cheek  i thought it was your voice and although i was just going to bed she added gaily with a slightly apologetic look at her charming dishabille i had to come in and be sure it was you and where have you been you naughty girl do you know i shall be dreadfully jealous of this mrs markle come and tell me all about her come you shall stay with me tonight and we wont let brother gabe hear our little secretsshall we come  and before the awestruck gabriel could believe his own senses she had actually whisked the halfpleased halffrightened child into her own room and he was left standing alone nor was he the less amazed although relieved of a certain undefined anxiety for the child when a moment later olly herself thrust her curly head out of the door and calling out goodnight old gabe with a mischievous accent shut and locked the door in his face for a moment gabriel stood petrified on his own hearthstone was he mistaken and had mrs conroys anger actually been nothing but a joke was olly really sincere in her dislike of his wife there was but one apparent solution to these various and perplexing problems and that was the general incomprehensibility of the sex  the ways o woman is awful onsartin said gabriel as he sought the solitary little room which had been set apart for olly and somehow i aint the man ez hez the gift o findin them out  and with these reflections he went apologetically yet to a certain extent contentedly as was his usual habit to bed     chapter ii  in which the treasure is foundand lost   as no word has been handed down of the conversation that night between olly and her sisterinlaw i fear the masculine reader must view their subsequent conduct in the light of gabriels abstract proportion the feminine readerto whose wellknown sense of justice and readiness to acknowledge a characteristic weakness i chiefly commend these pageswill of course require no further explanation and will be quite ready to believe that the next morning olly and mrs conroy were apparently firm friends and that gabriel was incontinently snubbed by both of these ladies as he deserved  you dont treat july right said olly one morning to gabriel during five minutes that she had snatched from the inseparable company of mrs conroy  gabriel opened his eyes in wonder i haint been round the house much because i allowed you and july didnt want my kempany he began apologetically and ef its shortness of provisions ive fooled away so much time olly in prospectin that ledge that i had no time to clar up and get any dust i reckon may be the pork barl is low but ill fix thet straight soon olly soon  but it aint thet gabeit aint provisionsitsitso you aint got no sabe ez a husbandthar burst out the direct olly at last  without the least sign of resentment gabriel looked thoughtfully at his sister  thets soi reckon thet is the thing not hevin been married afore and bein so to speak strange and greenhanded like as not i dont exactly come up to the views of a woman ez hez hed thet experience and her husband a savang a savang olly and a larned man  youre as good as him ejaculated olly hastily whose parts of speech were less accurately placed than her feelings and i reckon she loves you a heap better gabe but you aint quite lovin enough she added as gabriel started why thar was thet young couple thet came up from simpsons last week and stayed over at mrs markles thar was no end of the attentions thet thet man paid to thet thar womanfixin her shawl histin the winder and puttin it down and askin after her health every five minnitsand theyd sit and sit just like thishere olly in the interests of domestic felicity improvised the favourite attitude of the bridegroom as far as the great girth of gabriels waist and chest could be clipped by her small arms  wot afore folks asked gabriel looking down a little shamefully on the twining arms of his sister  yesin courseafore folks why they want it to be known thet theyre married  olly broke out gabriel desperately your sisterinlaw aint thet kind of woman shed reckon thet kind o thing was low  but olly only replied by casting a mischievous look at her brother shaking her curls and with the mysterious admonition try it left him and went back to mrs conroy  happily for gabriel mrs conroy did not offer an opportunity for the exhibition of any tenderness on gabriels part although she did not make any allusion to the past and even utterly ignored any previous quarrel she still preserved a certain coy demeanour toward him that while it relieved him of an onerous duty very greatly weakened his faith in the infallibility of ollys judgment when out of respect to that judgment he went so far as to throw his arms ostentatiously around his wifes waist one sunday while perambulating the single long public street of one horse gulch and that lady with great decision quietly slipped out of his embrace he doubted still more  i did it on account o what you said olly and darn my skin if she seemed to like it at all and even the boys hangin around seemed to think it was queer jo hobson snickered right out  when was it said olly  sunday  olly sharplywhere  gabrielon main street  olly apostrophising heaven with her blue eyesef thar ever was a blunderin mule gabe its you  gabriel mildly and thoughtfullythets so  howbeit some kind of a hollow truce was patched up between these three belligerents and mrs conroy did not go to san francisco on business it is presumed that the urgency of her affairs there was relieved by correspondence for during the next two weeks she expressed much anxiety on the arrival of the regular triweekly mails and one day it brought her not only a letter but an individual of some importance in this history  he got down from the wingdam coach amid considerable local enthusiasm apart from the fact that it was well known that he was a rich san francisco banker and capitalist his brusque sharp energy his easy sceptical familiarity and general contempt for and ignoring of everything but the practical and material and above all his reputation for success which seemed to make that success a wholesome business principal rather than good fortune had already fascinated the passengers who had listened to his curt speech and half oracular axioms they had forgiven dogmatisms voiced in such a hearty manner and emphasised possibly with a slap on the back of the listener he had already converted them to his broad materialismless perhaps by his curt rhetoric than by the logic of his habitual business success and the respectability that it commanded it was easy to accept scepticism from a man who evidently had not suffered by it radicalism and democracy are much more fascinating to us when the apostle is in comfortable case and easy circumstances than when he is clad in fustian and consistently out of a situation human nature thirsts for the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but would prefer to receive it from the happy owner of a latchkey to the garden of eden rather than from the pilferer who had just been ejected from the premises  it is probable however that the possessor of these admirable qualities had none of that fine scorn for a mankind accessible to this weakness which at present fills the breast of the writer and i trust the reader of these pages if he had i doubt if he would have been successful like a true hero he was quite unconscious of the quality of his heroism and utterly unable to analyse it so that without any previous calculations or prearranged plan he managed to get rid of his admirers and apply himself to the business he had in hand without either wilfully misleading the public of one horse gulch or giving the slightest intimation of what that real business was that the general interests of one horse gulch had attracted the attention of this powerful capitalistthat he intended to erect a new hotel or start an independent line of stagecoaches from sacramento were among the accepted theories everybody offered him vast and gratuitous information and out of the various facts and theories submitted to him he gained the particular knowledge he required without asking for it given a reputation for business shrewdness and omnipresence in any one individual and the world will speedily place him beyond the necessity of using them  and so in a casual general way the stranger was shown over the length and breadth and thickness and present and future of one horse gulch when he had reached the farther extremity of the gulch he turned to his escortill make the inquiry you ask now  how  by telegraphif youll take it  he tore a leaf from a memorandumbook and wrote a few lines  and you  oh ill look around herei suppose theres not much beyond this  no the next claim is gabriel conroys  not much account i reckon  no it pays him grub  well dine with me at three oclock when and where you chooseyou know best invite whom you like goodbye and the great mans escort thus dismissed departed lost in admiration of the decisive promptitude and liberality of his guest  left to himself the stranger turned his footsteps in the direction of gabriel conroys claim had he been an admirer of nature or accessible to any of those influences which a contemplation of wild scenery is apt to produce in weaker humanity he would have been awed by the gradual transition of a pastoral landscape to one of uncouth heroics in a few minutes he had left the belt of sheltering pines and entered upon the ascent of a shadowless scorched and blistered mountain that here and there in places of vegetation had put on the excrescences of scoria or a singular eruption of crust that breaking beneath his feet in slippery grey powder made his footing difficult and uncertain had he been possessed of a scientific eye he would have noted here and there the evidences of volcanic action in the sudden depressions the abrupt elevations the marks of disruption and upheaval and the riverlike flow of débris that protruded a black tongue into the valley below but i am constrained to believe the strangers dominant impression was simply one of heat halfway up the ascent he took off his coat and wiped his forehead with his handkerchief nevertheless certain peculiarities in his modes of progression showed him to be not unfamiliar with mountain travel two or three times during the ascent he stopped and facing about carefully resurveyed the path beneath him slight as was the action it was the unfailing sign of the mountaineer who recognised that the other side of the mountain was as yet an undetermined quantity and was prepared to retrace his steps if necessary at the summit he paused and looked around him  immediately at his feet the gulch which gave its name to the settlement and from which the golden harvest was gathered broadened into a thickly wooded valley its quivering depths were suffused by the incense of odorous gums and balms liberated by the fierce heat of the noonday sun that rose to his face in soft tremulous waves and filled the air with its heated spices through a gap in the cañon to the west a faint scarcelydistinguishable line of cloud indicated the coast range north and south higher hills arose heavily terraced with straight colonnades of pines that made the vast black monolith on which he stood appear blacker and barer by contrast higher hills to the eastone or two peaksand between them in the sunlight oddlooking indistinct vacant intervalsblanks in the landscape as yet not filled in with colour or expression yet the stranger knew them to be snow and for a few moments seemed fascinatedgazing at them with a fixed eye and rigid mouth until with an effort he tore himself away  scattered over the summit were numerous holes that appeared to have been recently sunk in one of them the stranger picked up a fragment of the crumbled rock and examined it carelessly then he slowly descended the gentler slope towards the west in the direction of a claim wherein his quick eye had discovered a man at work a walk of a few moments brought him to the bank of red clay the heap of tailings the wooden sluicebox and the pan and shovel which constituted the appurtenances of an ordinary claim as he approached nearer the workman rose from the bank over which he was bending and leaning on his pick turned his face to the newcomer his broad athletic figure his heavy blonde beard and serious perplexed eyes were unmistakable it was gabriel conroy  how are ye said the stranger briskly extending a hand which gabriel took mechanically youre looking well recollect you but you dont recollect me eh he laughed curtly in a fashion as short and businesslike as his speech and then fixed his eyes rather impatiently on the hesitating gabriel  gabriel could only stare and struggle with a tide of thickcoming remembrances he looked around him the sun was beating down on the old familiar objects everything was unchangedand yet this face this voice  i am here on a matter of business continued the stranger briskly dismissing the question of recognition as one unessential to the business on handandwhat have you got to propose he leaned lightly against the bank and supported himself by thrusting gabriels pickaxe against the bank as he waited a reply  its peter dumphy said gabriel in a awestricken voice  yes you recollect me now thought you would its five years and overaint it rough times them gabrielwarnt they eh but youre lookin welldoin well too hey wellwhat do you propose to do about this claim havent made up your mindhey come thenill make a proposition first i suppose your titles all right hey  it was so evident from gabriels dazed manner that apart from his astonishment at meeting peter dumphy he did not know what he was talking about that dumphy paused  its about these specimens he added eyeing gabriel keenly the specimens you sent me  wot specimens said gabriel vaguely still lost in the past  the ones your wife sent meall the same thing you know  but it aint said gabriel with his old truthful directness you better talk to her bout thet thets her lookout i reckon now she did say suthin continued gabriel meditatively about sendin rock to frisco to be tested but i didnt somehow get to take an interest in it leastways its her funeral youd better see her  it was mr dumphys turn to be perplexed in his perfect misapprehension of the character of the man before him he saw only skilful business evasion under the guise of simplicity he remembered moreover that in the earlier days of his prosperity as dumphy and jenkins commission merchants he was himself in the habit of referring customers with whom he was not ready to treat to jenkins very much as he had just now been referred to mrs conroy  of course he said briskly only i thought id save time which is short with me today by coming directly to you may not have time to see her but you can write  thets so said gabriel praps its just as well in the long run ef ye dont see her shell know it aint your fault ill let on that much to her and having disposed of this unimportant feature of the interview he continued ye havent heard nought o graceye mind grace dumphya purty little girl ez was with me up thar ye aint heerd anything o hernor seen her may behev you  of course this question at such a moment was to mr dumphy susceptible of only one meaning it was that mrs conroy had confessed everything to gabriel and that he wished to use dumphys complicity in the deceit as a lever in future business transactions mr dumphy felt he had to deal with two consummate actorsone of whom was a natural hypocrite for the first time in his life he was impatient of evil we never admire truth and sincerity so highly as when we find it wanting in an adversary  ran off with some fellow didnt she yes i remember you wont see her again its just as well for you id call her dead anyway  although dumphy was convinced that gabriels interest in the fate of his sister was hypocritical he was not above a christian hope that this might wound a brothers feelings he turned to go  cant you come back this way and hev a little talk about ol times said gabriel warming toward dumphy under the magic of old associations and ignoring with provoking unconsciousness the sting of his last speech theres olly ez ud jest admire to see ye ye mind ollythe baby graces little sister growed a fine likely gal now see yer continued gabriel with sudden energy putting down his pick and shovel ill jess go over thar with ye now  no no said dumphy quickly busy cant nother time goodday see you again some time so long and he hurriedly departed retracing his steps until the claim and its possessor were lost in the intervening foliage  then he paused hesitated and then striking across the summit of the hill made his way boldly to gabriels cottage  either mrs conroy was expecting him or had detected him coming through the woods for she opened the door to him and took him into her little parlour with a graciousness of demeanour and an elaboration of toilet that would have been dangerous to any other man but like most men with a deservedly bad reputation among women mr dumphy always rigidly separated any weakness of gallantly from his business  here only for a few moments sorry cant stay longer youre looking well said mr dumphy  mrs conroy said she had not expected the pleasure of a personal interview mr dumphy must be so busy always  yes but i like to bring good news myself the specimens you sent have been assayed by firstclass reliable men theyll do no goldbut eighty per cent silver hey praps you expected it  but mr dumphy could see plainly from mrs conroys eager face that she had not expected it  silver she gaspedeighty per cent  he was mystified but relieved it was evident that she had not consulted anybody else and that he was first on the ground so he said curtly  what do you propose  i dont know began the lady i havent thought  exactly interrupted dumphy havent got any proposition excuse mebut taking out his watch times nearly up look here eighty per cents big thing but silver mine takes gold mine to run it all expense firstno profit till you get down works smeltingcost twenty per cent heres my proposition put whole thing in jointstock company 100 shares five millions capital you take fifty shares ill take twentyfivedispose of other twentyfive as i can hows that hey you cant say wellthink of it  but all mrs conroy could think of was two and a half millions it stared at her stretching its gigantic ciphers across the room it blazed in golden letters on chequesit rose on glittering piles of silver coin to the ceiling of the parlour yet she turned to him with a haggard face and said  but thisthis moneyis only in prospective  cash your draft for the sum ten minutes after the stocks issued thats business  with this certainty mrs conroy recovered herself  i will talkwithmy husband she said  mr dumphy smiledpalpably openly and shamelessly mrs conroy coloured quickly but not from the consciousness mr dumphy attributed to her of detected cunning she had begun to be ashamed of the position she believed she occupied in this mans eyes and fearful that he should have discovered her husbands indifference to her  ive already seen him said mr dumphy quietly  the colour dropped from mrs conroys cheeks  he knows nothing of this she said faintly  of course said dumphy half contemptuously he said so referred to you thats all right thats business  you did not tell himyou dared notshe said excitedly  mr dumphy looked curiously at her for a moment then he rose and shut the door  look here he said facing mrs conroy in a hard matteroffact way do you mean to say that what that manyour husbandsaid was true that he knows nothing of you of the circumstances under which you came here  he does noti swear to god he does not she said passionately  it was inexplicable but mr dumphy believed her  but how will you explain this to him you can do nothing without him  why should he know more if he has discovered this mine it is hisfree of any gift of mineas independent of any claim of mine as if we were strangers the law makes him the owner of the mine that he discovers no matter on whose land it may be found in personating his sister i only claimed a grant to the land he has made the discovery which gives it its value even that sister she added with a sudden flash in her eyeseven that sister were she living could not take it from him now  it was true this woman with whose weakness he had played had outwitted them all and slipped through their fingers almost without stain or blemish and in a way so simple duped as he had been he could hardly restrain his admiration and said quite frankly and heartily  goodthats business  and thenah me this clever creaturethis sharp adventuress this anonyma victrix began to cry and to beg him not to tell her husband  at this familiar sign of the universal feminine weakness dumphy picked up his ears and arts again  wheres your proof that your husband is the first discoverer he said curtly but not unkindly wont that paper that dr devarges gave his sister show that the doctor was really the discoverer of this lead  yes but dr devarges is dead and i hold the paper  good he took out his watch ive five minutes more now look here im not going to say that you havent managed this thing wellyou haveand that you can if you like get along without meyou can see im not going to say that i went into this thing without the prospect of making something out of it myself i have thats business the thing for you to consider now is this understanding each other as we do couldnt you push this thing through better with my helpand helping methan to go elsewhere understand me you could find a dozen men in san francisco who would make you as good an offer and better but it wouldnt be to their interest to keep down any unpleasant reminders of the past as it would be mine you understand  mrs conroy replied by extending her hand  to keep my secret from every onefrom him she said earnestly  certainlythats business  then these two artful ones shook hands with a heartfelt and loyal admiration and belief for each other that i fear more honest folks might have profited by and mr dumphy went off to dine  as mrs conroy closed the front door olly came running in from the back piazza mrs conroy caught her in her arms and discharged her pentup feelings and let us hope her penitence in a joyful and passionate embrace but olly struggled to extricate herself when at last she got her head free she said angrily  let me go i want to see him  whomr dumphy asked mrs conroy still holding the child with a halfhysterical laugh  yes gabe said he was here let me go i say  what do you want with him asked her captor with shrill gaiety  gabe saysgabe sayslet me go will you gabe says he knew  whom  my dear dear sister grace there i didnt mean to hurt youbut i must go  and she did leaving the prospective possessor of two and a half millions vexed suspicious and alone     chapter iii  mr dumphy meets an old friend   peter dumphy was true to his client a few days after he had returned to san francisco he dispatched a note to victor asking an interview he had reasoned that although victor was vanquished and helpless regarding the late discovery at one horse gulch yet his complicity with mrs conroys earlier deceit might make it advisable that his recollection of that event should be effaced he was waiting a reply when a card was brought to him by a clerk mr dumphy glanced at it impatiently and read the name of arthur poinsett autocrat as dumphy was in his own counting house and business circle the name was one of such recognised power in california that he could not ignore its claims to his attention more than that it represented a certain respectability and social elevation which dumphy with all his scepticism and democratic assertion could not with characteristic shrewdness afford to undervalue he said show him in without lifting his head from the papers that lay upon his desk  the door opened again to an elegantlooking young man who lounged carelessly into the awful presence without any of that awe with which the habitual business visitors approached peter dumphy indeed it was possible that never before had mr dumphys door opened to one who was less affected by the great capitalists reputation nevertheless with the natural ease of good breeding after depositing his hat on the table he walked quietly to the fireplace and stood with his back toward it with courteous but perhaps too indifferent patience mr dumphy was at last obliged to look up  busy i see yawned poinsett with languid politeness dont let me disturb you i thought your man said you were disengaged must have made a mistake  mr dumphy was forced to lay aside his pen and rise inwardly protesting  you dont know me by my card i have the advantage i think continued the young man with a smile even in the mere memory of faces the last time i saw you waslet me seefive years ago yes you were chewing a scrap of buffalo hide to keep yourself from starving  philip ashley said mr dumphy in a low voice looking hastily around and drawing nearer the stranger  precisely returned poinsett somewhat impatiently raising his own voice that was my nom de guerre but dumphy seems to have been your real name after all  if dumphy had conceived any idea of embarrassing poinsett by the suggestion of an alias in his case he could have dismissed it after this halfcontemptuous recognition of his own proper cognomen but he had no such idea in spite of his utmost effort he felt himself gradually falling into the same relative positionthe same humble subordination he had accepted five years before it was useless to think of his wealth of his power of his surroundings here in his own bank parlour he was submissively waiting the will and pleasure of this stranger he made one more desperate attempt to regain his lost prestige  you have some business with me eh poinsett he commenced the sentence with a dignity and ended it with a familiarity equally inefficacious  of course said poinsett carelessly shifting his legs before the fire shouldnt have called otherwise on a man of such affairs at such a time you are interested i hear in a mine recently discovered at one horse gulch on the rancho of the blessed innocents one of my clients holds a grant not yet confirmed to the rancho  who said mr dumphy quickly  i believe that is not important nor essential for you to know until we make a formal claim returned arthur quietly but i dont mind satisfying your curiosity its miss dolores salvatierra  mr dumphy felt relieved and began with gathering courage and brusqueness that dont affect  your mining claim not in the least interrupted arthur quietly i am not here to press or urge any rights that we may have we may not even submit the grant for patent but my client would like to know something of the present tenants or if you will owners you represent them i think a man and wife the woman appears first as a spinster assuming to be a miss grace conroy to whom an alleged transfer of an alleged grant was given she next appears as the wife of one gabriel conroy who is i believe an alleged brother of the alleged miss grace conroy youll admit i think its a pretty mixed business and would make a pretty bad showing in court but this adjudicature we are not yet prepared to demand what we want to know is thisand i came to you dumphy as the man most able to tell us is the sister or the brother realor are they both impostors is there a legal marriage of course your legal interest is not jeopardised in any event  mr dumphy partly regained his audacity  you ought to knowyou ran away with the real grace conroy he said putting his hands in his pockets  did i then this is not she if i understand you thanks and the brother  is gabriel conroy if i know the man said dumphy shortly feeling that he had been entrapped into a tacit admission but why dont you satisfy yourself  you have been good enough to render it unnecessary said arthur with a smile i do not doubt your word i am i trust too much of a lawyer to doubt the witness i myself have summoned but who is this woman  the widow of dr devarges  the real thing  yes unless grace conroy should lay claim to that title and privilege the old man seems to have been pretty much divided in his property and affections  the shaft did not apparently reach arthur for whom it was probably intended he only said have you legal evidence that she is the widow if it were a fact and a case of illtreatment or hardship why it might abate the claim of my client who is a rich woman and whose sympathies are of course in favour of the real brother and real sister by the way there is another sister isnt there  yes a mere child  thats all thank you i shant trespass further upon your time goodday  he had taken up his hat and was moving toward the door mr dumphy who felt that whatever might have been poinsetts motives in this interview he dumphy had certainly gained nothing determined to retrieve himself if possible by a stroke of audacity  one moment he said as poinsett was carefully settling his hat over his curls you know whether this girl is living or not what has become of her  but i dont returned poinsett calmly or i shouldnt come to you  there was something about poinsetts manner that prevented dumphy from putting him in the category of all men that both in his haste and his deliberation mr dumphy was apt to say were liars  when and where did you see her last he asked less curtly  i left her at a hunters cabin near the north fork while i went back for help i was too late a relief party from the valley had already discovered the other dead when i returned for grace she was gonepossibly with the relief party i always supposed it was the expedition that succoured you  there was a pause in which these two scamps looked at each other it will be remembered that both had deceived the relief party in reference to their connexions with the unfortunate dead neither believed however that the other was aware of the fact but the inferior scamp was afraid to ask another question that might disclose his own falsehood and the question which might have been an embarrassing one to arthur and have changed his attitude toward dumphy remained unasked not knowing the reason of dumphys hesitation arthur was satisfied of his ignorance and was still left the master he nodded carelessly to dumphy and withdrew  as he left the room he brushed against a short thickset man who was entering at the same moment some instinct of mutual repulsion caused the two men to look at each other poinsett beheld a sallow face that in spite of its belonging to a square figure seemed to have a consumptive look a face whose jaw was narrow and whose lips were always halfparted over white large and protruding teeth a mouth that apparently was always breathlessa mouth that mr poinsett remembered as the distinguishing and unpleasant feature of some one vaguely known to him professionally as the mouth gasped and parted further in recognition poinsett nodded carelessly in return and attributing his repulsion to that extraordinary feature thought no more about it  not so the newcomer he glanced suspiciously after arthur and then at mr dumphy the latter who had recovered his presence of mind and his old audacity turned them instantly upon him  well what have you got to propose he said with his usual curt formula  it is you have something to say you sent for me said his visitor  yes you left me to find out that there was another grant to that mine what does all this mean ramirez  victor raised his eyes and yellow fringes to the ceiling and said with a shrug  quien sabe there are grants and grants  so it seems but i suppose you know that we have a title now better than any granta mineral discovery  victor bowed and answered with his teeth we eh  yes i am getting up a company for her husband  her husbandgood  dumphy looked at his accomplice keenly there was something in victors manner that was vaguely suspicious dumphy who was one of those men to whose courage the habit of success in all things was essential had been a little shaken by his signal defeat in his interview with poinsett and now became irritable  yesher husband what have you got to propose about it eh nothing well look here i sent for you to say that as everything now is legal and square you might as well dry up in regard to her former relations or your first scheme you sabe dumphy became slangy as he lost his selfcontrol you are to know nothing about miss grace conroy  and there is no more any sister ehonly a wife  exactly  so  you will of course get something for these preliminary steps of yours although you understand they have been useless and that your claim is virtually dead you are in fact in no way connected with her present success unlessunless added dumphy with a gratuitous malice that defeat had engendered unless you expect something for having been the means of making a match between her and gabriel  victor turned a little more yellow in the thin line over his teeth ha ha gooda joke he laughed no i make no charge to you for that not even to you noha ha at the same moment had mr dumphy known what was passing in his mind he would have probably moved a little nearer the door of his countingroom  theres nothing we can pay you for but silence we may as well understand each other regarding that thats your interest its ours only so far as mrs conroys social standing is concerned for i warn you that exposure might seriously compromise you in a business way while it would not hurt us i could get the value of gabriels claim to the mine advanced tomorrow if the whole story were known tonight if you remember the only evidence of a previous discovery exists in a paper in our possession perhaps we pay you for that consider it so if you like consider also that any attempt to get hold of it legally or otherwise would end in its destruction well what do you say all right when the stock is issued ill write you a cheque or perhaps youd take a share of stock  i would prefer the money said victor with a peculiar laugh  dumphy affected to take no notice of the sarcasm your head is level victor he said returning to his papers dont meddle with stocks good day  victor moved toward the door by the way victor said dumphy looking up calmly if you know the owner of this lately discovered grant you might intimate that any litigation wouldnt pay thats what i told their counsel a moment ago  poinsett asked victor pausing with his hand on the door  yes but as he also happens to be philip ashleythe chap who ran off with grace conroy you had better go and see him perhaps he can help you better than i good day  and turning from the petrified victor mr dumphy conscious that he had fully regained his prestige rang his bell to admit the next visitor     chapter iv  mr jack hamlin takes a holiday   for some weeks mr hamlin had not been well or as he more happily expressed it had been off colour the celebrated dr duchesne an exarmy surgeon after a careful diagnosis had made several inquiries of jack in a frank way that delighted mr hamlin and then had said very quietly  you are not doing justice to your profession jack your pulse is 75 and that wont do for a man who habitually deals faro been doing pretty well lately and having a good time eh i thought so youve been running too fast and under too high pressure you must take these weights off the safely valve jackbetter take the blower down altogether bank your fires and run on half steam for the next two months i shall run you you must live like a christian noticing the horror of jacks face he added hastily i mean go to bed before midnight get up before you want to eat more and drink less dont play to win bore yourself thoroughly and by that time ill be able to put you back at that table as strong and cool as ever you used to sing jack sit down at the piano and give me a taste of your quality    there thatll do i thought so youre out of practice and voice do that every day for a week and it will come easier i havent seen you stop and talk to a child for a month whats become of that little bootblack that you used to bedevil ive a devilish good mind to send you to a foundling hospital for the good of the babies and yourself find out some poor ranchero with a dozen children and teach em singing dont mind what you eat as long as you eat regularly id have more hopes of you jack if id dragged you out of starvation camp in the sierras as i did a poor fellow six years ago than finding you here in these luxurious quarters come do as i say and ill stop that weariness dissipate that giddiness get rid of that pain lower that pulse and put you back where you were i dont like your looks jack at all id buck against any bank you ran all night  from which the intelligent reader will i hope and trust perceive that this popular doctors ideas of propriety resided wholly in his intentions with the abstract morality of hamlins profession as a gambler he did not meddle with his competency to practise that profession only was he concerned indeed so frank was he in his expression that a few days later he remarked to a popular clergyman i must put you under the same treatment as i did jack hamlindo you know hima gambler and a capital fellow you remind me of him same kind of troublecured him as i will you and he did  the result of which advice was that in two weeks mr jack hamlin found himself dreadfully bored and ennuyé but loyal to his trust with his physician wandering in the lower coast counties at san luis rey he attended a bullfight and was sorely tempted to back the bull heavily and even conceived the idea of introducing a grizzly bear taking all the odds himself but remembered his promise and fled the fascination and so the next day in a queer oldfashioned diligence he crossed the coast range and drifted into the quiet mission of san antonio here he was so done up and bored with the journey and the unpromising aspect of the town that he quietly yielded his usual profane badinage of the landlord to his loyal henchman and negro bodyservant pete and went to bed at the solitary fonda in the usual fleainfested bedroom of the spanish california inn  what does she look like pete said jack languidly  pete who was familiar with his masters peculiarities of speech knew that the feminine pronoun referred to the town and responded with great gravity  de fac is mahs jack dah dont peah to be much show heah foh you deys playin threecard monte in the bah room but taint no squar game it ud do you no good it might jess rile you deys a fass pinto hoss hitched to a poss in de yarda hoss dat de

hard on dem boys sunday sah and its de lords day mahs jack  partly for the sake of horrifying his attendant who notwithstanding his evil associations was very devout jack gave way to violent denunciation of any system of theology that withheld children from romping with him any day he might select  open that window he groaned finally and shove the bed alongside of it thatll do hand me that novel you neednt read to me today you can finish that volneys ruins another time  it may be remarked here that it had been jacks invalid habit to get pete to read to him as he had provided himself with such books as were objectionable to pete as they were always utterly incomprehensible when filtered through his dialect and as he always made the reader repeat the more difficult words he extracted from this diversion a delicious enjoyment which pete never suspected  you can go now he said when pete had arranged him comfortably i shant want you this afternoon take some money i reckon you wont find any church of your kind here but if anybody interferes with you jest lambaste him if you cant do it jest spot him and i will mr hamlin never allowed anybody but himself to object to his followers religious tendencies have a good time pete dont tangle yourself up if you can help it the liquor about here is jest pizen  with this parting adjuration mr hamlin turned over and tried to devote himself to his book but after reading a few lines the letters somehow got blurred and indistinct and he was obliged to put the book down with a much graver recollection of the doctors warning than he had ever had before he was obliged to confess to a singular weariness and lassitude that had become habitual and to admit that he had more pain at times thanas he put ita man ought to have the idea of his becoming blind or paralysed dawned upon him gradually at first humorously wondering if he couldnt deal faro as well without the use of his legs for instance which were of no account to a man under the table if there could not be raised cards for the blind as well as raised letters the idea of feeling a pair or a flush amused him greatly and then he remembered more gravely poor gordon who becoming gradually paralysed blew his brains out the best thing he could do he soliloquised seriously the reflection however had left such a depressing effect upon his mind that the exaltation of liquor for a moment seemed to be the proper thing for him but the next moment remembering his promise to the doctor he changed his mind andwith an efforthis reflections  for relief he turned his paling face to the window it gave upon a dusty courtyard the soil of which was pulverised by the pawing of countless hoofs during the long dry summer upon a tiled roof that rose above an adobe wall over which again rose the two square whitewashed towers of the mission church between these towers he caught a glimpse of dark green foliage and beyond this the shining sea  it was very hot and dry scarcely a wave of air stirred the curtains of the window that afternoon the tradewinds which usually harried and bullied the little mission of san antonio did not blow and a writhing weeping willow near the window that whipped itself into trifling hysterics on the slightest pretext was surprised into a stony silence even the sea beyond glittered and was breathless it reminded jack of the mouth of the man he met in sacramento at the hotel and again had quarrelled with in san francisco and there absolutely was the man the very man gazing up at the hotel from the shadows of the courtyard jack was instantly and illogically furious had pete been there he would at once have sent an insulting message but while he was looking at him a sound rose upon the air which more pleasantly arrested his attention  it was an organ not a very fine instrument nor skilfully played but an instrument that jack was passionately fond of i forgot to say that he had once occupied the position of organist in the second presbyterian church of sacramento until a growing and more healthy public sentiment detected an incongruity between his secular and sunday occupations and a prominent deacon a successful liquordealer demanded his resignation although he afterwards changed his attentions to a piano he never entirely lost his old affections to become the possessor of a large organ to introduce it gradually educating the public taste as a special feature of a firstclass gambling saloon had always been one of jacks wildest ambitions so he raised himself upon his elbow and listened he could see also that the adjacent building was really a recent addition to the old mission church and that what appeared to be a recess in the wall was only a deeply embrasured window presently a choir of fresh young voices joined the organ mr hamlin listened more attentively it was one of mozarts masses with which he was familiar  for a few moments he forgot his pain and lassitude and lying there hummed in unison and then like a true enthusiast unmindful of his surroundings he lifted his voicea very touching tenor well known among his friendsand joined in drowning i fear the feebler pipe of the little acolytes within indeed it was a fine sight to see this sentimental scamp lying sick nigh unto dissolution through a dissipated life and infamous profession down upon his back in the dingy cuarto of a cheap spanish inn voicing the litanies of the virgin howbeit once started in he sang it through and only paused when the antiphonal voices and organ ceased then he lifted his head and leaning on his elbow looked across the courtyard he had hoped for the appearance of some of the little singers and had all ready a handful of coin to throw to them and a few of those ingenious epithets and persuasive arguments by which he had always been successful with the young but he was disappointed  i reckon school aint out yet he said to himself and was about to lie down again when a face suddenly appeared at the grating of the narrow window  mr hamlin as suddenly became breathless and the colour rose to his pale face he was very susceptible to female beauty and the face that appeared at the grating was that of a very beautiful indian girl he thought and was ready to swear that he had never seen anything half so lovely framed in the recess of the embrasure as a shrine it might have been a shadowed devotional image but that the face was not so angelically beautiful as it was femininely fascinating and that the large deeply fringed eyes had an expression of bright impatience and human curiosity from his secure vantage behind the curtain mr hamlin knew that he could not be seen and so lay and absorbed this lovely bronze apparition which his voice seemed to have evoked from the cold bronze adobe wall and then as suddenly she was gone and the staring sunlight and glittering sea beyond seemed to mr hamlin to have gone too  when pete returned at sunset he was amazed and alarmed to find his master dressed and sitting by the window there was a certain brightness in his eye and an unwonted colour in his cheek that alarmed him still more  you aint bin and gone done nuffin agin de doctors orders mahs jack he began  youll find the whisky flask all right unless youve been dippin into it you infernal old hypocrite responded jack cheerfully accepting the implied suspicion of his servant ive dressed myself because im goin to church tonight to find out where you get your liquor im happy because im virtuous trot out that volneys ruins and wade in youre gettin out o practice pete stop because youre religious do you expect me to starve go and order supper first stop where in blank are you going here youve been gone three hours on an errand for me and if you aint runnin off without a word about it  gone on an errand foh you sah gasped the astonished pete  yes didnt i tell you to go round and see what was the kind of religious dispensation here continued jack with an unmoved face didnt i charge you particularly to observe if the catholic church was such as a professing christian and the former organist of the second presbyterian church of sacramento could attend and now i suppose ive got to find out myself id bet ten to one you aint been there at all  in sheer embarrassment pete began to brush his masters clothes with ostentatious and apologetic diligence and said  ise no papist mahs jack but if id thought  do you suppose im going to sit here without my supper while you abuse the catholic churchthe only church that a gentlemenbut the frightened pete was gone  the angelus bell had just rung and it lacked a full half hour yet before vespers when mr hamlin lounged into the old mission church only a few figures knelt here and theremere vague black shadows in the gloom aided perhaps more by intuition than the light of the dim candles on the high altar he knew that the figure he looked for was not among them and seeking the shadow of a column he calmly waited its approach it seemed a long time a heavylooking woman redolent of garlic came in and knelt nearly opposite a yellow vaquero whom mr hamlin recalled at once as one he had met on the road hithera man whose spanish profanity incited by unruly cattle had excited jacks amused admirationdropped on his knees and with equally characteristic volubility began a supplication to the virgin then two or three men whom jack recognised as the monteplayers of the fonda began as it seemed to jack to bewail their losses in lachrymose accents and then mr hamlin highly excited with a pulse that would have awakened the greatest concern of his doctor became nervously and magnetically aware that some one else was apparently waiting and anxious as himself and had turned his head at the entrance of each one of the congregation it was a figure jack had at first overlooked safe in the shadow of the column he could watch it without being seen himself even in the gloom he could see the teeth and eyes of the man he had observed that afternoonhis old antagonist at sacramento  had it been anywhere else jack would have indulged his general and abstract detestation of victor by instantly picking a quarrel with him as it was he determined upon following him when he left the churchof venting on him any possible chagrin or disappointment he might then have as an excitement to mitigate the unsupportable dreariness of the mission the passions are not so exclusive as moralists imagine for mr hamlin was beginning to have his breast filled with wrath against victor in proportion as his doubts of the appearance of the beautiful stranger grew stronger in his mind when two figures momentarily darkened the church porch and a rustle of silk stole upon his ear a faint odour of spice penetrated through the incense jack looked up and his heart stopped beating  it was she as she reached the stall nearly opposite she put aside her black veil and disclosed the same calm nymphlike face he had seen at the window it was doubly beautiful now even the strange complexion had for jack a bewildering charm she looked around hesitated for a moment and then knelt between the two monteplayers with an almost instinctive movement jack started forward as if to warn her of the contaminating contact and then he stopped his own face crimsoned with shame for the first time he had doubted the morality of his profession  the organ pealed out the incense swam the monotonous voice of the priest rose upon the close sluggish air and mr jack hamlin dreamed a dream he had dispossessed the cold mechanical organist and seating himself at the instrument had summoned all the powers of reed and voice to sing the pæansah me i fear not of any abstract being but of incarnate flesh and blood he heard her pure young voice lifted beside his even in that cold passionless commingling there was joy unspeakable and he knew himself exalted yet he was conscious even in his dream from his own hurried breathing and something that seemed to swell in his throat that he could not have sung a note and then he came back to his senses and a close examination of the figure before him he looked at the graceful shining head the rich lace veil the quiet elegance of attire even to the small satin slipper that stole from beneath her silken robeall united with a refinement and an air of jealous seclusion that somehow removed him to an immeasurable distance  the anthem ceased the last notes of the organ died away and the lady rose half an hour before jack would have gladly stepped forward to have challenged even a passing glance from the beautiful eyes of the stranger now a timidity and distrust new to the man took possession of him he even drew back closer in the shadow as she stepped toward the pillar which supported on its face a font of holy water she had already slipped off her glove and now she leaned forwardso near he could almost feel her warm breathand dipped her long slim fingers into the water as she crossed herself with the liquid symbol jack gave a slight start one or two drops of holy water thrown from her little fingers had fallen on his face     chapter v  victor makes a discovery   happily for mr hamlin the young girl noticed neither the effect of her unconscious baptismal act nor its object but moved away slowly to the door as she did so jack stepped from the shadow of the column and followed her with eyes of respectful awe and yearning she had barely reached the porch when she suddenly and swiftly turned and walked hurriedly back almost brushing against mr hamlin her beautiful eyes were startled and embarrassed her scarlet lips parted and paling rapidly her whole figure and manner agitated and discomposed without noticing him she turned toward the column and under the pretext of using the holy water took hold of the font and leaned against it as if for support with her face averted from the light jack could see her hands tighten nervously on the stone and fancied that her whole figure trembled as she stood there  he hesitated for a moment and then moved to her side not audaciously and confident as was his wont with women but with a boyish colour in his face and a timid halfembarrassed manner  can i do anything for you miss he said falteringly you dont seem to be well i mean you look tired shant i bring you a chair its the heat of this holei mean its so warm here shant i go for a glass of water a carriage  here she suddenly lifted her eyes to his and his voice and presence of mind utterly abandoned him  its nothing she said with a dignified calm as sudden and as alarming to jack as her previous agitationnothing she added fixing her clear eyes on his with a look so frank so open and withal as it seemed to jack so cold and indifferent that his own usually bold glance fell beneath it nothing but the heat and closeness i am better now  shall ibegan jack awkwardly  i want nothing thank you  seeming to think that her conduct required some explanation she added hastily  there was a crowd at the door as i was going out and in the press i felt giddy i thought some onesome manpushed me rudely i daresay i was mistaken  she glanced at the porch against which a man was still leaning  the suggestion of her look and speechif it were a suggestionwas caught instantly by jack without waiting for her to finish the sentence he strode to the door to his wrathful surprise the lounger was victor mr hamlin did not stop for explanatory speech with a single expressive word and a single dexterous movement of his arm and foot he tumbled the astonished victor down the steps at one side and then turned toward his late companion but she had been equally prompt with a celerity quite inconsistent with her previous faintness she seized the moment that victor disappeared to dart by him and gain her carriage which stood in waiting at the porch but as it swiftly drove away mr hamlin caught one grateful glance from those wonderful eyes one smile from those perfect lips and was happy what matters that he had an explanationpossibly a quarrel on his hands ah me i fear this added zest to the rascals satisfaction  a hand was laid on his shoulder he turned and saw the face of the furious victor with every tooth at a white heat and panting with passion mr hamlin smiled pleasantly  why i want to know he ejaculated with an affectation of rustic simplicity if it aint you johnny why darn my skin and this is your house you and st anthony in partnership eh well that gets me and here i tumbled you off your own stoop didnt i i might have known it was you by the way you stood there mightnt i johnny  my name is not johnnycarámba gasped victor almost beside himself with impatient fury  oh its that is it any relation to the carámbas of dutch flat it aint a pretty name i like johnny better and i wouldnt make a row here now not today johnny its sunday id go home id go quietly home and id beat some woman or child to keep myself in training but id go home first i wouldnt draw that knife neither for it might cut your fingers and frighten the folks around town id go home quietly like a good nice little man and in the morning id come round to the hotel on the next square and id ask for mr hamlin mr jack hamlin room no 29 and id go right up to his room and id have such a time with himsuch a high old time id just make that hotel swim with blood  two or three of the monte players had gathered around victor and seemed inclined to take the part of their countryman victor was not slow to improve this moment of adhesion and support  is it dogs that we are my compatriots he said to them bitterly and hethis onea man infamous  mr hamlin who had a quick ear for abusive and interjaculatory spanish overheard him there was a swift chorus of carámba from the allies albeit wholesomely restrained by something in mr hamlins eye which was visible and probably a suspicion of something in mr hamlins pocket which was not visible but the remaining portion of mr hamlin was ironically gracious  friends of yours i suppose he inquired affably carámbas all of them too perhaps theyll call with you maybe they havent time and are in a hurry now if my room isnt large enough and they cant wait theres a handy lot o ground beyond on the next squareplaza del toros eh what did you say im a little deaf in this ear  under the pretence of hearing more distinctly jack hamlin approached the nearest man who i grieve to say instantly and somewhat undignifiedly retreated mr hamlin laughed but already a crowd of loungers had gathered and he felt it was time to end this badinage grateful as it was to his sense of humour so he lifted his hat gravely to victor and his friends replaced it perhaps aggressively tilted a trifle over his straight nose and lounged slowly back to his hotel leaving his late adversaries in secure but unsatisfactory and dishonourable possession of the field once in his own quarters he roused the sleeping pete and insisted upon opening a religious discussion in which to petes great horror he warmly espoused the catholic church averring with several strong expletives that it was the only religion fit for a white man and ending somewhat irreverently by inquiring into the condition of the pistols  meanwhile victor had also taken leave of his friends  he has fledthis most infamous he said he dared not remain and face us thou didst observe his fear tiburcio it was thy great heart that did it  rather he recognised thee my victor and his heart was that of the coyote  it was the mexican nation ever responsive to the appeal of manhood and liberty that made his liver as blanched as that of the chicken returned the gentleman who had retreated from jack let us then celebrate this triumph with a little glass  and victor who was anxious to get away from his friends and saw in the prospective aguardiente a chance for escape generously led the way to the first wineshop  it chanced to be the principal one of the town it had the generic qualitythat is was dirty dingy illsmelling and yellow with cigarette smoke its walls were adorned by various printsone or two french in origin excellent in art and defective in moral sentiment and several of spanish origin infamous in art and admirable in religious feeling it had a portrait of santa anna and another of the latest successful revolutionary general it had an allegorical picture representing the genius of liberty descending with all the celestial machinery upon the mexican confederacy moved apparently by the same taste for poetry and personification the proprietor had added to his artistic collection a highly coloured american handbill representing the angel of healing presenting a stricken family with a bottle of somebodys panacea at the farther extremity of the low room a dozen players sat at a greenbaize table absorbed in monte beyond them leaning against the wall a harpplayer twanged the strings of his instrument in a lugubrious air with that singular stickiness of touch and reluctancy of finger peculiar to itinerant performers on that instrument the cardplayers were profoundly indifferent to both music and performer  the face of one of the players attracted victors attention it was that of the odd english translatorthe irascible stranger upon whom he had intruded that night of his memorable visit to don josé victor had no difficulty in recognising him although his slovenly and negligent workingdress had been changed to his holiday antique black suit he did not lift his eyes from the game until he had lost the few silver coins placed in a pile before him when he rose grimly and nodding brusquely to the other players without speaking left the room  he has lost five halfdollarshis regular limitno more no less said victor to his friend he will not play again tonight  you know of him asked vincente in admiration of his companions superior knowledge  si said victor he is a jackal a dog of the americanos he added vaguely intending to revenge himself on the strangers former brusqueness by this depreciation he affects to know our historyour language is it a question of the fine meaning of a wordthe shade of a technical expressionit is him they ask not us it is thus they treat us these heretics carámba  carámba echoed vincente with a vague patriotism superinduced by aguardiente but victor had calculated to unloose vincentes tongue for his private service  it is the world my friend he said sententiously these americanoscome they here often  you know the great american advocateour frienddon arturo poinsett  yes said victor impatiently comes he  eh does he not laughed vincente always ever eternally he has a clienta widow young handsome rich ehone of his own race  ah you are wise vincente  vincente laughed a weak spirituous laugh  ah it is a transparent fact trulyof a verity believe me  and this fair clientwho is she  donna maria sepulvida said vincente in a drunken whisper  how is this you said she was of his own race  truly i did she is americana but it is years ago she was very young when the americans first came she was of the first she taught the child of the widower don josé sepulvida herself almost a child you understand it was the old story she was pretty and poor and young the don grizzled and old and rich it was fire and tow eh ha ha the don meant to be kind you understand and made a rich wife of the little americana he was kinder than he meant and in two years carámba made a richer widow of the donna  if vincente had not been quite thrown by his potations he would have seen an undue eagerness in victors mouth and eyes  and she is prettytall and slender like the americans ehlarge eyes a sweet mouth  an angel ravishing  and don arturofrom legal adviser turns a lover  it is said responded vincente with drunken cunning and exceeding archness but thou and i victor know better love comes not with a brief eh look it is an old flame believe me it is said it is not two months that he first came here and she fell in love with him at the first glance absurdo disparátado hear me victor it was an old flame an old quarrel made up thou and i have heard the romance before two lovers not rich eh good separation despair the señorita marries the rich man eh  victor was too completely carried away by the suggestion of his friends speech to conceal his satisfaction here was the secret at last here was not only a clue but absolutely the missing grace conroy herself in this young americanathiswidowthis client of her former lover philip ashley he held the secret of three lives in his joy he slapped vincente on the back and swore roundly that he was the wisest of men  i should have seen herthe heroine of this romancemy friend possibly she was at mass  possibly not she is catholic but don arturo is not she does not often attend when he is here  as today  as today  you are wrong friend vincente said victor a little impatiently i was there i saw her  vincente shrugged his shoulders and shook his head with drunken gravity  it is impossible señor victor believe me  i tell you i saw her said victor excitedly borrachon she was there by the pillar as she went out she partook of agua bendita i saw her large eyes an oval face a black dress and mantle  vincente who happily for victor had not heard the epithet of his friend shook his head and laughed a conceited drunken laugh  tell me not this friend victor it was not her thou didst see believe me i am wise it was the donna dolores who partook of agua bendita and alone for there is none thou knowest that has a right to offer it to her look you foolish victor she has large eyes a small mouth an oval face and darkah she is dark  in the dark all are as the devil quoted victor impatiently how should i know who then is she he demanded almost fiercely as if struggling with a rising fear who is this donna dolores  thou art a stranger friend victor hark ye it is the halfbreed daughter of the old commander of san ysabel yet such is the foolishness of old men she is his heiress she is rich and lately she has come into possession of a great grant very valuable thou dost understand friend victor well why dost thou stare she is a recluse marriage is not for her love love the tender the subduing the delicious is not for her she is of the church my victor and to think that thou didst mistake this ascetic this nun this little brown novice this donna dolores salvatierra for the little american coquette ha ha it is worth the fee of another bottle eh victor my friend thou dost not listen eh thou wouldst fly traitor eh whats that thou sayst bobo dupe thyself  for victor stood before him dumb but for that single epithet was he not a dupe had he not been cheated again and this time by a blunder in his own malice if he had really as he believed identified grace conroy in this darkfaced devotee whose name he now learned for the first time by what diabolical mischance had he deliberately put her in possession of the forged grant and so blindly restored her the missing property could don pedro have been treacherous could he have known could they allarthur poinsett dumphy and julie devargeshave known this fact of which he alone was ignorant were they not laughing at him now the thought was madness  with a vague impression of being shaken rudely off by a passionate hand and a drunken vision of a ghastly and passionate face before him uttering words of impotent rage and baffled despair vincente the wise and valiant came slowly and amazedly to himself lying over the table but his late companion was gone     chapter vi  an expert   a cold grey fog had that night stolen noiselessly in from the sea and after possessing the town had apparently intruded itself in the long low plain before the hacienda of the rancho of the holy trinity where it sullenly lingered even after the morning sun had driven in its eastern outposts viewed from the mission towers it broke a cold grey sea against the corral of the hacienda and half hid the white walls of the hacienda itself it was characteristic of the rancho that under such conditions at certain times it seemed to vanish entirely from the sight or rather to lose and melt itself into the outlines of the low foothills and mr perkins the english translator driving a buggy that morning in that direction was forced once or twice to stop and take his bearings anew until the grey sea fell and the hacienda again heaved slowly into view  although mr perkins transformations were well known to his intimate associates it might have been difficult for any stranger to have recognised the slovenly drudge of pacific street in the antique dandy who drove the buggy mr perkins hair was brushed curled and darkened by dye a high stock of a remote fashion encompassed his neck above which his face whitened by cosmetics to conceal his high complexion rested stiffly and expressionless as a mask a light blue coat buttoned tightly over his breast and a pair of closefitting trousers strapped over his japanned leather boots completed his remarkable ensemble it was a figure well known on montgomery street after three oclockseldom connected with the frousy visitor of the pacific street den and totally unrecognisable on the plains of san antonio  it was evident however that this figure eccentric as it was was expected at the hacienda and recognised as having an importance beyond its antique social distinction for when mr perkins drew up in the courtyard the grave major domo at once ushered him into the formal lowstudded drawingroom already described in these pages and in another instant the donna dolores salvatierra stood before him  with a refined womans delicacy of perception donna dolores instantly detected under this bizarre exterior something that atoned for it which she indicated by the depth of the halfformal curtsey she made it mr perkins met the salutation with a bow equally formal and respectful he was evidently agreeably surprised at his reception and impressed with her manner but like most men of illassured social position he was a trifle suspicious and on the defensive with a graceful gesture of her fan the donna pointed to a chair but her guest remained standing  i am a stranger to you señor but you are none to me she said with a gracious smile before i ventured upon the boldness of seeking this interview your intelligence your experience your honourable report was already made known to me by your friends let me call myself one of theseeven before i break the business for which i have summoned you  the absurd figure bowed again but even through the pitiable chalk and cosmetics of its complexion an embarrassed colour showed itself donna dolores noticed it but delicately turned toward an oldfashioned secretary and opened it to give her visitor time to recover himself she drew from a little drawer a folded legallooking document and then placing two chairs beside the secretary seated herself in one thus practically reminded of his duty mr perkins could no longer decline the proffered seat  i suppose said donna dolores that my business although familiar to you generallyalthough you are habitually consulted upon just such questionsmay seem strange to you when you frankly learn my motives here is a grant purporting to have been made to myfatherthe late don josé salvatierra examine it carefully and answer me a single question to the best of your judgment she hesitated and then addedlet me say before you answer yes or no that to me there are no pecuniary interests involvednothing that should make you hesitate to express an opinion which you might be called upon legally to prove that you will never be required to give your answer will be accepted by me in confidence will not as far as the world is concerned alter the money value of this documentwill leave you free hereafter to express a different opinion or even to reverse your judgment publicly if the occasion requires it you seem astounded señor perkins but i am a rich woman i have no need to ask your judgment to increase my wealth  your question issaid mr perkins speaking for the first time without embarrassment  is that document a forgery  he took it out of her hand opened it with a kind of professional carelessness barely glanced at the signature and seals and returned it  the signatures are genuine he said with businesslike brevity then he added as if in explanation of that brevity i have seen it before  donna dolores moved her chair with the least show of uneasiness the movement attracted mr perkins attention it was something novel here was a woman who appeared actually annoyed that her claim to a valuable property was valid he fixed his eyes upon her curiously  then you think it is a genuine grant she said with a slight sigh  as genuine as any that receive a patent at washington he replied promptly  ah said donna dolores simply the feminine interjection appeared to put a construction upon señor perkins reply that both annoyed and challenged him he assumed the defensive  have you any reason to doubt the genuineness of this particular document  yes it was only recently discovered among don josés papers and there is another in existence  señor perkins again reached out his hand took the paper examined it attentively held it to the light and then laid it down it is all right he said where is the other  i have it not said donna dolores  señor perkins shrugged his shoulders respectfully as to donna dolores but scornfully of an unbusinesslike sex how did you expect me to institute a comparison  there is no comparison necessary if that document is genuine said the donna quickly  señor perkins was embarrassed for a moment i mean there might be some mistake under what circumstances is it heldwho holds it to whom was it given  that is a part of my story it was given five years ago to a dr devargesi beg your pardon did you speak  señor perkins had not spoken but was staring with grim intensity at donna dolores yousaiddr devarges he repeated slowly  yes did you know him it was donna dolores turn to be embarrassed she bit her lip and slightly contracted her eyebrows for a moment they both stood on the defensive  i have heard the name before mr perkins said at last with a forced laugh  yes it is the name of a distinguished savant said donna dolores composedly wellhe is dead but he gave this grant to a young girl namednameddolores paused as if to recall the namenamed grace conroy  she stopped and raised her eyes quickly to her companion but his face was unmoved and his momentary excitement seemed to have passed he nodded his head for her to proceed  named grace conroy repeated donna dolores more rapidly and with freer breath after the lapse of five years a womanan impostorappears to claim the grant under the name of grace conroy but perhaps finding difficulty in carrying out her infamous scheme by some wicked wicked art she gains the affections of the brother of this grace and marries him as the next surviving heir and donna dolores paused a little out of breath with a glow under her burnished cheek and a slight metallic quality in her voice it was perhaps no more than the natural indignation of a quickly sympathising nature but mr perkins did not seem to notice it in fact within the last few seconds his whole manner had become absent and preoccupied the stare which he had fixed a moment before on donna dolores was now turned to the wall and his old face under its juvenile mask looked still older  certainly certainly he said at last recalling himself with an effort but all this only goes to prove that the grant may be as fraudulent as the owner then you have nothing really to make you suspicious of your own claim but the fact of its recent discovery well that i dont think need trouble you remember your grant was given when lands were not valuable and your late father might have overlooked it as unimportant he rose with a slight suggestion in his manner that the interview had closed he appeared anxious to withdraw and not entirely free from the same painful preabsorption that he had lately shown with a slight shade of disappointment in her face donna dolores also rose  in another moment he would have been gone and the lives of these two people thus brought into natural yet mysterious contact have flowed on unchanged in each monotonous current but as he reached the door he turned to ask a trivial question on that question trembled the future of both  this real grace conroy then i suppose has disappeared and thisdoctordevargeshe hesitated at the name as something equally fictitiousyou say is dead how then did this impostor gain the knowledge necessary to set up the claim who is she  oh she isthat isshe married gabriel conroy under the name of the widow of dr devarges pardon me i did not hear what you said holy virgin what is the matter you are ill let me call sanchez sit here  he dropped into a chair but only for an instant as she turned to call assistance he rose and caught her by the arm  i am better he said it is nothingi am often taken in this way dont look at me dont call anybody except to get me a glass of waterthere that will do  he took the glass she brought him and instead of drinking it threw back his head and poured it slowly over his forehead and face as he leaned backward in the chair then he drew out a large silk handkerchief and wiped his face and hair until they were dry then he sat up and faced her the chalk and paint was off his face his high stock had become unbuckled he had unbuttoned his coat and it hung loosely over his gaunt figure his hair although still dripping seemed to have become suddenly bristling and bushy over his red face but he was perfectly selfpossessed and his voice had completely lost its previous embarrassment  rush of blood to the head he said quietly felt it coming on all the morning gone now nothing like cold water and sitting posture hope i didnt spoil your carpet and now to come back to your business he drew up his chair without the least trace of his former diffidence beside donna dolores lets take another look at your grant he took it up drew a small magnifying glass from his pocket and examined the signature yes yes signature all right seal of the custom house paper all regular he rustled it in his fingers youre all rightthe swindle is with madame devarges theres the forgerytheres this spurious grant  i think not said donna dolores quietly  why  suppose the grant is exactly like this in everything paper signature seal and all  that proves nothing said mr perkins quickly look you when this grant was drawnin the early daysthere were numbers of these grants lying in the custom house like waste paper drawn and signed by the governor in blank only wanting filling in by a clerk to make them a valid document shethis impostorthis madame devarges has had access to these blanks as many have since the american conquest and that grant is the result but she is not wise no i know the handwriting of the several copyists and clerksi was one myself put me on the stand donna doloresput me on the stand and ill confront her as i have the others  you forget said donna dolores coldly that i have no desire to legally test this document and if spanish grants are so easily made why might not this one of mine be a fabrication you say you know the handwriting of the copyistslook at this  mr perkins seized the grant impatiently and ran his eye quickly over the interlineations between the printed portions strange he muttered this is not my own nor sanchez nor ruiz it is a new hand ah what have we herea correction in the datein still another hand and thissurely i have seen something like it in the office but where he stopped ran his fingers through his hair but after an effort at recollection abandoned the attempt but why he said abruptly why should this be forged  suppose that the other were genuine and suppose that this woman got possession of it in some wicked way suppose that some one knowing of this endeavoured by this clever forgery to put difficulties in her way without exposing her  but who would do that  perhaps the brotherher husband perhaps some one continued donna dolores embarrassedly with the colour struggling through her copper cheek someonewhodidnotbelieve that the real grace conroy was dead or missing  suppose the devili beg your pardon but people dont forge documents in the interests of humanity and justice and why should it be given to you  i am known to be a rich woman said donna dolores i believe she added dropping her eyes with a certain proud diffidence that troubled even the preoccupied man before her ibelievethat is i am toldthat i have a reputation for being liberal andand just  mr perkins looked it her for a moment with undisguised admiration but suppose he said with a bitterness that seemed to grow out of that very contemplation suppose this woman this adventuress this impostor were a creature that made any such theory impossible suppose she were one who could poison the very life and soul of any manto say nothing of the man who was legally bound to her suppose she were a devil who could deceive the mind and heart who could make the very man she was betraying most believe her guiltless and sinned against suppose she were capable of not even the weakness of passion but that all her acts were shrewd selfish precalculated even to a smile or a teardo you think such a womanwhom thank god such as you cannot even imaginedo you suppose such a woman would not have guarded against even this no no  unless said donna dolores leaning against the secretary with the glow gone from her dark face and a strange expression trembling over her mouth unless it were the revenge of some rival  her companion started good it is so he muttered to himself i would have done it i could have done it you are right donna dolores he walked to the window and then came hurriedly back buttoning his coat as he did so and rebuckling his stock some one is coming leave this matter with me i will satisfy you and myself concerning this affair will you trust this paper with me donna dolores without a word placed it in his hand thank you he said with a slight return of his former embarrassment that seemed to belong to his ridiculous stock and his buttoned coat rather than any physical or moral quality dont believe me entirely disinterested either he added with a strange smile adios  she would have asked another question but at that instant the clatter of hoofs and sound of voices arose from the courtyard and with a hurried bow he was gone the door opened again almost instantly to the bright laughing face and coquettish figure of mrs sepulvida  well said that little lady as soon as she recovered her breath for a religiously inclined young person and a notorious recluse i must say you certainly have more masculine company than falls to the lot of the worldly here i ran across a couple of fellows hanging around the casa as i drove up and come in only to find you closeted with an old exquisite who was itanother lawyer dear i declare its too bad i have only one  and that one is enough eh smiled donna dolores somewhat gravely as she playfully tapped mrs sepulvidas fair cheek with her fan  oh yes she blushed a little coquettishlyof course and here i rode over post haste to tell you the news but first tell me who is that wicked dashinglooking fellow outside the courtyard it cant be the lawyers clerk  i dont know who you mean but it is i suppose said donna dolores a little wearily but tell me the news i am all attention  but mrs sepulvida ran to the deep embrasured window and peeped out it isnt the lawyer for he is driving away in his buggy as if he were hurrying to get out of the fog and my gentleman still remains dolores said mrs sepulvida suddenly facing her friend with an expression of mock gravity and humour this wont do who is that cavalier  with a terrible feeling that she was about to meet the keen eyes of victor donna dolores drew near the window from the side where she could look out without being herself seen her first glance at the figure of the stranger satisfied her that her fears were unfounded it was not victor reassured she drew the curtain more boldly at that instant the mysterious horseman wheeled and she met full in her own the black eyes of mr jack hamlin donna dolores instantly dropped the curtain and turned to her friend  i dont know  truly dolores  truly maria  well i believe you i suppose then it must be me  donna dolores smiled and playfully patted mrs sepulvidas joyous face  well then she said invitingly  well then responded mrs sepulvida half in embarrassment and half in satisfaction  the news said donna dolores  ohwell said mrs sepulvida with mock deliberation it has come at last  it has said donna dolores looking gravely at her friend  yes he has been there again today  and he asked you said donna dolores opening her fan and turning her face toward the window  he asked me  and you said  mrs sepulvida tripped gaily toward the window and looked out  i said  what  no     book v  the vein     chapter i  in which gabriel recognises the proprieties   after the visit of mr peter dumphy one horse gulch was not surprised at the news of any stroke of good fortune it was enough that he the great capitalist the successful speculator had been there the information that a company had been formed to develop a rich silver mine recently discovered on conroys hill was received as a matter of course already the theories of the discovery were perfectly well established that it was simply a grand speculative coup of dumphysthat upon a boldly conceived plan this man intended to build up the town of one horse gulchthat he had invented the lead and backed it by an ostentatious display of capital in mills and smelting works solely for a speculative purpose that five years before he had selected gabriel conroy as a simpleminded tool for this design that gabriels two and one half millions was merely an exaggerated form of expressing the exact wagesone thousand dollars a year which was all dumphy had paid him for the use of his name and that it was the duty of every man to endeavour to realise quickly on the advance of property before this enormous bubble burstthis was the theory of onehalf the people of one horse gulch on the other hand there was a large party who knew exactly the reverse that the whole thing was purely accidental that mr peter dumphy being called by other business to one horse gulch while walking with gabriel conroy one day had picked up a singular piece of rock on gabriels claim and had said this looks like silver that gabriel conroy had laughed at the suggestion whereat mr peter dumphy who never laughed had turned about curtly and demanded in his usual sharp business way will you take seventeen millions for all your right and title to this claim that gabrielyou know what a blank fool gabe ishad assented and this way sir actually disposed of a property worth on the lowest calculation one hundred and fifty millions this was the generally accepted theory of the other and more imaginative portion of one horse gulch  howbeit within the next few weeks following the advent of mr dumphy the very soil seemed to have quickened through that sunshine and all over the settlement pieces of plank and scantlingthin blades of new dwellingsstarted up under that beneficent presence on the bleak hill sides the more extensive foundations of the conroy smelting works were laid the modest boardinghouse and restaurant of mrs markle was found inadequate to the wants and inconsistent with the greatness of one horse gulch and a new hotel was erected but here i am anticipating another evidence of progressnamely the daily newspaper in which these events were reported with a combination of ease and elegance one may envy yet never attain said the times       the grand conroy house now being inaugurated will be managed      by mrs susan markle whose talents as a chef de cuisine are      as well known to one horse gulch as her rare social graces and      magnificent personal charms she will be aided by her former      accomplished assistant miss sarah clark as hashslinger sal      can walk over anything of her weight in plumas  with these and other evidences of an improvement in public taste the old baleful title of one horse gulch was deemed incongruous it was proposed to change that name to silveropolis there being in the figurative language of the gulch more than one horse could draw  meanwhile the nominal and responsible position of superintendent of the new works was filled by gabriel although the actual business and executive duty was performed by a sharp snappy young fellow of about half gabriels size supplied by the company this was in accordance with the wishes of gabriel who could not bear idleness and the company although distrusting his administrative ability wisely recognised his great power over the workmen through the popularity of his easy democratic manners and his disposition always to lend his valuable physical assistance in cases of emergency gabriel had become a great favourite with the men ever since they found that prosperity had not altered his simple nature it was pleasant to them to be able to point out to a stranger this plain unostentatious powerful giant working like themselves and with themselves with the added information that he owned half the mine and was worth seventeen millions always a shy and rather lonely man his wealth seemed to have driven him by its very oppressiveness to the society of his humble fellows for relief a certain deprecatoriness of manner whenever his riches were alluded to strengthened the belief of some in that theory that he was merely the creature of dumphys speculation  although gabriel was always assigned a small and insignificant part in the present prosperity of one horse gulch it was somewhat characteristic of the peculiar wrongheadedness of this community that no one ever suspected his wife of any complicity in it it had been long since settled that her superiority to her husband was chiefly the feminine charm of social grace and physical attraction that warmed by the sunshine of affluence this butterfly would wantonly flit from flower to flower and eventually quit her husband and one horse gulch for some more genial clime was never doubted shell make them millions fly ef she hez to fly with it was the tenor of local criticism a pity not unmixed with contempt was felt for gabriels apparent indifference to this prophetic outlook his absolute insensibility to his wifes ambiguous reputation was looked upon as the hopelessness of a thoroughly deceived man even mrs markle whose attempts to mollify olly had been received coldly by that young womaneven she was a convert to the theory of the complete domination of the conroy household by this alien and stranger  but despite this baleful prophecy mrs conroy did not fly nor show any inclination to leave her husband a new house was built with that rapidity of production that belonged to the climate among the pines of conroys hill which on the hottest summer day still exuded the fresh sap of its green timbers and exhaled a woodland spicery here the good taste of mrs conroy flowered in chintz and was always fresh and feminine in white muslin curtains and pretty carpets and here the fraternal love of gabriel brought a grand piano for the use of olly and a teacher hither also came the best citizens of the countyeven the notabilities of the state feeling that mr dumphy had to a certain extent made one horse gulch respectable soon found out also that mrs conroy was attractive the hon blank had dined there on the occasion of his last visit to his constituents of the gulch the hon judge beeswinger had told in her parlour several of his most effective stories colonel starbottles manly breast had dilated over her dishcovers and he had carried away with him not only a vivid appreciation of her charms capable of future eloquent expression but an equally vivid idea of his own fascinations equally incapable of concealment gabriel himself rarely occupied the house except for the exigencies of food and nightly shelter if decoyed there at other times by specious invitations of olly he compromised by sitting on the back porch in his shirt sleeves alleging as a reason his fear of the contaminating influence of his short black pipe  dont ye mind me july he would say when his spouse with anxious face and deprecatory manner would waive her native fastidiousness and aver that she liked it dont ye mind me i admire to sit out yer im a heap more comfortable outer doors and allus waz i reckon the smell might get into them curtings and thenand then added gabriel quietly ignoring the look of pleased expostulation with which mrs conroy recognised this fancied recognition of her tastes and then ollys friends and thet teacher not being round like you and me allez and used to it they mightnt like it and ive heerd that the smell of niggerhead terbacker do git inter the strings of a pianner and kinder stops the music a pianners a mighty curus thing ive heerd say theyre as dilikit and ailin ez a child look in em and see them little strings a twistin and crossin each other like the reins of a six mule team and it taint no wonder they gets mixed up often  it was not gabriels way to notice his wifes manner very closely but if he had at that moment he might have fancied that there were other instruments whose fine chords were as subject to irritation and discordant disturbance perhaps only vaguely conscious of some womanish sullenness on his wifes part gabriel would at such times disengage himself as being the possible disorganising element and lounge away his favourite place of resort was his former cabin now tenantless and in rapid decay but which he had refused to dispose of even after the erection of his two later dwellings rendered it an unnecessary and unsightly encumbrance of his lands he loved to linger by the deserted hearth and smoke his pipe in solitude not from any sentiment conscious or unconscious but from a force of habit that was in this lonely man almost as pathetic  he may have become aware at this time that a certain growing disparity of sentiment and taste which he had before noticed with a vague pain and wonder rendered his gradual separation from olly a necessity of her welldoing he had indeed revealed this to her on several occasions with that frankness which was natural to him he had apologised with marked politeness to her music teacher who once invited him to observe ollys proficiency by saying in general terms that he took no stock in chunes i reckon its about ez easy miss if ye dont ring me in thet chiles got to get on without thinkin o meor my pinionallowin it was wuth thinkin on once meeting olly walking with some older and more fashionable school friends whom she had invited from sacramento he had delicately avoided them with a sudden and undue consciousness of his great bulk and his slow moving intellect painfully sensitive to what seemed to him to be the preternatural quickness of the young people and turned into a bypath  on the other hand it is possible that with the novelty of her new situation and the increased importance that wealth brought to olly she had become more and more oblivious of her brothers feelings and perhaps less persistent in her endeavours to draw him toward her she knew that he had attained an equal importance among his fellows from this very wealth and also a certain evident palpable superficial respect which satisfied her with her restless ambition and the new life that was opening before her his slower oldfashioned methods his absolute rusticitythat day by day appeared more strongly in contrast to his surroundingsbegan to irritate where it had formerly only touched her sensibilities from this irritation she at last escaped by the unfailing processes of youth and the fascination of newer impressions and so day by day and hour by hour they drifted slowly apart until one day mrs conroy was pleasantly startled by an announcement from gabriel that he had completed arrangements to send olly to boardingschool in sacramento it was understood also that this was only a necessary preliminary to the departure of herself and husband for a longpromised tour of europe  as it was impossible for one of gabriels simple nature to keep his plans entirely secret olly was perfectly aware of his intention and prepared for the formal announcement which she knew would come in gabriels quaint serious way in the critical attitude which the child had taken toward him she was more or less irritated as an older person might have been with the grave cautiousness with which gabriel usually explained that conduct and manner which was perfectly apparent and open from the beginning it was during a long walk in which the pair had strayed among the evergreen woods when they came upon the little dismantled cabin here gabriel stopped olly glanced around the spot and shrugged her shoulders gabriel more mindful of ollys manner than he had ever been of any other of her sex instantly understood it  it aint a purty place olly he began rubbing his hands but weve had high ole times yeryou and me dont ye mind the nights i used to kem up from the gulch and pitch in to mendin your gownds olly and you asleep dont ye mind thatar dress i copper fastened and gabriel laughed loudly and yet a little doubtfully  olly laughed too but not quite so heartily as her brother and cast her eyes down upon her own figure gabriel followed the direction of her glance it was not perhaps easy to recreate in the figure before him the outré little waif who such a short timesuch a long timeago had sat at his feet in that very cabin it is not alone that olly was better dressed and her hair more tastefully arranged but she seemed in some way to have become more refined and fastidiousa fastidiousness that was plainly an outgrowth of something that she possessed but he did not as he looked at her another vague hope that he had fostereda fond belief that as she grew taller she would come to look like grace and so revive the missing sister in his memorythis seemed to fade away before him yet it was characteristic of the unselfishness of his nature that he did not attribute this disappointment to her alone but rather to some latent principle in human nature whereof he had been ignorant he had even gone so far as to invite criticism on a hypothetical case from the sagacious johnson its the difference atween human natur and brute natur that philosopher had answered promptly a purps the same purp allez even arter its a grown dorg but a child aintits the difference atween reason and instink  but olly to whom this scene recalled another circumstance did not participate in gabriels particular reminiscence  dont you remember gabe she said quickly the first night that sister july came here and stood right in that very door lord how flabergasted we was to be sure and if anybodyd told me gabe that she was going to marry youid id a knocked em down she blurted out after hesitating for a suitable climax  gabriel who in his turn did not seem to be particularly touched with ollys form of reminiscence rose instantly above all sentiment in a consideration of the proprieties ye shouldnt talk o knockin people down ollyit aint decent for a young gal he said quickly not that i mind it he added with his usual apology but allowin that some of them purty little friends o yours or teacher now should hear ye sit down for a spell olly ive suthin to tell ye  he took her hand in his and made her sit beside him on the rude stone that served as the old doorstep of the cabin  maybe ye might remember he went on lightly lifting her hand in his and striking it gently across his knee to beget an easy confidential manner maybe ye might remember that i allers allowed to do two things ef ever i might make a strikeone was to give you a good schoolinthe other was to find grace if so be as she was above the yearth they waz many ways o finding outmany ways o settin at it but they warnt my ways i allus allowed that ef thet child was in harkenin distance o the reach o my call shed hear me i mout have took other men to help memen ez was sharp in them things men ez was in that tradebut i didnt and why  olly intimated by an impatient shake of her head that she didnt know  because she was that shy and skary with strangers ye disremember how shy she was olly in them days for ye was too young to notice and then not bein shy yourself but sorter peart free and promisskiss ready and able to keep up your end of a conversation with anybody and allus ez chipper as a jaybirdwhy ye dont kinder allow that fur gracy as i do and thar was reasons why that purty chile should be shyreasons ye dont understand now olly but reasons powful and strong to such a child as thet  ye mean gabe said the shamelessly direct olly that she was bashful hevin ran away with her bo  that perplexity which wiser students of human nature than gabriel have experienced at the swift perception of childhood in regard to certain things left him speechless he could only stare hopelessly at the little figure before him  well wot did you do gabe go on said olly impatiently  gabriel drew a long breath  thar bein certing reasons why gracy should be thet shyreasons consarning propperty o her deceased parients boldly invented gabriel with a lofty ignoring of ollys baser suggestion i reckoned that she should get the first word from me and not from a stranger i knowed she warnt in californy or shed hev seen them handbills i issued five years ago what did i do thar is a paper wots printed in new york called the herald thar is a place in that thar paper whar they print notisses to people that is fur fur away they is precious words from fathers to their sons from husbands to their wives from brothers to sisters ez cant find each other from  from sweethearts to thar bos said olly briskly i know  gabriel paused in speechless horror  yes continued olly they calls em personals lord i know all bout them gals get bos by them gabe  gabriel looked up at the bright arching vault above him yet it did not darken nor split into fragments and he hesitated was it worth while to go on was there anything he could tell this terrible childhis own sisterwhich she did not already know better than he  i wrote one o them pursonals he went on to say doggedly in this ways he paused and fumbling in his waistcoat pocket finally drew out a wellworn newspaper slip and straightening it with some care from its multitudinous enfoldings read it slowly and with that peculiar patronising selfconsciousness which distinguishes the human animal in the rehearsal of its literary composition       ef g c will communicate with sufferin and anxious friends      she will confer a favour on ole gabe i will come and see her      and olly will rise up and welcome her ef g c is sick or      dont want to come she will write to g c g c is same as      usual and so is olly all is well address g c one horse      gulch californytill further notiss  read it over again said olly  gabriel did so readily  aint it kinder mixed up with them g cs queried the practical olly  not for she responded gabriel quickly thats just what july said when i showed her the pursonal but i sed to her as i sez to you it taint no puzzle to gracy she knows ez our letters is the same and ef it pears queer to strangers wots the odds thets the idee ov a pursonal howsomever its all right olly fur he continued lowering his voice confidentially and drawing is sister closer to his side its bin ansered  by grace asked olly  no said gabriel in some slight confusion not by grace exactlythat isbut yers the anser he drew from his bosom a small chamoisskin purse such as miners used for their loose gold and extracted the more precious slip read it he said to olly turning away his head  olly eagerly seized and read the paper       g clook no more for the missing one who will never return      look at home be happyp a  olly turned the slip over in her hands is that all she asked in a higher key with a rising indignation in her pink cheeks  thats all responded gabriel short and shythats gracy all over  then all i got to say is its mean said olly bringing her brown fist down on her knee and thats wot id say to that thar p athat philip ashleyif i met him  a singular look quite unlike the habitual placid goodhumoured expression of the man crossed gabriels face as he quietly reached out and took the paper from ollys hand  thets why im goin off he said simply  goin off repeated olly  goin offto the states to new york he responded july and me july sezand shes a peart sort o woman in her way ef not o your kind olly he interpolated apologetically but powful to argyfy and plan and she allows ez new york ud natrally be the stampin ground o sich a hightoned feller ez him and thats why i want to talk to ye olly thars only two things ez ud ever part you and me dear and one on em ez this very thingits my dooty to gracy and the other ez my dooty to you et aint to be expected that when you oughter be gettin your edykation youd be cavortin round the world with me and youll stop yer at sacramento in a a1 firstclass school ontil i come back are ye harknin dear  yes said olly fixing her clear eyes on her brother  and ye aint to worrit about me and it ud be as well olly ez youd forget all bout this yer gulch and the folks fur yer to be a lady and in bein thet brother gabe dont want ennythin to cross ye and i want to say to thet feller olly ye aint to jedge this yer fammerly by me fur the men o that fammerly ginrally speakin runs to size and aint so to speak strong up yer continued gabriel placing his hands on his sandy curls but thars a little lady in school in californy ez is jest what gracy would hev bin if shed had the schoolin and ef ye wants to converse with her she kin give you pints enny time and then i brings you up and natrally i reckon thet you aint goin back on brother gabein stronomy grammar rithmetic and them things  but wots the use of huntin grace if she says shell never return said olly sharply  ye musnt read them pursonals ez ef they was square theyre kinder conundrums ye knowpuzzles it says g c will never return well spose g c has another name dont you see  married maybe said olly clapping her hands  surely said gabriel with a slight colour in his cheeks thets so  but spose it doesnt mean grace after all persisted olly  gabriel was for a moment staggered  but july sez it does he answered doubtfully  olly looked as if this evidence was not entirely satisfactory  but what does look at home mean she continued  thets it said gabriel eagerly thet readslook at little ollyaint she there and thets like gracyallus thinkin o somebody else  well said olly ill stop yer and let you go but wot are you goin to do without me  gabriel did not reply the setting sun was so nearly level with his eyes that it dazzled them and he was fain to hide them among the clustering curls of olly as he held the girls head in both his hands after a moment he said  do ye want to know why i like this old cabin and this yer chimbly olly  yes said olly whose eyes were also affected by the sun and who was glad to turn them to the object indicated  it aint because you and me hez sot there many and many a day fur thats suthin that we aint goin to think about any more its because olly the first lick i ever struck with a pick on this hill was just yer and i raised this yer chimbly with the rock folks thinks thet it was over yonder in the slope whar i struck the silver lead thet i first druv a pick but it warnt and i sometimes think olly that ive had as much square comfort outer thet first lick ez ill ever get outer the lead yonder but come olly come july will be wonderin whar you is and thers a stranger yonder comin up the road and i reckon i aint ez fine a lookin bo ez a young lady ez you ez orter to comand never mind olly he neednt know ez you and me is any relashuns come  in spite of gabriels precautionary haste the stranger who was approaching by the only trail which led over the rocky hillside perceived the couple and turned toward them interrogatively gabriel was forced to stop not however without first giving a slight reassuring pressure to ollys hand  can you tell me the way to the hotelthe grand conroy house i think they call it the traveller asked politely  he would have been at any time an aweinspiring and aggressive object to one horse gulch and to gabriel and at this particular moment he was particularly discomposing he was elaborately dressed buttoned and patentleather booted in the extreme limit of some bygone fashion and had the added effrontery of spotless ruffled linen as he addressed gabriel he touched a tall black hat sacred in that locality to clergymen and gamblers to add to gabriels discomfiture at the mention of the grand conroy house he had felt olly stiffen aggressively under his hand  foller this yer trail to the foot of the hill and yell strike main street thatll fetch ye thar id go with ye a piece but im imployed said gabriel with infinite tact and artfulness accenting each word with a pinch of ollys arm imployed by this yer young ladys friends to see her home and bein a partikler sort o fammerly they makes a row when i dont come reglar axin your parding dont they miss and to stop any possible retort from olly before she could recover from her astonishment he had hurried her into the shadows of the evergreen pines of conroy hill     chapter ii  transient guests at the grand conroy   the grand conroy hotel was new and had the rare virtue of comparative cleanliness as yet the odours of bygone dinners and forgotten suppers and long dismissed breakfasts had not possessed and permeated its halls and passages there was no distinctive flavour of preceding guests in its freshly clothed and papered rooms there was a certain virgin coyness about it and even the active ministration of mrs markle and sal was delicately veiled from the public by the interposition of a barkeeper and irish waiter only to a few of the former habitués did these ladies appear with their former frankness and informality there was a public parlour glittering with gilt framed mirrors and gorgeous with red plush furniture which usually froze the geniality of one horse gulch and repressed its larger expression but there was a little sittingroom beyond sacred to the widow and her lieutenant sal where visitors were occasionally admitted among the favoured few who penetrated this arcana was lawyer maxwell he was a widower and was supposed to have a cynical distrust of the sex that was at once a challenge to them and a source of danger to himself  mrs markle was of course fully aware that mrs conroy had been maxwells client and that it was while on a visit to him she had met with the accident that resulted in her meeting with gabriel unfortunately mrs markle was unable to entirely satisfy herself if there had been any previous acquaintance maxwell had declared to her that to the best of his knowledge there had been none and that the meeting was purely accidental he could do this without violating the confidence of his client and it is fair to presume that upon all other matters he was loyally uncommunicative that madame devarges had consulted him regarding a claim to some property was the only information he imparted in doing this however he once accidentally stumbled and spoke of mrs devarges as grace conroy mrs markle instantly looked up i mean mrs conroy he said hastily  gracethat was his sister who was lostwasnt it  yes replied maxwell demurely did he ever talk much to you about her  noo said mrs markle with great frankness he and me only talked on ginral topics but from what olly used to let on i reckon that sister was the only woman he ever loved  lawyer maxwell who with an amused recollection of his extraordinary interview with gabriel in regard to the woman before him was watching her mischievously suddenly became grave i guess youll find mrs markle that his present wife amply fills the place of his lost sister he said more seriously than had intended  never said mrs markle quickly not shethe designin crafty hussy  i am afraid you are not doing her justice said maxwell wiping away a smile from his lips after his characteristic habit but then its not strange that two bright pretty women are unable to admire each other what reason have you to charge her with being designing he asked again with a sudden return of his former seriousness  why her marryin him responded mrs markle frankly look at that simple shy bashful critter do you suppose hed marry hermarry any womanthat didnt throw herself at his head eh  mrs markles pique was so evident that even a philosopher like maxwell could not content himself with referring it to the usual weakness of the sex no man cares to have a woman exhibit habitually her weakness for another man even when he possesses the power of restraining it he answered somewhat quickly as he raised his hand to his mouth to wipe away the smile that however did not come but suppose that youand othersare mistaken in gabriels character suppose all this simplicity and shyness is a mask suppose he is one of the most perfect and successful actors on or off the stage suppose he should turn out to have deceived everybodyeven his present wifeand lawyer maxwell stopped in time  mrs markle instantly fired suppose fiddlesticks and flapjacks id as soon think o suspectin thet child she said pointing to the unconscious manty you lawyers are allus suspectin what you cant understand she paused as maxwell wiped his face again what do you mean anywaywhy dont yer speak out what do you know of him  oh nothing only its as fair to say all this of him as of heron about the same evidence for instance heres a simple ignorant fellow  he aint ignorant interrupted mrs markle sacrificing argument to loyalty  well this grownup child he discovers the biggest lead in one horse gulch manages to get the shrewdest financier in california to manage it for him and that too after he has snatched up an heiress and a pretty woman before the rest of em got a sight of her that may be simplicity but my experience of guilelessness is that ordinarily it isnt so lucky  they wont do him the least good depend upon it said mrs markle with the air of triumphantly closing the argument  it is very possible that mrs markles dislike was sustained and kept alive by sals more active animosity and the strict espionage that young woman kept over the general movements and condition of the conroys gabriels loneliness his favourite haunt on the hillside the number and quality of mrs conroys visitors even fragments of conversation held in the family circle were all known to sal and redelivered to mrs markle with sals own colouring it is possible that most of the gossip concerning mrs conroy already hinted at had its origin in the views and observations of this admirable young woman who did not confine her confidences entirely to her mistress and when one day a stranger and guest staying at the grand conroy house sought to enliven the solemnity of breakfast by social converse with sal regarding the conroys she told him nearly everything that she had already told mrs markle  i am aware that it is alleged that some fascinating quality in this strangers manner and appearance worked upon the susceptible nature and loosened the tongue of this severe virgin but beyond a certain disposition to minister personally to his wants to hover around him archly with a greater quantity of dishes than that usually offered the transient guest and to occasionally expatiate on the excellence of some extra viand there was really no ground for the report certainly the guest was no ordinary man was quite unlike the regular habitués of the house and perhaps to some extent justified this favouritism he was young sallowfaced with very white teeth and skin yellow hands and a tropical impulsive manner which miss sarah clark generally referred to as eyetalian i venture to transcribe something of his outward oral expression  i care not greatly for the flapjack nor yet for the dried apples said victor whom the intelligent reader has at once recognised but a single cup of coffee sweetened by those glances and offered by those fair handswhich i kissare to me enough and you think that the meestrees conroy does not live happily with her husband ah you are wise you are wise mees clark i would not for much money find myself under these criticism eh  well eyes bein given to us to see with by the lords holy will and it aint for weak creeturs like us to misplace our gifts or magnify em said sal in shrill bashful confusion allowing an underdone fried egg to trickle from the plate on the coatcollar of the unconscious judge beeswinger i do say when a woman sez to her husband ez shes sworn to honour and obey this yers my house and this yers my land and yer kin git thar aint much show o happiness thar ef it warnt for hearin this with my own ears bein thar accidental like and in a sogial way i wouldnt hev believed it and she allowin to be a lady and afeared to be civil to certain folks ez is ez good ez she and far better and dont find it necessary to git married to git a positionand could hev done it a thousand times over ef so inclined but folks is various and self praise is open disgrace let me recommend them beans the pork ez we allus kills ourselves fur the benefit o transient gests bein a speciality  it is of your kindness mees clark i am already full and of the pork i touch not it is an impossibility said victor showing every tooth in his head it is much painful to hear of this sad sad affair it is badand yet you say he has richesthis man ah the what is the world see the great manner it has treated those no i will not more i am sufficient now ah eh what have we here  he lowered his voice and eyes as a strangerthe antique dandy gabriel had met on conroys hill the evening beforerose from some unnoticed seat at a side table and unconcernedly moved away victor instantly recognised the card player of san antonio his former chance acquaintance of pacific street and was filled with a momentary feeling of suspicion and annoyance but sals sotto voce reply that the stranger was a witness attending court seemed to be a reasonable explanation and the fact that the translator did not seem to recognise him promptly relieved his mind when he had gone sal returned to her confidences ez to his riches them ez knows best hez their own say o that thar was a party yer last weekgents ez was free with their money and not above exchanging the time o day with working folk and though it aint often ez me or sue markle dips into conversation with entire strangers yet continued sal with parenthetical tact and courtesy eyetaliansfurriners in a strange land bein an exceptionand and them gents let on thet thet vein o silver on conroys hill hed been surveyed and it wazent over a foot wide and would be played out afore a month longer and thet old peter dumphy knowed it and hed sold out and thet thets the reason gabriel conroy was goin offjest to be out o the way when the killapse comes  gabriel going away mees sal this is not possible ejaculated the fascinating guest breathing very hard and turning all his teeth in a single broadside upon the susceptible handmaid at any other moment it is possible that sal might have been suspicious of the strangers excitement but the fascination of his teeth held and possessed this fluttering virgin  ef thar ever waz a man ez had an angelic smile she intimated afterwards in confidence to mrs markle it waz thet young eyetalian she handed him several dishes some of them empty in her embarrassment and rejoined with an affectation of arch indignation thank ye fur sayin i lieand its my pay fur bein a gossip and ez good ez i sendbut thars olympy conroy packed away to school fur six months and thars the new superintendent ez is come up to take gabriels situation and he a sittin in a grey coat next to ye a minit ago eh and ye wont take nothin more appil or cranbear pieour own make im afeerd ye aint made out a dinner but victor had already risen hurriedly and departed leaving sal in tormenting doubt whether she had not in her coquettish indignation irritated the tropical nature of this sensitive italian i orter allowed fur his bein a furriner and not bin so free pore young man i thought he did luk tuk back when i jest allowed that he said i lied and with a fixed intention of indicating her forgiveness and goodwill the next morning by an extra dish sal retired somewhat dejectedly to the pantry she made a point somewhat later of dusting the hall in the vicinity of victors room but was possibly disappointed to find the door open and the tenant absent still later she imparted some of this interview to mrs markle with a certain air of fatigued politeness and a suggestion that in the interest of the house solely she had not repressed perhaps as far as maidenly pride and strict propriety demanded the somewhat extravagant advances of the stranger im sure she added briskly why he kept a lookin and a talkin at me in that way mind cant consave and transients did notiss and if he did go off mad why he kin git over it having thus delicately conveyed the impression of an ardent southern nature checked in its exuberance she became mysteriously reticent and gloomy  it is probable that miss clarks theory of gabriels departure was not original with her or entirely limited to her own experience a very decided disapprobation of gabriels intended trip was prevalent in the gulches and barroom he quickly lost his late and hardearned popularity not a few questioned his moral right to leave one horse gulch until its property was put beyond a financial doubt in the future the men who had hitherto ignored the proposition that he was in any way responsible for the late improvement in business now openly condemned him for abandoning the position they declared he never had the silveropolis messenger talked vaguely of the danger of changing superintendents at such a moment and hinted that the stock of the company would suffer the rival paperfor it was found that the interests of the town required a separate and distinct expressionhad an editorial on absenteeism and spoke crushingly of those men who having enriched themselves out of the resources of one horse gulch were now seeking to dissipate that wealth in the excesses of foreign travel  meanwhile the humble object of this criticism oblivious in his humility of any public interest in his movements or intentions busied himself in preparations for his departure he had refused the offer of a large rent for his house from the new superintendent but had retained a trusty servant to keep it with a view to the possible return of grace ef thar mout ever come a young gal yet lookin fur me he said privately to his servant yer not to ax any questions partiklaly ef she looks sorter shy and bashful but yell gin her the best room in the house and send to me by igspress and ye neednt say anythin to mrs conroy about it observing the expression of virtuous alarm on the face of the domesticshe was a married woman of some comeliness who was not living with her husband on account of his absurdly jealous dispositionhe added hastily shes a young woman o proputty ez hez troubil about it and wishes to be kep secret and having in this way thoroughly convinced his handmaid of the vileness of his motives and the existence of a dark secret in the conroy household he said no more but paid a flying visit to olly secretly packed away all the remnants of his deceased mothers wardrobe cut god knows for what purpose small patches from the few old dresses that grace had worn that were still sacredly kept in his wardrobe and put them in his pocketbook wandered in his usual lonely way on the hillside and spent solitary hours in his deserted cabin avoided the sharp advances of mrs markle who once aggressively met him in his long postprandial walks as well as the shy propinquity of his wife who would fain have delayed him in her bower and so having after the fashion of his sex made the two women who loved him exceedingly uncomfortable he looked hopefully forward to the time when he should be happy without either     chapter iii  in which mr dumphy takes a holiday   it was a hot day on the california coast in the memory of the oldest american inhabitant its like had not been experienced and although the testimony of the spanish californian was deemed untrustworthy where the interests of the american people were concerned the statement that for sixty years there had been no such weather was accepted without question the additional fact vouchsafed by don pedro peralta that the great earthquake which shook down the walls of the mission of san juan bautista had been preceded by a week of such abnormal meteorology was promptly suppressed as being of a quality calculated to check immigration howbeit it was hot the usual afternoon tradewinds had pretermitted their rapid panting breath and the whole coast lay as it were in the hush of death the evening fogs that always had lapped the windabraded surfaces of the bleak seaward hills were gone too the vast pacific lay still and glassy glittering but intolerable the outlying sand dunes unmitigated by any breath of air blistered the feet and faces of chance pedestrians for once the broad verandahs piazzas and balconies of san francisco cottage architecture were consistent and serviceable people lingered upon them in shirtsleeves with all the exaggeration of a novel experience french windows that had always been barred against the fierce afternoon winds were suddenly thrown open that brisk energetic step with which the average san franciscan hurried to business or pleasure was changed to an idle purposeless lounge the saloons were crowded with thirsty multitudes the quays and wharves with a people who had never before appreciated the tonic of salt air the avenues leading over the burning sandhills to the ocean all day were thronged with vehicles the numerous streets and byways abandoned by their great scavenger the wind were foul and illsmelling for twentyfour hours business was partly forgotten as the heat continued and the wind withheld its customary tribute there were some changes in the opinions and beliefs of the people doubts were even expressed of the efficacy of the climate a few heresies were uttered regarding business and social creeds and mr dumphy and certain other financial magnates felt vaguely that if the thermometer continued to advance the rates of interest must fall correspondingly  equal to even this emergency mr dumphy had sat in his office all the morning resisting with the full strength of his aggressive nature any disposition on the part of his his customers to succumb financially to the unusual weather mr dumphys shirtcollar was off with it seemed to have departed some of his respectability and he was perhaps on the whole a trifle less imposing than he had been nevertheless he was still dominant in the suggestion of his short bull neck and two visitors who entered observing the déshabillé of this great man felt that it was the proper thing for them to instantly unbutton their own waistcoats and loosen their cravats  its hot said mr pilcher an eminent contractor  you bet responded mr dumphy must be awful on the atlantic coast people dying by hundreds of sunstroke thats the style out there here theres nothing of the kind a man stands things here that he couldnt there  having thus reestablished the supremacy of the california climate mr dumphy came directly to business bad news from one horse gulch he said quickly  as that was the subject his visitors came to speak abouta fact of which mr dumphy was fully awarehe added sharply what do you propose  mr pilcher who was a large stockholder in the conroy mine responded hesitatingly weve heard that the lead opens badly  dn bad interrupted dumphy what do you propose  i suppose continued mr pilcher the only thing to do is to get out of it before the news becomes known  no said dumphy promptly the two men stared at each other no he continued with a quick short laugh which was more like a logical expression than a mirthful emotion no we must hold on sir look yer theres a dozen men as you and me know that we could unload to tomorrow suppose we did well what happens they go in on four hundred thousandthats about the figures we represent well they begin to examine and look around them men pilcherin mr dumphys more inspired moods he rose above considerations of the english grammarthem men want to know what that four hundred thousands invested in they aint goin to take our word after weve got their moneythats human natureand in twentyfour hours they find theyre sold that dont look well for me nor youdoes it  there was not the least assumption of superior honour or integrityindeed scarcely any selfconsciousness or sentiment of any kind implied in this speechyet it instantly affected both of these sharp business men who might have been suspicious of sentiment with an impression of being both honourable and manly mr pilchers companion mr wyck added a slight embarrassment to his reception of these great truths which mr dumphy noticed  no he went on what we must do is this increase the capital stock just as much again that will enable us to keep everything in our handsnews and alland if it should leak out afterwards we have half a dozen others with us to keep the secret six months hence will be time to talk of selling just now buying is the thing you dont believe iteh well wyck ill take yours at the figure you paid what do you sayquick  mr wyck more confused than appeared necessary declared his intention of holding on mr pilcher laughed mr dumphy barked behind his hand  that offers open for ninety dayswill you take it no well then thats all and mr dumphy turned again to his desk mr pilcher took the hint and drew mr wyck away  devilish smart chap that dumphy said pilcher as they passed out of the door  an honest man by responded wyck  when they had gone mr dumphy rang his bell ask mr jaynes to come and see me at once dn it go now you must get there before wyck does run  the clerk disappeared in a few moments mr jaynes a sharp but very youthful looking broker entered the office parlour mr wyck will want to buy back that stock he put in your hands this morning jaynes i thought id tell you its worth 50 advance now  the precocious youth grinned intelligently and departed by noon of that day it was whispered that notwithstanding the rumours of unfavourable news from the conroy mine one of the heaviest stockholders had actually bought back at an advance of 50 per share some stock he had previously sold more than that it was believed that mr dumphy had taken advantage of these reports and was secretly buying in spite of the weather for some few hours there had been the greatest excitement  possibly from some complacency arising from this possibly from some singular relaxing in the atmosphere mr dumphy at two oclock shook off the cares of business and abandoned himself to recreationrefusing even to take cognisance of the card of one colonel starbottle which was sent to him with a request for an audience at halfpast two he was behind a pair of fast horses one of a carriageload of ladies and gentlemen rolling over the scorching sandhills towards the pacific that lay calm and cool beyond as the wellappointed equipage rattled up the bush street hill many an eye was turned with envy and admiration toward it the spectacle of two pretty women among the passengers was perhaps one reason the fact that everybody recognised in the showy and brilliant driver the celebrated mr rollingstone an able financier and rival of mr dumphys was perhaps equally potent for mr rollingstone was noted for his turnout as well as for a certain impulsive south sea extravagance and picturesque hospitality which dumphy envied and at times badly imitated indeed the present excursion was one of mr rollingstones famous fetes champetres and the present company was composed of the élite of san francisco and made selfcomplacent and appreciative by an enthusiastic eastern tourist  their way lay over shifting sand dunes now motionless and glittering in the cruel white glare of a california sky only relieved here and there by glimpses of the blue bay beyond and odd marinelooking buildings like shells scattered along the beach as if they had been cast up and forgotten by some heavy tide farther on their road skirted the base of a huge solitary hill broken in outline by an outcrop of gravestones sacred to the memory of worthy pioneers who had sealed their devotion to the healthiest climate in the world with their lives occasionally these gravestones continued to the foot of the hill where struggling with the drifting sand they suggested a halfexhumed pompeii to the passing traveller they were the skeletons at the feast of every san francisco pleasureseeker the memento mori of every picnicing party and were visible even from the broad verandahs of the suburban pavilions where the gay and thoughtless citizen ate drank and was merry part of the way the busy avenue was parallel with another up which even at such times occasionally crept the lugubrious procession of hearse and mourning coach to other pavilions scarcely less crowded where there were funeral baked meats and sorrow and tears and beyond this again was the grey eternal sea and at its edge perched upon a rock and rising out of the very jaws of the gushing breakers a stately pleasure dome decreed by some speculative and enterprising san francisco landlordthe excuse and terminus of this popular excursion  here rollingstone drew up and alighting led his party into a bright cheery room whose windows gave upon the sea a few other guests evidently awaiting them were mitigating their impatience by watching the uncouth gambols of the huge sealions who on the rocks beyond offered a contrast to the engaging and comfortable interior that was at once pleasant and exciting in the centre of the room a table overloaded with overgrown fruits and grossly large roses somewhat ostentatiously proclaimed the coming feast  here we are said mr dumphy bustling into the room with that brisk businesslike manner which his friends fondly believed was frank cheerfulness and on time too he added drawing out his watch inside of thirty minuteshows that eh he clapped his nearest neighbour on the back who pleased with this familiarity from a man worth five or six millions did not stop to consider the value of this celerity of motion in a pleasure excursion on a hot day  well said rollingstone looking around him you all know each other i reckon or will soon mr dumphy mr poinsett mr pilcher mr dyce mr wyck mrs sepulvida and miss rosey ringround gentlemen mr and mrs raynor of boston there now thats through dinners ready sit down anywhere and wade in no formality gentlementhis is california  there was perhaps some advantage in this absence of ceremony the guests almost involuntarily seated themselves according to their preferences and arthur poinsett found himself beside mrs sepulvida while mr dumphy placed miss ringrounda pretty though boyishlooking blonde slangy in speech and fashionable in attireon his right hand  the dinner was lavish and luxurious lacking nothing but restraint and delicacy there was game in profusion fat but flavourless the fruits were characteristic the enormous peaches were blowsy in colour and robust in fibre the pears were prodigious and dropsical and looked as if they wanted to be tapped the strawberries were overgrown and yet immaturerather as if they had been arrested on their way to become pineapples with the exception of the grapes which were delicate in colour and texture the fruit might have been an ironical honouring by nature of mr dumphys lavish drafts  it is probable however that the irony was lost on the majority of the company who were inclined to echo the extravagant praise of mr raynor the tourist wonderful wonderful said that gentleman if i had not seen this i wouldnt have believed it why that pear would make four of ours  thats the way we do things here returned dumphy with the suggestion of being personally responsible for these abnormal growths he stopped suddenly for he caught arthur poinsetts eye mr dumphy ate little in public but he was at that moment tearing the wing of a grouse with his teeth and there was something so peculiar and characteristic in the manner that arthur looked up with a sudden recollection in his glance dumphy put down the wing and poinsett resume his conversation with mrs sepulvida it was not of a quality that interruption seriously impaired mrs sepulvida was a charming but not an intellectual woman and mr poinsett took up the lost thread of his discourse quite as readily from her eyes as her tongue  to have been consistent nature should have left a race of giants here said mr poinsett meditatively i believe he added more pointedly and in a lower voice the late don josé was not a large man  whatever he was he thought a great deal of me pouted mrs sepulvida  mr poinsett was hastening to say that if taking thought like that could add a cubit to ones stature he himself was in a fair way to become a son of anak when he was interrupted by miss rosey  whats all that about big men there are none here theyre like the big trees they dont hang around the coast much you must go to the mountains for your goliahs  emboldened quite as much by the evident annoyance of her neighbour as the amused look of arthur poinsett she went on  i have seen the prehistoric manthe original athletic sharp he is seven feet high is as heavy as a sealion and has shoulders like tom hyer he slings an awful left hes got blue eyes as tender as a seals he has hair like samson before that woman went back on him hes as brave as a lion and as gentle as a lamb he blushes like a girl or as girls used to i wish i could start up such a colour on even double the provocation  of course everybody laughedit was the usual tribute of miss roseys speechthe gentlemen frankly and fairly the ladies perhaps a little doubtfully and fearfully mrs sepulvida following the amused eyes of arthur asked miss rosey patronisingly where she had seen her phenomenon  oh its no use my dear positivelyno use hes married these phenomena always get married no i didnt see him in a circus mr dumphy nor in a menagerie mr dyce but in a girls school  everybody stared a few laughed as if this were an amusing introduction to some possible joke from miss rosey  i was visiting an old schoolmate at madame eclairs pension at sacramento he was taking his little sister to the same school she went on coolly so he told me i love my love with a g for he is guileless and gentle his name is gabriel and he lives in a gulch  our friend the superintendentim blessed said dyce looking at dumphy  yes but not so very guileless said pilcher eh dyce  the gentlemen laughed the ladies looked at each other and then at miss ringround that fearless young woman was equal to the occasion  what have you got against my giant out with it  oh nothing said mr pilcher only your guileless simple friend has played the sharpest game on record in montgomery street  go on said miss rosey  shall i asked pilcher of dumphy  dumphy laughed his short laugh go on  thus supported mr pilcher assumed the ease of a graceful raconteur miss roseys guileless friend ladies and gentlemen is the superintendent and shareholder in a certain valuable silver mine in which dumphy is largely represented being about to leave the country and anxious to realise on his stock he contracted for the sale of a hundred shares at 1000 each with our friend mr dyce the stocks to be delivered on a certain dateten days ago instead of the stock that day comes a letter from conroya wonderful piece of artsimple illspelled and unbusinesslike saying that in consequence of recent disappointment in the character and extent of the lead he shall not hold dyce to his contract but will release him dyce who has already sold that identical stock at a pretty profit rushes off to dumphys broker and finds two hundred shares held at 1200 dyce smells a largesized rat writes that he shall hold gabriel to the performance of his contract makes him hand over the stock delivers it in time and then loads up again with the brokers 200 at 1200 for a rise that rise dont comewont comefor that sale was gabriels tooas dumphy can tell you theres guilelessness theres simplicity and it cleared a hundred thousand by the operation  of the party none laughed more heartily than arthur poinsett without analysing his feelings he was conscious of being greatly relieved by this positive evidence of gabriels shrewdness and when mrs sepulvida touched his elbow and asked if this were not the squatter who held the forged grant arthur without being conscious of any special meanness could not help replying with unnecessary significance that it was  i believe the whole dreadful story that donna dolores told me said she how he married the woman who personated his sister and all thatthe deceitful wretch  ive got that letter here continued mr pilcher drawing from his pocket a folded piece of letter paper its a curiosity if youd like to see the documentary evidence of your friends guilelessness here it is he added turning to miss ringround  miss rosey took the paper defiantly and unfolded it as the others gathered round her mr dumphy availing himself of that opportunity to lean familiarly over the arm of her chair the letter was written with that timid uncertain ink peculiar to the illiterate effort and suggestive of an occasional sucking of the pen in intervals of abstraction or difficult composition saving that characteristic it is reproduced literally below       1

can send the sam to me in care of wels farko       co new york citty witch is a grate favor and will be pade      sure g c  i dont care what you say thats an honest letter said miss rosey with a certain decision of character new to the experience of her friends as honest and simple as ever was written you can bet your pile on that  no one spoke but the smile of patronising superiority and chivalrous toleration was exchanged by all the gentlemen except poinsett mr dumphy added to his smile his short characteristic bark at the reference to the writers sister mrs sepulvida shrugged her pretty shoulders and looked doubtingly at poinsett but to her great astonishment that gentleman reached across the table took the letter and having glanced over it said positively you are right miss rosey it is genuine  it was characteristic of poinsetts inconsistency that this statement was as sincere as his previous assent to the popular suspicion when he took the letter in his hand he at once detected the evident sincerity of its writer and as quickly recognised the quaint honesty and simple nature of the man he had known it was gabriel conroy all over more than that he even recalled an odd memory of grace in this frank directness and utter unselfishness of the brother who so plainly had never forgotten her that all this might be even reconcilable with the fact of his marriage to the woman who had personated the sister arthur easily comprehended but that it was his own duty after he had impugned gabriels character to make any personal effort to clear it was not so plain nevertheless he did not answer mrs sepulvidas look but walked gravely to the window and looked out upon the sea mr dumphy who with the instincts of jealousy saw in poinsetts remark only a desire to ingratiate himself with miss rosey was quick to follow his lead  its a clear case of quien sabe anyway he said to the young lady and maybe youre right joe pass the champagne  dyce and pilcher looked up inquiringly at their leader who glanced meaningly towards the openmouthed mr raynor whose astonishment at this sudden change in public sentiment was unbounded  but look here said that gentleman bless my soul if this letter is genuine your friends herethese gentlemenhave lost a hundred thousand dollars dont you see if this news is true and this mans information is correct the stock really isnt worth  he was interrupted by a laugh from messrs dyce and pilcher  thats so it would be a devilish good thing on dyce said the latter goodhumouredly and as im in myself about as much again i reckon i should take the joke about as well as he  but continued the mystified mr raynor do you really mean to say that you have any idea this news is true  yes responded pilcher coolly  yes echoed dyce with equal serenity  you do  we do  the astonished tourist looked from the one to the other with undisguised wonder and admiration and then turned to his wife had she heard it did she fully comprehend that here were men accepting and considering an actual and present loss of nearly a quarter of a million of dollars as quietly and indifferently as if it were a postage stamp what superb coolness what magnificent indifference what supreme and royal confidence in their own resources was this not a country of gods all of which was delivered in a voice that although pitched to the key of matrimonial confidence was still entirely audible to the gods themselves  yes gentlemen continued pilcher its the fortune of war tother mans turn today ours tomorrow cant afford time to be sorry in this climate a mans born again here every day move along and pass the bottle  what was that  nothing apparently but a rattling of windows and shaking of the glassesthe effect of a passing carriage or children running on the piazza without but why had they all risen with a common instinct and with faces bloodless and eyes fixed in horrible expectancy these were the questions which mr and mrs raynor asked themselves hurriedly unconscious of danger yet with a vague sense of alarm at the terror so plainly marked upon the countenances of these strange selfpoised people who a moment before had seemed the incarnation of reckless selfconfidence and inaccessible to the ordinary annoyances of mortals and why were these other pleasureseekers rushing by the windows and was not that a lady fainting in the hall arthur was the first to speak and tacitly answer the unasked question  it was from east to west he said with a coolness that he felt was affected and a smile that he knew was not mirthful its over now i think he turned to mrs sepulvida who was very white you are not frightened surely this is nothing new to you let me help you to a glass of wine  mrs sepulvida took it with a hysterical little laugh mrs raynor who was now conscious of a slight feeling of nausea did not object to the same courtesy from mr pilcher whose hand shook visibly as he lifted the champagne mr dumphy returned from the doorway in which to his own and everybodys surprise he was found standing and took his place at miss roseys side the young woman was first to recover her reckless hilarity  it was a judgment on you for slandering natures noblest specimen she said shaking her finger at the capitalist  mr rollingstone who had returned to the head of his table laughed  but what was it gasped mr raynor making himself at last heard above the somewhat pronounced gaiety of the party  an earthquake said arthur quietly     chapter iv  mr dumphy has news of a domestic character   an earthquake echoed mr rollingstone cheerfully to his guests now youve had about everything we have to show dont be alarmed madam he continued to mrs raynor who was beginning to show symptoms of hysteria nobody ever was hurt by em  in two hundred years there hasnt been as many persons killed by earthquakes in california as are struck by lightning on your coast in a single summer said mr dumphy  never have em any stronger than this said mr pilcher with a comforting suggestion on there being an absolute limitation of natures freaks on the pacific coast  over in a minute as you see said mr dumphy andhello whats that  in a moment they were on their feet pale and breathless again this time mr raynor and his wife among the number but it was only a carriagedriving away  let us adjourn to the piazza said mr dumphy offering his arm to mrs raynor with the air of having risen solely for that purpose  mr dumphy led the way and the party followed with some celerity mrs sepulvida hung back a moment with arthur and whispered  take me back as soon as you can  you are not seriously alarmed asked arthur  we are too near the sea here she replied looking toward the ocean with a slight shudder dont ask questions now she added a little sharply dont you see these eastern people are frightened to death and they may overhear  but mrs sepulvida had not long to wait for in spite of the pointed asseverations of messrs pilcher dyce and dumphy that earthquakes were not only harmless but absolutely possessed a sanitary quality the piazzas were found deserted by the usual pleasureseekers and even the eloquent advocates themselves betrayed some impatience to be once more on the open road  a brisk drive of an hour put the party again in the highest spirits and mr and mrs raynor again into the condition of chronic admiration and enthusiasm  mrs sepulvida and mr poinsett followed in an open buggy behind when they were fairly upon their way arthur asked an explanation of his fair companions fear of the sea  there is an old story said donna maria that the point of pinesyou know where it is mr poinsettwas once covered by a great wave from the sea that followed an earthquake but tell me do you really think that letter of this man conroy is true  i do said arthur promptly  and thatthereisaprospectthatthestock of this big mine maydepreciate in value  wellpossiblyyes  and if you knew that i had been foolish enough to put a good deal of money in it you would still talk to me as you did the other daydown there  i should say responded arthur changing the reins to his left hand that his right might be free for some purposegoodness knows whati should say that i am more than ever convinced that you ought to have some person to look after you  what followed this remarkable speech i really do not know how to reconcile with the statement that mrs sepulvida made to the donna dolores a few chapters ago and i therefore discreetly refrain from transcribing it here suffice it to say that the buggy did not come up with the charàbanc and the rest of the party until long after they had arrived at mr dumphys stately mansion on rincon hill where another costly and elaborate collation was prepared mr dumphy evidently was in spirits and had so far overcome his usual awe and distrust of arthur as well as the slight jealousy he had experienced an hour or so before as to approach that gentleman with a degree of cheerful familiarity that astonished and amused the selfsustained arthurwho perhaps at that time had more reason for his usual conceit than before arthur who knew or thought he knew that miss ringround was only coquetting with mr dumphy for the laudable purpose of making the more ambitious of her sex miserable and that she did not care for his person or position was a good deal amused at finding the young lady the subject of mr dumphys sudden confidences  you see poinsett as a man of business i dont go as much into society as you do but she seems to be a straight up and down girl eh he queried as they stood together in the vestibule after the ladies had departed it is hardly necessary to say that arthur was positive and sincere in his praise of the young woman mr dumphy by some obscure mental process taking much of the praise to himself was highly elated and perhaps tempted to a greater vinous indulgence than was his habit howbeit the last bottle of champagne seemed to have obliterated all past suspicion of arthur and he shook him warmly by the hand i tell ye what now poinsett if there are any points i can give you dont you be afraid to ask for em i can see whats up between you and the widowhonour you knowall right my boyshes in the conroy lode pretty deep but ill help her out and you too youve got a good thing therepoinsettand i want you to realise we understand each other eh youll find me a square man with my friends poinsett pitch inpitch inmy advice to you is to just pitch in and marry the widow shes worth ityou can realise on her you see you and messo to speakole pards eh you rekleck ole times on sweetwater eh wellif you mus go goobi i spose shes waitin for ye look you poinsy dye see this yer posy in my buttonhole she give it to me rosey did eh ha ha wont tak nothin drink lesh open nor boll no goori until struggling between disgust amusement and selfdepreciation arthur absolutely tore himself away from the great financier and his degrading confidences  when mr dumphy staggered back into his drawingroom a servant met him with a card  the genlman says its very important business and he must see you tonight he said hastily anticipating the oath and indignant protest of his master he says its your business sir and not his hes been waiting here since you came back sir  mr dumphy took the card it bore the inscription in pencil colonel starbottle siskiyou on important business mr dumphy reflected a moment the magical word business brought him to himself show him inin the office he said savagely and retired thither  anybody less practical than peter dumphy would have dignified the large showy room in which he entered as the library the rich mahogany shelves were filled with a heterogeneous collection of recent books very fresh very new and glaring as to binding and subject the walls were hung with files of newspapers and stock reports there was a velvetlined cabinet containing mineralsall of them gold or silver bearing there was a map of an island that mr dumphy ownedthere was a marine view with a representation of a steamship also owned by mr dumphy there was a momentary relief from these facts in a very gorgeous and badly painted picture of a tropical forest and seabeach until inquiry revealed the circumstance that the sugarhouse in the corner under a palmtree was run by mr dumphy and that the whole thing could be had for a bargain  the stranger who entered was large and somewhat inclined to a corpulency that was however restrained in expansion by a blue frock coat tightly buttoned at the waist which had the apparent effect of lifting his stomach into the higher thoracic regions of moral emotiona confusion to which its owner lent a certain intellectual assistance the colonels collar was very large open and impressive his black silk neckerchief loosely tied around his throat occupying considerable space over his shirt front and expanding through the upper part of a giltbuttoned white waistcoat lent itself to the general suggestion that the colonel had burst his sepals and would flower soon above this unfolding the colonels face purple aquilinenosed throttlelooking as to the eye and moist and sloppylooking as to the mouth uptilted above his shoulders the colonel entered with that tiptoeing celerity of step affected by men who are conscious of increasing corpulency he carried a cane hooked over his forearm in one hand a large white handkerchief and in the other a broadbrimmed hat he thrust the former gracefully in his breast laid the latter on the desk where mr dumphy was seated and taking an unoffered chair himself coolly rested his elbow on his cane in an attitude of easy expectancy  say youve got important business said dumphy hope it is sirhope it is then out with it cant afford to waste time any more here than at the bank come what is it  not in the least affected by mr dumphys manner whose habitual brusqueness was intensified to rudeness colonel starbottle drew out his handkerchief blew his nose carefully returned apparently only about two inches of the cambric to his breast leaving the rest displayed like a ruffled shirt and began with an airy gesture of his fat white hand  i was here two hours ago sir when you were at theerfestive board i said to the boy dont interrupt your master a gentleman worshipping at the shrine of venus and bacchus and attended by the muses and immortals dont want to be interrupted ged sir i knew a man in louisianahank pinckneyshot his boya little yellow boy worth a thousand dollarsfor interrupting him at a poker partyand no ladies present and the boy only coming in to say that the gin house was in flames perhaps youll say an extreme case know a dozen such so i said dont interrupt him but when the ladies have risen and beauty sir no longer dazzles andergleams and the table round no longer echoes theerlight jest then spot him and over the deserted board withersocial glass between us your master and i will have our little confab  he rose and before the astonished dumphy could interfere crossed over to a table where a decanter of whisky and a carafe of water stood and filling a glass halffull of liquor reseated himself and turned it off with an easy yet dignified inclination towards his host  for once only mr dumphy regretted the absence of dignity in his own manner it was quite evident that his usual brusqueness was utterly ineffective here and he quickly recognised in the colonel the representative of a class of men well known in california from whom any positive rudeness would have provoked a demand for satisfaction it was not a class of men that mr dumphy had been in the habit of dealing with and he sat filled with impotent rage but wise enough to restrain its verbal expression and thankful that none of his late guests were present to witness his discomfiture only one good effect was due to his visitor mr dumphy through baffled indignation and shame had become sober  no sir continued colonel starbottle setting his glass upon his knee and audibly smacking his large lips no sir i waited in theerantechamber until i saw you part with your guestsuntil you badeeradieu to a certain fair nymphged sir i like your taste and i call myself a judge of fine womenblank it all i said to myself blank it all star you aint goin to pop out upon a man just as hes ministering to beauty and putting a shawl upon a pair of alabaster shoulders like that ha ha ged sir i remembered myself that in 43 in washington at a party at tom bentons i was in just such a position sir are you never going to get that cloak on star she says to methe most beautiful creature the acknowledged belle of that whole winter43 siras a gentleman yourself youll understand why i dont particulariseif i had my way madam i said i never would i did blank me but youre not drinking mr dumphy eh a thimbleful sir to our better acquaintance  not daring to trust himself to speak mr dumphy shook his head somewhat impatiently and colonel starbottle rose as he did so it seemed as if his shoulders had suddenly become broader and his chest distended until his handkerchief and white waistcoat protruded through the breast of his buttoned coat like a bursting grain of pop corn he advanced slowly and with deliberate dignity to the side of dumphy  if i have intruded upon your privacy mr dumphy he said with a stately wave of his white hand if as i surmise from your disinclination sir to call it by no other name to exchange the ordinary convivial courtesies common between gentlemen siryou are disposed to resent any reminiscences of mine as reflecting upon the character of the young lady sir whom i had the pleasure to see in your companyif such be the case sir gedi am ready to retire now sir and to give you tomorrow or at any time the satisfaction which no gentleman ever refuses another and which culpepper starbottle has never been known to deny my card sir you have already my address sir is st charles hotel where i and my friend mr dumphy will be ready to receive you  look here said mr dumphy in surly but sincere alarm i dont drink because ive been drinking no offence mr starbottle i was only waiting for you to open what you had on your mind in the way of business to order up a bottle of cliquot to enable us to better digest it take your seat colonel bring champagne and two glasses he rose and under pretence of going to the sideboard added in a lower tone to the servant who entered stay within call and in about ten minutes bring me some important message from the bankyou hear a glass of wine with you colonel happy to make your acquaintance here we go  the colonel uttered a slight cough as if to clear away his momentary severity bowed with gracious dignity touched the glass of his host drew out his handkerchief wiped his mouth and seated himself once more  if my object he began with a wave of dignified depreciation were simply one of ordinary business i should have sought you sir in the busy mart and not among your lares and penates nor in the blazing lights of the festive hall i should have sought you at that temple which report and common rumour says that you sir as one of the favoured sons of fortune have erected to her worship in my intercourse with the gifted john c calhoun i never sought him sir in the gladiatorial arena of the senate but rather with the social glass in the privacy of his own domicile ged sir in my profession we recognise some quality in our relations even when professional with gentlemen that keep us from approaching them like a yankee pedlar with goods to sell  whats your profession asked mr dumphy  until elected by the citizens of siskiyou to represent them in the legislative councils i practised at the bar since then i have been open occasionally to retainers in difficult and delicate cases in the various intrigues that arise in politics in the more complicated relations of the two sexesin i may say the two great passions of mankind ambition and love my services have i believe been considered of value it has been my office sir to help the steed of vaulting ambitionererover the fence and to dry theertearful yet glowing cheek of beauty but for the necessity of honour and secrecy in my profession sir i could give you the names of some of the most elegant women and some of the firstthe very first men in the land as the clients of culpepper starbottle  very sorry began mr dumphy but if youre expecting to put me among your list of clients i  without taking the least notice of dumphys halfreturned sneer colonel starbottle interrupted him coolly  ged sirits out of the question im retained on the other side  the sneer instantly faded from dumphys face and a look of genuine surprise took its place  what do you mean he said curtly  colonel starbottle drew his chair beside dumphy and leaning familiarly over his desk took mr dumphys own penholder and persuasively emphasised the points of his speech upon mr dumphys arm with the blunt end sir when i say retained by the other side it doesnt keep me from doing the honourable thing with the defendantfrom recognising a gentleman and trying to settle this matter as between gentlemen  but whats all this about who is your plaintiff roared dumphy forgetting himself in his rage  ged sirits a womanof course dont think im accusing you of any political ambition ha ha no sir youre like me its a womanlovely womani saw it at a glance gentlemen like you and me dont go through to fifty years without giving some thought to these dear little creatures sir i despise a man who did its the weakness of a great man sir  mr dumphy pushed his chair back with the grim deliberation of a man who had at last measured the strength of his adversary and was satisfied to risk an encounter  look here colonel starbottle i dont know or care who your plaintiff is i dont know or care how she may have been deceived or wronged or disappointed or bamboozled or what is the particular game thats up now but youre a man of the world you say and as a man of the world and a man of sense you know that no one in my position ever puts himself in any womans power i cant afford it i dont pretend to be better than other men but i aint a fool thats the difference between me and your clients  yesbut my boy that is the difference dont you see in other cases the womans a beautiful woman a charming creature you know ged sometimes shes as proper and pious as a nun but then the relations you see aint legal but hang it all my boy this isyour wife  mr dumphy with colourless cheeks tried to laugh a reckless scornful laugh my wife is dead  a mistakeged sira most miserable mistake understand me i dont say that she hadnt ought to be ged sir from the look that that little blueeyed hussy gave you an hour agothere aint much use of another woman around but the fact is that she is living you thought she was dead and left her up there in the snow she goes so far as to sayyou know how these women talk dumphy ged sir theyll say anything when they get down on a manshe says it aint your fault if she wasnt dead eh sho  a message sir business of the bank very important said dumphys servant opening the door  get out said dumphy with an oath  but sir they told me sir  get out will you roared dumphy  the door closed on his astonished face its allamistake said dumphy when he had gone they died of starvationall of themwhile i was away hunting help ive read the accounts  colonel starbottle slowly drew from some vast moral elevation in his breast pocket a wellworn paper it proved when open to be a faded blackened and bethumbed document in spanish here is the report of the commander of the presidio who sent out the expedition you read spanish well the bodies of all the other women were identified except your wifes hang it my boy dont you see why she was excepted she wasnt there  the colonel darted a fat forefinger at his host and then drew back and settled his purpled chin and wattled cheeks conclusively in his enormous shirt collar mr dumphy sank back in his chair at the contact as if the finger of fate had touched him     chapter v  mrs conroy has an unexpected visitor   the hot weather had not been confined to san francisco san pablo bay had glittered and the yellow currents of the san joaquin and sacramento glowed sullenly with a dull sluggish lavalike flow no breeze stirred the wild oats that drooped on the western slope of the contra costa hills the smoke of burning woods on the eastern hillsides rose silently and steadily the great wheat fields of the intermediate valleys clothed themselves humbly in dust and ashes a column of red dust accompanied the wingdam and one horse gulch stagecoach a pillar of fire by day as well as by night and made the fainting passengers look longingly toward the snowpatched sierras beyond it was hot in california few had ever seen the like and those who had were looked upon as enemies of their race a rashly scientific man of murphys camp who had a theory of his own and upon that had prophesied a continuance of the probable recurrence of the earthquake shock concluded he had better leave the settlement until the principles of meteorology were better recognised and established  it was hot in one horse gulchin the ovenlike gulch on the burning sands and scorching bars of the river it was hot even on conroys hill among the calm shadows of the darkgreen pineson the deep verandahs of the conroy cottage orné perhaps this was the reason why mrs gabriel conroy early that morning after the departure of her husband for the mill had evaded the varnished and whiteleaded heats of her own house and sought the more fragrant odours of the sedate pines beyond the hilltop i fear however that something was due to a mysterious note which had reached her clandestinely the evening before and which seated on the trunk of a prostrate pine she was now reperusing  i should like to sketch her as she sat there a broadbrimmed straw hat covered her head that although squared a little too much at the temples for shapeliness was still made comely by the good taste with whichaided by a crimpingironshe had treated her finespun electrical blonde hair the heat had brought out a delicate dewy colour in her usually pale face and had heightened the intense nervous brightness of her vivid grey eyes from the same cause probably her lips were slightly parted so that the rigidity that usually characterised their finely chiselled outlines was lost she looked healthier the long flowing skirts which she affected after the fashion of most petite women were gathered at a waist scarcely as sylphlike and unsubstantial as that which gabriel first clasped after the accident in the fateful cañon she seemed a trifle more languidmore careful of her personal comfort and spent some time in adjusting herself to the inequalities of her uncouth seat with a certain pouting peevishness of manner that was quite as new to her character as it was certainly feminine and charming she held the open note in her thin narrow whitetipped fingers and glanced over it again with a slight smile it read as follows       at ten oclock i shall wait for you at the hill near the big      pine you shall give me an interview if you know yourself well      i say beware i am strong for i am injuredvictor  mrs conroy folded the note again still smiling and placed it carefully in her pocket then she sat patient her hands clasped lightly between her knees the parasol open at her feetthe very picture of a fond confiding tryst then she suddenly drew her feet under her sideways with a quick nervous motion and examined the ground carefully with sincere distrust of all artful lurking vermin who lie in wait for helpless womanhood then she looked at her watch  it was five minutes past the hour there was no sound in the dim slumbrous wood but the faroff sleepy caw of a rook a squirrel ran impulsively halfway down the bark of the nearest pine and catching sight of her tilted parasol suddenly flattened himself against the bark with outstretched limbs a picture of abject terror a bounding hare came upon it suddenly and had a palpitation of the heart that he thought he really never should get over and then there was a slow crackling in the underbrush as of a masculine tread and mrs conroy picking up her terrible parasol shaded the cold fires of her grey eyes with it and sat calm and expectant  a figure came slowly and listlessly up the hill when within a dozen yards of her she saw it was not victor but when it approached nearer she suddenly started to her feet with pallid cheeks and an exclamation upon her lips it was the spanish translator of pacific street she would have flown but on the instant he turned and recognised her with a cry a start and a passion equal to her own for a moment they stood glaring at each other breathless but silent  devarges said mrs conroy in a voice that was scarcely audible good god  the stranger uttered a bitter laugh yes devargesthe man who ran away with youdevarges the traitor devarges the betrayer of your husband look at me you know mehenry devarges your husbands brotheryour old accompliceyour loveryour dupe  hush she said imploringly glancing around through the dim woods for gods sake hush  and who are you he went on without heeding her which of the mesdames devarges is it now or have you taken the name of the young sprig of an officer for whom you deserted me and maybe in turn married or did he refuse you even that excuse for your perfidy or is it the wife and accomplice of this feebleminded conroy what name shall i call you tell me quick oh i have much to say but i wish to be polite madame tell me to whom i am to speak  despite the evident reality of his passion and fury there was something so unreal and grotesque in his appearancein his antique foppery in his dyed hair in his false teeth in his padded coat in his thin strapped legs that this relentless woman cowered before him in very shame not of her crime but of her accomplice hush she said call me your friend i am always your friend henry call me anything but let me go from here for gods sake do you hear not so loud another time and another place i will listen and she drew slowly back until scarce knowing what he did she had led him away from the place of rendezvous toward the ruined cabin here she felt that she was at least safe from the interruption of victor how came you here how did you find out what had become of me where have you been these long years she asked hastily  within the last few moments she had regained partially the strange power that she had always exerted over all men except gabriel conroy the stranger hesitated and then answered in a voice that had more of hopelessness than bitterness in its quality  i came here six years ago a broken ruined and disgraced man i had no ambition but to hide myself from all who had known me from that brother whose wife i had stolen and whose home i had broken upfrom youyou julie you and your last loverfrom the recollection of your double treachery he had raised his voice here but was checked by the unflinching eye and cautionary gesture of the woman before him when you abandoned me in st louis i had no choice but death or a second exile i could not return to switzerland i could not live in the sickening shadow of my crime and its bitter punishment i came here my education my knowledge of the language stood me in good stead i might have been a rich man i might have been an influential one but i only used my opportunities for the bare necessaries of life and the means to forget my trouble in dissipation i became a drudge by day a gambler by night i was always a gentleman men thought me crazy an enthusiast but they learned to respect me traitor as i was in a larger trust no one doubted my honour or dared to question my integrity but bah what is this to you you  he would have turned from her again in very bitterness but in the act he caught her eye and saw in it if not sympathy at least a certain critical admiration that again brought him to her feet for despicable as this woman was she was pleased at this pride in the man she had betrayed was gratified at the sentiment that lifted him above his dyed hair and his pitiable foppery and felt a certain honourable satisfaction in the fact that even after the lapse of years he had proved true to her own intuitions of him  i had been growing out of my despair julie he went on sadly i was or believed i was forgetting my fault forgetting even you when there came to me the news of my brothers deathby starvation listen to me julie one day there came to me for translation a document revealing the dreadful death of himyour husband my brotherdo you hearby starvation driven from his home by shame he had desperately sought to hide himself as i hadaccepted the hardship of emigrationhe a gentleman and a man of letterswith the boors and rabble of the plains had shared their low trials and their vulgar pains and died among them unknown and unrecorded  he died as he had lived said mrs conroy passionately a traitor and a hypocrite he died following the fortunes of his paramour an uneducated vulgar rustic to whom dying he willed a fortunethis girlgrace conroy thank god i have the record hush whats that  whatever it wasa falling bough or the passing of some small animal in the underbrushit was past now a dead silence enwrapped the two solitary actors they might have been the first man and the first woman so encompassed were they by nature and solitude  no she went on hurriedly in a lower tone it was the same old storythe story of that girl at baslethe story of deceit and treachery which brought us first together which made you henry my friend which turned our sympathies into a more dangerous passion you have suffered ah well so have i we are equal now  henry devarges looked speechlessly upon his companion her voice trembled there were tears in her eyes that had replaced the burning light of womanly indignation he had come there knowing her to have been doubly treacherous to her husband and himself she had not denied it he had come there to tax her with an infamous imposture but had found himself within the last minute glowing with sympathetic condemnation of his own brother and ready to accept the yet unoffered and perfectly explicable theory of that imposture more than that he began to feel that his own wrongs were slight in comparison with the injuries received by this superior woman the woman who endeavours to justify herself to her jealous lover always has a powerful ally in his own selflove and devarges was quite willing to believe that even if he had lost her love he had never at least been deceived and the answer to the morality of this imposture was before him here was she married to the surviving brother of the girl she had personated had hehad dr devarges ever exhibited as noble trust as perfect appreciation of her nature and sufferings had they not thrown away the priceless pearl of this womans love through ignorance and selfishness you and i my dear sir who are not in love with this most reprehensible creature will be quick to see the imperfect logic of henry devarges but when a man constitutes himself accuser judge and jury of the woman he loves he is very apt to believe he is giving a verdict when he is only entering a nolle prosequi it is probably that mrs conroy had noticed this weakness in her companion even with her preoccupied fears of the inopportune appearance of victor whom she felt she could have accounted for much better in his absence victor was an impulsive person and there are times when this quality generally adored by a selfrestrained sex is apt to be confounding  why did you come here to see me asked mrs conroy with a dangerous smile only to abuse me  there is another grant in existence for the same land that you claim as grace conroy or mrs conroy returned devarges with masculine bluntness a grant given prior to that made to my brother paul a suspicion that some imposture has been practised is entertained by the party holding the grant and i have been requested to get at the facts  mrs conroys grey eyes lightened and how were these suspicions aroused  by an anonymous letter  and you have seen it  yes both it and the handwriting in portions of the grant are identical  and you know the hand  i do it is that of a man now here an old californianvictor ramirez  he fixed his eyes upon her unabashed she turned her own clear glance on his and asked with a dazzling smile  but does not your client know that whether this grant is a forgery or not my husbands title is good  yes but the sympathies of my client as you call her are interested in the orphan girl grace  ah said mrs conroy with the faintest possible sigh your client for whom you have travelledhow many milesis a woman  halfpleased but halfembarrassed devarges said yes  i understand said mrs conroy slowly a young woman perhaps a good a pretty one and you have said i will prove this mrs conroy an impostor and you are here well i do not blame you you are a man it is well perhaps it is so  but julie hear me interrupted the alarmed devarges  no more said mrs conroy rising and waving her thin white hand i do not blame you i could expecti deserveno more go back to your client sir tell her that you have seen julie devarges the impostor tell her to go and press her claim and that you will assist her finish the work that the anonymous letterwriter has begun and earn your absolution for your crime and my folly get your rewardyou deserve itbut tell her to thank god for having raised up to her better friends than julie devarges ever possessed in the heyday of her beauty go farewell no let me go henry devarges i am going to my husband he at least has known how to forgive and protect a friendless and erring woman  before the astonished man could recover his senses elusive as a sunbeam she had slipped through his fingers and was gone for a moment only he followed the flash of her white skirt through the dark aisles of the forest and then the pillared trees crowding in upon each other hid her from view  perhaps it was well for a moment later victor ramirez flushed wildeyed dishevelled and panting stumbled blindly upon the trail and blundered into devarges presence the two men eyed each other in silence  a hot day for a walk said devarges with an illconcealed sneer  vengeance of god you are right it is returned victor and you  oh i have been fighting flies goodday     chapter vi  gabriel discards his home and wealth   i am sorry to say that mrs conroys expression as she fled was not entirely consistent with the grieved and heartbroken manner with which she had just closed the interview with henry devarges something of a smile lurked about the corners of her thin lips as she tripped up the steps of her house and stood panting a little with the exertion in the shadow of the porch but here she suddenly found herself becoming quite faint and entering the apparently empty house passed at once to her boudoir and threw herself exhaustedly on the lounge with a certain peevish discontent at her physical weakness no one had seen her enter the chinese servants were congregated in the distant washhouse her housekeeper had taken advantage of her absence to ride to the town the unusual heat was felt to be an apology for any domestic negligence  she was very thoughtful the shock she had felt on first meeting devarges was past she was satisfied she still retained an influence over him sufficient to keep him her ally against ramirez whom she felt she now had reason to fear hitherto his jealousy had only shown itself in vapouring and bravado she had been willing to believe him capable of offering her physical violence in his insane fury and had not feared it but this deliberately planned treachery made her tremble she would see devarges again she would recite the wrongs she had received from the dead brother and husband and in henrys weak attempt to still his own conscience with that excuse she could trust to him to keep ramirez in check and withhold the exposure until she and gabriel could get away once out of the country she could laugh at them both once away she could devote herself to win the love of gabriel without which she had begun to feel her life and schemes had been in vain she would hurry their departure at once since the report had spread affecting the value of the mine gabriel believing it true had vaguely felt it his duty to stand by his doubtful claim and accept its fortunes and had delayed his preparations she would make him believe that it was dumphys wish that he should go at once she would make dumphy write him to that effect she smiled as she thought of the power she had lately achieved over the fears of this financial magnate she would do all this but for her physical weakness she ground her teeth as she thought of it that at such a time she should beand yet a moment later a sudden fancy flashed across her mind and she closed her eyes that she might take in its delusive sweetness more completely it might be that it wanted only this to touch his heartsome men were so strangeand if it were o godshe stopped  what was that noise the house had been very quiet so still that she had heard a woodpecker tapping on its roof but now she heard distinctly the slow heavy tread of a man in one of the upper chambers which had been used as a lumberroom mrs conroy had none of the nervous apprehension of her sex in regard to probable ghosts or burglarsshe had too much of a mans practical preoccupation for that yet she listened curiously it came again there was no mistaking it now it was the tread of the man with whom her thoughts had been busyher husband  what was he doing here in the few months of their married life he had never been home before at this hour the lumberroom contained among other things the disjecta membra of his old mining life and experience he may have wanted something there was an old bag which she remembered he said contained some of his mothers dresses yet it was so odd that he should go there now any other time but this a terrible superstitious dreada dread that any other time she would have laughed to scorn began to creep over her hark he was moving she stopped breathing  the tread recommenced it passed into the upper hall and came slowly down the stairs each step recording itself in her heartbeats it reached the lower hall and seemed to hesitate then it came slowly along toward her door and again hesitated  another moment of suspense and she felt she would have screamed and then the door slowly opened and gabriel stood before her  in one swift intuitive hopeless look she read her fate he knew all and yet his eyes except that they bore less of the usual perplexity and embarrassment with which they had habitually met hers though grave and sad had neither indignation nor anger he had changed his clothes to a rough miners blouse and trousers and carried in one hand a miners pack and in the other a pick and shovel he laid them down slowly and deliberately and seeing her eyes fixed upon them with a nervous intensity began apologetically  they contains maam ony a blanket and a few duds ez i allus used to carry with me ill open it ef you say so but you know me maam well enough to allow that id take nothin outer this yer house ez i didnt bring inter it  you are going away she said in a voice that was not audible to herself but seemed to vaguely echo in her mental consciousness  i be ef ye dont know why maam i reckon ez youll hear it from the same vyce ez i did its ony the squar thing to say afore i go ez it aint my fault nor hizn i was on the hill this mornin in the ole cabin  it seemed as if he had told her this before so old and selfevident the fact appeared  i was sayin i woz on the hill when i heerd vyces and lookin out i seed you with a stranger from wot ye know o me and my ways maam it aint like me to listen to thet wot aint allowed for me to hear and ye might hev stood thar ontel now ef i hadnt seed a chap dodgin round behind the trees spyin and listnin when i seed thet man i knowed him to be a pore mexican whose legs id tended yer in the gulch morn a year ago i went up to him and when he seed me hed hev run but i laid my hand onto himandhe stayed  there was something so unconsciously large and fine in the slight gesture of this giants hand as he emphasised his speech that even through her swiftly rising pride mrs conroy was awed and thrilled by it but the next moment she found herself sayingwhether aloud or not she could not tellif he had loved me he would have killed him then and there  wot thet man sed to mebein flustered and savagelike along o bein choked hard to keep him from singin out and breakin in upon you and thet entire strangeraint fur me to say knowin him longer than i do i reckon you suspect bout wot it was that it ez the truth i read it in your face now maam ez i reckon i might hev read it off and on in many ways and varis styles sens weve been yer together ony i waz thet weak and ondecided yer  he raised his hand to his forehead here and with his broad palm appeared to wipe away the trouble and perplexity that had overshadowed it he then drew a paper from his breast  ive drawed up a little paper yer ez ill hand over to lawyer maxwell makin over back agin all ez i once hed o you and all ez i ever expect to hev for i dont agree with that mexican thet wot was gin to grace belongs to me i allow ez she kin settle thet herself ef she ever comes and ef i

ez lived ez was ever pinted for money or ez ever took more outer the kompanys wages than his grub and his clothes  it was the first time that he had ever asserted himself in her presence and even then he did it half apologetically yet with an unconscious dignity in his manner that became him well he reached down as he spoke and took up his pick and his bundle and turned to go  there is nothing then that you are leaving behind you she asked  he raised his eyes squarely to hers  no he said simply nothing  oh if she could have only spoken oh had she but dared to tell him that he had left behind that which he could not take away that which the mere instincts of his manhood would have stirred him to tenderness and mercy that which would have appealed to him through its very helplessness and youth but she dared not that eloquence which an hour before had been ready enough to sway the feelings of the man to whom she had been faithless and did not love failed her now in the grasp of her first and only hopeless passion this archhypocrite had lost even the tact of the simplest of her sex she did not even assume an indifference she said nothing when she raised her eyes again he was gone  she was wrong at the front door he stopped hesitated a moment and then returned slowly and diffidently to the room her heart beat rapidly and then was still  ye asked just now he said falteringly ef thar was anything ez i was leavin behind thar isef yell overlook my sayin it when you and me allowed to leave fur furrin parts i reckoned to leave thet housekeeper behind and unbeknowed to ye i gin

take her in and send for me lawyer maxwell will gin ye my address  the sting recalled her benumbed life she rose with a harsh dissonant laugh and said your wishes shall be fulfilledifshe hesitated a momenti am here  but he did not hear the last sentence and was gone     chapter vii  what passed under the pine and what remained there   ramirez was not as happy in his revenge as he had anticipated he had in an instant of impulsive rage fired his mine prematurely and as he feared impotently gabriel had not visibly sickened faded nor fallen blighted under the exposure of his wifes deceit it was even doubtful as far as ramirez could judge from his quiet reception of the revelation whether he would even call that wife to account for it again ramirez was unpleasantly conscious that this exposure had lost some of its dignity and importance by being wrested from his as a confession made under pressure or duress worse than all he had lost the opportunity of previously threatening mrs conroy with the disclosure and the delicious spectacle of her discomfiture in point of fact his revenge had been limited to the cautious cowardice of the anonymous letterwriter who stabbing in the dark enjoys neither the contemplation of the agonies of his victim nor the assertion of his own individual power  to this torturing reflection a terrible suspicion of the spanish translator perkins was superadded for gabriel ramirez had only that contempt which every lawless lover has for the lawful husband of his mistress while for perkins he had that agonising doubt which every lawless lover has for every other man but the husband in making this exposure had he not precipitated a catastrophe as fatal to himself as to the husband might they not both drive this woman into the arms of another man ramirez paced the little bedroom of the grand conroy hotel a prey to that bastard remorse of all natures like his ownthe overwhelming consciousness of opportunities for villany misspent  come what might he would see her again and at once he would let her know that he suspected her relations with this translator he would tell her that he had written the letterthat he had forged the grantthat  a tap at the door recalled him to himself it opened presently to sal coy bashful and conscious the evident agitation of this young foreigner had to sals matteroffact comprehension only one origina hopeless consuming passion for herself  dinner hez bin done gone an hour ago said that arch virgin but i put suthin by for ye ye was inquirin last night about them conroys i thought id tell ye thet gabril hez bin yer askin arter lawyer maxwellwhich hes off to sacramentoaltho one o sue markles most intymit friends and steddeyist boarders  but mr ramirez had no ear for gabriel now  tell to me mees clark he said suddenly turning all his teeth on her with gasping civility where is this señor perkins eh  thet shiny chapez looks like a old turned alpacker gownd said sal thet man ez i cant abear she continued with a delicately maidenly suggestion that ramirez need fear no rivalry from that quarter i dont mindand dont keer to know he heznt bin yer since mornin i reckon hes up somewhar on conroys hill all i know ez thet he sent a message yer to git ready his volise to put aboard the wingdam stage tonight are ye goin with him  no said ramirez curtly  axin yer parding for the question but seein ez hed got booked for two places i thot ez maybe yed got tired o plain mounting folks and mounting ways and waz goin with him and sal threw an arch yet reproachful glance at ramirez  booked for two seats gasped victor ah for a lady perhapseh mees clark for a lady  sal bridled instantly at what might have seemed a suggestion of impropriety on her part a ladylike his imperanceindeed id like to know who would demean theirselves by goin with the like o he but youre not startin out agin without your dinner and it waitin ye in the oven no la mr ramirez ye must be in luv ive heerd tell ez it do take away the appetite not knowin o my own experense though its little hez passed my lips these two days and only when tempted  but before sal could complete her diagnosis mr ramirez gasped a few words of hasty excuse seized his hat and hurried from the room  leaving sal a second time to mourn over the effect of her coquettish playfulness upon the sensitive italian nature victor ramirez toiling through the heat and fiery dust shaken from the wheels of incoming teams once more brushed his way up the long ascent of conroys hill and did not stop until he reached its summit here he paused to collect his scattered thoughts to decide upon some plan of action to control the pulse of his beating temples quickened by excitement and the fatigue of the ascent and to wipe the perspiration from his streaming face he must see her at once but how and where to go boldly to her house would be to meet her in the presence of gabriel and that was no longer an object besides if she were with this stranger it would not probably be there by haunting this nearest umbrage to the house he would probably intercept them on their way to the gulch or overhear any other conference by lingering here he would avoid any interference from gabriels cabin on the right and yet be able to detect the approach of any one from the road the spot that he had chosen was singularly enough in earlier days gabriels favourite haunt for the indulgence of his noontide contemplation and pipe a great pine the largest of its fellows towered in a little opening to the right as if it had drawn apart for seclusion and obeying some mysterious attraction victor went toward it and seated himself on an abutting root at its base here a singular circumstance occurred which at first filled him with superstitious fear the handkerchief with which he had wiped his facenay his very shirtfront itselfsuddenly appeared as if covered with blood a moment later he saw that the ensanguined hue was only due to the dust through which he had plunged blending with the perspiration that on the least exertion still started from every pore of his burning skin  the sun was slowly sinking the long shadow of reservoir ridge fell upon conroys hill and seemed to cut down the tall pine that a moment before had risen redly in the sunlight the sounds of human labour slowly died out of the gulch below the faroff whistle of teamsters in the wingdam road began to fail one by one the red openings on the wooded hillside opposite went out as if nature were putting up the shutters for the day with the gathering twilight ramirez became more intensely alert and watchful treading stealthily around the lone pine tree with shining eyes and gleaming teeth he might have been mistaken for some hesitating animal waiting for that boldness which should come with the coming night suddenly he stopped and leaning forward peered into the increasing shadow coming up the trail from the town was a woman even at that distance and by that uncertain light ramirez recognised the flapping hat and ungainly stride it was salperdition might the devil fly away with her but she turned to the right with the trail that wound toward gabriels hut and the cottage beyond and victor breathed or rather panted more freely and then a voice at his very side thrilled him to his smallest fibre and he turned quickly it was mrs conroy white erect and truculent  what are you doing here she said with a sharp quick utterance  hush said ramirez trembling with the passion called up by the figure before him hush there is one who has just come up the trail  what do i care who hears me now you have made caution unnecessary she responded sharply all the world knows us now and so i ask you again what are you doing here  he would have approached her nearer but she drew back twitching her long white skirt behind her with a single quick feminine motion of her hand as if to save it from contamination  victor laughed uneasily you have come to keep your appointment it is not my fault if i am late  i have come here because for the last halfhour i have watched you from my verandah coursing in and out among the trees like a hound as you are i have come to whip you off my land as i would a hound but i have first a word or two to say to you as the man you have assumed to be  standing there with the sunset glow over her erect graceful figure in the pink flush of her cheek in the cold fires of her eyes in all the thousand nameless magnetisms of her presence there was so much of her old power over this slave of passion that the scorn of her words touched him only to inflame him and he would have grovelled at her feet could he have touched the thin three fingers that she warningly waved at him  you wrong me julie by the god of heaven i was wild mad this morningyou understandfor when i came to you i found you with another i had reason mother of god i had reason for my madness reason enough but i came in peace julie i came in peace  in peace returned mrs conroy scornfully your note was a peaceful one indeed  ah but i knew not how else to make you hear me i had newsnews you understand news that might save you for i came from the woman who holds the grant ah you will listen will you not for one moment only julie hear me and i am gone  mrs conroy with abstracted gaze leaned against the tree go on she said coldly  ah you will listen then said victor joyfully and when you have listened you shall understand well first i have the fact that the lawyer for this woman is the man who deserted the grace conroy in the mountainsthe man who was called philip ashley but whose real name is poinsett  who did you say said mrs conroy suddenly stepping from the tree and fining a pair of cruel eyes on ramirez  arthur poinsettan exsoldier an officer ah you do not believei swear to god it is so  what has this to do with me she said scornfully resuming her position beside the pine go onor is this all  no but it is much look you he is the affianced of a rich widow in the southern country you understand no one knows his past ah you begin to comprehend he does not dare to seek out the real grace conroy he shall not dare to press the claim of his client consequently he does nothing  is this all your news  allah no there is one more but i dare not speak it here he said glancing craftily around through the slowly darkening wood  then it must remain untold returned mrs conroy coldly for this is our last and only interview  but julie  have you done she continued in the same tone  whether her indifference was assumed or not it was effective ramirez glanced again quickly around and then said sulkily come nearer and i will tell you ah you doubtyou doubt be it so but seeing that she did not move he drew toward the tree and whisperedbend here your headi will whisper it  mrs conroy evading his outstretched hand bent her head he whispered a few words in her ear that were inaudible a foot from the tree  did you tell this to himto gabriel she asked fixing her eyes upon him yet without change in her frigid demeanour  noi swear to you julie no i would not have told him anything but i was wild crazy and he was a brute a great bear he held me fast here so i could not move it was a forced confession yesmother of godby force  luckily for victor the darkness hid the scorn that momentarily flashed in the womans eyes at this corroboration of her husbands strength and the weakness of the man before her and is this all that you have to tell me she only said  alli swear to you julieall  then listen victor ramirez she said swiftly stepping from the tree into the path before him and facing him with a white and rigid face whatever was your purpose in coming here it has been successful you have done all that you intended and more the man whose mind you came to poisonthe man you wished to turn against mehas gonehas left meleft me never to returnhe never loved me your exposure of me was to him a godsend for it gave him an excuse for the insults he has heaped upon me for the treachery he has always hidden in his bosom  even in the darkness she could see the selfcomplacent flash of victors teeth could hear the quick hurried sound of his breath as he bent his head toward her and knew that he was eagerly reaching out his hand for hers he would have caught her gesturing hand and covered it with kisses but that divining his intention without flinching from her position she whipped both her hands behind her  wellyou are satisfied you have had your say and your way now i shall have mine do you suppose i came here tonight to congratulate you no i came here to tell you that insulted outraged and spurned as i have been by my husband gabriel conroycast off and degraded as i stand here tonighti love him love him as i never loved any man before love him as i never shall love any man again love him as i hate you love him so that i shall follow him wherever he goes if i have to drag myself after him on my knees his hatred is more precious to me than your love do you hear me victor ramirez that is what i came here to tell you more than thatlisten the secret you have whispered to me just now whether true or false i shall take to him i will help him to find his sister i will make him love me yet if i sacrifice you everybody my own life to do it do you hear that victor ramirez you dogyou spanish mongrelyou halfbreed oh grit your teeth there in the darknessi know yougrit your teeth as you did today when gabriel held you squirming under his thumb it was a fine sight victorworthy of the manly secretary who stole a dying girls papersworthy of the valiant soldier who abandoned his garrison to a yankee pedlar and his mule oh i know you sir and have known you from the first day i made you my toolmy dupe go on sir go ondraw your knife do i am not afraid coward i shall not scream i promise you come on  with an insane articulate gasp of rage and shame he sprang toward her with an uplifted knife but at the same instant she saw a hand reach from the darkness and fall swiftly upon his shoulder saw him turn and with an oath struggle furiously in the arms of devarges and without waiting to thank her deliverer or learn the result of his interference darted by the struggling pair and fled  possessed only by a single idea she ran swiftly to her home here she pencilled a few hurried lines and called one of her chinese servants to her side  take this ah fe and give it to mr conroy you will find him at lawyer maxwells or if not there he will tell you where he has gone but you must find him if he has left town already you must follow him find him within an hour and ill double thatshe placed a gold piece in his hand go at once  however limited might have been ah fes knowledge of the english language there was an eloquence in the womans manner that needed no translation he nodded his head intelligently said me shabbe youmuchee quick caused the gold piece and the letter to instantly vanish up his sleeve and started from the house in a brisk trot nor did he allow any incidental diversion to interfere with the business in hand the noise of struggling in the underbrush on conroys hill and a cry for help only extracted from ah fe the response you muchee gotohelleeno foolee me as he trotted unconcernedly by in half an hour he had reached lawyer maxwells office but the news was not favourable gabriel had left an hour before they knew not where ah fe hesitated a moment and then ran quickly down the hill to where a gang of his fellowcountrymen were working in a ditch at the roadside ah fe paused and uttered in a high recitative a series of the most extraordinary ejaculations utterly unintelligible to the few americans who chanced to be working near but the effect was magical in an instant pick and shovel were laid aside and before the astonished miners could comprehend it the entire gang of chinamen had dispersed and in another instant were scattered over the several trails leading out of one horse gulch except one  that one was luckily taken by ah fe in half an hour he came upon the object of his search settled on a boulder by the wayside smoking his evening pipe his pick shovel and pack lay by his side ah fe did not waste time in preliminary speech or introduction he simply handed the missive to his master and instantly turned his back upon him and departed in another half hour every chinaman was back in the ditch working silently as if nothing had happened  gabriel laid aside his pipe and held the letter a moment hesitatingly between his finger and thumb then opening it he at once recognised the small italian hand with which his wife had kept his accounts and written from his dictation and something like a faint feeling of regret overcame him as he gazed at it without taking the meaning of the text and then with the hesitation repetition and audible utterance of an illiterate person he slowly read the following       i was wrong you have left something behind youa secret that      as you value your happiness you must take with you if you      come to conroys hill within the next two hours you shall know      it for i shall not enter that house again and leave there      tonight for ever i do not ask you to come for the sake of      your wife but for the sake of a woman she once personated you      will come because you love grace not because you care for      julie  there was but one fact that gabriel clearly grasped in this letter that was that it referred to some news of grace that was enough he put away his pipe rose shouldered his pack and pick and deliberately retraced his steps when he reached the town with the shamefacedness of a man who had just taken leave of it for ever he avoided the main thoroughfare but did this so clumsily and incautiously after his simple fashion that two or three of the tunnelmen noticed him ascending the hill by an inconvenient and seldom used bypath he did not stay long however for in a short timesome said ten others said fifteen minuteshe was seen again descending rapidly and recklessly and crossing the gulch disappeared in the bushes at the base of bald mountain  with the going down of the sun that night the temperature fell also and the fierce dry desert heat that had filled the land for the past few days fled away before a fierce wind which rose with the coldly rising moon that during the rest of the night rode calmly over the twisting tops of writhing pines on conroys hill over the rattling windows of the town and over the beaten dust of mountain roads but even with the night the wind passed too and the sun arose the next morning upon a hushed and silent landscape it touched according to its habit first the tall top of the giant pine on conroys hill and then slid softly down its shaft until it reached the ground and there it found victor ramirez with a knife thrust through his heart lying dead     book vi  a dip     chapter i  mr hamlins recreation continued   when donna dolores after the departure of mrs sepulvida missed the figure of mr jack hamlin from the plain before her window she presumed he had followed that lady and would have been surprised to have known that he was at that moment within her castle drinking aguardiente with no less a personage than the solemn don juan salvatierra in point of fact with that easy audacity which distinguished him jack had penetrated the courtyard gained the hospitality of don juan without even revealing his name and profession to that usually ceremonious gentleman and after holding him in delicious fascination for two hours had actually left him lamentably intoxicated and utterly oblivious of the character of his guest why jack did not follow up his advantage by seeking an interview with the mysterious señora who had touched him so deeply i cannot say nor could he himself afterwards determine a sudden bashfulness and timidity which he had never before experienced in his relations with the sex tied his own tongue while don juan with the garrulity which inebriety gave to his poured forth the gossip of the mission and the household it is possible also that a certain vague hopelessness equally novel to jack sent him away in lower spirits than he came it is not remarkable that donna dolores knew nothing of the visit of this guest until three days afterwards for during that time she was indisposed and did not leave her room but it was remarkable that on learning it she flew into a paroxysm of indignation and rage that alarmed don juan and frightened her attendants  and why was i not told of the presence of this strange americano am i a child holy st anthony that i am to be kept in ignorance of my duty as the hostess of the blessed trinity or are you don juan my dueña a brave caballero who i surmise from your description is the same that protected me from insult at mass last sunday and he is not to kiss my hand mother of god and his nameyou have forgotten  in vain juan protested that the strange caballero had not requested an audience and that a proper maidenly spirit would have prevented the donna from appearing unsought  better that i should have been thought forwardand these americanos are of different habitude my unclethan that the blessed trinity should have been misrepresented by the guzzling of aguardiente  howbeit mr hamlin had not found the climate of san antonio conducive to that strict repose that his physician had recommended and left it the next day with an accession of feverish energy that was new to him he had idled away three days of excessive heat at sacramento and on the fourth had flown to the mountains and found himself on the morning of the first cool day at wingdam  anybody here i know he demanded of his faithful henchman as pete brought in his clothes freshly brushed for the morning toilette  no sah  nor want to eh continued the cynical jack leisurely getting out of bed  pete reflected dere is two o dese yar yeastern touristsdem folks as is goin round inspectin de countrydown in de parlour jess come over from de big trees i reckon deys some o de same partydem frisco chapsmass dumphy and de odders haz been unloadin to deys mighty green and de boys along de road has been fillin em up its jess so much water on de dried apples dat pete dumphys been shovin into em  jack smiled grimly i reckon you neednt bring up my breakfast pete ill go down  the party thus obscurely referred to by pete were mr and mrs raynor who had been doing the big trees under the intelligent guidance of a san francisco editor who had been deputised by mr dumphy to represent californian hospitality they were exceedingly surprised during breakfast by the entrance of a pale handsome languid gentleman accurately dressed whose infinite neatness shamed their own bedraggled appearance and who accompanied by his own servant advanced and quietly took a seat opposite the tourists and their guide mrs raynor at once became conscious of some negligence in her toilette and after a moments embarrassment excused herself and withdrew mr raynor impressed with the appearance of the stranger telegraphed his curiosity by elbowing the editor who however for some reason best known to himself failed to respond possibly he recognised the presence of the notorious mr jack hamlin in the darkeyed stranger and may have had ample reasons for refraining from voicing the popular reputation of that gentleman before his face or possibly he may have been inattentive howbeit after mr hamlins entrance he pretermitted the hymn of california praise and became reticent and absorbed in his morning paper mr hamlin waited for the lady to retire and then calmly ignoring the presence of any other individual languidly drew from his pocket a revolver and bowieknife and placing them in an easy habitual manner on either side of his plate glanced carelessly over the table and then called pete to his side  tell them said jack quietly that i want some large potatoes ask them what they mean by putting those little things on the table tell them to be quick is your rifle loaded  yes sah said pete promptly without relaxing a muscle of his serious ebony face  welltake it along with you  but here the curiosity of mr raynor who had been just commenting on the really enormous size of the potatoes got the best of his prudence failing to make his companion respond to his repeated elbowings he leaned over the table toward the languid stranger excuse me sir he said politely but did i understand you to say that you thought these potatoes smallthat there are really larger ones to be had  its the first time returned jack gravely that i ever was insulted by having a whole potato brought to me i didnt know it was possible before perhaps in this part of the country the vegetables are poor im a stranger to this section i take it you are too but because i am a stranger i dont see why i should be imposed upon  ah i see said the mystified raynor but if i might ask another questionyoull excuse me if im impertinenti noticed that you just now advised your servant to take his gun into the kitchen with him surely  pete interrupted mr hamlin languidly is a good nigger i shouldnt like to lose him perhaps youre rightmaybe i am a little overcautious but when a man has lost two servants by gunshot wounds inside of three months it makes him careful  the perfect unconcern of the speaker the reticence of his companion and the dead silence of the room in which this extraordinary speech was uttered filled the measure of mr raynors astonishment  bless my soul this is most extraordinary i have seen nothing of this he said appealing in dumb show to his companion  mr hamlin followed the direction of his eyes your friend is a californian and knows what we think of any man who lies and how most men resent such an imputation and i reckon hell endorse me  the editor muttered a hasty assent that seemed to cover mr hamlins various propositions and then hurriedly withdrew abandoning his charge to mr hamlin what advantage jack took of this situation what extravagant accounts he gravely offered of the vegetation in lower california of the resources of the country of the reckless disregard of life and property do not strictly belong to the record of this veracious chronicle notwithstanding all this mr raynor found mr hamlin an exceedingly fascinating companion and later when the editor had rejoined them and mr hamlin proceeded to beg that gentleman to warn mr raynor against gambling as the one seductive besetting sin of california alleging that it had been the ruin of both the editor and himself the tourist was so struck with the frankness and high moral principle of his new acquaintance as to insist upon his making one of their party an invitation that mr hamlin might have accepted but for the intervention of a singular occurrence  during the conversation he had been curiously impressed by the appearance of a stranger who had entered and modestly and diffidently taken a seat near the door to mr hamlin this modesty and diffidence appeared so curiously at variance with his superb physique and the exceptional strength and power shown in every muscle of his body that with his usual audacity he felt inclined to go forward and inquire what was his little game that he was lying in wait to be picked upthe reader must really excuse me if i continue to borrow mr hamlins expressive vernacularthat his diffidence and shyness was a deceit and intended to entrap the unwary he felt satisfied and was proportionably thrilled with a sense of admiration for him that a rational human being who held such a hand should be content with a small ante without raising the other playersbut i beg the fastidious readers forgiveness  he was dressed in the ordinary miners garb of the southern mines perhaps a little more cleanly than the average miner by reason of his taste certainly more picturesque by reason of his statuesque shapeliness he wore a pair of white duck trousers a jumper or loose blouse of the same material with a lowfolded sailors collar and sailorknotted neckerchief which displayed with an unconsciousness quite characteristic of the man the full muscular column of his sunburnt throat except where it was hidden by a full tawny beard his long sandy curls fell naturally and equally on either side of the centre of his low broad forehead his fair complexion although greatly tanned by exposure seemed to have faded lately as by sickness or great mental distress a theory that had some confirmation in the fact that he ate but little his eyes were downcast or when raised were so shy as to avoid critical examination nevertheless his mere superficial exterior was so striking as to attract the admiration of others besides mr hamlin to excite the enthusiastic attention of mr raynor and to enable the editor to offer him as a fair type of the mining population embarrassed at last by a scrutiny that asserted itself even through his habitual unconsciousness and preoccupation the subject of this criticism arose and returned to the hotel verandah where his pack and mining implements were lying mr hamlin who for the last few days had been in a rather exceptional mood for some occult reason which he could not explain felt like respecting the strangers reserve and quietly lounged into the billiardroom to wait for the coming of the stagecoach as soon as his back was turned the editor took occasion to offer mr raynor his own estimate of mr hamlins character and reputation to correct his misstatements regarding californian resources and social habits and to restore mr raynors possibly shaken faith in california as a country especially adapted to the secure investment of capital  as to the insecurity of life said the editor indignantly it is as safe here as in new york or boston we admit that in the early days the country was cursed by too many adventurers of the type of this very gambler hamlin but i will venture to say that you will require no better refutation of these calumnies than this very miner whom you admired he sir is a type of our mining population strong manly honest unassuming and perfectly gentle and retiring we are proud sir we admit of such meneh oh thats nothingonly the arrival of the upstage  it certainly was something more a momentarily increasing crowd of breathless men were gathered on the verandah before the window and were peering anxiously over each others head toward a central group among which towered the tall figure of the very miner of whom they had been speaking more than that there was a certain undefined restless terror in the air as when the intense conscious passion or suffering of one or two men communicates itself vaguely without speech sometimes even without visible sign to others and then yuba bill the driver of the wingdam coach strode out from the crowd into the barroom drawing from his hands with an evident effort his immense buckskin gloves  whats the row bill said halfadozen voices  nothin said bill gruffly only the sheriff of calaveras ez kem down with us hez nabbed his man jest in his very tracks  when bill  right yeron this very verandyfurst man he seed  what for who what hed he bin doin who is it whats up persisted the chorus  killed a man up at one horse gulch last night said bill grasping the decanter which the attentive barkeeper had without previous request placed before him  who did he kill bill  a little mexican from frisco by the name o ramirez  whats the mans name that killed himthe man that you took  the voice was jack hamlins  yuba bill instantly turned put down his glass wiped his mouth with his sleeve and then deliberately held out his great hand with an exhaustive grin dern my skin ole man if it aint you and hows things eh yer lookin a little white in the gills but peart and sassy ez usual heerd you was kinder off colour down in sacramento lass week and its you ole fell and jest in time barkeephist that pizen over to jack here to ye agin ole man but im glad to see ye  the crowd hung breathless over the two menawestruck and respectful it was a meeting of the godsjack hamlin and yuba bill none dare speak hamlin broke the silence at last and put down his glass  what he asked lazily yet with a slight colour on his cheek did you say was the name of the chap that fetched that little mexican  gabriel conroy said bill     chapter ii  mr hamlin takes a hand   the capture had been effected quietly to the evident astonishment of his captor gabriel had offered no resistance but had yielded himself up with a certain composed willingness as if it were only the preliminary step to the quicker solution of a problem that was sure to be solved it was observed however that he showed a degree of caution that was new to himasking to see the warrant the particulars of the discovery of the body and utterly withholding that voluble explanation or apology which all who knew his character confidently expected him to give whether guilty or innocenta caution which accepted by them as simply the low cunning of the criminal told against him he submitted quietly to a search that however disclosed no concealed weapon or anything of import but when a pair of handcuffs were shown him he changed colour and those that were nearest to him saw that he breathed hurriedly and hesitated in the first words of some protest that rose to his lips the sheriff a man of known intrepidity who had the rapid and clear intuition that comes with courageous selfpossession noticed it also and quietly put the handcuffs back in his pocket  i reckon theres no use for em here ef youre willin to take the risks i am  the eyes of the two men met and gabriel thanked him in that look he recognised and accepted the fact that on a motion to escape he would be instantly killed  they were to return with the next stage and in the interval gabriel was placed in an upper room and securely guarded here falling into his old apologetic manner he asked permission to smoke a pipe which was at once granted by his goodhumoured guard and then threw himself at full length upon the bed the rising wind rattled the windows noisily and entering tossed the smokewreaths that rose from his pipe in fitful waves about the room the guard who was much more embarrassed than his charge was relieved of an ineffectual attempt to carry on a conversation suitable to the occasion by gabriels simple directness  you neednt put yourself out to pass the time o day with me he said gently that bein extry to your reglar work ef you hev any friends ez youd like to talk to in your own line invite em in and dont mind me  but here the guards embarrassment was further relieved by the entrance of joe hall the sheriff  theres a gentleman here to speak with you he said to gabriel he can stay until were ready to go turning to the guard he added you can take a chair outside the door in the hall its all right its the prisoners counsel  at the word gabriel looked up following the sheriff lawyer maxwell entered the room he approached gabriel and extended with grave cordiality a hand that had apparently wiped from his mouth the last trace of mirthfulness at the door  i did not expect to see you again so soon gabriel but as quickly as the news reached me and i heard that our friend hall had a warrant for you i started after him i would have got here before him but my horse gave out he paused and looked steadily at gabriel well  gabriel looked at him in return but did not speak  i supposed you would need professional aid he went on with a slight hesitation perhaps mineknowing that i was aware of some of the circumstances that preceded this affair  wot circumstances asked gabriel with the sudden look of cunning that had before prejudiced his captors  for heavens sake gabriel said maxwell rising with a gesture of impatience dont let us repeat the blunder of our first interview this is a serious matter may be very serious to you think a moment yesterday you sought my professional aid to deed to your wife all your property telling me that you were going away never to return to one horse gulch i do not ask you now why you did it i only want you to reflect that i am just now the only man who knows that circumstancea circumstance that i can tell you as a lawyer is somewhat important in the light of the crime that you are now charged with  maxwell waited for gabriel to speak wiping away as he waited the usual smile that lingered around his lips but gabriel said nothing  gabriel conroy said lawyer maxwell suddenly dropping into the vernacular of one horse gulch are you a fool  thets so said gabriel with the simplicity of a man admitting a selfevident proposition thets so i reckon i are  i shouldnt wonder said maxwell again swiftly turning upon him if you were he stopped as if ashamed of his abruptness and said more quietly and persuasively come gabriel if you wont confess to me i suppose that i must to you six months ago i thought you an impostor six months ago the woman who is now your wife charged you with being an impostor with assuming a name and right that did not belong to you in plain english said that you had set yourself up as gabriel conroy and that she who was grace conroy the sister of the real gabriel knew that you lied she substantiated all this by proofs hang it continued maxwell appealing in dumb show to the walls there isnt a lawyer living as wouldnt have said it was a good case and been ready to push it in any court under these circumstances i sought you and you remember how you know the result of that interview i can tell you now that if there ever was a man who palpably confessed to guilt when he was innocent you were that man well after your conduct there was explained by olly without however damaging the original evidence against you or prejudicing her rights this woman came to me and said that she had discovered that you were the man who had saved her life at the risk of your own and that for the present she could not in delicacy push her claim when afterwards she told me that this gratitude hadwell ripened into something more serious and that she had engaged herself to marry you and so condone your offence why it was womanlike and natural and i suspected nothing i believed her storybelieved she had a case yes sir the last six months i have looked upon you as the creature of that womans foolish magnanimity i could see that she was soft on you and believed that you had fooled her i did hang me there if you confess to being a fool i do to having been an infernal sight bigger one  he stopped erased the mirthful past with his hand and went on  i began to suspect something when you came to me yesterday with this story of your going away and this disposal of your property when i heard of the murder of this strangerone of your wifes witnesses to her claimnear your house your own flight and the sudden disappearance of your wife my suspicions were strengthened and when i read this note from your wife delivered to you last night by one of her servants and picked up early this morning near the body my suspicions were confirmed  as he finished he took from his pocket a folded paper and handed it to gabriel he received it mechanically and opened it it was his wifes note of the preceding night he took out his knife still holding the letter and with its blade began stirring the bowl of his pipe then after a pause he asked cautiously  and how did ye come by this yer  it was found by sal clark brought to mrs markle and given to me its existence is known only to three people and they are your friends  there was another pause in which gabriel deliberately stirred the contents of his pipe mr maxwell examined him curiously  well he said at last what is your defence  gabriel sat up on the bed and rapped the bowl of his pipe against the bedpost to loosen some refractory encrustation  wot he asked gravely would be your idee of a good defence axin ye ez a lawyer having experins in them things and recknin to pay ez high ez eny man fo the same wot would you call a good defence and he gravely laid himself down again in an attitude of respectful attention  we hope to prove said maxwell really smiling that when you left your house and came to my office the murdered man was alive and at his hotel that he went over to the hill long before you did that you did not return until the eveningafter the murder was committed as the secret mentioned in your wifes mysterious note evidently shows that for some reason or other it was her design to place you in a suspicious attitude that the note shows that she refers to some fact of which she was cognisant and not yourself  suthin that she knowed and i didnt get to hear translated gabriel quietly  exactly now you see the importance of that note  gabriel did not immediately reply but slowly lifted his huge frame from the bed walked to the open window still holding the paper in his hands deliberately tore it into the minutest shreds before the lawyer could interfere and then threw it from the window  thet paper dont mount ter beans no how he said quietly but explanatively as he returned to the bed  it was lawyer maxwells turn to become dumb in his astonished abstraction he forgot to wipe his mouth and gazed at gabriel with his nervous smile as if his client had just perpetrated a practical joke of the first magnitude  ef its the same to you ill just gin ye me idee of a defence said gabriel apologetically relighting his pipe allowin o course that you knows best and askin no deduckshun from your charges for advice well you jess stands

hopelesslythen if i understand you you intend to admit  thet i done it in course replied gabriel but he added with a cunning twinkle in his eye justifyblyjustifyble homyside ye mindbein in fear o my life from seving men in course he added hurriedly i cant identify them seving strangers in the dark so thars no harm or suspicion goin to be done enny o the boys in the gulch  maxwell walked gravely to the window and stood looking out without speaking suddenly he turned upon gabriel with a brighter face and more earnest manner wheres olly  gabriels face fell he hesitated a moment i was on my way to the school in sacramento whar she iz  you must send for heri must see her at once  gabriel laid his powerful hand on the lawyers shoulder she izntthat chileto knows anythin o this you hear he said in a voice that began in tones of deprecation and ended in a note of stern warning  how are you to keep it from her said maxwell as determinedly in less than twentyfour hours every newspaper in the state will have itwith their own version and comments no you must see her she must hear it first from your own lips  buticantseeher just now said gabriel with a voice that for the first time during their interview faltered in its accents  nor need you responded the lawyer quickly trust that to me i will see her and you shall afterwards you need not fear i will prejudice your case give me the address quick he added as the sound of footsteps and voices approaching the room came from the hall gabriel did as he requested now one word he continued hurriedly as the footsteps halted at the door  yes said gabriel  as you value your life and ollys happiness hold your tongue  gabriel nodded with cunning comprehension the door opened to mr jack hamlin diabolically mischievous selfconfident and audacious with a familiar nod to maxwell he stepped quickly before gabriel and extended his hand simply yet conscious of obeying some vague magnetic influence gabriel reached out his own hand and took jacks white nervous fingers in his own calm massive grasp  glad to see you pard said that gentleman showing his white teeth and reaching up to clap his disengaged hand on gabriels shoulder glad to see you old boyeven if you have cut in and taken a job out of my hands that i was rather lyin by to do myself sooner or later id have fetched that mexicanif you hadnt dropped into my seat and taken up my hand oh its all right mack he said intercepting the quick look of caution that maxwell darted at his client dont do that were all friends here if you want me to testify ill take my oath that there hasnt been a day this six months that that infernal hound ramirez wasnt jest pantin to be planted in his tracks i can hardly believe i aint done it myself he stopped partly to enjoy the palpable uneasiness of maxwell and perhaps in some admiration of gabriels physique  maxwell quickly seized this point of vantage you can do your friend here a very great service he said to jack lowering his voice as he spoke  jack laughed no mack it wont do they wouldnt believe me there aint judge or jury you could play that on  you dont understand me said maxwell laughing a little awkwardly i didnt mean that jack this man was going to sacramento to see his little sister  go on said jack with much gravity of course he was i know that dear brother dear brother come home with me now certainly som i goin to see an innocent little thing bout seventeen years old blue eyes and curly hair always go there once a week says he must come says shellhe stopped in the full tide of his irony for looking up he caught a glimpse of gabriels simple troubled face and sadly reproachful eyes look here said jack turning savagely on maxwell what are you talking about anyway  i mean what i say returned maxwell quickly he was going to see his sistera mere child of course he cant go now but he must see herif she can be brought to him can youwill you do it  jack cast another swift glance at gabriel count me in he said promptly when shall i go  nowat once  all right where shall i fetch her to  one horse gulch  the games made said jack sententiously shell be there by sundown tomorrow he was off like a flash but as swiftly returned and called maxwell to the door look here he said in a whisper praps it would be as well if the sheriff didnt know i was his friend he went on indicating gabriel with a toss of his head and a wink of his black eye because you see joe hall and i aint friends we had a little difficulty and some shootin and foolishness down at marysville last year joes a good square man but he aint above prejudice and it might go against our man  maxwell nodded and jack once more darted off  but his colour was so high and his exaltation so excessive that when he reached his room his faithful pete looked at him in undisguised alarm bress usit taint no whisky mars jack arter all de doctors tole you he said clasping his hands in dismay  the bare suggestion was enough for jack in his present hilarious humour he instantly hiccuped lapsed wildly over against pete with artfully simulated alcoholic weakness tumbled him on the floor and grasping his white woolly head waved over it a bootjack and frantically demanded another bottle then he laughed as suddenly got up with the greatest gravity and a complete change in his demeanour and wanted to know severely what he pete meant by lying there on the floor in a state of beastly intoxication  bress me mars jack but ye did frighten me i jiss allowed dem tourists downstairs had been gettin ye tight  you didyou degraded old ruffian if youd been reading volneys ruins or reflectin on some of those moral maxims that im just wastin my time and health unloading to you instead of making me the subject of your inebriated reveries you wouldnt get picked up so often pack my valise and chuck it into some horse and buggyno matter whose be quick  is we gwine to sacramento mars jack  we no sir im goingalone what im doing now sir is only the result or calm reflectionof lying awake nights taking points and jest spottin the whole situation and im convinced peter that i can stay with you no longer youve been hackin the keen edge of my finer feelins playin it very low down on my moral and religious nature generally ringin in a cold deck on my spiritual condition for the last five years youve jest cut up thet rough with my higher emotions thet there aint enough left to chip in on a tencent ante five years ago continued jack coolly brushing his curls before the glass i fell into your hands a guileless simple youth in the first flush of manhood knowin no points easily picked up on my sensibilities and travellin so to speak on my shape and where am i now echo answers where and passes for a euchre no peter i leave you tonight wretched misleader of youth gummy old man with the strawberry eyebrows farewell  evidently this style of exordium was no novelty to pete for without apparently paying the least attention to it he went on surlily packing his masters valise when he had finished he looked up at mr hamlin who was humming in a heartbroken way yes we must part varied by occasional glances of exaggerated reproach at pete and said as he shouldered the valise  dis yer aint no woman foolishness mars jack like down at dat yar mission  your suggestion peter returned jack with dignity emanates from a moral sentiment debased by love feasts and camp meetings and an intellect weakened by rum and gum and the contact of lager beer jerkers it is worthy of a shortcard sharp and a keno flopper which i have i regret to say long suspected you to be farewell you will stay here until i come back if i dont come back by the day after tomorrow come to one horse gulch pay the bill and dont knock down for yourself more than seventyfive per cent remember i am getting old and feeble you are yet young with a brilliant future before you git  he tossed a handful of gold on the bed adjusted his hat carefully over his curls and strode from the room in the lower hall he stopped long enough to take aside mr raynor and with an appearance of the greatest conscientiousness to correct an error of two feet in the measurements he had given him that morning of an enormous pine tree in whose prostrate trunk he mr hamlin had once found a peaceful happy tribe of one hundred indians living then lifting his hat with marked politeness to mrs raynor and totally ignoring the presence of mr raynors mentor and companion he leaped lightly into the buggy and drove away  an entertaining fellow said mr raynor glancing after the cloud of dust that flew from the untarrying wheels of mr hamlins chariot  and so gentlemanly smiled mrs raynor  but the journalistic conservator of the public morals of california in and for the city and county of san francisco looked grave and deprecated even that feeble praise of the departed his class are a curse to the country they hold the law in contempt they retard by the example of their extravagance the virtues of economy and thrift they are consumers and not producers they bring the fair fame of this land into question by those who foolishly take them for a type of the people  but dear me said mrs raynor pouting where your gamblers and bad men are so fascinating and your honest miners are so dreadfully murderous and kill people and then sit down to breakfast with you as if nothing had happened what are you going to do  the journalist did not immediately reply in the course of some eloquent remarks as unexceptionable in morality as in diction which i regret i have not space to reproduce here he however intimated that there was still an unfettered press which scintillated and shone and lashed and stung and exposed and tore away the veil and became at various times a palladium and a watchtower and did and was a great many other remarkable things peculiar to an unfettered press in a pioneer community when untrammelled by the enervating conditions of an effete civilisation  and what have they done with the murderer asked mr raynor repressing a slight yawn  taken him back to one horse gulch half an hour ago i reckon hed as lief stayed here said a bystander from the way things are pintin it looks as if it might be putty lively for him up thar  what do you mean asked raynor curiously  well two or three of them old vigilantes from angels passed yer a minit ago with their rifles goin up that way returned the man lazily maynt be nothing in it but it looks mighty like  like what asked mr raynor a little nervously  lynchin said the man     chapter iii  in which mr dumphy takes poinsett into his confidence   the cool weather of the morning following mr dumphys momentous interview with colonel starbottle contributed somewhat to restore the former gentlemans tranquillity which had been considerably disturbed he had moreover a vague recollection of having invited colonel starbottle to visit him socially and a nervous dread of meeting this man whose audacity was equal to his own in the company of others braced however by the tonic of the clear exhilarating air and sustained by the presence of his clerks and the respectful homage of his business associates he despatched a note to arthur poinsett requesting an interview punctually at the hour named that gentleman presented himself and was languidly surprised when mr dumphy called his clerk and gave positive orders that their interview was not to be disturbed and to refuse admittance to all other visitors and then mr dumphy in a peremptory practical statement which his business habits and temperament had brought to a perfection that arthur could not help admiring presented the details of his interview with colonel starbottle now i want you to help me i have sent to you for that business purpose you understand this is not a matter for the banks regular counsel now what do you propose  first let me ask you do you believe your wife is living  no said dumphy promptly but of course i dont know  then let me relieve your mind at once and tell you that she is not  you know this to be a fact asked dumphy  i do the body supposed to be grace conroys and so identified was your wifes i recognised it at once knowing grace conroy to have been absent at the culmination of the tragedy  and why did you not correct the mistake  that is my business said arthur haughtily and i believe i have been invited here to attend to yours your wife is dead  then said mr dumphy rising with a brisk business air if you are willing to testify to that fact i reckon there is nothing more to be done  arthur did not rise but sat watching mr dumphy with an unmoved face after a moment mr dumphy sat down again and looked aggressively but nervously at arthur well he said at last  is that all asked arthur quietly are you willing to go on and establish the fact  dont know what you mean said dumphy with an attempted frankness which failed signally  one moment mr dumphy you are a shrewd business man now do you suppose the personwhoever he or she may be who has sent colonel starbottle to you relies alone upon your inability to legally prove your wifes death may they not calculate somewhat on your indisposition to prove it legally on the theory that youd rather not open the case for instance  mr dumphy hesitated a moment and bit his lip of course he said shortly thered be some talk among my enemies about my deserting my wife  and child suggested arthur  and child repeated dumphy savagely and not coming back againthered be suthin in the papers about it unless i paid em but whats thatdeserting ones wife isnt such a new thing in california  that is so said arthur with a sarcasm that was none the less sincere because he felt its applicability to himself  but were not getting on said mr dumphy impatiently whats to be done thats what ive sent to you for  now that we know it is not your wifewe must find out who it is that stands back of colonel starbottle it is evidently some one who knows at least as much as we do of the facts we are lucky if they know no more can you think of any one who are the survivors lets see you myself possibly grace  it couldnt be grace conroy really alive interrupted dumphy hastily  no said arthur quietly you remember she was not present at the time  gabriel  i hardly think so besides he is a friend of yours  it couldnt bedumphy stopped in his speech with a certain savage alarm in his looks arthur noticed itand quietly went on  who couldnt it be  nothingnobody i was only thinking if gabriel or somebody could have told the story to some designing rascal  hardlyin sufficient detail  well said dumphy with his coarse barklike laugh if ive got to pay to see mrs dumphy decently buried i suppose i can rely upon you to see that its done without a chance of resurrection find out who starbottles friend is and how much he or she expects if ive got to pay for this thing ill do it now and get the benefit of absolute silence so ill leave it in your hands and he again rose as if dismissing the subject and his visitor after his habitual business manner  dumphy said arthur still keeping his own seat and ignoring the significance of dumphys manner there are two professions that suffer from a want of frankness in the men who seek their services those professions are medicine and the law i can understand why a man seeks to deceive his physician because he is humbugging himself but i cant see why he is not frank to his lawyer you are no exception to the rule you are now concealing from me whose aid you have sought some very important reason why you wish to have this whole affair hidden beneath the snow of starvation camp  dont know what youre driving at said dumphy but he sat down again  well listen to me and perhaps i can make my meaning clearer my acquaintance with the late dr devarges began some months before we saw you during our intimacy he often spoke to me of his scientific discoveries in which i took some interest and i remember seeing among his papers frequent records and descriptions of localities in the foothills which he thought bore the indications of great mineral wealth at that time the doctors theories and speculations appeared to me to be visionary and the records of no value nevertheless when we were shut up in starvation camp and it seemed doubtful if the doctor would survive his discoveries at his request i deposited his papers and specimens in a cairn at monument point after the catastrophe on my return with the relief party to camp we found that the cairn had been opened by some one and the papers and specimens scattered on the snow we supposed this to have been the work of mrs brackett who in search of food had broken the cairn taken out the specimens and died from the effects of the poison with which they had been preserved  he paused and looked at dumphy who did not speak  now continued arthur like all californians i have followed your various successes with interest and wonder i have noticed with the gratification that all your friends experience the singular good fortune which has distinguished your mining enterprises and the claims you have located but i have been cognisant of a fact unknown i think to any other of your friends that nearly all of the localities of your successful claims by a singular coincidence agree with the memorandums of dr devarges  dumphy sprang to his feet with a savage brutal laugh so he shouted coarsely thats the game is it so it seems im lucky in coming to youno trouble in finding this woman now hey well go on this is getting interesting lets hear the rest what are your propositions what if i refuse hey  my first proposition said arthur rising to his feet with a cold wicked light in his grey eyes is that you shall instantly take that speech back and beg my pardon if you refuse by the living god ill throttle you where you stand  for one wild moment all the savage animal in dumphy rose and he instinctively made a step in the direction of poinsett arthur did not move then mr dumphys practical caution asserted itself a physical personal struggle with arthur would bring in witnesseswitnesses perhaps of something more than that personal struggle if he were victorious arthur unless killed outright would revenge himself by an exposure he sank back in his chair again had arthur known the low estimate placed upon his honour by mr dumphy he would have been less complacent in his victory  i didnt mean to suspect you said dumphy at last with a forced smile i hope youll excuse me i know youre my friend but youre all wrong about these papers you are poinsett i swear i know if the fact were known to outsiders it would look queer if not explained but whose business is it anyway legally i mean  no ones unless devarges has friends or heirs  he hadnt any  theres that wife  bahshe was divorced  indeed you told me on our last interview that she really was the widow of devarges  never mind that now said dumphy impatiently look here you know as well as i do that no matter how many discoveries devarges made they werent worth a dn if he hadnt done some work on themimproved or opened them  but that is not the point at issue just now said arthur nobody is going to contest your claim or sue you for damages but they might try to convict you of a crime they might say that breaking into the cairn was burglary and the taking of the papers theft  but how are they going to prove that  no matter listen to me and dont let us drift away from the main point the question that concerns you is this an impostor sets up a claim to be your wife you and i know she is an impostor and can prove it she knows that but knows also that in attempting to prove it you lay yourself open to some grave charges which she doubtless stands ready to make  well then the first thing to do is to find out who she is what she knows and what she wants eh said dumphy  no said arthur quietly the first thing to do is to prove that your wife is really dead and to do that you must show that grace conroy was alive when the body purporting to be hers but which was really your wifes was discovered once establish that fact and you destroy the credibility of the spanish reports and you need not fear any revelation from that source regarding the missing papers and that is the only source from which evidence against you can be procured but when you destroy the validity of that report you of course destroy the credibility of all concerned in making it and as i was concerned in making it of course it wont do for you to put me on the stand  notwithstanding dumphys disappointment he could not help yielding to a sudden respect for the superior rascal who thus cleverly slipped out of responsibility but added arthur coolly youll have no difficulty in establishing the fact of graces survival by others  dumphy thought at once of ramirez here was a man who had seen and conversed with grace when she had in the face of the spanish commander indignantly asserted her identity and the falsity of the report no witness could be more satisfactory and convincing but to make use of him he must first take arthur into his confidence must first expose the conspiracy of madame devarges to personate grace and his own complicity with the transaction he hesitated nevertheless he had been lately tortured by a suspicion that the late madame devarges was in some way connected with the later conspiracy against himself and he longed to avail himself of arthurs superior sagacity and after a second reflection he concluded to do it with the same practical conciseness of statement that he had used in relating colonel starbottles interview with himself he told the story of madame devarges brief personation of grace conroy and its speedy and felicitous ending in mrs conroy arthur listened with unmistakable interest and a slowly brightening colour when dumphy had concluded he sat for a moment apparently lost in thought  well at last said dumphy interrogatively and impatiently  arthur started well he said rising and replacing his hat with the air of a man who had thoroughly exhausted his subject your frankness has saved me a world of trouble  how said dumphy  there is no necessity for looking any further for your alleged wife she exists at present as mrs conroy alias madame devarges alias grace conroy ramirez is your witness you couldnt have a more willing one  then my suspicions are correct  i dont know on what you based them but here is a woman who has unlimited power over men particularly over one man gabrielwho alone of all men but ourselves knows the facts regarding your desertion of your wife in starvation camp her death and the placing of dr devarges private papers by me in the cairn he knows too of your knowledge of the existence of the cairn its locality and contents he knows this because he was in the cabin that night when the doctor gave me his dying injunctions regarding his propertythe night that youexcuse me dumphy but nothing but frankness will save us nowthe night that you stood listening at the door and frightened grace with your wolfish face dont speak she told me all about it your presence there that night gained you the information that you have used so profitably it was your presence that fixed her wavering resolves and sent her away with me  both men had become very pale and earnest arthur moved toward the door i will see you tomorrow when i will have matured some plan of defence he said abstractedly we havehe used the plural of advocacy with a peculiar significancewe have a clever woman to fight who may be more than our match meantime remember that ramirez is our defence he is our man dumphy hold fast to him as you would to your life goodday  in another moment he was gone as the door closed upon him a clerk entered hastily from the outer office you said not to disturb you sir and here is an important despatch waiting for you from wingdam  mr dumphy took it mechanically opened it read the first line and then said hurriedly run after that man quickstop wait a moment you need not go there that will do  the clerk hurriedly withdrew into the outer office mr dumphy went back to his desk again and once more devoured the following lines       wingdam 7th 6 amvictor ramirez murdered last night on      conroys hill gabriel conroy arrested mrs conroy missing      great excitement here strong feeling against gabriel wait      instructionsfitch  at first mr dumphy only heard as an echo beating in his brain the parting words of arthur poinsett ramirez is our defence hold fast to him as you would your life and now he was deadgone their only witness killed by gabriel the plotter what more was wanted to justify his worst suspicions what should they do he must send after poinsett again the plan of defence must be changed at once tomorrow might be too late stop  one of his accusers in prison charged with a capital crime the otherthe real murdererfor dumphy made no doubt that mrs conroy was responsible for the deeda fugitive from justice what need of any witness now the blow that crippled these three conspirators had liberated him for a moment mr dumphy was actually conscious of a paroxysm of gratitude toward some indefinitely supreme beinga god of special providencespecial to himself more than this there was that vague sentiment common i fear to common humanity in such crises that this providence was a tacit endorsement of himself it was the triumph of virtue dumphy over vice conroy et al  but there would be a trial publicity and the possible exposure of certain things by a man whom danger might make reckless and could he count upon mrs conroys absence or neutrality he was conscious that her feeling for her husband was stronger than he had supposed and she might dare everything to save him what had a woman of that kind to do with such weakness why hadnt she managed it so as to kill gabriel too there was an evident want of practical completeness in this special providence that as a business man mr dumphy felt he could have regulated and then he was seized with an ideaa damnable inspirationand set himself briskly to write i regret to say that despite the popular belief in the dramatic character of all villany mr dumphy at this moment presented only the commonplace spectacle of an absorbed man of business no lurid light gleamed from his pale blue eyes no satanic smile played around the corners of his smoothly shaven mouth no feverish exclamation stirred his moist cool lips he wrote methodically and briskly without deliberation or undue haste when he had written halfadozen letters he folded and sealed them and without summoning his clerk took them himself into the outer office and thence into the large countingroom the news of the murder had evidently got abroad the clerks were congregated together and the sound of eager interested voices ceased as the great man entered and stood among them  fitch you and judson will take the quickest route to one horse gulch tonight dont waste any time on the road or spare any expense when you get there deliver these letters and take your orders from my correspondents pick up all the details you can about this affair and let me know whats your balance at the gulch mr peebles never mind the exact figures  larger than usual sir some heavy deposits  increase your balance then if there should be any dd fools who connect the bank with this matter  i suppose said mr fitch respectfully were to look after your foreman mr conroy sir  you are to take your orders from my correspondent mr fitch and not to interfere in any way with public sentiment we have nothing to do with the private acts of anybody justice will probably be done to conroy it is time that these outrages upon the reputation of the california miner should be stopped when the fame of a whole community is prejudiced and business injured by the rowdyism of a single ruffian said mr dumphy raising his voice slightly as he discovered the interested and absorbed presence of some of his most respectable customers it is time that prompt action should be taken in fact he would have left behind him a strong roman flavour and a general suggestion of brutus had he not unfortunately effected an anticlimax by adding thats business sir as he retired to his private office     chapter iv  mr hamlin is off with an old love   mr jack hamlin did not lose much time on the road from wingdam to sacramento his rapid driving his dust bespattered vehicle and the exhausted condition of his horse on arrival excited but little comment from those who knew his habits and for other criticism he had a supreme indifference he was prudent enough however to leave his horse at a stable on the outskirts and having reconstructed his toilet at a neighbouring hotel he walked briskly toward the address given him by maxwell when he reached the corner of the street and was within a few paces of the massive shining door plate of madame eclairs pensionnat he stopped with a sudden ejaculation and after a moments hesitation turned on his heel deliberately and began to retrace his steps  to explain mr hamlins singular conduct i shall be obliged to disclose a secret of his which i would fain keep from the fair reader on receiving ollys address from maxwell mr hamlin had only cursorily glanced at it and it was only on arriving before the house that he recognised to his horror that it was a boardingschool with one of whose impulsive inmates he had whiled away his idleness a few months before in a heartbreaking but innocent flirtation and a soulsubduing but clandestine correspondence much to the distaste of the correct principal to have presented himself there in his proper person would be to have been refused admittance or subjected to a suspicion that would have kept olly from his hands for once mr hamlin severely regretted his infelix reputation among the sex but he did not turn his back on his enterprise he retraced his steps only to the main street visited a barbers shop and a jewellers and reappeared on the street again with a pair of enormous green goggles and all traces of his long distinguishing silken black moustache shaven from his lip when it is remembered that this rascal was somewhat vain of his personal appearance the reader will appreciate his earnestness and the extent of his sacrifice  nevertheless he was a little nervous as he was ushered into the formal receptionroom of the pensionnat and waited until his credentials countersigned by maxwell were submitted to madame eclair mr hamlin had no fear of being detected by his real name in the brief halcyon days of his romance he had been known as clarence spifflingtonan ingenious combination of the sentimental and humorous which suited his fancy and to some extent he felt expressed the character of his affection fate was propitious the servant returned saying that miss conroy would be down in a moment and mr hamlin looked at his watch every moment was precious he was beginning to get impatient when the door opened again and olly slipped into the room  she was a pretty child with a peculiar boyish frankness of glance and manner and a refinement of feature that fascinated mr hamlin who fond as he was of all childhood had certain masculine preferences for good looks she seemed to be struggling with a desire to laugh when she entered and when jack turned towards her with extended hands she held up her own warningly and closing the door behind her cautiously said in a demure whisper  shell come down as soon as she can slip past madames door  who asked jack  sophy  whos sophy asked jack seriously he had never known the name of his dulcinea in the dim epistolatory region of sentiment she had existed only as the blue moselle so called from the cerulean hue of her favourite raiment and occasionally in moments of familiar endearment as mosey  come now pretend you dont know will you said olly evading the kiss which jack always had ready for childhood if i was her i wouldnt have anything to say to you after that she added with that ostentatious chivalry of the sex towards each other in the presence of their common enemy why she saw you from the window when you first came this morning when you went back again and shaved off your moustache she knew you and you dont know her its mean aint ittheyll grow again wont theymiss olly referred to the mustachios and not the affections  jack was astonished and alarmed in his anxiety to evade or placate the duenna he had never thought of her chargehis sweetheart here was a dilemma oh yes said jack hastily with a well simulated expression of arch affection sophyof coursethats my little game but ive got a note for you too my dear and he handed olly the few lines that gabriel had hastily scrawled he watched her keenly almost breathlessly as she read them to his utter bewilderment she laid the note down indifferently and said thats like gabethe old simpleton  but youre goin to do what he says asked mr hamlin aint you  no said olly promptly i aint why lord mr hamlin you dont know that man why he does this sort o thing every week perceiving jack stare she went on why only last week didnt he send to me to meet him out on the corner of the street and he my own brother instead o comin here ez he hez a right to do go to him at wingdam no ketch me  but suppose he cant come continued mr hamlin  why cant he come i tell you its just foolishness and the meanest kind o bashfulness jes because there happened to be a young lady here from san francisco rosey ringround who was a little took with the old fool if he could come to wingdam why couldnt he come herethats what i want to know  will you let me see that note asked hamlin  olly handed him the note with the remark he dont spell welland he wont let me teach himthe old muggins  hamlin took it and read as follows       dear ollyif it dont run a fowl uv yer lessings and the      maddams willin and the young laddies brother gabs waitin      fer ye at wingdam so no more from your affeshtunate brother      gab  mr hamlin was in a quandary it never had been part of his plan to let olly know the importance of her journey mr maxwells injunctions to bring her quietly his own fears of an outburst that might bring a questioning and sympathetic school about his ears and lastly and not the least potently his own desire to enjoy ollys company in the long ride to one horse gulch without the preoccupation of grief with his own comfortable conviction that he could eventually bring gabriel out of this fix without olly knowing anything about it all this forbade his telling her the truth but here was a coil he had not thought of howbeit mr hamlin was quick at expedients  then you think sophy can see me he added with a sudden interest  of course she will said olly archly it was right smart in you to get acquainted with gabe and set him up to writing that though its just like him hes that soft that anybody could get round him but there she is now mr hamlin thats her step on the stairs and i dont suppose you two hez any need of me now  and she slipped out of the room as demurely as she had entered at the same moment that a tall slim and somewhat sensational young lady in blue came flying in  i can in justice to mr hamlin whose secrets have been perhaps needlessly violated in the progress of this story do no less than pass over as sacred and perhaps wholly irrelevant to the issue the interview that took place between himself and miss sophy that he succeeded in convincing that young woman of his unaltered loyalty that he explained his long silence as the result of a torturing doubt of the permanence of her own affection that his presence at that moment was the successful culmination of a longmatured and desperate plan to see her once more and learn the truth from her own lips i am sure that no member of my own disgraceful sex will question and i trust no member of a too fond and confiding sex will doubt that some bitterness was felt by mr hamlin who was conscious of certain irregularities during this long interval and some tears shed by miss sophy who was equally conscious of more or less aberration of her own magnetic instincts during his absence i think will be selfevident to the largely comprehending reader howbeit at the end of ten tender yet tranquillising minutes mr hamlin remarked in low thrilling tones  by the aid of a few confiding friends and playin it rather low on them i got that note to the conroy girl but the games up and we might as well pass in our checks now if she goes back on us and passes out which i reckons her little game if what you say is true sophy and you do sometimes look back to the past and things is generally on the square youll go for that olly and fetch her for if i go back without that child and throw up my hand its just tampering with the holiest affections and playing it mighty rough on as white a man as ever you saw sophy to say nothing of your reputation and everybody ready to buck agin us who has ten cents to chip in on you must make her go back with me and put things on a specie basis  in spite of the mixed character of mr hamlins metaphor his eloquence was so convincing and effective that miss sophy at once proceeded with considerable indignation to insist upon ollys withdrawing her refusal  if this is the way you are going to act you horrid little thing after all that me and hims trusted you id like to see the girl in school that will ever tell you anything again thats all a threat so appalling that olly who did not stop to consider that this confidence was very recent and had been forced upon her assented without further delay exhibited gabriels letter to madame eclair and having received that ladys gracious permission to visit her brother was in half an hour in company with mr hamlin on the road     chapter v  the three voices   once free from the trammelling fascinations of sophy and the more dangerous espionage of madame eclair and with the object of his mission accomplished mr hamlin recovered his natural spirits and became so hilarious that olly who attributed this exaltation to his interview with sophy felt constrained to make some disparaging remarks about that young lady partly by way of getting even with her for her recent interference and partly in obedience to some well known but unexplained law of the sex to her great surprise however mr hamlins spirits were in no way damped nor did he make any attempt to defend his lalage nevertheless he listened attentively and when she had concluded he looked suddenly down upon her chip hat and thick yellow tresses and said  ever been in the southern country olly  no returned the child  never down about san antonio visiting friends or relations  no said olly decidedly  mr hamlin was silent for some time giving his exclusive attention to his horse who was evincing a disposition to break into a gallop when he had brought the animal back into a trot again he continued  theres a woman olly  down in san antonio asked olly  mr hamlin nodded  purty continued the child  it aint the word responded mr hamlin seriously purty aint the word  as purty as sophy continued olly a little mischievously  sophy be hanged mr hamlin here quickly pulled up himself and horse both being inclined to an exuberance startling to the youth and sex of the third party that isi mean something in a different suit entirely  here he again hesitated doubtful of his slang  i see quoth olly diamondssophys in spades  the gambler in sudden and awful admiration diamondsyouve just struck it but what do you know bout cards  olly pomposaménte everything tell our fortunes by emwe girls im in heartssophys in spadesyoure in clubs do you know in a thrilling whisper only last night i had a letter a journey a death and a gentleman in clubs dark complectedthats you  mr hamlina good deal more at ease through this revelation of the universal power of the four suitsspeakin of women i suppose down there indicating the school you occasionally hear of angels whats their general complexion  olly dubiously in the pictures  hamlin yes with a leading question sorter dark complected sometimes hey  olly positively never always white  jack always white  olly yes and flabby  they rode along for some time silently presently mr hamlin broke into a song a popular song one verse of which olly supplied with such deftness of execution and melodiousness of pipe that mr hamlin instantly suggested a duet and so over the dead and barren wastes of the sacramento plains they fell to singing often barbarously sometimes melodiously but never selfconsciously wherein i take it they approximated to the birds and better class of poets so that rough teamsters rude packers and weary wayfarers were often touched as with the birds and poets aforesaid to admiration and tenderness and when they stopped for supper at a wayside station and jack hamlin displayed that readiness of resource audacity of manner and address and perfect and natural obliviousness to the criticism of propriety or the limitations of precedent and when moreover the results of all this was a much better supper than perhaps a more reputable companion could have procured she thought she had never known a more engaging person than this knave of clubs  when they were fairly on the road again olly began to exhibit some curiosity regarding her brother and asked some few questions about gabriels family which disclosed the fact that jacks acquaintance with gabriel was comparatively recent  then you never saw july at all asked olly  july queried jack reflectively whats she like  i dont know whether shes a heart or a spade said olly as thoughtfully  jack was silent for some moments and then after a pause to ollys intense astonishment proceeded to sketch in a few vigorous phrases the external characteristics of mrs conroy  why you said you never saw her ejaculated olly  no more i did responded the gambler with a quick laugh this is only a little bluff  it had grown cold with the brief twilight and the coming on of night for some time the black unchanging outlines of the distant coast range were sharply silhouetted against a pale ashen sky that at last faded utterly leaving a few stars behind as emblems of the burntout sunset the red road presently lost its calm and even outline in the swiftly gathering shadows or to ollys fancy was stopped by shapeless masses of rock or giantlike trunks of trees that in turn seemed to give way before the skilful hand and persistent will of her driver at times a chill exhalation from a roadside ditch came to olly like the damp breath of an open grave and the child shivered even beneath the thick travelling shawl of mr hamlin with which she was enwrapped whereat jack at once produced a flask and prevailed upon olly to drink something that set her coughing but which that astute and experienced child at once recognised as whisky mr hamlin to her surprise however did not himself partake a fact which she at once pointed out to him  at an early age olly said mr hamlin with infinite gravity i promised an infirm and aged relative never to indulge in spirituous liquors except on a physicians prescription i carry this flask subject to the doctors orders never having ordered me to drink any i dont  as it was too dark for the child to observe mr hamlins eyes which after the fashion of her sex she consulted much oftener than his speech for his real meaning and was as often deceived she said nothing and mr hamlin relapsed into silence at the end of five minutes he said  she was a woman ollyyou bet  olly with great tact and discernment instantly referring back to mr hamlins discourse of an hour before queried that girl in the southern country  yes said mr hamlin  tell me all about her said ollyall you know  that aint much mused hamlin with a slight sigh ah olly she could sing  with the piano said olly a little superciliously  with the organ said hamlin  olly whose sole idea of this instrument was of the itinerant barrel variety yawned slightly and with a very perceptible lack of interest said that she hoped she would see her some time when she came up that way and was going round  mr hamlin did not laugh but after a few minutes rapid driving began to explain to olly with great earnestness the character of a church organ  i used to play once olly in a church they did say that i used sometimes to fetch that congregation jest snatch em baldheaded olly but its a long time ago there was one hymn in particular that i used to run on considrableone o them masses o mozartone that i heard her sing olly it went something like this and jack proceeded to lift his voice in the praise of our lady of sorrows with a serene unconsciousness to his surroundings and utter absorption in his theme that would have become the most enthusiastic acolyte the springs creaked the wheels rattled the mare broke plunged and recovered herself the slight vehicle swayed from side to side ollys hat bruised and flattened itself against his shoulder and still mr hamlin sang when he had finished he looked down at olly she was asleep  jack was an artist and an enthusiast but not unreasonable nor unforgiving its the whisky he murmured to himself in an apologetic recitation to the air he had just been singing he changed the reins to his other hand with infinite caution and gentleness slowly passed his disengaged arm round the swaying little figure until he had drawn the chip hat and the golden tresses down upon his breast and shoulder in this attitude scarcely moving a muscle lest he should waken the sleeping child at midnight he came upon the twinkling lights of fiddletown here he procured a fresh horse dispensing with an ostler and harnessing the animal himself with such noiseless skill and quickness that olly propped up in the buggy with pillows and blankets borrowed from the fiddletown hostelry slept through it all nor wakened even after they were again upon the road and had begun the long ascent of the wingdam turnpike  it wanted but an hour of daybreak when he reached the summit and even then he only slackened his pace when his wheels sank to their hubs in the beaten dust of the stage road the darkness of that early hour was intensified by the gloom of the heavy pine woods through which the red road threaded its difficult and devious way it was very still hamlin could hardly hear the dead muffled plunge of his own horse in the dusty track before him and yet once or twice he stopped to listen his quick ear detected the sound of voices and the jingle of mexican spurs apparently approaching behind him mr hamlin knew that he had not passed any horseman and was for a moment puzzled but then he recalled the fact that a few hundred yards beyond the road was intersected by the cutoff to one horse gulch which after running parallel with the wingdam turnpike for half a mile crossed it in the forest the voices were on that road going the same way mr hamlin pushed on his horse to the crossing and hidden by the darkness and the trunks of the giant pines pulled up to let the strangers precede him in a few moments the voices were abreast of him and stationary the horsemen had apparently halted  here seems to be a road said a voice quite audibly  all right then returned another its the cutoff well save an hour sure  a third voice here struck in potentially keep the stage road if joe hall gets wind of whats up hell run his man down to sacramento for safe keeping if he does hell take this roadits the only onesabewe cant miss him  jack hamlin leaned forward breathlessly in his seat  but its an hour longer this way growled the second voice the boys will wait responded the previous speaker there was a laugh a jingling of spurs and the invisible procession moved slowly forward in the darkness  mr hamlin did not stir a muscle until the voices failed before him in the distance then he cast a quick glance at the child she still slept quietly undisturbed by the halt or those ominous voices which had brought so sudden a colour into her companions cheek and so baleful a light in his dark eyes yet for a moment mr hamlin hesitated to go forward to wingdam now would necessitate his following cautiously in the rear of the lynchers and so prevent his giving a timely alarm to strike across to one horse gulch by the cutoff would lose him the chance of meeting the sheriff and his prisoner had they been forewarned and were escaping in time but for the impediment of the unconscious little figure beside him he would have risked a dash through the party ahead of him but that was not to be thought of now he must follow them to wingdam leave the child and trust to luck to reach one horse gulch before them if they delayed a moment at wingdam it could be done a feeling of yearning tenderness and pity succeeded the slight impatience with which he had a moment before regarded his encumbering charge he held her in his arms scarcely daring to breathe lest he should waken herhoping that she might sleep until they reached wingdam and that leaving her with his faithful henchman pete he might get away before she was aroused to embarrassing inquiry mr hamlin had a mans dread of scenes with even so small a specimen of the sex and for once in his life he felt doubtful of his own readiness and feared lest in his excitement he might reveal the imminent danger of her brother perhaps he was never before so conscious of that danger perhaps he was never before so interested in the life of any one he began to see things with ollys eyesto look upon events with reference to her feelings rather than his own if she had sobbed and cried this sympathetic rascal really believed that he would have cried too such was the unconscious and sincere flattery of admiration he was relieved when with the first streaks of dawn his mare wearily clattered over the scattered river pebbles and tailings that paved the outskirts of wingdam he was still more relieved when the three voices of the night now faintly visible as three armed horsemen drew up before the verandah of the wingdam hotel dismounted and passed into the barroom and he was perfectly content when a moment later he lifted the still sleeping olly in his arms and bore her swiftly yet cautiously to his room to awaken the sleeping pete on the floor above and drag him halfdressed and bewildered into the presence of the unconscious child as she lay on jack hamlins own bed half buried in a heap of shawls and rugs was only the work of another moment  why mars jack bress de lordits a chile said pete recoiling in sacred awe and astonishment  hold your jaw said jack in a fierce whisper youll waken her listen to me you chattering idiot dont waken her if you want to keep the bones in your creaking old skeleton whole enough for the doctors to buy let her sleep as long as she can if she wakes up and asks after me tell her im gone for her brother do you hear give her anything she asks forexceptthe truth what are you doing you old fool  pete was carefully removing the mountain of shawls and blankets that jack had piled upon olly fore god mars jackyous smuddering dat chile was his only response nevertheless jack was satisfied with a certain vague tenderness in his manipulation and said curtly get me a horse  it aint to be did mars jack de stables is all gonecleaned deys a rush over to one horse gulch all day  there are three horses at the door said jack with wicked significance  for de love of god mars jack dont ye do dat ejaculated pete in unfeigned and tremulous alarm dey dont take dem kind o jokes yer worth a centdeyd be doin somefin awful to ye sahshuahs yer born  but jack with the child lying there peaceably in his own bed and the three voices growing husky in the barroom below regained all his old audacity i havent made up my mind continued jack coolly which of the three ill take but youll find out from the owner when i do tell him that mr jack hamlin left his compliments and a mare and buggy for him you can say that if he keeps the mare from breaking and gives her her head down hill she can do her mile inside of 245 hush not a word byebye he turned lifted the shawl from the fresh cheek of the sleeping olly kissed her and shaking his fist at pete vanished  for a few moments the negro listened breathlessly and then there came the sharp quick clatter of hoofs from the rocky road below and he sank dejectedly at the foot of the bed hes gonedone it lord save us but its a hangin matter yer and even as he spoke mr jack hamlin mounted on the fleet mustang that had been ridden by the potential voice with his audacious face against the red sunrise and his right shoulder squarely advanced was butting away the morning mists that rolled slowly along the river road to one horse gulch     chapter vi  mr dumphy is perplexed by a movement in real estate   mr dumphys confidence in himself was so greatly restored that several business enterprises of great pith and moment whose currents for the past few days had been turned awry and so lost the name of action were taken up by him with great vigour and corresponding joy to the humbler business associates who had asked him just to lend his name to that project and make a big thing of it he had just given his royal sanction and a cheque to an association for the encouragement of immigration by the distribution through the sister states of one million seductive pamphlets setting forth the various resources and advantages of california for the farmer and proving that one hundred and fifty dollars spent for a passage thither was equal to the price of a farm he had also assisted in sending the eloquent mr blowhard and the persuasive mr windygust to present these facts orally to the benighted dwellers of the east and had secured the services of two eminent californian statisticians to demonstrate the fact that more people were killed by lightning and frozen to death in the streets of new york in a single year than were ever killed by railroad accidents or human violence in california during the past three centuries he had that day conceived the truly magnificent plan of bringing the waters of lake tahoe to san francisco by ditches thereby enabling the citizens to keep the turf in their dooryards green through the summer he had started two banks a stage line and a watering place whose climate and springs were declared healthful by edict and were aggressively advertised and he had just projected a small suburban town that should bear his name he had returned from this place in high spirits with a company of friends in the morning after this interview with poinsett there was certainly no trace of the depression of that day in his manner  it was a foggy morning following a clear still nightan atmospheric condition not unusual at that season of the year to attract mr dumphys attention yet he was conscious on reaching his office of an undue oppressiveness in the air that indisposed him to exertion and caused him to remove his coat and cravat then he fell to work upon his mornings mail and speedily forgot the weather there was a letter from mrs sepulvida disclosing the fact that owing to the sudden and unaccountable drying up of the springs on the lower plains large numbers of her cattle had died of thirst and were still perishing this was of serious import to mr dumphy who had advanced money on this perishable stock and he instantly made a memorandum to check this sudden freak of nature which he at once attributed to feminine carelessness of management further on mrs sepulvida inquired particularly as to the condition of the conroy mine and displayed a disposition characteristic of her sex to realise at once on her investment her letter ended thus but i shall probably see you in san francisco pepe says that this morning the markings on the beach showed the rise of a tide or wave during the night higher than any ever known since one thousand eight hundred i do not feel safe so near the beach and shall rebuild in the spring mr dumphy smiled grimly to himself he had at one time envied poinsett but here was the woman he was engaged to marry careless improvident with a vast estate and on the eve of financial disaster through her carelessness and yet actually about to take a journey of two hundred miles because of some foolish womanish whim or superstition it would be a fine thing if this man to whom good fortune fell without any effort on his partthis easy elegant supercilious arthur poinsett who was even indifferent to that good fortune should find himself tricked and deceived should have to apply to him dumphy for advice and assistance and this too after his own advice and assistance regarding the claims of colonel starbottles client had been futile the revenge would be complete mr dumphy rubbed his hands in prospective satisfaction  when a few moments later colonel starbottles card was put into his hand mr dumphys satisfaction was complete this was the day that the gallant colonel was to call for an answer it was evident that arthur had not seen him nor had he made the discovery of starbottles unknown client the opportunity of vanquishing this man without the aid or even knowledge of poinsett was now before him by way of preparing himself for the encounter as well as punishing the colonel he purposely delayed the interview and for full five minutes kept his visitor cooling his heels in the outer office  he was seated at his desk ostentatiously preoccupied when colonel starbottle was at last admitted he did not raise his head when the door opened nor in fact until the colonel stepping lightly forward walked to dumphys side and deliberately unhooking his cane from its accustomed rest on his arm laid it pronouncedly on the desk before him the colonels face was empurpled the colonels chest was efflorescent and bursting the colonel had the general effect of being about to boil over the top button of his coat but his manner was jauntily and daintily precise  one momenta single moment sir he said with husky politeness before proceeding to businesserwe will devote a single moment to the necessary explanations oferera gentleman the kyard now lying before you sir was handed ten minutes ago to one of your subordinates i wish to inquire sir if it was then delivered to you  yes said mr dumphy impatiently  colonel starbottle leaned over mr dumphys desk and coolly rung his bell mr dumphys clerk instantly appeared at the door i wish said the colonel addressing himself to the astounded employé as he stood loftily over mr dumphys chairi haveerin fact sent for you to withdraw the offensive epithets i addressed to you and the threatsof erof erpersonal violence the offenceis not yoursbuterrests with your employer for whose apology i amernow waiting nevertheless i am ready sir to hold myself at your servicethat iserof courseafter my responsibilityerwith your mastererceases  mr dumphy who in the presence of colonel starbottle felt his former awkwardness return signed with a forced smile to his embarrassed clerk to withdraw and said hastily but with an assumption of easy familiarity sorry colonel sorry but i was very busy and am now no offence all a mistake you know business man and business hours and mr dumphy leaned back in his chair and emitted his rare cachinnatory bark  glad to hear it sir i accept your apology said the colonel recovering his good humour and his profanity together hang me if i didnt think it was another affair like that i had with old maje tolliver of georgia called on him in washington in 48 during session boy took up my kyard waited ten minutes no reply then sent friend poor jeff boomerang dead now killed in new orleans by ben pastorwith challenge hang me sir after the second shot maje sends for me lying thar with hole in both lungs gasping for breath its all a blunder star he says boy never brought kyard horsewhip the nigger for me star for i reckon i wont live to do it and died like a gentleman blank me  what have you got to propose said mr dumphy hastily seeing an opportunity to stop the flow of the colonels recollections  according to my memory at our last interview over the social glass in your own house i think something was said of a proposition coming from you that iser continued the colonel loftily i hold myself responsible for the mistake if any  it had been mr dumphys first intention to assume the roughly offensive to curtly inform colonel starbottle of the flight of his confederate and dare him to do his worst but for certain vague reasons he changed his plan of tactics he drew his chair closer to the colonel and clapping his hand familiarly on his shoulder began  youre a man of the world starbottle so am i sabe youre a gentlemanso am i he continued hastily but im a business man and youre not sabe lets understand each other no offence you know but in the way of business this woman claiming to be my wife dont existits all right you know i understand i dont blame you but youve been deceived and all that sort of thing ive got the proofs now as a man of the world and a gentleman and a business man when i say the games up youll understand me look at thatthere he thrust into starbottles hand the telegram of the preceding day there the mans hung by this timelynched the womans gone  colonel starbottle read the telegram without any perceptible dismay or astonishment  conroy conroydont know the man there was a mcconroy of st jo but i dont think its the same no sir this aint like him sir dont seem to be a duel unless hed posted the man to kill on sightmurders an ugly word to use to gentlemen dn me sir i dont know but he could hold the man responsible who sent that despatch its offensive sirvery  and you dont know mrs conroy continued mr dumphy fixing his eyes on colonel starbottles face  mrs conroy the wife of the superintendentone of the most beautiful women good ged sir i do and im devlish sorry for her but whats this got to do with our affair oh i see gedthe colonel suddenly chuckled drew out his handkerchief and waved it in the air with deprecatory gallantry gossip sir all gossip people will talk a fine woman blank me if she was inclined to show some attention to colonel starbottleged sir it was no more than other women have you comprehend dumphy ged sir so the storys got round ehhusbands jealouskilled wrong man folks think shes run off with colonel starbottle ha ha no sir he continued suddenly dropping into an attitude of dignified severity you can say that colonel starbottle branded the story as a lie sir that whatever might have been the foolish indiscretion of a susceptible sex colonel starbottle will defend the reputation of that lady sir with his lifewith his life  absurd and ridiculous as this sudden diversion of colonel starbottle from the point at issue had become dumphy could not doubt his sincerity nor the now selfevident fact that mrs conroy was not his visitors mysterious client mr dumphy felt that his suddenly built up theory was demolished and his hope with it he was still at the mercy of this conceited braggart and the invisible power behind himwhoever or whatever it might be mr dumphy was not inclined to superstition but he began to experience a strange awe of his unknown persecutor and resolved at any risk to discover who it was could it be really his wifehad not the supercilious poinsett been himself trickedor was he not now trying to trick him dumphy couldnt starbottle be bribed to expose at least the name of his client he would try it  i said just now you had been deceived in this woman who represents herself to be my wife i find i have been mistaken in the person who i believe imposed upon you and it is possible that i may be otherwise wrong my wife may be alive i am willing to admit it bring her here tomorrow and i will accept it as a fact  you forget that she refuses to see you again said colonel starbottle until she has established her claim by process of law  thats so thats all right old fellow we understand each other now suppose that we business menas a business maxim you knowalways prefer to deal with principals now suppose we even go so far as to do that and yet pay an agents commission perhapsyou understand meeven a bonus good thats business you understand that as a gentleman and a man of the world now i say bring me your principalfetch along that woman and ill make it all right with you stop i know what youre going to say youre bound by honour and all thati understand your position as a gentleman and respect it then let me know where i can find her understandyou shant be compromised as bringing about the interview in any way ill see that youre protected in your commissions from your client and for my partif a cheque for five thousand dollars will satisfy you of my desire to do the right thing in this matter its at your service  the colonel rose to his feet and applied himself apparently to the single and silent inflation of his chest for the space of a minute when the upper buttons of his coat seemed to be on the point of flying off with a report he suddenly extended his hand and grasped dumphys with fervour permit me he said in a voice husky with emotion to congratulate myself on dealing with a gentleman and a man of honour your sentiments sir i dont care if i do say it do you credit i am proud sir continued the colonel warmly to have made your acquaintance but i regret to say sir that i cannot give you the information you require i do not myself know the name or address of my client  the look of halfcontemptuous satisfaction which had irradiated dumphys face at the beginning of this speech changed to one of angry suspicion at its close thats a dd queer oversight of yours he ejaculated with an expression as nearly insulting as he dared to make it colonel starbottle did not apparently notice the manner of his speech but drawing his chair close beside dumphy he laid his hand upon his arm  your confidence as a man of honour and a gentleman he began demands equal confidence and frankness on my part and culp starbottle of virginia is not the man to withhold it when i state that i do not know the name and address of my client i believe sir there is no one now living who willererrequire orerdeem it necessary for me to repeat the assertion certainly not sir added the colonel lightly waving his hand the gentleman who has just honoured me with his confidence and invited minei thank you sir he continued as mr dumphy made a hasty motion of assent and will go on  it is not necessary for me to name the party who first put me in possession of the facts you will take my word as a gentlemanerthat it is some one unknown to you of unimportant position though of strict respectability and one who acted only as the agent of my real client when the case was handed over to me there was also put into my possession a sealed envelope containing the name of my client and principal witness my injunctions were not to open it until all negotiations had failed and it was necessary to institute legal proceedings that envelope i have here you perceive it is unopened  mr dumphy unconsciously reached out his hand with a gesture of polite deprecation colonel starbottle evaded it and placing the letter on the table before him continued it is unnecessary to say thaterthere being in my judgment no immediate necessity for the beginning of a suitthe injunctions still restrain me and i shall not open the letter if however i accidentally mislay it on this table and it is returned to me tomorrow sealed as before i believe sir as a gentleman and a man of honour i violate no pledge  i see said mr dumphy with a short laugh  excuse me if i venture to require another condition merely as a form among men of honour write as i dictate mr dumphy took up a pen colonel starbottle placed one hand on his honourable breast and began slowly and meditatively to pace the length of the room with the air of a second measuring the distance for his principal are you ready  go on said dumphy impatiently  i hereby pledge myselfererthat in the event of any disclosure by meerof confidential communications from colonel starbottle to me i shall hold myself ready to afford him the usual honourable satisfactionercommon among gentlemen at such times or places and with such weapons as he may choose without further formality of challenge and thatererfailing in that i do thereby proclaim myself without posting a liar poltroon and dastard  in the full preoccupation of his dignified composition and possibly from an inability to look down over the increased exaggeration of his swelling breast colonel starbottle did not observe the contemptuous smile which curled the lip of his amanuensis howbeit mr dumphy signed the document and handed it to him colonel starbottle put it in his pocket nevertheless he lingered by mr dumphys side  theerercheque said the colonel with a slight cough had better be to your order endorsed by youto spare any criticism hereafter  mr dumphy hesitated a moment he would have preferred as a matter of business to have first known the contents of the envelope but with a slight smile he dashed off the cheque and handed it to the colonel iferit would not be too much trouble said the colonel jauntily for the same reason just mentioned would you give thaterpiece of paper to one of your clerks to draw the money for me  mr dumphy impatiently with his eyes on the envelope rang his bell and handed the cheque to the clerk while colonel starbottle with an air of abstraction walked discreetly to the window  for the rest of colonel starbottles life he never ceased to deplore this last act of caution and regret that he had not put the cheque in his pocket for as he walked to the window the floor suddenly appeared to rise beneath his feet and as suddenly sank again and he was thrown violently against the mantelpiece he felt sick and giddy with a terrible apprehension of apoplexy in his whirling brain he turned toward his companion who had risen from his seat and was supporting himself by his swinging desk with a panicstricken face and a pallor equal to his own in another moment a bookcase toppled with a crash to the floor a loud outcry arose from the outer offices and amidst the sounds of rushing feet the breaking of glass and the creaking of timber the two men dashed with a common instinct to the door it opened two inches and remained fixed with the howl of a caged wild beast dumphy threw himself against the rattling glass of the window that opened on the level of the street in another instant colonel starbottle was beside him on the sidewalk and the next they were separated unconsciously uncaringly as if they had been the merest strangers in contact in a crowd the business that had brought them together the unfinished incomplete absorbing interests of a moment ago were forgottenwere buried in the oblivion of another existence which had no sympathy with this whose only instinct was to flywhere they knew not  the middle of the broad street was filled with a crowd of breathless pallid deathstricken men who had lost all sense but the common instinct of animals there were hysterical men who laughed loudly without a cause and talked incessantly of what they knew not there were dumb paralysed men who stood helplessly and hopelessly beneath cornices and chimneys that toppled over and crushed them there were automatic men who flying carried with them the work on which they were engagedone whose hands were full of bills and papers another who held his ledger under his arm there were men who had forgotten the ordinary instincts of decencysome halfdressed there were men who rushed from the fear of death into its presence two were picked up one who had jumped through a skylight another who had blindly leaped from a fourthstory window there were brave men who trembled like children there was one whose life had been spent in scenes of daring and danger who cowered paralysed in the corner of the room from which a few inches of plastering had fallen there were hopeful men who believed that the danger was over and having passed would by some mysterious law never recur there were others who shook their heads and said that the next shock would be fatal there were crowds around the dust that arose from fallen chimneys and cornices around runaway horses that had dashed as madly as their drivers against lampposts around telegraph and newspaper offices eager to know the extent of the disaster along the remoter avenues and crossstreets dwellings were deserted people sat upon their doorsteps or in chairs upon the sidewalks fearful of the houses they had built with their own hands and doubtful even of this blue arch above them that smiled so deceitfully of those farreaching fields beyond which they had cut into lots and bartered and sold and which now seemed to suddenly rise against them or slip and wither away from their very feet it seemed so outrageous that this dull patient earth whose homeliness they had adorned and improved and which whatever their other fortune or vicissitudes at least had been their sure inheritance should have become so faithless small wonder that the owner of a little house which had sunk on the reclaimed water front stooped in the speechless and solemn absurdity of his wrath to shake his clenched fist in the face of the great mother  the real damage to life and property had been so slight and in such pronounced contrast to the prevailing terror that half an hour later only a sense of the ludicrous remained with the greater masses of the people mr dumphy like all practical unimaginative men was among the first to recover his presence of mind with the passing of the immediate danger people took confidence when this great man who had so much to lose after sharply remanding his clerks and everybody else back to business reentered his office he strode at once to his desk but the envelope was gone he looked hurriedly among his paperson the floorby the broken windowbut in vain  mr dumphy instantly rang his bell the clerk appeared  was that draft paid  no sir we were counting the money when  stop itreturn the draft to me  the young man was confiding to his confrères his suspicions of a probable run on the bank as indicated by mr dumphys caution when he was again summoned by mr dumphy  go to mr poinsetts office and ask him to come here at once  in a few moments the clerk returned out of breath  mr poinsett left a quarter of an hour ago sir for san antonio  san antonio  yes sirthey say theres bad news from the mission     chapter vii  in which both justice and the heavens fall   the day following the discovery of the murder of victor ramirez was one of the intensest excitement in one horse gulch it was not that killing was rare in that pastoral communityfoul murder had been done there upon the bodies of various citizens of more or less respectability and the victim in the present instance was a stranger and a man who awakened no personal sympathy but the suspicion that swiftly and instantly attached to two such important people as mr and mrs conroy already objects of severe criticism was sufficient to exalt this particular crime above all others in thrilling interest for two days business was practically suspended  the discovery of the murder was made by sal who stumbled upon the body of the unfortunate victor early the next morning during a walk on conroys hill manifestly in search of the missing man who had not returned to the hotel that night a few flippant souls misunderstanding miss clarks interest in the stranger asserted that he had committed suicide to escape her attentions but all jocular hypothesis ceased when it became known that gabriel and his wife had fled then came the report that gabriel had been seen by a passing miner early in the day shoving the stranger along the trail with his hand on his collar and exchanging severe words then the willing testimony of miss clark that she had seen mrs conroy in secret converse with victor before the murder then the unwilling evidence of the chinaman who had overtaken gabriel with the letter but who heard the sounds of quarrelling and cries for help in the bushes after his departure but this evidence was excluded from the inquest by virtue of the famous californian law that a pagan was of necessity a liar and that truth only resided in the breast of the christian caucasian and was excluded from the general public for its incompatibility with gabriels subsequent flight and the fact that the chinaman being a fool was probably mistaken in the hour then there was the testimony of the tunnelmen to gabriels appearance on the hill that night there was only one important proof not submitted to the public or the authoritiesmrs conroys notepicked up by sal handed to mrs markle and given by her to lawyer maxwell the knowledge of this document was restricted to the few already known to the reader  a dozen or more theories of the motive of the deed at different hours of the day occupied and disturbed the public mind that gabriel had come upon a lover of his wife in the act of eloping with her and had slain him out of hand was the first that gabriel had decoyed the man to an interview by simulating his wifes handwriting and then worked his revenge on his body was accepted later as showing the necessary deliberation to constitute murder that gabriel and his wife had conjointly taken this method to rid themselves of a former lover who threatened exposure was a still later theory towards evening when one horse gulch had really leisure to put its heads together it was generally understood that gabriel and mrs conroy had put out of their way a dangerous and necessarily rightful claimant to that mine which gabriel had pretended to discover this opinion was for some timesay two hoursthe favourite one agreeing as it did with the popular opinion of gabriels inability to discover a mine himself and was only modified by another theory that victor was not the real claimant but a dangerous witness that the conroys had found it necessary to dispose of and when possibly from some unguarded expression of lawyer maxwell it was reported that gabriel conroy was an impostor under an assumed name all further speculation was deemed unnecessary the coroners jury brought in a verdict against john doe alias gabriel conroy and one horse gulch added this injury of false pretence to other grievances complained of one or two cases of horsestealing and sluicerobbing in the neighbourhood were indefinitely but strongly connected with this discovery if i am thus particular in citing these evidences of the various gradations of belief in the guilt of the accused it is because they were peculiar to one horse gulch and of course never obtained in more civilised communities  it is scarcely necessary to say that one person in one horse gulch never wavered in her opinion of gabriels innocence nor that that person was mrs markle that he was the victim of a vile conspiracythat mrs conroy was the real culprit and had diabolically contrived to fasten the guilt upon her husband mrs markle not only believed herself but absolutely contrived to make lawyer maxwell and sal believe also more than that it had undoubtedly great power in restraining sals evidence before the inquest which that impulsive and sympathetic young woman persisted in delivering behind a black veil and in a suit of the deepest mourning that could be hastily improvised in one horse gulch  miss clarks evidence said the silveropolis messenger although broken by sobs and occasional expressions of indignation against the murderer strongly impressed the jury as the natural eloquence of one connected with the tenderest ties to the unfortunate victim it is said that she was an old acquaintance of ramirez who was visiting her in the hope of inducing her to consent to a happy termination of a lifelong courtship when the dastard hand of the murderer changed the bridal wreath to the veil of mourning from expressions that dropped from the witnesss lips although restrained by natural modesty it would not be strange if jealousy were shown to be one of the impelling causes it is said that previous to his marriage the alleged gabriel conroy was a frequent visitor at the house of miss clark  i venture to quote this extract not so much for its suggestion of a still later theory in the last sentence as for its poetical elegance and as an offset to the ruder record of the one horse gulch banner which i grieve to say was as follows       sal was no slouch of a witness rigged out in ten yards of      briggs best black glazed muslin and with a lot of black      mosquito netting round her head she pranced round the stand      like a skittish hearse horse in flytime if sal calculates to      go into mourning for every man she has to sling hash to wed      recommend her to buy up briggs stock and take one of pat      hoolans carriages for the season there is a strong feeling      among men whose heads are level that this minstrel variety      performance is a bluff of the messenger to keep from the      public the real motives of the murderer which it is pretty      generally believed concerns some folks a little highertoned      than sal we mention no names but we would like to know what      the editor of the messenger was doing in the countingroom      of one of pete dumphys emissaries at ten oclock last evening      looking up his bank account eh whats the size of the figures      today you hear us  at one oclock that morning the editor of the messenger fired at the editor of the banner and missed him at halfpast one two men were wounded by pistol shots in a difficulty at briggs warehousecause not stated at nine oclock half a dozen men lounged down the main street and ascended the upper loft of briggs warehouse in ten or fifteen minutes a dozen more from different saloons in the town lounged as indifferently in the direction of briggs until at halfpast nine the assemblage in the loft numbered fifty men during this interval a smaller party had gathered apparently as accidentally and indefinitely as to purpose on the steps of the little twostory brick court house in which the prisoner was confined at ten oclock a horse was furiously ridden into town and dropped exhausted at the outskirts a few moments later a man hurriedly crossed the plaza toward the court house it was mr jack hamlin but the three voices had preceded him and from the steps of the court house were already uttering the popular mandate  it was addressed to a single man a man who deserted by his posse and abandoned by his friends had for the last twelve hours sat beside his charge tireless watchful defiant and resolutejoe hall the sheriff of calaveras he had been waiting for this summons behind barricaded doors with pistols in his belt and no hope in his heart a man of limited ideas and restricted resources constant only to one intentthat of dying behind those bars in defence of that legal trust which his office and an extra fifty votes at the election only two months before had put into his hands it had perplexed him for a moment that he heard the voices of some of these voters below him clamouring against him but above their feebler pipe always rose another mandatory sentence we command you to take and safely keep the body of gabriel conroy and being a simple man the recollection of the quaint phraseology strengthened him and cleared his mind ah me i fear he had none of the external marks of a hero as i remember him he was small indistinctive and fidgety without the repose of strength a man who at that extreme moment chewed tobacco and spat vigorously on the floor who tweaked the ends of his scanty beard paced the floor and tried the locks of his pistols presently he stopped before gabriel and said almost fiercely  you hear thatthey are coming  gabriel nodded two hours before when the contemplated attack of the vigilance committee had been revealed to him he had written a few lines to lawyer maxwell which he entrusted to the sheriff he had then relapsed into his usual tranquillityserious simple and when he had occasion to speak diffident and apologetic  are you going to help me continued hall  in course said gabriel in quiet surprise ef you say so but dont ye do nowt ez would be gettin yourself into troubil along o me i aint worth it maybe it ud be jest as square ef ye handed me over to them chaps out yerallowin i was a heep o troubil to youand reckonin youd about hed your sheer o the keer o me and kinder passin me round but ef you do feel obligated to take keer o me ez hevin promised the jedges and jury it is almost impossible to convey the gentle deprecatoriness of gabriels voice and accent at this juncture why he added im with ye im thar you understand me  he rose slowly and with quiet but powerfully significant deliberation placed the chair he had been sitting on back against the wall the tone and act satisfied the sheriff the seventyfour gunship gabriel conroy was clearing the decks for action  there was an ominous lull in the outcries below and then the solitary lifting up of a single voice the potential voice of the night before the sheriff walked to a window in the hall and opened it the besieger and besieged measured each other with a look then came the homeric chaff  git out o that joe hall and run home to your mother shes getting oneasy about ye  the hll you say responded hall promptly and the old woman in such a hurry she had to borry al barkers hat and breeches to come here run home old gal and dont parse yourself off for a man agin  this aint no bluff joe hall why dont ye call yers fifty men the returns are agin ye and two precincts yet to hear from this was a double thrust at halls former career as a gambler and the closeness of his late election vote  all right send em up by expressmark em c o d the previous speaker was the expressman  blank you git  blank you come on  here there was a rush at the door the accidental discharge of a pistol and the window was slammed down words ceased deeds began  a few hours before hall had removed his prisoner from the uncertain tenure and accessible position of the cells below to the open courtroom of the second floor inaccessible by windows and lit by a skylight in the roof above the reach of the crowd whose massive doors were barricaded by benches and desks a smaller door at the side easily secured was left open for reconnoitring the approach to the courtroom was by a narrow stairway halfway down whose length gabriel had thrust the long courtroom table as a barricade to the besiegers the lower outer door secured by the sheriff after the desertion of his underlings soon began to show signs of weakening under the vigorous battery from without from the landing the two men watched it eagerly as it slowly yielded the sheriff drew back toward the side door and beckoned gabriel to follow but with a hasty sign gabriel suddenly sprang forward and dropped beneath the table as the door with a crash fell inward beaten from its hinges there was a rush of trampling feet to the stairway a cry of baffled rage over the impeding table a sudden scramble up and upon it and then as if on its own volition the long table suddenly reared itself on end and staggering a moment toppled backward with its clinging human burden on the heads of the thronging mass below there was a cry a sudden stampede of the philistines to the street and samson rising to his feet slowly walked to the side door and reentered the courtroom but at the same instant an agile besieger who unnoticed had crossed the rubicon darted from his concealment and dashed by gabriel into the room there was a shout from the sheriff the door was closed hastily a shot and the intruder fell but the next moment he staggered to his knees with outstretched hands hold up im yer to help ye  it was jack hamlin haggard dusty grimy his gay feathers bedraggled his tall hat battered his spotless shirt torn open at the throat his eyes and cheeks burning with fever the blood dripping from the bullet wound in his leg but still jack hamlin strong and audacious by a common instinct both men dropped their weapons ran and lifted him in their arms  thereshove that chair under me thatll do said hamlin coolly were even now joe hall that shot wiped out old scores even if it has crippled me and lost ye my valuable aid dry up and listen to me and then leave me here theres but one way of escape its up there he pointed to the skylight the rear wall hangs over the wingdam ditch and gully once on the roof you can drop over with this rope which you must unwind from my body for im dd if i can do it myself can you reach the skylight  theres a stepladder from the gallery said the sheriff joyously but wont they see us and be prepared  before they can reach the gully by going round youll be half a mile away in the woods but what in blank are you waiting for go you can hold on here for ten minutes more if they attack the same point but if they think of the skylight and fetch ladders youre gone in go  there was another rush on the staircase without the surging of an immense wave against the heavy folding doors the blows of pick and crowbar the gradual yielding of the barricade a few inches and the splintering of benches by a few pistol shots fired through the springing crevices of the doors and yet the sheriff hesitated suddenly gabriel stooped down lifted the wounded man to his shoulder as if he had been an infant and beckoning to the sheriff started for the gallery but he had not taken two steps before he staggered and lapsed heavily against hall who in his turn stopped and clutched the railing at the same moment the thunder of the besiegers seemed to increase not only the door but the windows rattled the heavy chandelier fell with a crash carrying a part of the plaster and the elaborate cornice with it a shower of bricks fell through the skylight and a cry quite distinct from anything heard before rose from without there was a pause in the hall and then the sudden rush of feet down the staircase and all was still again the three men gazed in each others whitened faces  an earthquake said the sheriff  so much the better said jack it gives us timeforward  they reached the gallery and the little stepladder that led to a door that opened upon the roof gabriel preceding with his burden there was another rush up the staircase without the court room but this time there was no yielding in the door the earthquake that had shaken the foundations and settled the walls had sealed it firmly  gabriel was first to step out on the roof carrying jack hamlin but as he did so another thrill ran through the building and he dropped on his knees to save himself from falling while the door closed smartly behind him in another moment the shock had passed and gabriel putting down his burden turned to open the door for the sheriff but to his alarm it did not yield to his pressure the earthquake had sealed it as it had the door below and joe hall was left a prisoner  it was gabriels turn to hesitate and look at his companion but jack was gazing into the street below then he looked up and said we must go on now gabrielforfor theyve got a ladder  gabriel rose again to his feet and lifted the wounded man the curve of the domed roof was slight in the centre on a rough cupola or base the figure of justice fifteen feet high rudely carved in wood towered above them with drawn sword and dangling scales gabriel reached the cupola and crouched behind it as a shout rose from the street below that told he was discovered a few shots were fired one bullet imbedded itself in the naked blade of the goddess and another with cruel irony shattered the equanimity of her balance unwind the cord from me said hamlin gabriel did so fasten one end to the chimney or the statue but the chimney was levelled by the earthquake and even the statue was trembling on its pedestal gabriel secured the rope to an iron girder of the skylight and crawling on the roof dropped it cautiously over the gable but it was several feet too shorttoo far for a cripple to drop gabriel crawled back to hamlin you must go first he said quietly i will hold the rope over the gable you can trust me  without waiting for hamlins reply he fastened the rope under his arms and halflifted halfdragged him to the gable then pressing his hand silently he laid himself down and lowered the wounded man safely to the ground he had recovered the rope again and crawling to the cupola was about to fasten the line to the iron girder when something slowly rose above the level of the roof beyond him the uprights of a ladder  the three voices had got tired of waiting a reply to their oftreiterated question and had mounted the ladder by way of forcing an answer at the muzzles of their revolvers they reached the level of the roof one after another and again propounded their inquiry and then as it seemed to their awestricken fancy the only figure therethe statue of justiceawoke to their appeal awoke leaned towards them advanced its awful sword and shook its broken balance and then toppling forward with one mighty impulse came down upon them swept them from the ladder and silenced the voices for ever and from behind its pedestal gabriel arose panting pale but triumphant     chapter viii  in tenebris servare fidem   although a large man gabriel was lithe and active and dropped the intervening distance where the rope was scant lightly and without injury happily the falling of the statue was looked upon as the result of another earthquake shock and its disastrous effect upon the storming party for awhile checked the attack gabriel lifted his halffainting ally in his arms and gaining the friendly shelter of the ditch in ten minutes was beyond the confines of one horse gulch and in the shadow of the pines of conroys hill there were several tunnel openings only known to him luckily the first was partly screened by a fall of rock loosened by the earthquake from the hill above and satisfied that it would be unrecognised by any eye less keen than his own gabriel turned into it with his fainting burden and it was high time for the hæmorrhage from jack hamlins wound was so great that that gentleman after a faint attempt to wave his battered hat above his dishevelled curls suddenly succumbed and lay as cold and senseless and beautiful as a carven apollo  then gabriel stripped him and found an ugly hole in his thigh that had narrowly escaped traversing the femoral artery and set himself about that rude surgery which he had acquired by experience and that more delicate nursing which was instinctive with him he was shocked at the revelation of a degree of emaciation in the figure of this young fellow that he had not before suspected gabriel had nursed many sick men and here was one who clearly ought to be under the doctors hands economising his vitality as a sedentary invalid who had shown himself to him hitherto only as a man of superabundant activity and animal spirits whence came the power that had animated this fragile shell gabriel was perplexed he looked down upon his own huge frame with a new and sudden sense of apology and depreciation as if it were an offence to this spare and bloodless adonis  and then with an infinite gentleness as of a young mother over her newborn babe he stanched the blood and bound up the wounds of his new friend so skilfully that he never winced and with a peculiar purring accompaniment that lulled him to repose once only as he held him in his arms did he change his expression and that was when a shadow and a treadperhaps of a passing hare or squirrelcrossed the mouth of his cave when he suddenly caught the body to his breast with the fierceness of a lioness interrupted with her cubs in his own rough experience he was much awed by the purple and fine linen of this fine gentlemans underclothingnot knowing the prevailing habits of his classand when he had occasion to open his bosom to listen to the faint beatings of his heart he put aside with great delicacy and instinctive honour a fine gold chain from which depended some few relics and keepsakes which this scamp wore but one was a photograph set in an open locket that he could not fail to see and that at once held him breathless above it it was the exact outline and features of his sister grace but with a strange shadow over that complexion which he remembered well as beautiful that struck him with superstitious awe he scanned it again eagerly maybe it was a dark day when she sot he murmured softly to himself maybe its the light in this yer tunnel maybe the heat o this poor chaps buzzum hez kinder turned it it aint measles fur she hed em along o olly he paused and looked at the unconscious man before him as if trying to connect him with the past no he said simply with a resigned sigh its agin reason she never knowed him its only my foolishness and my thinkin and thinkin o her so much its another gal and none o your business gabe and you a prying inter another mans secrets and takin advantage of him when hes down he hurriedly replaced it in his companions bosom and closed the collar of his shirt as jacks lips moved pete he called feebly  its his pardner maybe hes callin on said gabriel to himself then aloud with the usual comforting professional assent in course pete surely hes coming right offhell be yer afore you know it  pete continued jack forcibly take the mare off my leg shes breaking it dont you see shes stumbled dn it quick ill be late theyll string him up before i get there  in a moment gabriels stout heart sank if fever should set inif he should become delirious they would be lost providentially however jacks aberration was only for a moment he presently opened his black eyes and stared at gabriel gabriel smiled assuringly am i dead and buried said jack gravely looking around the dark vault or have i got em again  ye wuz took bad fur a minitthats all said gabriel reassuringly much relieved himself yer all right now  hamlin tried to rise but could not thats a lie he said cheerfully whats to be done  ef youd let me hev my say without gettin riled said gabriel apologetically id tell ye look yer he continued persuasively ye ought to hev a doctor afore thet wound gets inflamed and ye aint goin to get one bein packed round by me now dont ye flare up but harkin allowin i goes out to them chaps ez is huntin us and sez look yer you kin take me provided ye dont bear no malice agin my friend and you sends a doctor to fetch him outer the tunnel dont yer see they cant prove anythin agin ye anyway continued gabriel with a look of the intensest cunning ill swear i took you prisner and joe wont go back on his shot  in spite of his pain and danger this proposition afforded jack hamlin apparently the largest enjoyment thank ye he said with a smile but as theres a warrant by this time out against me for horsestealing i reckon i wont put myself in the way of their nursing they might forgive you for killing a mexican of no great market value but they aint goin to extend the right hand of fellowship to me after running off with their ringleaders mustang particularly when that animals foundered and kneesprung no sir  gabriel stared at his companion without speaking  i was late coming back with olly to wingdam i had to swap the horse and buggy for the mare without having time to arrange particulars with the owner i dont wonder youre shocked continued jack mischievously affecting to misunderstand gabriels silence but thets me thets the kind of company youve got into procrastination and want of punctuality has brought me to this never procrastinate gabriel always make it a point to make it a rule never to be late at the sabbath school  ef i hed owt to give ye said gabriel ruefully a drop o whisky or suthin to keep up your strenth  i never touch intoxicating liquors without the consent of my physician said jack gravely theyre too exciting i must be kept free from all excitement something soothing or sedentary like this he added striking his leg but even through his mischievous smile his face paled and a spasm of pain crossed it  i reckon well hev to stick yer ontil dark said gabriel and then strike acrost the gully to the woods on conroys hill yell be easier thar and were safe ontil sunup when we kin hunt another tunnel thar aint no choice added gabriel apologetically  jack made a grimace and cast a glance around the walls of the tunnel the luxurious scamp missed his usual comfortable surroundings well he assented with a sigh i suppose the games made anyway and weve got to stick here like snails on a rock for an hour yet well he continued impatiently as gabriel after improvising a rude couch for him with some withered pine tassels gathered at the mouth of the tunnel sat down beside him are you goin to bore me to death now that youve got me heresittin there like an owl why dont you say something  say what asked gabriel simply  anything lie if you want to only talk  id like to put a question to ye mr hamlin said gabriel with great gentlenessallowin in course yell answer or no jest ez as is agreeble to yereckonin its no business o mine nor pryin into secrets ony jess to pass away the time ontil sundown when you was tuk bad a spell ago unloosin yer shirt thar i got to see a pictur that ye hev around yer neck i aint askin who nor which it isbut ony thisez thetthetthet young woman dark complected ez that picter allows her to be  jacks face had recovered its colour by the time that gabriel had finished and he answered promptly a dd sight more so why that pictures fair alongside of her  gabriel looked a little disappointed hamlin was instantly up in arms yes sirand when i say that he returned i mean by thunder that the whitest faced woman in the world dont begin to be as handsome thar aint an angel that she couldnt give points to and beat thats her style it dont continued mr hamlin taking the picture from his breast and wiping its face with his handkerchiefit dont begin to do her justice what he asked suddenly and aggressively have you got to say about it anyway  i reckoned it kinder favoured my sister grace said gabriel submissively ye didnt know her mr hamlin she was lost sence 49thets all  mr hamlin measured gabriel with a contempt that was delicious in its sublime audacity and unconsciousness your sister he repeated thats a healthy lookin sister of such a man as youaint it why look at it roared jack thrusting the picture under gabriels nose why itsits a lady  ye musnt jedge gracey by me nor even olly interposed gabriel gently evading mr hamlins contempt  but jack was not to be appeased does your sister sing like an angel and talk spanish like governor alvarado is she connected with one of the oldest spanish families in the state does she run a rancho and thirty square leagues of land and is dolores salvatierra her nickname is her complexion like the young bark of the madroñothe most beautiful thing ever seendid every other woman look chalky beside her eh  no said gabriel with a sighit was just my foolishness mr hamlin but seein that picter kinder  i stole it interrupted jack with the same frankness i saw it in her parlour on the table and i froze to it when no one was looking lord she wouldnt have given it to me i reckon those relatives of hers would have made it very lively for me if theyd suspected it hoss stealing aint a circumstance to this gabriel said jack with a reckless laugh then with equal frankness and a picturesque freedom of description he related his first and only interview with donna dolores i am glad to say that this scamp exaggerated if anything the hopelessness of his case dwelt but slightly on his own services and concealed the fact that donna dolores had even thanked him you can reckon from this the extent of my affection for that johnny ramirez and why i just froze to you when i heard youd dropped him but come now its your deal tell us all about it the boys put it up that he was hangin round your wifeand you went for him for all he was worth go onim waitingand added jack as a spasm of pain passed across his face and aching to that degree that ill yell if you dont take my mind off it  but gabriels face was grave and his lips silent as he bent over mr hamlin to adjust the bandages go on said jack darkly or ill tear off these rags and bleed to death before your eyes what are you afraid of i know all about your wifeyou cant tell me anything about her didnt i spot her in sacramentobefore she married youwhen she had this same chilino ramirez on a string why shes fooled him as she has you you aint such a blasted fool as to be stuck after her still are you and jack raised himself on his elbow the more intently to regard this possible transcendent idiot  you was speakin o this mexican ramirez said gabriel after a pause fixing his now clear and untroubled eyes on his interlocutor  of course roared out jack impatiently did you think i was talking of here mr hamlin offered a name that suggested the most complete and perfect antithesis known to modern reason  i didnt kill him said gabriel quietly  of course not said jack promptly he sorter stumbled and fell over on your bowieknife as you were pickin your teeth with it but go onhow did you do it where did you spot him did he make any fight has he got any sand in him  i tell ye i didnt kill him  who did then screamed jack furious with pain and impatience  i dont knowi reckonthat is and gabriel stopped short with a wistful perplexed look at his companion  perhaps mr gabriel conroy said jack with sudden coolness and deliberation of speech and a baleful light in his dark eyes perhaps youll be good enough to tell me what this meanswhat is your little game perhaps youll kindly inform me what im lying here crippled for what you were doing up in the court house when you were driving those people crazy with excitement what youre hiding here in this blank family vault for and maybe if youve got time youll tell me what was the reason i made that pleasant little trip to sacramento i know i required the exercise and then there was the honour of being introduced to your little sisterbut perhaps youll tell me what it was for  jack said gabriel leaning forward with a sudden return of his old trouble and perplexity i thought she did it and thinkin thatwhen they asked mei took it upon myself i didnt know to ring you into this jack i thoughti thoughtthetit ud all be onethet theyd hang me up afore thisi did jack honest  and you didnt kill ramirez  no  and you reckoned your wife did  yes  and you took the thing on yourself  i did  you did  i did  you did  i did  mr hamlin rolled over on his back and began to whistle when the spring time comes gentle annie as the only way of expressing his inordinate contempt for the whole proceeding  gabriel slowly slid his hand under mr hamlins helpless back and under pretext of arranging his bandages lifted him in his arms like a truculent babe jack he said softly ef thet picter of yoursthat coloured woman  which said jack fiercely  i meanthet purty creatureef she and you hed been married and youd found out accidental like that shed fooled yemore belike jack he added hastily o your own foolishnessthan her little gameand  that woman was a lady interrupted jack savagely and your wifes abut he paused looking into gabriels face and then added oh git will you leave me alone i want to be an angel and with the angels stand  and thet woman hez a secret continued gabriel unmindful of the interruption and bein hounded by the man az knows it up and kills him ye wouldnt let thet womanthat poor pooty creeturesuffer for it no jack ye would rather pint your own toes up to the sky than do it it aint in ye jack and it aint in me so help me god  this is all very touching mr conroy and does credit sir to your head and heart and i kin feel it drawing halls ball out of my leg while youre talkin said jack with his black eyes evading gabriels and wandering to the entrance of the tunnel what time is it you dd old fool aint it dark enough yet to git outer this hole he groaned and after a pause added fiercely how do you know your wife did it  gabriel swiftly and for him even concisely related the events of the day from his meeting with ramirez in the morning to the time that he had stumbled upon the body of victor ramirez on his return to keep the appointment at his wifes written request  jack only interrupted him once to inquire why after discovering the murder he had not gone on to keep his appointment  i thought it want of no use said gabriel simply i didnt want to let her see i knowed it  hamlin groaned if you had you would have found her in the company of the man who did do it you daddering old idiot  what man asked gabriel  the first man you saw your wife with that morning the man i ought to be helping now instead of lyin here  you dont mean to allow jack ez you reckon she didnt do it asked gabriel in alarm  i do said hamlin coolly  then what did she reckon to let on by that note said gabriel with a sudden look of cunning  dont know returned jack like as not being a dd fool you didnt read it right hand it over and let me see it  gabriel hesitatingly i cant  hamlin you cant  gabriel apologetically i tore it up  hamlin with frightful deliberation you did  i did  jack after a long crushing silence were you ever under medical treatment for these spells  gabriel with great simplicity and submission they allers used to allow i waz queer  hamlin after another pause has pete dumphy got anything agin you  gabriel surprisedly no  hamlin languidly it was his right hand man his agent at wingdam that started up the vigilantes i heard him and saw him in the crowd hounding em on  gabriel simply i reckon youre out thar jack dumphys my friend it was him that first gin me the money to open this yer mine and im his superintendent  jack oh after another pause is there any firstclass lunatic asylum in this county where they would take in two men one an incurable and the other sufferin from a gunshot wound brought on by playin with firearms  gabriel with a deep sigh ye musnt talk jack ye must be quiet till dark  jack dragged down by pain and exhausted in the intervals of each paroxysm was quiescent  gradually the faint light that had filtered through the brush and débris before the tunnel faded quite away and a damp charnelhouse chill struck through the limbs of the two refugees and made them shiver the flow of water from the dripping walls seemed to have increased gabriels experienced eye had already noted that the earthquake had apparently opened seams in the gully and closed up one of the leads he carefully laid his burden down again and crept to the opening the distant hum of voices and occupation had ceased the sun was setting in a few moments calculating on the brief twilight of the mountain region it would be dark and they might with safety leave their hidingplace as he was returning he noticed a slant beam of light hitherto unobserved crossing the tunnel from an old drift examining it more closely gabriel was amazed to find that during the earthquake a cave had taken place in the drift possibly precipitated by the shock disclosing the more surprising fact that there had been a previous slight but positive excavation on the hill side above the tunnel that antedated any record of one horse gulch known to gabriel he was perfectly familiar with every foot of the hill side and the existence of this ancient prospecting hole had never been even suspected by him while he was still gazing at the opening his foot struck against some glittering metallic substance he stooped and picked up a small tin can not larger than a sardine box hermetically sealed and soldered in which some inscription had been traced but which the darkness of the tunnel prevented his deciphering in the faint hope that it might contain something of benefit to his companion gabriel returned to the opening and even ventured to step beyond its shadow but all attempts to read the inscription were in vain he opened the box with a sharp stone it contained to his great disappointment only a memorandum book and some papers he swept them into the pocket of his blouse and reentered the tunnel he had not been absent altogether more than five minutes but when he reached the place where he had left jack he was gone     chapter ix  in which hector arises from the ditch   he stood for a moment breathless and paralysed with surprise then he began slowly and deliberately to examine the tunnel step by step when he had proceeded a hundred feet from the spot to his great relief he came upon jack hamlin sitting upright in a side drift his manner was feverish and excited and his declaration that he had not moved from the place where gabriel had left him at once was accepted by the latter as the aberration of incipient inflammation and fever when gabriel stated that it was time to go he replied yes and added with such significance that his business with the murderer of victor ramirez was now over and that he was ready to enter the lunatic asylum at once that gabriel with great precipitation lifted him in his arms and carried him without delay from the tunnel once more in the open air the energies of both men seemed to rally jack became as a mere feather in gabriels powerful arms and even forgot his querulous opposition to being treated as a helpless child while gabriel trod the familiar banks of the ditch climbed the long ascent and threaded the aisles of the pillared pines of reservoir hill with the free experienced feet of the mountaineer here gabriel knew he was safe until daybreak and gathered together some withered pine boughs and its fragrant tassels for a couch for his helpless companion and here as he feared fever set in the respiration of the wounded man grew quick and hurried he began to talk rapidly and incoherently of olly of ramirez of the beautiful girl whose picture hung upon his breast of gabriel himself and finally of a stranger who was as it seemed to him his sole auditor the gratuitous coinage of his excited fancy once or twice he raised his voice to a shout and then to gabriels great alarm suddenly he began to sing and before gabriel could place his hand upon his mouth he had trolled out the verse of a popular ballad the rushing river below them gurgled beat its bars and sang an accompaniment the swaying pine sighed and creaked in unison the patient stars above them stared and bent breathlessly and then to gabriels exalted consciousness an echo of the wounded mans song arose from the gulch below for a moment he held his breath with an awful mingling of joy and fear was he going mad too or was it really the voice of little olly the delirious man beside him answered his query with another verse the antiphonal response rose again from the valley gabriel hesitated no longer but with feverish hands gathered a few dried twigs and pine cones into a pile and touched a match to them at the next moment they flashed a beacon to the sky in another there was a crackling of the underbrush and the hurried onset of two figures and before the slow gabriel could recover from his astonishment olly flew panting to his arms while her companion the faithful pete sank breathlessly beside his wounded and insensible master  olly was first to find her speech that speech after the unfailing instincts of her sex in moments of excitement was the instant arraignment of somebody else as the cause of that excitement and at once put the whole universe on the defensive  why didnt you send word where you was she said impatiently and wot did you have it so dark for and up a steep hill and leavin me alone at wingdam and why didnt you call without singin  and then gabriel after the fashion of his sex ignored all but the present and holding olly in his arms said  its my little girl aint it come to her own brother gabe bless her  whereat mr hamlin after the fashion of lunatics of any sex must needs be consistent and break out again into song  hes looney olly what with fever along o bein shot in the leg a savin me ez iznt worth savin explained gabriel apologetically it was him ez did the singin  then olly still following the feminine instinct at once deserted conscious rectitude for indefensible error and flew to mr hamlins side  oh where is he hurt pete is he going to die  and pete suspicious of any medication but his own replied doubtfully he looks bad miss olly dats a facbut now bein in my hans bress de lord amighty and we able to minister to him we hopes fur de bess your brudder meant well is a fair meanin man missa tollable nuss but he aint got the peerfeshnl knowledge dat mars jack in de habit o gettin here pete unslung from his shoulders a wallet and proceeded to extract therefrom a small medicine case with the resigned air of the family physician who has been called full late to remedy the practice of rustic empiricism  how did ye come yer asked gabriel of olly when he had submissively transferred his wounded charge to pete what made ye allow i was hidin yer how did ye reckon to find me but ye was allus peart and onhanded olly he suggested gazing admiringly at his sister  when i woke up at wingdam after jack went away who should i find gabe but lawyer maxwell standin thar and askin me a heap o questions i supposed youd been makin a fool o yourself agin gabe and afore i let on thet i knowed a word i jist made him tell me everythin about you gabe and it was orful and you bein arrested fur murder ez wouldnt harm a fly let alone that mexican ez i never liked gabe and all this comes of tendin his legs instead o lookin arter me and all them questions waz about july and whether she wasnt your enemy and if they ever waz a woman gabe ez waz sweet on you you know it was july and all thet kind o foolishness and then when he couldnt get ennythin out o me agin july he allowed to pete that he must take me right to you fur he said ther was talk o the vigilantes gettin hold o ye afore the trial and he was goin to get an order to take you outer the county and he reckoned they wouldnt dare to tech ye if i waz with ye gabeand id like to see em try it and he allowed to pete that he must take me right to you and peteand thar aint a whiter nigger livin than that ole mansaid he wouldreckonin you know to find jack as he allowed to me theyd hev to kill afore they got youand he came down yer with me and when we got yeryou was offand the sheriff goneand the vigilanteswhat with bein killed the biggest o them by the earthquakewhat was orful gabe but we bein on the road didnt get to feeljest scared outer their butes and then a chinyman gins us your note  my note interrupted gabriel i didnt send ye any note  then his note said olly impatiently pointing to hamlin sayin youll find your friends on conroys hilldont you see gabe continued olly stamping her foot in fury at her brothers slowness of comprehension and so we came and heard jack singin and a mighty foolish thing it was to do and yer we are  but he didnt send any note olly persisted gabriel  well you awful old gabe what difference does it make who sent it continued the practical olly here we are along o thet note and she added feeling in her pocket theres the note  she handed gabriel a small slip of paper with the pencilled words youll find your friends waiting for you tonight on conroys hill  the handwriting was unfamiliar but even if it were jacks how did he manage to send it without his knowledge he had not lost sight of jack except during the few moments he had reconnoitred the mouth of the tunnel since they had escaped from the court house gabriel was perplexed in the presence of this anonymous note he was confused and speechless and could only pass his hand helplessly across his forehead but its all right now gabe continued olly reassuringly the vigilantes hev run awaywhat was left of them the sheriff aint to be found nowhar this yer earthquake hez frightened everybody outer the idea of huntin yenobody talks of ennything but the earthquake they even say gabei forgot to tell yethat our claim on conroy hill has busted too and the mine aint worth shucks now but theres no one to interfere with us now gabe and were goin to get into a waggin that pete hez bespoke for us at the head of reservoir gulch tomorrow mornin at sunup and then pete sez we kin git down to stockton and frisco and out to a place called san antonio that the devil himself wouldnt think o goin to and thar we kin stay me and you and jack until this whole thing has blown over and jack gits well agin and july comes back  gabriel still holding the hand of his sister dared not tell her of the suspicions of lawyer maxwell regarding her sisterinlaws complicity in this murder nor jacks conviction of her infidelity and he hesitated but after a pause he suggested with a consciousness of great discretion and artfulness suppose thet july doesnt come back  look yer gabe said olly suddenly ef yer goin to be thet foolish and ridiklus agin ill jess quit ez if thet woman would ever leave ye gabriel groaned inwardly why when she hears o this wild hosses couldnt keep her from ye dont be a mule gabe dont and gabriel was dumb  meantime under the influence of some anodyne which pete had found in his medicine chest mr hamlin became quiet and pretermitted his vocal obligato gabriel whose superb physical adjustment no mental excitement could possibly overthrow and whose regular habits were never broken by anxiety nodded even while holding ollys hand and in due time slept and i regret to saywriting of a herosnored after a while olly herself succumbed to the drowsy coolness of the night and wrapped in mr hamlins shawl pillowed her head upon her brothers broad breast and slept too only pete remained to keep the watch he being comparatively fresh and strong and declaring that the condition of mr hamlin required his constant attention  it was after midnight that olly dreamed a troubled dream she thought that she was riding with mr hamlin to seek her brother when she suddenly came upon a crowd of excited men who were bearing gabriel to the gallows she thought that she turned to mr hamlin frantically for assistance when she saw to her horror that his face had changedthat it was no longer he who sat beside her but a strange wildlooking haggard mana man whose face was old and pinched but whose grey hair was discoloured by a faded dye that had worn away leaving the original colour in patches and the antique foppery of whose dress was deranged by violent exertion and grimy with the dust of travela dandy whose strapped trousers of a bygone fashion were ridiculously loosened in one leg whose high stock was unbuckled and awry she awoke with a start even then her dream was so vivid that it seemed to her this face was actually bending over her with such a pathetic earnestness and inquiry that she called aloud it was some minutes before pete came to her but as he averred albeit somewhat incoherently and rubbing his eyes to show that he had not closed them that he had never slept a wink and that it was impossible for any stranger to have come upon them without his knowledge olly was obliged to accept it all as a dream but she did not sleep again she watched the moon slowly sink behind the serrated pines of conroys hill she listened to the crackling tread of strange animals in the underbrush to the faroff rattle of wheels on the wingdam turnpike until the dark outline of the tree trunks returned and with the cold fires of the mountain sunrise the chilly treetops awoke to winged life and the twitter of birds while the faint mists of the river lingered with the paling moon like tired sentinels for the relief of the coming day and then olly awoke her companions they struggled back into consciousness with characteristic expression gabriel slowly and apologetically as of one who had overslept himself jack hamlin violently and aggressively as if some unfair advantage had been taken of his human weakness that it was necessary to combat at once i am sorry to say that his recognition of pete was accompanied by a degree of profanity and irreverence that was dangerous to his own physical weakness and you had to trapse down yer sniffin about my tracks you black and tan idiot continued mr hamlin raising himself on his arm and after id left everything all straight at wingdamand jest as i was beginning to reform and lead a new life how do olly youll excuse my not rising come and kiss me if that nigger of mine has let you want for anything jest tell me and ill discharge him well hang it all what are you waitin for here its daybreak and weve got to get down to the head of reservoir gulch come little children the picnic is over  thus adjured gabriel rose and lifting mr hamlin in his arms with infinite care and tenderness headed the quaint procession mr hamlin perhaps recognising some absurdity in the situation forbore exercising his querulous profanity on the man who held him helpless as an infant and olly and pete followed slowly behind  their way led down reservoir cañon beautiful hopeful and bracing in the early morning air a few birds awakened by the passing tread started into song a moment and then were still with a cautious gentleness habitual to the man gabriel forbore as he strode along to step upon the few woodland blossoms yet left to the dry summer woods there was a strange fragrance in the air the light odours liberated from a thousand nameless herbs the faint melancholy spicing of dead leaves there was moreover that sense of novelty which nature always brings with the dawn in deep forests a fancy that during the night the earth had been created anew and was fresh from the makers hand as yet untried by burden or tribulation and guiltless of a past and so it seemed to the little caravanalbeit fleeing from danger and deaththat yesterday and its fears were far away or had in some unaccountable way shrunk behind them in the west with the swiftly dwindling night olly once or twice strayed from the trail to pick an opening flower or lingering berry pete hummed to himself the fragment of an old campmeeting song  and so they walked on keeping the rosy dawn and its promise before them from time to time the sound of faroff voices came to them faintly slowly the light quickened morning stole down the hills upon them stealthily and at last the entrance of the cañon became dimly outlined olly uttered a shout and pointed to a black object moving backward and forward before the opening it was the waggon and team awaiting them ollys shout was answered by a whistle from the driver and they quickened their pace joyfully in another moment they would be beyond the reach of danger  suddenly a voice that seemed to start from the ground before them called on gabriel to stop he did so unconsciously drawing hamlin closer to him with one hand and with the other making a broad protecting sweep toward olly and then a figure rose slowly from the ditch at the roadside and barred their passage  it was only a single man a small man bespattered with the slime of the ditch and torn with brambles a man exhausted with fatigue and tremulous with nervous excitement but still erect and threatening a man whom gabriel and hamlin instantly recognised even through his rags and exhaustion it was joe hallthe sheriff of calaveras he held a pistol in his right hand even while his left exhaustedly sought the support of a tree by a common instinct both men saw that while the hand was feeble the muzzle of the weapon covered them  gabriel conroy i want you said the apparition  hes got us lined drop me whispered hamlin hastily drop me ill spoil his aim  but gabriel by a swift dexterous movement that seemed incompatible with his usual deliberation instantly transferred hamlin to his other arm and with his burden completely shielded presented his own right shoulder squarely to the muzzle of halls revolver  gabriel conroy you are my prisoner repeated the voice  gabriel did not move but over his shoulder as a rest dropped the long shining barrel of jacks own favourite duelling pistol and over it glanced the bright eye of its crippled owner the issue was joined  there was a deathlike silence  go on said jack quietly keep cool joe for if you miss him youre gone in and hit or miss ive got you sure  the barrel of halls pistol wavered a moment from

his full heightwhich was not much i fearand steadied himself by the tree his weapon still advanced and pointing at gabriel but with such an evident and hopeless contrast between his determination and his evident inability to execute it that his attitude impressed his audience less with its heroism than its halfpathetic absurdity  mr hamlin laughed but even then he suddenly felt the grasp of gabriel relax found himself slipping to his companions feet and the next moment was deposited carefully but ignominiously on the ground by gabriel who strode quietly and composedly up to the muzzle of the sheriffs pistol  i am ready to go with ye mr hall he said gently putting the pistol aside with a certain large indifferent wave of the hand ready to go with yenowat onct but ive one little favour

track of a storm   a quarter of an hour before the messenger of peter dumphy had reached poinsetts office mr poinsett had received a more urgent message a telegraph despatched from san antonio had been put into his hands its few curt words more significant to an imaginative man than rhetorical expression ran as follows       mission church destroyed father felipe safe blessed trinity      in ruins and dolores missing my house spared come at      oncemaria sepulvida  the following afternoon at four oclock arthur poinsett reached san geronimo within fifteen miles of his destination here the despatch was confirmed with some slight local exaggeration  saints and devils there is no longer a st anthony the temblor has swallowed him said the innkeeper sententiously it is the end of all such is the world thou wilt find stones on stones instead of houses don arturo wherefore another glass of the brandy of france or the whisky of the american as thou dost prefer but of san antonionothingabsolutelyperfectlytruly nothing  in spite of this cheering prophecy mr poinsett did not wait for the slow diligence but mounting a fleet mustang dashed off in quest of the missing mission he was somewhat relieved at the end of an hour by the faroff flash of the sea the rising of the dark green fringe of the mission orchard and encinal and above it the white dome of one of the mission towers but at the next moment arthur checked his horse and rubbed his eyes in wonder where was the other tower he put spurs to his horse again and dashed off at another angle and again stopped and gazed there was but one tower remaining the mission church must have been destroyed  perhaps it was this discovery perhaps it was some instinct stronger than this but when arthur had satisfied himself of this fact he left the direct road which would have brought him to the mission and diverged upon the open plain towards the rancho of the blessed trinity a fierce wind from the sea swept the broad llano and seemed to oppose him step by stepa wind so persistent and gratuitous that it appeared to arthur to possess a moral quality and as such was to be resisted and overcome by his superior will here at least all was unchanged here was the dead flat monotony of land and sky here was the brittle harsh stubble of the summer fields sunbaked and winddried here were the long stretches of silence from which even the harrying wind made no opposition nor complaint here were the formless specks of slowlymoving cattle even as he remembered them before a momentary chill came over him as he recalled his own perilous experience on these plains a momentary glow suffused his cheek as he thought of his rescue by the lovely but cold recluse again he heard the name of philip softly whispered in his ears again he felt the flood of old memories sweep over him as he rode even as he had felt them when he lay that day panting upon the earth and yet arthur had long since convinced his mind that he was mistaken in supposing that donna dolores had addressed him at that extreme moment as philip he had long since believed it was a trick of his disordered and exhausted brain the conduct of dolores towards himself habitually restrained by grave courtesy never justified him in directly asking the question nor suggested any familiarity that might have made it probable she had never alluded to it againbut had apparently forgotten it not so arthur he had often gone over that memorable scene with a strange tormenting pleasure that was almost a pain it was the one incident of his life for whose poetry he was not immediately responsiblethe one genuine heartthrill whose sincerity he had not afterwards stopped to question in his critical fashion the one enjoyment that had not afterwards appeared mean and delusive and now the heroine of this episode was missing and he might never perhaps see her again and yet when he first heard the news he was conscious of a strange sense of reliefrather let me say of an awakening from a dream that though delicious had become dangerous and might unfit him for the practical duties of his life donna dolores had never affected him as a real personageat least the interest he felt in her was he had always considered due to her relations to some romantic condition of his mind and her final disappearance from the plane of his mental vision was only the exit of an actress from the mimic stage it seemed only natural that she should disappear as mysteriously as she came there was no shock even to the instincts of his ordinary humanityit was no catastrophe involving loss of life or even suffering to the subject or spectator  such at least was mr poinsetts analysis of his own mental condition on the receipt of donna marias telegram it was the cool selfexamination of a man who believed himself coldblooded and selfish superior to the weakness of ordinary humanity and yet was conscious of neither pride nor disgrace in the belief yet when he diverged from his direct road to the mission and turned his horses head toward the home of donna dolores he was conscious of a new impulse and anxiety that was stronger than his reason unable as he was to resist it he still took some satisfaction in believing that it was nearly akin to that feeling which years before had driven him back to starvation camp in quest of the survivors suddenly his horse recoiled with a bound that would have unseated a less skilful rider directly across his path stretched a chasm in the level plainthirty feet broad and as many feet in depth and at its bottom in undistinguishable confusion lay the wreck of the corral of the blessed trinity  except for the enormous size and depth of this fissure arthur might have mistaken it for the characteristic cracks in the sunburnt plain which the long dry summer had wrought upon its surface some of which were so broad as to task the agility of his horse but a second glance convinced him of the different character of the phenomenon the earth had not cracked asunder nor separated but had sunk the width of the chasm below was nearly equal to the width above the floor of this valley in miniature was carpeted by the same dry brittle herbs and grasses which grew upon the plain around him  in the preoccupation of the last hour he had forgotten the distance he had traversed he had evidently ridden faster than he had imagined but if this was really the corral the walls of the rancho should now be in sight at the base of the mountain he turned in that direction nothing was to be seen only the monotonous plain stretched before him vast and unbroken between the chasm where he stood and the falda of the first low foothills neither roof nor wall nor ruin rose above the dull dead level  an ominous chill ran through his veins and for an instant the reins slipped through his relaxed fingers good god could this have been what donna maria meant or had there been a later convulsion of nature he looked around him the vast farstretching plain desolate and trackless as the shining ocean beyond took upon itself an awful likeness to that element standing on the brink of the revealed treachery of that yawning chasm arthur poinsett read the fate of the rancho in the storm that had stirred the depths of this motionless level the rancho and its miserable inmates had foundered and gone down  arthurs first impulse was to push on towards the scene of the disaster in the vague hope of rendering some service but the chasm before him was impassable and seemed to continue to the sea beyond then he reflected that the catastrophe briefly told in donna marias despatch had happened twentyfour hours before and help was perhaps useless now he cursed the insane impulse that had brought him here aimlessly and without guidance and left him powerless even to reach the object of his quest if he had only gone first to the mission asked the advice and assistance of father felipe or learned at least the full details of the disaster he uttered an oath rare to his usual calm expression and wheeling his horse galloped fiercely back towards the mission  night had deepened over the plain with the going down of the sun a fog that had been stealthily encompassing the coastline stole with soft step across the shining beach dulled its lustre and then moved slowly and solemnly upon the plain blotting out the point of pines at first salient with its sparkling lighthouse but now undistinguishable from the grey sea above and below until it reached the galloping horse and its rider and then as it seemed to arthur isolated them from the rest of the worldfrom even the pencilled outlines of the distant foothills that it at last sponged from the bluegrey slate before him at times the faroff tolling of a fogbell came faintly to his ear but all sound seemed to be blotted out by the fog even the rapid fall of his horses hoofs was muffled and indistinct by degrees the impression that he was riding in a dream overcame him and was accepted by him without questioning or deliberation  it seemed to be a consistent part of the dream or vision when he rodeor rather as it seemed to him was borne by the foginto the outlying fields and lanes of the mission a few lights with a nimbus of fog around them made the narrow street of the town appear still more ghostly and unreal as he plunged through its obscurity towards the plaza and church even by the dim grey light he could see that one of the towers had fallen and that the eastern wing and refectory were a mass of shapeless ruin and what would at another time have excited his surprise now only struck him as a natural part of his dreamthe church a blaze of light and filled with thronging worshippers still possessed by his strange fancy arthur poinsett dismounted led his horse beneath the shed beside the remaining tower and entered the building the body and nave of the church were intact the outlandish paintings still hung from the walls the waxen effigies of the blessed virgin and the saints still leaned from their niches yellow and lank and at the high altar father felipe was officiating as he entered a dirge broke from the choir he saw that the altar and its offerings were draped in black and in the first words uttered by the priest arthur recognised the mass for the dead the feverish impatience that had filled his breast and heightened the colour of his cheeks for the last hour was gone he sunk upon a bench beside one of the worshippers and buried his face in his hands the voice of the organ rose again faintly the quaintvoiced choir awoke the fumes of incense filled the church and the monotonous accents of the priest fell soothingly upon his ear and arthur seemed to sleep i say seemed to sleep for ten minutes later he came to himself with a start as if awakening from a troubled dream with the voice of padre felipe in his ear and the soft caressing touch of padre felipe on his shoulder the worshippers had dispersed the church was dark save a few candles still burning on the high altar and for an instant he could not recall himself  i knew you would come son said padre felipe but where is she did you bring her with you  who asked arthur striving to recall his scattered senses  who saints preserve us don arturo she who sent for youdonna maria did you not get her message  arthur replied that he had only just arrived and had at once hastened to the mission for some reason that he was ashamed to confess he did not say that he had tried to reach the rancho of the blessed trinity nor did he admit that he had forgotten for the last two hours even the existence of donna maria you were having a mass for the dead father felipeyou have then suffered here  he paused anxiously for in his then confused state of mind he doubted how much of his late consciousness had been real or visionary  mother of god said father felipe eyeing arthur curiously you know not then for whom was this mass you know not that a saint has gonethat donna dolores has at last met her reward  i have heardthat is donna marias despatch saidthat she was missing stammered arthur feeling with a new and unsupportable disbelief in himself that his face was very pale and his voice uncertain  missing echoed father felipe with the least trace of impatience in his voice missing she will be found when the rancho of the blessed trinity is restoredwhen the ruins of the casa sunk fifty feet below the surface are brought again to the level of the plain missing don arturoahmissing indeedfor ever always entirely  moved perhaps by something in arthurs face padre felipe sketched in a few graphic pictures the details of the catastrophe already forecast by arthur it was a repetition of the story of the sunken corral the earthquake had not only levelled the walls of the rancho of the blessed trinity but had opened a gravelike chasm fifty feet below it and none had escaped to tell the tale the faithful vaqueros had rushed from the trembling and undulating plain to the rancho only to see it topple into a yawning abyss that opened to receive it don juan donna dolores the faithful manuela and alejandro the major domo with a dozen peons and retainers went down with the crumbling walls no one had escaped was it not possible to dig in the ruins for the bodies mother of god had not don arturo been told that the earth at the second shock had closed over the sunken ruins burying beyond mortal resurrection all that the rancho contained they were digging but hopelesslya dozen men they mightweeks hencediscover the bodiesbut who knows  the meek fatalistic way that father felipe accepted the final doom of donna dolores exasperated arthur beyond bounds in san francisco a hundred men would have been digging night and day in the mere chance of recovering the buried family herebut arthur remembered the sluggish helpless retainers of salvatierra the dreadful fatalism which affected them on the occurrence of this mysterious catastrophe even as shown in the man before him their accepted guide and leaderand shuddered could anything be done could he not with dumphys assistance procure a gang of men from san francisco and then came the instinct of caution always powerful with a nature like arthurs if these people most concerned in the loss of their friends their relations accepted it so hopelessly what right had hea mere strangerto interfere  but come my son said padre felipe laying his large soft hand parentally on arthurs shoulder come come with me to my rooms thanks to the blessed virgin i have still shelter and a roof to offer you ah he added stroking arthurs ridingcoat and examining critically as if he had been a large child what have wewhat is this eh you are wet with this heretic fogeh your hands are cold and your cheeks hot you have fatigue possiblymost possibly hunger no no it is so come with me come and drawing arthurs passive arm through his own he opened the vestry door and led him across the little garden choked with débris and plaster of the fallen tower to a small adobe building that had been the mission schoolroom it was now hastily fitted up as padre felipes own private apartment and meditative cell a bright fire burned in the low ovenlike hearth around the walls hung various texts illustrating the achievement of youthful penmanship with profound religious instruction at the extremity of the room there was a small organ midway and opposite the hearth was a deep embrasured windowthe window at which two weeks before mr jack hamlin had beheld the donna dolores she spent much of her time here dear child in the instruction of the young said father felipe taking a huge pinch of snuff and applying a large red bandana handkerchief to his eyes and nose it is her best monument thanks to her largessand she was ever freehanded don arturo to the churchthe foundation of the convent of our lady of sorrows her own patron saint thou seest here thou knowest possiblymost possibly as her legal adviserthat long ago by her will the whole of the salvatierra estate is a benefaction to the holy church eh  no i dont said arthur suddenly awakening with a glow of protestant and heretical objection that was new to him and eyeing padre felipe with the first glance of suspicion he had ever cast upon that venerable ecclesiastic no sir i never heard any intimation or suggestion of the kind from the late donna dolores on the contrary i was engaged  pardonpardon me my son interrupted father felipe taking another large pinch of snuff it is not now scarce twentyfour hours since the dear child was translatednot in her masses and while her virgin strewments are not yet fadedthat we will talk of this he blew his nose violently no all in good timethou shalt see but i have something here he continued turning over some letters and papers in his desk something for youpossibly most possibly more urgent it is a telegraphic despatch for you to my care  he handed a yellow envelope to arthur but poinsetts eyes were suddenly fixed upon a card which lay upon padre felipes table and which the padres search for the despatch had disclosed written across its face was the name of colonel culpepper starbottle of siskiyou do you know that man asked poinsett holding the despatch unopened in his hand and pointing to the card  father felipe took another pinch of snuff possiblymost possibly a lawyer i thinki think some business of the church property i have forgotten but your despatch don arturo what says it it does not take you from us and youonly an hour here  father felipe paused and looking up innocently found the eyes of arthur regarding him gravely the two men examined each other intently arthurs eyes at last withdrew from the clear unshrinking glance of padre felipe unabashed but unsatisfied a sudden recollection of the thousand and one scandals against the church and wild stories of its farreaching influencea swift remembrance of the specious craft and cunning charged upon the religious order of which padre felipe was a memberscandals that he had hitherto laughed at as idleflashed through his mind conscious that he was now putting himself in a guarded attitude before the man with whom he had always been free and outspoken arthur after a moments embarrassment that was new to him turned for relief to the despatch and opened it in an instant it drove all other thoughts from his mind its few words were from dumphy and ran characteristically as follows gabriel conroy arrested for murder of victor ramirez what do you propose answer  arthur rose to his feet when does the upstage pass through san geronimo he asked hurriedly  at midnight returned padre felipe surely my son you do not intend  and it is now nine oclock continued arthur consulting his watch can you procure me a fresh horse it is of the greatest importance father he added recovering his usual frankness  ah it is urgentit is a mattersuggested the padre gently  of life and death responded arthur gravely  father felipe rang a bell and gave some directions to a servant while arthur seating himself at the table wrote an answer to the despatch i can trust you to send it as soon as possible to the telegraph office he said handing it to father felipe  the padre took it in his hand but glanced anxiously at arthur and donna maria he said hesitatingly you have not seen her yet surely you will stop at the blessed fisherman if only for a moment eh  arthur drew his ridingcoat and cape over his shoulders with a mischievous smile i am afraid not father i shall trust to you to explain that i was recalled suddenly and that i had not time to call knowing the fascinations of your society father she will not begrudge the few moments i have spent with you  before father felipe could reply the servant entered with the announcement that the horse was ready  goodnight father felipe said arthur pressing the priests hands warmly with every trace of his former suspiciousness gone good night a thousand thanks for the horse in speeding the parting guest he added gravely you have perhaps done more for the health of my soul than you imaginegoodnight adios  with a light laugh in his ears the vision of a graceful erect figure waving a salute from a phantom steed an inward rush of the cold grey fog and muffled clatter of hoofs over the mouldy and mossy marbles in the churchyard father felipe parted from his guest he uttered a characteristic adjuration took a pinch of snuff and closing the door picked up the card of the gallant colonel starbottle and tossed it into the fire  but the perplexities of the holy father ceased not with the night at an early hour in the morning donna maria sepulvida appeared before him at breakfast suspicious indignant and irate  tell me father felipe she said hastily did the don arturo pass the night here  truly no my daughter answered the padre cautiously he was here but for a little  and he went away when interrupted donna maria  at nine  and where continued donna maria with a rising colour  to san francisco my child it was business of great importancebut sit down sit little one this impatience is of the devil daughter you must calm yourself  and do you know father felipe that he went away without coming near me continued donna maria in a higher key scarcely heeding her ghostly confessor  possibly most possibly but he received a despatchit was of the greatest importance  a despatch repeated donna maria scornfully trulyfrom whom  i know not my child said father felipe gazing at the pink cheeks indignant eyes and slightly swollen eyelids of his visitor this impatiencethis anger is most unseemly  was it from mr dumphy reiterated donna maria stamping her little foot  father felipe drew back his chair through what unhallowed spell had this womanonce the meekest and humblest of wivesbecome the shrillest and most shrewest of widows was she about to revenge herself on arthur for her long suffering with the late don josé father felipe pitied arthur now and prospectively  are you going to tell me said donna maria tremulously with alarming symptoms of hysteria  i believe it was from mr dumphy stammered padre felipe at least the answer don arturo gave me to send in replyonly these words i will return at oncewas addressed to mr dumphy but i know not what was the message he received  you dont said donna maria rising to her feet with white in her cheek fire in her eyes and a stridulous pitch in her voice you dont well i will tell you it was the same news that this brought she took a telegraphic despatch from her pocket and shook it in the face of father felipe there read it that was the news sent to him that was the reason why he turned and ran away like a coward as he is that was the reason why he never came near me like a perjured traitor as he is that is the reason why he came to you with his fastidious airs and his supercilious smileand hishisoh how i hate him that is whyread it read it why dont you read it she had been gesticulating with it waving it in the air wildly and evading every attempt of father felipe to take it from her read it read it and see why read and see that i am ruineda beggara cajoled and tricked and deceived womanbetween these two villains dumphy and misterarthurpoinsett ah read itor are you a traitor too you and dolores and all  she crumpled the paper in her hands threw it on the floor whitened suddenly round the lips and then followed the paper as suddenly at full length in a nervous spasm at father felipes feet father felipe gazed first at the paper and then at the rigid form of his friend he was a man an old onewith some experience of the sex and i regret to say he picked up the paper first and straightened it out it was a telegraphic despatch in the following words       sorry to say telegram just received that earthquake has      dropped out lead of conroy mine everything gone up cant make      further advances or sell stockdumphy  father felipe bent over donna maria and raised her in his arms poor little one he said but i dont think arthur knew it     chapter ii  the yellow envelope   for once by a cruel irony the adverse reports regarding the stability of the conroy mine were true a few stockholders still clung to the belief that it was a fabrication to depress the stock but the fact as stated in mr dumphys despatch to donna maria was in possession of the public the stock fell to 35 to 30 to 10to nothing an hour after the earthquake it was known in one horse gulch that the lead had dropped suddenly and that a veil of granite of incalculable thickness had been upheaved between the seekers and the treasure now lost in the mysterious depths below the vein was gone whereno one could tell there were various theories more or less learned there was one party who believed in the subsidence of the vein another who believed in the interposition of the granite but all tending to the same conclusionthe inaccessibility of the treasure science pointed with stony finger to the evidence of previous phenomena of the same character visible throughout the gulch but the grim i told you so of nature was i fear no more satisfactory to the dwellers of one horse gulch than the ordinary prophetic distrust of common humanity  the news spread quickly and far it overtook several wandering californians in europe and sent them to their bankers with anxious faces it paled the cheeks of one or two guardians of orphan children frightened several widows drove a confidential clerk into shameful exile and struck mr raynor in boston with such consternation that people for the first time suspected that he had backed his opinion of the resources of california with capital throughout the length and breadth of the pacific slope it produced a movement of aggression which the earthquake had hitherto failed to cover the probabilities of danger to life and limb by a recurrence of the shock had been dismissed from the public consideration but this actual loss of characteristic property awakened the gravest anxiety if nature claimed the privilege of at any time withdrawing from that implied contract under which so many of californias best citizens had occupied and improved the country it was high time that something should be done thus spake an intelligent and unfettered press a few old residents talked of returning to the east  during this excitement mr dumphy bore himself toward the world generally with perfect selfconfidence and if anything an increased aggressiveness his customers dared not talk of their losses before him or exhibit a stoicism unequal to his own  its a bad business he would say what do you propose and as the one latent proposition in each human breast was the return of the money invested and as no one dared to make that proposition mr dumphy was as usual triumphant in this frame of mind mr poinsett found him on his return from the mission of san antonio the next morning  bad news i suppose down there said mr dumphy briskly and i reckon the widow though she has been luckier than her neighbours dont feel particularly lively eh im devilish sorry for you poinsett though as a man you can see that the investment was a good one but you cant make a woman understand business eh well the ranchos worth double the mortgage i reckon eh ugly aint sheof course said shed been swindled thats like a woman you and me know em eh poinsett mr dumphy emitted his characteristic bark and winked at his visitor  arthur looked up in unaffected surprise if you mean mrs sepulvida he said coldly i havent seen her i was on my way there when your telegram recalled me i had some business with padre felipe  you dont know then that the conroy mine has gone up with the earthquake eh lead dropped outeh and the widows fiftysix thousandhere mr dumphy snapped his finger and thumb to illustrate the lame and impotent conclusion of donna marias investmentdont you know that  no said arthur with perfect indifference and a languid abstraction that awed mr dumphy more than anxiety no i dont but i imagine that isnt the reason you telegraphed me  no returned dumphy still eyeing poinsett keenly for a possible clue to this singular and unheardof apathy to the condition of the fortune of the woman his visitor was about to marry noof course  well said arthur with that dangerous quiet which was the only outward sign of interest and determination in his nature im going up to one horse gulch to offer my services as counsel to gabriel conroy now for the details of this murder which by the way i dont believe gabriel committed unless hes another man than the one i knew after that you can tell me your business with me for i dont suppose you telegraphed to me on his account solely of course at first you felt it was to your interest to get him and his wife out of the way now that ramirez is gone but now if you please let me know what you know about this murder  mr dumphy thus commanded and completely under the influence of arthurs quiet will briefly recounted the particulars already known to the reader of which he had been kept informed by telegraph  hes been recaptured added dumphy i learn by a later despatch and i dont reckon therell be another attempt to lynch him ive managed that he continued with a return of his old selfassertion ive got some influence there  for the first time during the interview arthur awoke from his preoccupation and glanced keenly at dumphy of course he returned coolly i dont suppose you such a fool as to allow the only witness you have of your wifes death to be sacrificedeven if you believed that the impostor who was personating your wife had been charged with complicity in a capital crime and had fled from justice youre not such a fool as to believe that this mrs conroy wont try to help her husband that she evidently loves by every means in her powerthat she wont make use of any secret she may have that concerns you to save him and herself no mr peter dumphy said arthur significantly no youre too much of a business man not to see that as he spoke he noted the alternate flushing and paling of mr dumphys face and readi fear with the triumphant and instinctive consciousness of a superior intellectthat mr dumphy had been precisely such a fool and had failed  i reckon nobody will put much reliance on the evidence of a woman charged with a capital crime said mr dumphy with a show of confidence he was far from feeling  suppose that she and gabriel both swear that she knows your abandoned wife for instance suppose that they both swear that she and you connived to personate grace conroy for the sake of getting the title to this mine suppose that she alleges that she repented and married gabriel as she did and suppose that they both admit the killing of this ramirezand assert that you were persecuting them through him and still are suppose that they show that he forged a second grant to the minethrough your instigation  its a lie interrupted dumphy starting to his feet he did it from jealousy  can you prove his motives said arthur  but the grant was not in my favourit was to some old californian down in the mission of san antonio i can prove that said dumphy excitedly  suppose you can nobody imagines you so indiscreet as to have had another grant conveyed to you directly while you were negotiating with gabriel for his dont be foolish i know you had nothing to do with the forged grant i am only suggesting how you have laid yourself open to the charges of a woman of whom you are likely to make an enemy and might have made an ally if you calculate to revenge ramirez consider first if you care to have it proved that he was a confidential agent of yoursas they will if you dont help them never mind whether they committed the murder you are not their judge or accuser you must help them for your own sake no continued arthur after a pause congratulate yourself that the vigilance committee did not hang gabriel conroy and that you have not to add revenge to the other motives of a desperate and scheming woman  but are you satisfied that mrs conroy is really the person who stands behind colonel starbottle and personates my wife  i am replied arthur positively  dumphy hesitated a moment should he tell arthur of colonel starbottles interview with him and the delivery and subsequent loss of the mysterious envelope arthur read his embarrassment plainly and precipitated his decision with a single question  have you had any further interview with colonel starbottle  thus directly adjured dumphy hesitated no longer but at once repeated the details of his late conversation with starbottle his successful bribery of the colonel the delivery of the sealed envelope under certain conditions and its mysterious disappearance arthur heard him through with quiet interest but when mr dumphy spoke of the loss of the envelope he fixed his eyes on mr dumphys with a significance that was unmistakable  you say you lost this envelope trusted to your honour said arthur with slow and insulting deliberation lost it without having opened it or learned its contents that was very unfortunate mr dumphy very unfortunate  the indignation of an honourable man at the imputation of some meanness foreign to his nature is weak compared with the anger of a rascal accused of an offence which he might have committed but didnt mr dumphy turned almost purple it was so evident that he had not been guilty of concealing the envelope and did not know its contents that arthur was satisfied  he denied any personal knowledge of mrs conroy in this affair queried arthur  entirely he gave me to understand that his instructions were received from another party unknown to me said dumphy look yer poinsettyoure wrong i dont believe it is that woman  arthur shook his head no one else possesses the information necessary to blackmail you no one else has a motive in doing it  the door opened to a clerk bearing a card mr dumphy took it impatiently and read aloud colonel starbottle of siskiyou he then turned an anxious face to poinsett  good said that gentleman quietly admit him as the clerk disappeared arthur turned to dumphy i suppose it was to meet this man you sent for me  yes returned dumphy with a return of his old brusqueness  then hold your tongue and leave everything to me  the door opened as he spoke to colonel starbottles frilled shirt and expanding bosom followed at a respectful interval by the gallant colonel himself he was evidently surprised by the appearance of mr dumphys guest but by no means dashed in his usual chivalrous port and bearing my legal adviser mr poinsett said dumphy introducing arthur briefly  the gallant colonel bowed stiffly while arthur with a smile of fascinating courtesy and deference that astonished dumphy in proportion as it evidently flattered and gratified colonel starbottle stepped forward and extended his hand as a younger member of the profession i can hardly claim the attention of one so experienced as colonel starbottle but as the friend of poor henry beeswinger i can venture to take the hand of the man who so gallantly stood by him as his second two years ago  ged sir said colonel starbottle absolutely empurpling with pleasure and exploding his handkerchief from his sweltering breast ged youererdo me proud i amergratified sir to meet any friend oferergentleman like hank beeswinger i remember the whole affair sir as if it was yesterday i do with an oath gratifying mr poinsett to every gentleman concerned your friend sirim proud to meet youi ammekilled sir second fire dropped like a gentlemanme no fuss no reporters no arrests friends considerate blank me sir one of the finest d me i may say sir one of the very finestermeetings in which i haveerparticipated glad to know you sir you call to mind sir one of theerhighest illustrations of a code of honourthatererunder the presenterdegrading state of public sentiment is ererpassing away we are drifting sir driftingdrifting to ererpolitical and social condition where the voice of honour sir is drowned by the yankee watchword of produce and trade trade sir blank me colonel starbottle paused with a rhetorical full stop blew his nose and gazed at the ceiling with a plaintive suggestion that the days of chivalry had indeed passed and that american institutions were indeed retrograding mr dumphy leaned back in his chair in helpless irritability mr arthur poinsett alone retained an expression of courteous and sympathising attention  i am the more gratified at meeting colonel starbottle said arthur gravely from the fact that my friend and client here mr dumphy is at present in a condition where he most needs the consideration and understanding of a gentleman and a man of honour a paper which has been entrusted to his safe keeping and custody as a gentleman has disappeared since the earthquake and it is believed that during the excitement of that moment it was lost the paper is supposed to be intact as it was in an envelope that had never been opened and whose seals were unbroken it is a delicate matter but i am rejoiced that the gentleman who left the paper in trust is the honourable colonel starbottle whom i know by reputation and the gentleman who suffered the misfortune of losing it is my personal friend mr dumphy it enables me at once to proffer my services as mediator or as mr dumphys legal adviser and friend to undertake all responsibility in the matter  the tone and manner were so like colonel starbottles own that dumphy looked from arthur to colonel starbottle in hopeless amazement the latter gentleman dropped his chin and fixed a pair of astonished and staring eyes upon arthur do i understandthaterthis gentleman mr dumphy has placed you in possession of any confidential statementthater  pardon me colonel starbottle interrupted arthur rising with dignity the facts i have just stated are sufficient for the responsibility i assume in this case i learn from my client that a sealed paper placed in his hands is missing i have from him the statement that i am bound to believe that it passed from his hands unopened where he knows not this is a matter between gentlemen serious enough without further complication  and the paper and envelope are lost continued colonel starbottle still gazing at arthur  are lost returned arthur quietly i have advised my friend mr dumphy that as a man of honour and a business man he is by no means freed through this unfortunate accident from any promise or contract that he may have entered into with you concerning it any deposit as a collateral for its safe delivery which he might have made or has promised to make is clearly forfeited this he has been waiting only for your appearance to hand to you arthur crossed to mr dumphys side and laid his hand lightly upon his shoulder but with a certain significance of grip palpable to mr dumphy who after looking into his eyes took out his cheque book when he had filled in a duplicate of the cheque he had given colonel starbottle two days before arthur took it from his hand and touched the bell as we will not burden colonel starbottle unnecessarily your cashiers acceptance of this paper will enable him to use it henceforth at his pleasure and as i expect to have the pleasure of the colonels company to my office will you kindly have this done at once  the clerk appeared and at mr poinsetts direction took the cheque from the almost passive fingers of mr dumphy  allow me to express my perfect satisfaction witherer your explanation said colonel starbottle extending one hand to arthur while at the same moment he gracefully readjusted his shirtbosom with the other trouble yourself no furtherregarding theererpaper i trust it willeryet be found if not sir i shallerer added the colonel with honourable resignation hold myself personally responsible to my client blank me  was there no mark upon the envelope by which it might be known without explaining its contents suggested arthur  none sir a plain yellow envelope stop said the colonel striking his forehead with his hand ged sir i do remember now that during our conversation i made a memorandum  me a memorandum upon the face of it across it a name ged sir the very name of the party you were speaking ofgabriel conroy  you wrote the name of gabriel conroy upon it good that may lead to its identification without exposing its contents returned arthur well sir  the last two words were addressed to mr dumphys clerk who had entered during the colonels speech and stood staring alternately at him and his employer holding the accepted cheque in his hand  give it to the gentleman said dumphy curtly  the man obeyed colonel starbottle took the cheque folded it and placed it somewhere in the moral recesses of his breastpocket that done he turned to mr dumphy i need not sayerthateras far as my personal counsel and advice to my client can prevail it will be my effort to prevent litigation in thiserdelicate affair should the envelopeererturn up you will of courseersend it to me who amerpersonally responsible for it ged sir continued the colonel i should be proud to conclude this affair conducted as it has been on your side with the strictest honour over theerfestiveboardbuterbusiness prevents me i leave here in one hour for one horse gulch  both mr dumphy and poinsett involuntarily started  one horse gulch repeated arthur   me yes ged sir im retained in a murder case there the case of this man gabriel conroy  arthur cast a swift precautionary look at dumphy then perhaps we may be travelling companions he said to starbottle smiling pleasantly i am going there too perhaps my good fortune may bring us in friendly counsel you are engaged  for the prosecution interrupted starbottle slightly expanding his chest at the request of relatives of the murdered mana spanish gentleman ofererlarge and influential family connections i shall assist the district attorney my old friend nelse buckthorne  the excitement kindled in arthurs eyes luckily did not appear in his voice it was still pleasant to colonel starbottles ear as after a single threatening glance of warning at the utterly mystified and half exploding dumphy he turned gracefully toward him and if by the fortunes of war we should be again on opposite sides my dear colonel i trust that our relations may be as gratifying as they have been today one moment i am going your way let me beg you to take my arm a few blocks and a glass of wine afterwards as a stirrupcup on our journey and with a significant glance at dumphy arthur poinsett slipped colonel starbottles arm deftly under his own and actually marched off with that doughty warrior a blushing expanding but not unwilling captive  when the door closed mr dumphy resumed his speech and action in a single expletive what more he might have said is not known for at the same moment he caught sight of his clerk who had entered hastily at the exit of the others but who now stood awed and abashed by mr dumphys passion dash it all what in dash are you dashingly doing here dash you  sorry sir said the unlucky clerk but overhearing that gentleman say there was writing on the letter that you lost by which it might be identified sirwe think weve found itthat is we know where it is  how said dumphy starting up eagerly  when the shock came that afternoon continued the clerk the express bag for sacramento and marysville had just been taken out by the expressman and was lying on top of the waggon the horses started to run at the second shock and the bag fell and was jammed against a lamppost in front of our window bursting open as it did so and spilling some letters and papers on the sidewalk one of our night watchmen helped the expressman pick up the scattered letters and picked up among them a plain yellow envelope with no address but the name of gabriel conroy written in pencil across the end supposing it had dropped from some package in the express bag he put it back again in the bag when you asked about a blank envelope missing from your desk he did not connect it with the one he had picked up for that had writing on it we sent to the express office just now and found that they had stamped it and forwarded it to conroy at one horse gulch just as they had always done with his letters sent to our care thats the way of it daresay its there by this time in his hands sir all right     chapter iii  gabriel meets his lawyer   gabriels petition on behalf of mr hamlin was promptly granted by the sheriff the waggon was at once put into requisition to convey the wounded manalbeit screaming and protestingto the grand conroy hotel where in company with his faithful henchman he was left to all intents a free man and a half an hour later a demented one tossing in a burning fever  owing to the insecure condition of the county jail at one horse gulch and possibly some belief in the equal untrustworthiness of the people the sheriff conducted his prisoner accompanied by olly to wingdam nevertheless ollys statement of the changed condition of public sentiment or rather its preoccupation with a calamity of more absorbing interest was in the main correct the news of the recapture of gabriel by his legal guardian awoke no excitement nor comment more than this there was a favourable feeling toward the prisoner the action of the vigilance committee had been unsuccessful and had terminated disastrously to the principal movers therein it is possible that the morality of their action was involved in their success somehow the whole affair had not resulted to the business interests of the gulch the three most prominent lynchers were deadand clearly in error the prisoner who was still living was possibly in the right the silverpolis messenger which ten days before had alluded to the noble spectacle of a free people outraged in their holiest instincts appealing to the first principles of justice and order and rallying as a single man to their support now quietly buried the victims and their motives from the public eye beneath the calm statement that they met their fate while examining the roof of the court house with a view to estimate the damage caused by the first shock of the earthquake the banner favoured the same idea a little less elegantly and suggested ironically that hereafter none but experts should be allowed to go foolin round the statue of justice i trust that the intelligent reader will not accuse me of endeavouring to cast ridicule upon the general accuracy of spontaneous public emotion nor the infallibility of the true democratic impulse which i beg to quote from the messenger in the earliest ages of our history enabled us to resist legalised aggression and take the reins of government into our own hands or i now refer to the glowing language of the banner gave us the right to run the machine ourselves and boss the job and i trust that the reader will observe in this passing recognition of certain inconsistencies in the expression and action of these people only the fidelity of a faithful chronicler and no intent of churlish criticism nor moral or political admonition which i here discreetly deprecate and disclaim  nor was there any opposition when gabriel upon the motion of lawyer maxwell was admitted to bail pending the action of the grand jury nor any surprise when mr dumphys agent and banker came forward as his bondsman for the sum of fifty thousand dollars by one of those strange vicissitudes in the fortunes of mining speculation this act by mr dumphy was looked upon as an evidence of his trust in the future of the unfortunate mine of which gabriel had been original locator and superintendent and under that belief the stock rallied slightly it was a mighty sharp move of pete dumphys bailin thet gabe right in face of that there dropped lead in his bustedup mine oh youve got to set up all night to get any points to show him and to their mutual surprise mr dumphy found himself more aweinspiring than ever at one horse gulch and gabriel found himself a free man with a slight popular flavour of martyrdom about him  as he still persistently refused to enter again upon the premises which he had deeded to his wife on the day of the murder temporary lodgings were found for him and olly at the grand conroy hotel and here mrs markle although exhibiting to lawyer maxwell the greatest concern in gabriels trouble by one of those inconsistencies of the sex which i shall not attempt to explain treated the unfortunate accused with a degree of cold reserve that was as grateful i fear to gabriel as it was unexpected indeed i imagine that if the kindhearted widow had known the real comfort and assurance that the exasperating gabriel extracted from her first cold and constrained greeting she would have spent less of her time in consultation with maxwell regarding his defence but perhaps i am doing a largehearted and unselfish sex a deep injustice so i shall content myself with transcribing part of a dialogue which took pace between them at the grand conroy  mrs markle loftily and regarding the ceiling with cold abstraction we cant gin ye here mister conroy the french style and attention yere kinder habitooal to in your own house on the hill bein plain folks and mounting ways but we know our place and dont reckon to promise the comforts of a home wot with lookin arter forty reglar and twentyfive transientef i dont happen to see ye much myself mr conroy yell understand ef ye ring thet there bell one o the help will be always on hand yer lookin well mr conroy and bizness i reckon the reader will here observe a ladylike ignoring of gabriels special trouble ez about what it allers waz though judging from remarks of transients its dull  gabriel endeavouring to conceal a large satisfaction under the thin glowing of conventional sentiment dont let me nor olly put ye out a cent mrs marklea change bein ordered by ollys physiciansand variety bein so to speak the spice o life and yere lookin well mrs markle that ez with a sudden alarm at the danger of compliment so to speak ez peart and stronghanded ez ever and hows thet little manty o yours gettin on jist how it was thet me and olly didnt get to see ye before ez mighty queer times and times agin with shameless mendacity hez me and thet child bin on the pint o coming and suthin hez jest chipped in and interfered  mrs markle with freezing politeness you do me proud i jest dropped in ez a matter o not bein able allers to trust to help good night mister conroy i hope i see you well ye kin jest retiring with matronly dignity ye kin jest touch onto that bell thar if yere wantin anything and helpll come to ye goodnight  olly appearing a moment later at the door of gabriels room truculent and suspicious afore id stand tharchirpin with thet crockidilland you in troubil and not knowin wots gone o julyid pizen myself  gabriel blushing to the roots of his hair and consciencestricken to his inmost soul its jest passin the time o day olly with old friendskinder influencin the public sentyment and the jury thets all its the advice o lawyer maxwell ez ye didnt get to hear i reckonthets all  but gabriels experience in the grand conroy hotel was not i fear always as pleasant a darkfaced largefeatured woman manifestly in mourning and as manifestly an avenging friend of the luckless deceased in whose taking off gabriel was supposed to be so largely instrumental presently appeared at the grand conroy hotel waiting the action of the grand jury she was accompanied by a darkfaced elderly gentleman our old friend don pedroshe being none other than the unstablewaisted manuela of pacific streetand was i believe in the opinion of one horse gulch supposed to be charged with convincing and mysterious evidence against gabriel conroy the sallowfaced pair had a way of meeting in the corridors of the hotel and conversing in mysterious whispers in a tongue foreign to one horse gulch and to olly strongly suggestive of revenge and concealed stilettos that was darkly significant happily however for gabriel he was presently relieved from their gloomy espionage by the interposition of a third partysal clark that individual herself in the deepest mourning and representing the deceased in his holiest affections it is scarcely necessary to say at once resented the presence of the strangers the two women glared at each other at the public table and in a chance meeting in the corridor of the hotel  in the name of god what have we here in this imbecile and forward creature and why is this so and after this fashion asked manuela of don pedro  of a verity i know not replied don pedro it is most possibly a person visited of goda helpless being of brains peradventure a person filled with aguardiente or the whisky of the americans have a care little one thou smallest manuela she weighed at least three hundred pounds that she does thee no harm  meanwhile miss sarah clark relieved herself to mrs markle in quite as positive language ef that black mulattar and that driedup old furriner reckons theyre going to monopolise public sentyment in this yer way theyre mighty mistaken ef thar ever was a shameless piece ets thet old womanand goodness knows the mans a poor critter enyway ef anybodys goin to take the word of that woman under oath ets morn sal clark would dothats all who ez sheenyway i never heard her name mentioned afore  and ridiculous as it may seem to the unprejudiced reader this positive expression and conviction of miss clark like all positive convictions was not without its influence on the larger unimpanelled grand jury of one horse gulch and by reflection at last on the impanelled jury itself  when you come to consider gentlemen said one of those dangerous charactersa sagacious farseeing jurorwhen you come to consider that the principal witness o the prosecution and the people at the inquest dont know this yer greaser woman and kinder throws off her testimony and the prosecution dont seem to agree it looks mighty queer and i put it to you as farminded men if it aint mighty queer and this yer sal clark one of our own people  an impression at once inimical to the new mistress and stranger and favourable to the accused gabriel instantly took possession of one horse gulch  meanwhile the man who was largely responsible for this excitement and these conflicting opinions maintained a gravity and silence as indomitable and impassive as his alleged victim then slumbering peacefully in the little cemetery on round hill he conversed but little even with his counsel and friend lawyer maxwell and received with his usual submissiveness and gentle deprecatoriness the statement of that gentleman that mr dumphy had already bespoken the services of one of the most prominent lawyers of san franciscomr arthur poinsettto assist in the defence when maxwell added that mr poinsett had expressed a wish to hold his first consultation with gabriel privately the latter replied with his usual simplicity i reckon ive nowt to say to him ez i haint said to ye but its all right  then ill expect you over to my office at eleven tomorrow asked maxwell  thets so responded gabriel though i reckon thet anything you and him might fix up to be dumped onto thet jury would be pleasin and satisfactory to me  at a few minutes of eleven the next morning mr maxwell in accordance with a previous understanding with mr poinsett put on his hat and left his office in the charge of that gentleman that he might receive and entertain gabriel in complete privacy and confidence as arthur sat there alone fine gentleman as he was and famous in his profession he was conscious of a certain degree of nervousness that galled his pride greatly he was about to meet the man whose cherished sister six years ago he had stolen such at least arthur felt was gabriels opinion he had no remorse nor consciousness of guilt or wrongdoing in that act but in looking at the fact in his professional habit of viewing both sides of a question he made this allowance for the sentiment of the prosecution and putting himself in his old fashion in the position of his opponent he judged that gabriel might consistently exhibit some degree of indignation at their first meeting that there was however really any moral question involved he did not believe the girl grace conroy had gone with him readily after a careful and honourable statement of the facts of her situation and gabriels authority or concern in any subsequent sentimental complication he utterly denied that he arthur had acted in a most honourable highminded and even weakly generous fashion towards grace that he had obeyed her frivolous whims as well as her most reasonable demands that he had gone back to starvation camp on a hopeless quest just to satisfy her that everything had happened exactly as he had predicted and that when he had returned to her he found that she had deserted himthesethese were the facts that were incontrovertible arthur was satisfied that he had been honourable and even generoushe was quite convinced that this very nervousness that he now experienced was solely the condition of a mind too sympathetic even with the feelings of an opponent in affliction i must not give way to this absurd quixotic sense of honour said this young gentleman to himself severely  nevertheless at exactly eleven oclock when the staircase creaked with the strong steady tread of the giant gabriel arthur felt a sudden start to his pulse there was a hesitating rap at the doora rap that was so absurdly inconsistent with the previous tread on the staircaseas inconsistent as were all the mental and physical acts of gabrielthat arthur was amused and reassured come in he said with a return of his old confidence and the door opened to gabriel diffident and embarrassed  i was told by lawyer maxwell said gabriel slowly without raising his eyes and only dimly cognisant of the slight strong elegant figure before himi was told that mr arthur poinsett reckoned to see me today at eleven oclockso i came be you mr poinsett gabriel here raised his eyesbe you ehgod amighty why itsehwhyi want to knowit cant beyes it is he stoppedthe recognition was complete  arthur did not move if he had expected an outburst from the injured man before him he was disappointed gabriel passed his hard palm vaguely and confusedly across his forehead and through his hair and lifted and put back behind his ears two tangled locks and then without heeding arthurs proffered hand yet without precipitation anger or indignation he strode toward him and asked calmly and quietly as arthur himself might have done where is grace  i dont know said arthur bluntly i have not known for years i have never known her whereabouts living or dead since the day i left her at a loggers house to return to starvation camp to bring help to you arthur could not resist italicising the pronoun nor despising himself for doing it when he saw that the full significance of his emphasis touched the man before him she was gone when i returned where no one knew i traced her to the presidio but there she had disappeared  gabriel raised his eyes to arthurs the impression of nonchalant truthfulness which arthurs speech always conveyed to his hearer an impression that he did not prevaricate because he was not concerned sufficiently in his subject was further sustained by his calm clear eyes but gabriel did not speak and arthur went on  she left the loggers camp voluntarily of her own free will and doubtless for some reason that seemed sufficient to her she abandoned meif i may so express myselfleft my care relieved me of the responsibility i held towards her relativeshe continued with the first suggestion of personal apology in his toneswithout a word of previous intimation possibly she might have got tired of waiting for me i was absent two weeks it was the tenth day after my departure that she left the loggers hut  gabriel put his hand in his pocket and deliberately drew out the precious newspaper slip he had once shown to olly then thet thar personal wozent writ by you and thet p a dont stand for philip ashley asked gabriel with a hopeless dejection in his tone  arthur glanced quickly over the paper and smiled i never saw this before he said what made you think i did it he asked curiously  because julymy wife that wassaid that p a meant you said gabriel simply  oh she said so did she said arthur still smiling  she did and ef it wasnt you who was it  i really dont know returned arthur carelessly possibly it might have been herself from what i have heard of your wife i think this might be one and perhaps the most innocent of her various impostures  gabriel cast down his eyes and for a moment was gravely silent then the look of stronger inquiry and intelligence that he had worn during the interview faded utterly from his face and he began again in his old tone of apology for answerin all my questions im obliged to ye mr ashley and its right good in ye to remember ol times and ef i hev often thought hard on ye yell kinder pass that by ez the natrel allowins of a man ez was worried about a sister ez hasnt been heerd from sens she left with ye and ye mustnt think this yer meetin was o my seekin i kinder dropped in yer he added wearily to see a man o the name o poinsett he allowed to be yer at eleving oclockmebbee its airly yetmebbee ive kinder got wrong o the place and he glanced apologetically around the room  my name is poinsett said arthur smiling the name of philip ashley by which you knew me was merely the one i assumed when i undertook the long overland trip he said this in no tone of apology or even explanation but left the impression on gabriels mind that a change of name like a change of dress was part of the outfit of a gentleman emigrant and looking at the elegant young figure before him it seemed exceedingly plausible it was as arthur poinsett the san francisco lawyer that i made this appointment with you and it is now as your old friend philip ashley that i invite your confidence and ask you to tell me frankly the whole of this miserable business i have come to help you gabriel for your ownfor your sisters sake and i think i can do it he held out his hand again and this time not in vain with a sudden frank gesture it was taken in both of gabriels and arthur felt that the greatest difficulty he had anticipated in his advocacy of gabriels cause had been surmounted  he has told me the whole story i think said arthur two hours later when maxwell returned and found his associate thoughtfully sitting beside the window alone and i believe it he is as innocent of this crime as you or i of that i have always been confident how far he is accessory after the facti know he is not accessory beforeis another question but his story that to me is perfectly convincing i am afraid wont do before a jury and the world generally it involves too much that is incredible and damning to him secondarily if believed we must try something else as far as i can see really it seems that his own suggestion of a defence as you told it to me has more significance in it than the absurdity you only saw we must admit the killing and confine ourselves to showing excessive provocation i know something of the public sentiment here and the sympathies of the average jury and if gabriel should tell them the story he has just told me they would hang him at once unfortunately for him the facts show a complication of property interests and impostures on the part of his wife of which he is perfectly innocent and which are not really the motive of the murder but which the jury would instantly accept as a sufficient motive we must fight understand this very story from the outset you will find it to be the theory of the prosecution but if we can keep him silent it cannot be proved except by him the facts are such that if he had really committed the murder he could have defied prosecution but through his very stupidity and blind anxiety to shield his wife he has absolutely fixed the guilt upon himself  then you dont think that mrs conroy is the culprit asked maxwell  no said arthur she is capable but not culpable the real murderer has never been suspected nor his presence known to one horse gulch but i must see him again and olly and you must hunt up a chinamanone ah fewhom gabriel tells me brought him the note and who is singularly enough missing now that he is wanted  but you cant use a chinamans evidence before a jury interrupted maxwell  not directly but i can find christian caucasians who would be willing to swear to the facts he supplied them with i shall get at the facts in a few daysand then my dear fellow continued arthur laying his hand familiarly and patronisingly on the shoulder of his senior and then you and i will go to work to see how we can get rid of them  when gabriel recounted the events of the day to olly and described his interview with poinsett she became furiously indignant and did that man mean to say he dont know whether gracey is livin or dead and he pertendin to hev bin her bo  in coorse explained gabriel ye disremember olly that gracey never hez let on to me her own brother whar she ez and she wouldnt be going to tell a stranger thars them personals as she never answered  mebbe she didnt want to speak to him agin said olly fiercely with a toss of her curls id like to know what hed bin sayin to herlike his impudence enny how he ought to hev found her out and she his sweetheart why didnt he go right off to the presidio what did he come back for not find her indeed why gabe do you suppose as july wont find you out soonwhy i bet anythin she knows jest whar you are gabriel trembled and felt an inward sinking and is ony waitin to come forward to the trial and yer you are taken in agin and fooled by these yer lawyersyou old gabe you let me git at thet philipashley poinsettthets all     chapter iv  what ah fe does not know   thus admonished by the practicalminded olly gabriel retired precipitately to the secure fastnesses of conroys hill where over a consolatory pipe in his deserted cabin he gave himself up to reflections upon the uncertainty of the sex and the general vagaries of womanhood at such times he would occasionally extend his wanderings to the gigantic pine tree which still towered preeminently above its fellows in ominous loneliness and seated upon one of its outlying roots would gently philosophise to himself regarding his condition the vicissitudes of fortune the awful prescience of olly and the beneficence of a creator who permitted such awkward triviality and uselessness as was incarnate in himself to exist at all sometimes following the impulse of habit he would encroach abstractedly upon the limits of his own domain and find himself under the shadow of his own fine house on the hill from which since that eventful parting with his wife he had always rigidly withheld his foot as soon as he would make this alarming discovery he would turn back in honourable delicacy and a slight sense of superstitious awe retreating from one of these involuntary incursions one day in passing through an opening in a little thicket of buckeye near his house he stumbled over a small workbasket lying in the withered grass apparently mislaid or forgotten gabriel instantly recognised it as the property of his wife and as quickly recalled the locality as one of her favourite resorts during the excessive midday heats he hesitated and then passed on and then stopped and returned again awkwardly and bashfully to have touched any property of his wifes after their separation was something distasteful and impossible to gabriels sense of honour to leave it there the spoil of any passing chinaman or the prey of the elements was equally inconsistent with a certain respect which gabriel had for his wifes weaknesses he compromised by picking it up with the intention of sending it to lawyer maxwell as his wifes trustee but in doing this to gabriels great alarm for he would as soon have sacrificed the hand that held this treasure as to have exposed its contents in curiosity or suspicion part of that multitudinous contents overflowed and fell on the ground and he was obliged to pick them up and replace them one of them was a babys shirtso small it filled the great hand that grasped it in gabriels emigrant experience as the frequent custodian and nurse of the incomplete human animal he was somewhat familiar with those sacred mummylike enwrappings usually unknown to childless men and he recognised it at once  he did not replace it in the basket but with a suffused cheek and an increased sense of his usual awkwardness stuffed it into the pocket of his blouse nor did he send the basket to lawyer maxwell as he had intended and in fact omitted any allusion to it in his usual account to olly of his daily experience for the next two days he was peculiarly silent and thoughtful and was sharply reprimanded by olly for general idiocy and an especial evasion of some practical duties  yers them lawyers hez been huntin ye to come over and examine that there chinaman ah fe ez is jest turned up agin and you aint no whar to be found and lawyer maxwell sez its a most important witness and whar bouts was ye found down in the gulch chirpin and gossipin with that arkansas family and totin round mrs welchs baby and you a growed man with a fammerly of yer own to look after i wonder ye aint got more sabeprancin round in this yer shiftless way and you on trial and accused o killin folks yer a high ole gaberentin yerself out fur a dry nuss for nothin  gabriel colouring and hastily endeavouring to awaken ollys feminine sympathies it waz the powerfullest smallest babyye oughter get to see it olly taint bigger nor a squirrelony two weeks old yesterday  olly outwardly scornful but inwardly resolving to visit the phenomenon next week dont stand yawpin here but waltz down to lawyer maxwell and see that chinaman  gabriel reached the office of lawyer maxwell just as that gentleman and arthur poinsett were rising from a long hopeless and unsatisfactory examination of ah fe the lawyers had hoped to be able to establish the fact of gabriels remoteness from the scene of the murder by some corroborating incident or individual that ah fe could furnish in support of the detailed narrative he had already given but it did not appear that any caucasian had been encountered or met by ah fe at the time of his errand and ah fes memory of the details he had already described was apparently beginning to be defective it was evident nothing was to be gained from him even if he had been constituted a legal witness and then more than all he was becoming sullen  we are afraid that we havent made much out of your friend ah fe said arthur taking gabriels hand you might try if you can revive his memory but it looks doubtful  gabriel gazed at ah fe intentlypossibly because he was the last person who had spoken to his missing wife ah fe returned the gaze discharging all expression from his countenance except a slight suggestion of the habitual vague astonishment always seen in the face of a newborn infant perhaps this peculiar expression reminding gabriel as it did of the phenomenon in the welch family interested him but the few vague wandering questions he put were met by equally vague answers arthur rose in some impatience lawyer maxwell wiped away the smile that had been lingering around his mouth the interview was ended  arthur and maxwell passed down the narrow stairway arm in arm gabriel would have followed them with ah fe but turning toward that mongolian he was alarmed by a swift spasm of expression that suddenly convulsed ah fes face he winked both his eyes with the velocity of sheetlightning nodded his head with frightful rapidity and snapped and apparently dislocated every finger on his right hand gabriel gazed at him in openmouthed wonder  all litee said ah fe looking intently at gabriel  which asked gabriel  all litee you shabbee all litee

blank slatecoloured physiognomy than did gabriels simple question he returned his questioners glance with ineffable calmness and vacancy patiently drew the long sleeves of his blouse still further over his varnished fingers crossed them submissively and orientally before him and waited apparently for gabriel to become again intelligible  look yer said gabriel with gentle persuasiveness ef its the same to ye youd be doin me a heap o good ef youd let on whar thet julythet mrs conroy ez bein a man ez in his blindness bows down to wood and stun ye aint supposed to allow fur a christians

face then he said kindly gently but somewhat vaguely and unsatisfactorily  me no shabbee melican man me washee shirtee dollah and hap dozen     chapter v  the people v john doe alias gabriel conroy and jane roe alias julie conroy before boompointer j   the day of the trial was one of exacting and absorbing interest to one horse gulch long before ten oclock the courtroom and even the halls and corridors of the lately rehabilitated court house were thronged with spectators it is only fair to say that by this time the main points at issue were forgotten it was only remembered that some of the first notabilities of the state had come up from sacramento to attend the trial that one of the most eminent lawyers in san francisco had been engaged for the prisoner at a fee variously estimated from fifty to one hundred thousand dollars and that the celebrated colonel starbottle of siskiyou was to assist in the prosecution that a brisk duel of words and it was confidently hoped a later one of pistols would grow out of this forensic encounter that certain disclosures affecting men and women of high social standing were to be expected and finally that in some mysterious way a great political and sectional principle colonel starbottle was from the south and mr poinsett from the north was to be evolved and upheld during the trialthese were the absorbing fascinations to one horse gulch  at ten oclock gabriel accompanied by his counsel entered the courtroom followed by colonel starbottle judge boompointer entering at the same moment bowed distantly to arthur and familiarly to colonel starbottle in his otium off the bench he had been chaffed by the district attorney and had lost large sums at play with colonel starbottle nevertheless he was a trifle uneasy under the calmly critical eyes of the famous young advocate from san francisco arthur was too wise to exhibit his fastidiousness before the court nevertheless judge boompointer was dimly conscious that he would on that occasion have preferred that the clerk who sat below him had put on a cleaner shirt and himself refrained from taking off his cravat and collar as was his judicial habit on the wingdam circuit there was some slight prejudice on the part of the panel to this welldressed young lawyer which they were pleased to specify and define more particularly as his general airiness seeing which justice on the bench became more dignified and gazed severely at the panel and at arthur  in the selection of the jury there was some difficulty it was confidently supposed that the prisoners counsel would challenge the array on the ground of the recent vigilance excitement but public opinion was disappointed when the examination of the defence was confined to trivial and apparently purposeless inquiry into the nativity of the several jurors a majority of those accepted by the defence were men of southern birth and education colonel starbottle who as a representative of the peculiar chivalry of the south had always adopted this plan himself in cases where his client was accused of assault and battery or even homicide could not in respect to his favourite traditions object to it but when it was found that there were only two men of northern extraction on the jury and that not a few of them had been his own clients colonel starbottle thought he had penetrated the theory of the defence  i regret that colonel starbottles effort admirably characterised by the banner as one of the most scathing and juniuslike gems of legal rhetoric ever known to the californian bar has not been handed down to me in extenso substantially however it appeared that colonel starbottle had never before found himself in so peculiar so momentous soerdelicate a position a position sirerergentlemen fraught with the deepest social professionalererhe should not hesitate to say upon his own personal responsibility a position of the deepest political significance colonel starbottle was aware that this statement might be deprecatednay even assailed by some but he did not retract that statement certainly not in the presence of that jury in whose intelligent faces he sawerererjusticeinflexible justiceerermingled andermixed withwith chivalrous instinct and suffused with the characteristicererglow oferer i regret to add that at this supreme moment as the colonel was lightly waving away with his fat right hand the difficulties of rhetoric a sepulchral voice audible behind the jury suggested robinson county whisky as the origin of the phenomena the colonel hesitated to describe the judge smiled blandly and directed the deputy sheriff to preserve order the deputy obeyed the mandate by looking over into the crowd behind the jury and saying in an audible tone youd better dry up thar joe white or git out o that and the colonel undismayed proceeded he well understood the confidence placed by the defence in these gentlemen he had reason to believe that an attempt would be made to show that this homicide was committed in accordance with certainererprinciples held by honourable menthat the act was retributive and in defence of an invasion of domestic rights and the sanctity of wedlock but he should show them its fallacy he should show them that only a base pecuniary motive influenced the prisoner he should show themererthat the accused had placed himself firstly by his antecedent acts and secondly by the manner of the later act beyond the sympathies of honourable men he should show them a previous knowledge of certainererindiscretions on the part of the prisoners wife and a condonation by the prisoner of those indiscretions that effectually debarred the prisoner from the provisions of the code he should show an inartistic he must say even on his own personal responsibility a certain ungentlemanliness in the manner of the crime that refused to clothe it with theerergenerous mantle of chivalry the crime of which the prisoner was accused might haveererbeen committed by a chinaman or a nigger colonel starbottle did not wish to be misunderstood it was not in the presence oferbeauty the colonel paused drew out his handkerchief and gracefully waved it in the direction of the dusky manuela and the truculent salboth ladies acknowledging the courtesy as an especial and isolated tribute and exchanging glances of the bitterest hatredit is not gentlemen in the presence of an allsufficient and enthralling sex that i would seek to disparage their influence with man but i shall prove that this absorbingererpassion thisererdeliciousererfatal weakness that rules the warlike camp theererstately palace as well as theerercabin of the baseborn churl never touched the calculating soul of gabriel conroy look at him gentlemen look at him and say upon your oaths upon your experience as men of gallantry if he is a man to sacrifice himself for a woman look at him and say truly as men personally responsible for their opinions if he is a man to place himself in a position of peril through the blandishments ofererbeauty or sacrifice himself upon theereraltar of venus  every eye was turned upon gabriel and certainly at that moment he did not bear any striking resemblance to a sighing amintor or a passionate othello his puzzled serious face which had worn a look of apologetic sadness was suffused at this direct reference of the prosecution and the long heavy lower limbs which he had diffidently tucked away under his chair to reduce the elevation of his massive knees above the ordinary level of one of the courtroom chairs retired still further finding himself during the colonels rhetorical pause still the centre of local observation he slowly drew from his pocket a small comb and began awkwardly to comb his hair with an ineffective simulation of preoccupation and indifference  yes sir continued the colonel with that lofty forensic severity so captivating to the spectator you may comb yer hair hyar was the colonels pronunciation but yer cant comb it so as to make this intelligent jury believe that it is fresh from the hands ofererdelilah  the colonel then proceeded to draw an exceedingly poetical picture of the murdered ramireza native appealing to the sympathies of every southern man a native of the tropics impulsive warm and peculiarly susceptible as we all are gentlemen to the weaknesses of the heart the colonel would not dwell further upon this characteristic of the deceased there were within the sound of his voice visible to the sympathising eyes of the jury two beings who had divided his hearts holiest affectionstheir presence was more eloquent than words this man continued the colonel a representative of one of our oldest spanish familiesa family that recalled the days ofererthe cid and don johnthis man had been the victim at once of the arts of mrs conroy and the dastardly fears of gabriel conroy of the wiles of the woman and the stealthy steel of the man  colonel starbottle would show that personating the character and taking the name of grace conroy an absent sister of the accused mrs conroy then really madame devarges sought the professional aid of the impulsive and generous ramirez to establish her right to a claim then held by the accusedin fact wrongfully withheld from his own sister grace conroy that ramirez believing implicitly in the story of madame devarges with the sympathy of an overflowing nature gave her that aid until her marriage with gabriel exposed the deceit colonel starbottle would not characterise the motives of such a marriage it was apparent to the jury they were intelligent men and would detect the unhallowed combination of two confederates under the sacrament of a holy institution to deceive the trustful ramirez it was a nuptial feast at whicherermercury presided and notererhymen its only issue was fraud and murder having obtained possession of the property in a common interest it was necessary to remove the only witness of the fraud ramirez the wife found a willing instrument in the husband and how was the deed committed openly and in the presence of witnesses did gabriel even assume a virtue and under the pretext of an injured husband challenge the victim to the field of honour no no gentlemen look at the murderer and contrast his enormous bulk with theerslight graceful youthful figure of the victim and you will have an idea of theererenormity of the crime  after this exordium came the testimonyie facts coloured more or less unconsciously according to the honest prejudices of the observer his capacity to comprehend the fact he had observed and his disposition to give his theory regarding that fact rather than the fact itself and when the blind had testified to what they saw and the halt had stated where they walked and ran the prosecution rested with a flush of triumph  they had established severally that the deceased had died from the effects of a knife wound that gabriel had previously quarrelled with him and was seen on the hill within a few hours of the murder that he had absconded immediately after and that his wife was still a fugitive and that there was ample motive for the deed in the circumstances surrounding the prisoner  much of this was shaken on crossexamination the surgeon who made the autopsy was unable to say whether the deceased being consumptive might not have died from consumption that very night the witness who saw gabriel pushing the deceased along the road could not swear positively whether the deceased were not pulling gabriel instead and the evidence of mrs conroys imposture was hearsay only nevertheless bets were offered in favour of starbottle against poinsettthat being the form in which the interest of one horse gulch crystallised itself  when the prosecution rested mr poinsett as counsel for defence moved for the discharge of the prisoner no evidence having been shown of his having had any relations with or knowledge of the deceased until the day of the murder and none whatever of his complicity with the murderess against whom the evidence of the prosecution and the arguments of the learned prosecuting attorney were chiefly directed  motion overruled a sigh of relief went up from the spectators and the jury that any absurd technical objection should estop them from that fun which as lawabiding citizens they had a right to expect seemed oppressive and scandalous and when arthur rose to open for the defence it was with an instinctive consciousness that his audience were eyeing him as a man who had endeavoured to withdraw from a race  ridiculous as it seemed in reason it was enough to excite arthurs flagging interest and stimulate his combativeness with ready tact he fathomed the expectation of the audience and at once squarely joined issue with the colonel  mr poinsett differed from his learned friend in believing this case was at all momentous or peculiar it was a quite common onehe was sorry to say a very common onein the somewhat hasty administration of the law in california he was willing to admit a peculiarity in his eloquent brothers occupying the line of attack when his place was as clearly at his mr poinsetts side he should overlook some irregularities in the prosecution from this fact and from the natural confusion of a man possessing colonel starbottles quick sympathies who found himself arrayed against his principles he should however relieve them from that confusion by stating that there really was no principle involved beyond the common one of selfpreservation he was willing to admit the counsels ingenious theory that mrs conroywho was not mentioned in the indictment or indeed any other person not specifiedhad committed the deed for which his client was charged but as they were here to try gabriel conroy only he could not see the relevancy of the testimony to that fact he should content himself with the weakness of the accusation he should not occupy their time but should call at once to the stand the prisoner the man who the jury would remember was now against all legal precedent actually if not legally placed again in peril of his life in the very building which but a few days before had seen his danger and his escape  he should call gabriel conroy  there was a momentary sensation in the court gabriel uplifted his huge frame slowly and walked quietly toward the witnessbox his face slightly flushed under the halfcritical halfamused gaze of the spectators and those by whom he brushed as he made his way through the crowd noticed that his breathing was hurried but when he reached the box his face grew more composed and his troubled eyes presently concentrated their light fixedly upon colonel starbottle then the clerk mumbled the oath and he took his seat  what is your name asked arthur  i reckon ye mean my real name queried gabriel with a touch of his usual apology  yes certainly your real name sir replied arthur a little impatiently  colonel starbottle pricked up his ears and lifting his eyes met gabriels dull concentrated fires full in his own  gabriel then raised his eyes indifferently to the ceiling my real namemy genooine nameis johnny dumbledee jonny johnny dumbilde johnny dumbledee  there was a sudden thrill and then a stony silence arthur and maxwell rose to their feet at the same moment what said both those gentlemen sharply in one breath  johnny dumbledee repeated gabriel slowly and with infinite deliberation johnny dumbledee ez my real name i hev frequent he added turning around in easy confidence to the astonished judge boompointer i hev frequent allowed i was gabriel conroythe same not being the truth and the woman ez i marriedher name was grace conroy and the heap o lies ez thet old liar over thar

your honour and this yer court and you gentlmen was me     chapter vi  in rebuttal   the utter and complete astonishment created by gabriels reply was so generally diffused that the equal participation of gabriels own counsel in this surprise was unobserved maxwell would have risen again hurriedly but arthur laid his hand on his shoulder  the man his gone clean madthis is suicide whispered maxwell excitedly we must get him off the stand you must explain  hush said arthur quietly not a word show any surprise and were lost  in another instant all eyes were fixed upon arthur who had remained standing outwardly calm there was but one idea dominant in the audience what revelation would the next question bring the silence became almost painful as arthur quietly and selfcontainedly glanced around the courtroom and at the jury as if coolly measuring the effect of a carefullyplanned dramatic sensation then when every neck was bent forward and every ear alert arthur turned nonchalantly yet gracefully to the bench  we have no further questions to ask your honour he said quietly and sat down  the effect of this simple natural and perfectly consistent action was tremendous in the various triumphs of arthurs successful career he felt that he had never achieved as universal and instantaneous popularity gabriel was forgotten the man who had worked up this sensationa sensation whose darkly mysterious bearing upon the case no one could fathom or even fared to fathom but a sensation that each man confidently believed held the whole secret of the crimethis man was the hero had it been suggested the jury would have instantly given a verdict for this heros client without leaving their seats the betting was two to one on arthur i beg to observe that i am writing of men impulsive natural and unfettered in expression and action by any tradition of logic or artificial lawa class of beings much idealised by poets and occasionally i believe exalted by latterday philosophers  judge boompointer looked at colonel starbottle that gentleman completely stunned and mystified by the conduct of the defence fumbled his papers coughed expanded his chest rose

prisoner used his left hand efery dime  dr pressnitz recalled viewed the body at nine oclock on the 16th the bloodstains on the linen and the body had been slightly obliterated and diluted with water as if they had been subjected to a watery application there was an unusually heavy dew at seven oclock that evening not later has kept a meteorological record for the last three years is of the opinion that this saturation might be caused by dew falling on a clot of coagulated blood the same effect would not be noticeable on a freshly bleeding wound the hygrometer showed no indication of a later fall of dew the night was windy and boisterous after eight oclock with no humidity is of the opinion that the body as seen by him first assumed its position before eight oclock would not swear positively that the deceased expired before that time would swear positively that the wounds were not received after eight oclock from the position of the wound should say it was received while the deceased was in an upright position and the arm raised as if in struggling from the course of the wound should say it could not have been dealt from the left hand of an opponent on the cross examination dr pressnitz admitted that many socalled lefthanded men were really ambidexterous was of the opinion that perspiration would not have caused the saturation of the dead mans linen the saturation was evidently after deaththe blood had clotted dr pressnitz was quite certain that a dead man did not perspire  the defence rested amid a profound sensation colonel starbottle who had recovered his jaunty spirits apparently influenced by his animated and gallant conversation with the veiled female rose upon his short stubby feet and withdrawing his handkerchief from his breast laid it upon the table before him then carefully placing the ends of two white pudgy fingers upon it colonel starbottle gracefully threw his whole weight upon their tips and leaning elegantly toward the veiled figure called grace conroy  the figure arose slight graceful elegant hesitated a moment and then slipped a lissom shadow through the crowd as a trout glides through a shallow and before the swaying moving mass had settled to astonished rest stood upon the witnessstand then with a quick dexterous movement she put aside the veil that after the spanish fashion was both bonnet and veil and revealed a face so exquisitely beautiful and gracious that even manuela and sal were awed into speechless admiration she took the oath with downcast lids whose sweeping fringes were so perfect that this very act of modesty seemed to the two female critics as the most artistic coquetry and then raised her dark eyes and fixed them upon gabriel  colonel starbottle waved his hand with infinite gallantry  what iseryour name  grace conroy  have you a brother by the name of gabriel conroy  i have  look around the court and see if you can recognise him  the witness with her eyes still fixed on gabriel pointed him out with her gloved finger i do he is there  the prisoner at the bar  yes  he is gabriel conroy  he is  how long is it since you have seen him  six years  where did you see him last and under what circumstances  at starvation camp in the sierras i left there to get help for him and my sister  and you have never seen him since  never  are you aware that among theererunfortunates who perished a body that was alleged to be yours was identified  yes  can you explain that circumstance  yes when i left i wore a suit of boys clothes i left my own garments for mrs peter dumphy one of our party it was her body clothed in my garments that was identified as myself  have you any proof of that fact other than your statement  yes mr peter dumphy the husband of mrs dumphy my brother gabriel conroy and  may it please the court the voice was arthur poinsetts cool quiet and languidly patient may it please the court we of the defenceto save your honour and the jury some time and troubleare willing to admit this identification of our client as gabriel conroy and the witness without further corroboration than her own word as his sister your honour and the gentlemen of the jury will not fail to recognise in the evidence of our client as to his own name and origin a rash foolish and on behalf of myself and my colleague i must add unadvised attempt to save the reputation of the wife he deeply loves from the equally unadvised and extraneous evidence brought forward by the prosecution but we must insist your honour that all this is impertinent to the real issue the killing of victor ramirez by john doe alias gabriel conroy admitting the facts just testified to by the witness grace conroy we have no cross examination to make  the fact of the witness which had been pale and selfpossessed flushed suddenly as she turned her eyes upon arthur poinsett but that selfcontained scamp retained an unmoved countenance as at judge boompointers unusually gracious instruction that the witness might retire grace conroy left the stand to a question from the court colonel starbottle intimated that he should offer no further evidence in rebuttal  may it please the court said arthur quietly if we accept the impeachment by a sister of a brother on trial for his life without comment or cross examination it is because we are confidentlegally confidentof showing the innocence of that brother by other means recognising the fact that this trial is not for the identification of the prisoner under any name or alias but simply upon the issue of the fact whether he did or did not commit murder upon the body of victor ramirez as specified in the indictment we now waiving all other issues prepare to prove his innocence by a single witness that this witness was not produced earlier was unavoidable that his testimony was not outlined in the opening was due to the fact that only within the last halfhour had he been within the reach of the mandate of this court he would call henry perkins  there was a slight stir among the spectators by the door as they made way to a quaint figure that clad in garments of a bygone fashion with a pale wrinkled yellow face and grey hair from which the dye had faded stepped upon the stand  is a translator of spanish and searcher of deeds to the land commission is called an expert recognises the prisoner at the bar saw him only once two days before the murder in passing over conroys hill he was sitting on the doorstep of a deserted cabin with a little girl by his side saw the deceased twice once when he came to don pedros house in san francisco to arrange for the forgery of a grant that should invalidate one already held by the prisoners wife saw the deceased again after the forgery on conroys hill engaged in conversation with the prisoners wife deceased appeared to be greatly excited and suddenly drew a knife and made an attack upon the prisoners wife witness reached forward and interposed in defence of the woman when the deceased turned upon him in a paroxysm of insane rage and a struggle took place between them for the possession of the knife witness calling for help witness did not succeed in wresting the knife from the hands of deceased it required all his strength to keep himself from bodily harm in the midst of the struggle witness heard steps approaching and again called for help  the witness call was responded to by a voice in broken english unintelligible to witness apparently the voice of a chinaman at the sound of the voice and the approach of footsteps the deceased broke from witness and running backward a few steps plunged the knife into his own breast and fell witness ran to his side and again called for help deceased turned upon him with a ghastly smile and said bring any one here and ill accuse you before them of my murder deceased did not speak again but fell into a state of insensibility witness became alarmed reflecting upon the threat of the deceased and did not go for help while standing irresolutely by the body mrs conroy the prisoners wife came upon him confessed to her the details just described and the threat of the deceased she advised the instant flight of the witness and offered to go with him herself witness procured a horse and buggy from a livery stable and at halfpast nine at night took mrs conroy from the hillside near the road where she was waiting drove to markleville that night where he left her under an assumed name and came alone to san francisco and the mission of san antonio here he learned from the last witness the prisoners sister grace conroy of the arrest of her brother for murder witness at once returned to one horse gulch only to find the administration of justice in the hands of a vigilance committee feeling that his own life might be sacrificed without saving the prisoners he took refuge in a tunnel on conroys hill it chanced to be the same tunnel which gabriel conroy and his friend afterwards sought in escaping from the vigilance committee after the earthquake witness during the absence of gabriel made himself known to mr jack hamlin gabriels friend and comrade in flight and assured him of the witnesss intention to come forward whenever a fair trial could be accorded to gabriel after the rearrest and bailing of gabriel witness returned to san francisco to procure evidence regarding the forged grant and proofs of ramirezs persecution of mrs conroy had brought with him the knife and had found the cutler who sold it to deceased eight months before when deceased first meditated an assault on mrs conroy objected to and objection overruled by a deeply interested and excited court  that is all said arthur  colonel starbottle seated beside grace conroy did not for a moment respond to the impatient eyes of the audience in the hush that followed it was not until grace conroy whispered a few words in his ear that the gallant colonel lifted his dilated breast and selfcomplacent face above the level of the seated counsel  whatererwas the reasonwhy did theererdeeply anxious wife who fled with you and thus precipitated the arrest of her husbandwhy did not she return with you to clear him from suspicion why does she remain absent  she was taken illdangerously ill at markleville the excitement and fatigue of the journey had brought on premature confinement a child was born  there was a sudden stir among the group beside the prisoners chair colonel starbottle with a hurried glance at grace conroy waved his hand toward the witness and sat down arthur poinsett rose we ask a moments delay your honour the prisoner has fallen in a fit     chapter vii  a family greeting   when gabriel opened his eyes to consciousness he was lying on the floor of the jury room his head supported by olly and a slight graceful womanly figure that had been apparently bending over him in the act of slowly withdrawing from his awakening gaze it was his sister grace  thar youre better now said olly taking her brothers hand and quietly ignoring her sister on whom gabriels eyes were still fixed try and raise yourself inter this chair tharthar nowthats a good old gabethar i reckon youre more comfortable  its gracey whispered gabriel hoarsely with his eyes still fixed upon the slight elegantly dressed woman who now leaning against the doorway stood coldly regarding him its graceyyour sister olly  ef you mean the woman who hez been tryin her best to swar away your life and kem here allowin to do itshe aint no sister o minenot added olly with a withering glance at the simple elegance of her sisters attire not even ef she does trapse in yer in frills and tuckersmore shame for her  if you mean said grace coldly the girl whose birthright you took away by marrying the woman who stole it if you mean the girl who rightfully bears the name that you denied under oath in the very shadow of the gallows she claims nothing of you but her name  thets so said gabriel simply he dropped his head between his great hands and a sudden tremor shook his huge frame  ye aint goin to be driv inter histeriks agin along o that crockidill said olly bending over her brother in alarm dont yedont ye cry gabe whimpered olly as a few drops oozed between gabriels fingers dont ye take on darling afore her  the two sisters glared at each other over the helpless man between them then another woman entered who looked sympathetically at gabriel and then glared at them both it was mrs markle at which happily for gabriel the family bickering ceased  its all over gabriel youre clar said mrs markle ignoring the sympathies as well as the presence of the two other ladies heres mr poinsett  he entered quickly but stopped and flushed slightly under the cold eyes of grace conroy but only for a moment coming to gabriels side he said kindly gabriel i congratulate you the acting district attorney has entered a nolle prosequi and you are discharged  ye mean i kin go said gabriel suddenly lifting his face  yes you are as free as air  and ez to her asked gabriel quickly  who do you mean replied arthur involuntarily glancing in the direction of grace whose eyes dropped scornfully before him  my wifejulyis she clar too  as far as this trial is concerned yes returned arthur with a trifle less interest in his voice which gabriel was quick to discern  then ill go said gabriel rising to his feet he made a few steps to the door and then hesitated stopped and turned toward grace as he did so his old apologetic troubled diffident manner returned  yell exkoos me miss he said looking with troubled eyes upon his newlyfound sister yell exkoos me ef i havent the time now to do the agreeable and show ye over yer property on conroys hill but its thar its all thar ez lawyer maxwell kin testify its all thar and the house is open ez it always was to ye ez the young woman who keeps the house kin tell ye id go thar with ye ef i hed time but im startin out now tonight to see july to see my wife miss conroy to see july ez is expectin and i reckon tharll be a babya pore little helpless newborn babyony so long added gabriel exhibiting his forefinger as a degree of mensuration and ez a fammerly man being ladies i reckon you reckon i oughter be thar i grieve to state that at this moment the ladies appealed to exchanged a glance of supreme contempt and am proud to record that lawyer maxwell and mr poinsett exhibited the only expression of sympathy with the speaker that was noticeable in the group  arthur detected it and said i fear none the less readily for that knowledge  dont let us keep you gabriel we understand your feelings go at once  take me along gabe said olly flashing her eyes at her sister and then turning to gabriel with a quivering upper lip  gabriel turned swooped his tremendous arm around olly lifted her bodily off her feet and saying youre my own little girl vanished through the doorway  this movement reduced the group to mrs markle and grace conroy confronted by mr poinsett and maxwell mrs markle relieved an embarrassing silence by stepping forward and taking the arm of lawyer maxwell and leading him away arthur and grace were left alone  for the first time in his life arthur lost his readiness and selfcommand he glanced awkwardly at the woman before him and felt that neither conventional courtesy nor vague sentimental recollection would be effective here  i am waiting for my maid said grace coldly if as you return to the courtroom you will send her here you will oblige me  arthur bowed confusedly  your maid  yes you know her i think mr poinsett continued grace lifting her arched brows with cold surprise manuela  arthur turned pale and red he was conscious of being not only awkward but ridiculous  pardon meperhaps i am troubling youi will go myself said grace contemptuously  one moment miss conroy said arthur instinctively stepping before her as she moved as if to pass him one moment i beg he paused and then said with less deliberation and more impulsively than had been his habit for the last six years you will perhaps be more forgiving to your brother if you know that i who have had the pleasure of meeting you sinceyou were lost to us alli who have not had his preoccupation of interest in anothereven i have been as blind as foolish as seemingly heartless as he you will remember this miss conroyi hope quite as much for its implied compliment to your complete disguise and an evidence of the success of your own endeavours to obliterate your identity as for its being an excuse for your brothers conduct if not for my own i did not know you  grace conroy paused and raised her dark eyes to his  you spoke of my brothers preoccupation withwith the woman for whom

blocking up the way with a general expansiveness of demeanour ged sir this is not all you will remember that our recent interview in san francisco was regarding another and a different issue that sir

that claim of my client falls to the ground you may state to your client mr poinsett thatererupon my own personal responsibility i abandon the claim  arthur poinsett stopped and looked fixedly at the gallant colonel even in his sentimental preoccupation the professional habit triumphed  you withdraw mrs dumphys claim upon mr dumphy he said slowly  colonel starbottle did not verbally reply but that gallant warrior allowed the facial muscles on the left side of his face to relax so that one eye was partially closed  yes sirthere is a matter of a few thousand dollars thatereryou understand i amererpersonally responsible for  that will never be claimed colonel starbottle said arthur smiling and i am only echoing i am sure the sentiments of the man most concerned who is approaching usmr

such lightheartedness and levity toward his patient such captiousness toward pete with an occasional seriousness of demeanour when he was alone that to those who knew him it was equal to an unfavourable prognosis indeed he evaded the direct questioning of olly who had lately constituted herself a wondrously lightfooted softhanded assistant of pete until one day when they were alone he asked more seriously than was his wont if mr hamlin had ever spoken of his relations or if she knew of any of his friends who were accessible  olly had already turned this subject over in her womanly mind and had thought once or twice of writing to the blue moselle but on the direct questioning of the doctor and its peculiar significance she recalled jacks confidences on their midnight ride and the spanish beauty he had outlined and so one evening when she was alone with her patient and the fever was low and jack lay ominously patient and submissive she beganwhat the doctor had only lately abandonedprobing a halfhealed wound  i reckon youd hev been a heap more comfortable ef this thing hed happened to ye down thar in san antonio said olly  jack rolled his dark eyes wonderingly upon his fair persecutor  you know youd hev had thet thar sweetheart o yoursthet mexican womansittin by ye instead o meand pete suggested the artful olympia  jack nearly leaped from the bed  do you reckon id hev rung myself in as a wandering cripplea tramp thet hed got pepperedon a lady like her look yer olly continued mr hamlin raising himself on his elbow if youve got the idea thet thet woman is one of them hospital sharpsone of them angels who waltz round a sick man with a bottle of camphor in one hand and a tract in the otheryou had better disabuse your mind of it at once miss conroy take a back seat and wait for a new deal and dont you go to talkin of thet lady as my sweetheartitsitssacrilegiousand the meanest kind of a bluff  as the day of the trial drew near mr hamlin had expressed but little interest in it and had evidently only withheld his general disgust of gabriels weakness from consideration of his sister once mr hamlin condescended to explain his apparent coldness  theres a witness coming olly thatll clear your brothermore shame for himthe man ez did kill ramirez im keeping my sympathies for that chap dont you be alarmed if that man dont come up to the scratch i will sodont you go whining round and ef youll take my advice youll keep clear o that court and let them lawyers fight it out it will be time enough for you to go when they send for me  but you cant moveyou aint strong enough said olly  i reckon pete will get me there some way if he has to pack me on his back i aint a heavy weight now said jack looking sadly at his thin white hands ive reckoned on that and even if i should pass in my checks theres an affidavit already sworn to in maxwells hands  nevertheless on the day of the trial olly still doubtful of gabriel and still mindful of his capacity to develop godforsaken mulishness was nervous and uneasy until a messenger arrived from maxwell with a note to hamlin carrying the tidings of the appearance of perkins in court and closing with a request for ollys presence  whos perkins asked olly as she reached for her hat in nervous excitement  hes no slouch said jack sententiously dont ask questions its all right with gabriel now he added assuringly hes as good as clear run away miss conroy hold up a minit there kiss me look here olly saydo you take any stock in that lost sister of yours that your fool of a brother is always gabbing about you do well you are as big a fool as he there therenever mind nowshes turned up at last much good may it do you one twogo and as ollys pink ribbons flashed through the doorway mr hamlin lay down again with a twinkle in his eye  he was alone the house was very quiet and still most of the guests and the hostess and her assistant were at the allabsorbing trial even the faithful pete unconscious of any possible defection of his assistant olly had taken the opportunity to steal away to hear the arguments of counsel as the retreating footsteps of olly echoed along the vacant corridor he felt that he possessed the house completely  this consciousness to a naturally active man bored by illness and the continuous presence of attendants however kind and devoted was at first a relief mr hamlin experienced an instant desire to get up and dress himself to do various things which were forbiddenbut which now an overruling providence had apparently placed within his reach he rose with great difficulty and a physical weakness that seemed altogether inconsistent with the excitement he was then feeling and partially dressed himself then he was suddenly overtaken with great faintness and vertigo and struggling to the open window fell in a chair beside it the cool breeze revived him for a moment and he tried to rise but found it impossible then the faintness and vertigo returned and he seemed to be slipping away somewherenot altogether unpleasantly nor against his volitionsomewhere where there was darkness and stillness and rest and then he slipped back almost instantly as it seemed to him to a room full of excited and anxious people all extravagantly and as he thought ridiculously concerned about himself he tried to assure them that he was all right and not feeling any worse for his exertion but was unable to make them understand him then followed night replete with pain and filled with familiar voices that spoke unintelligibly and then day devoted to the monotonous repetition of the last word or phrase that the doctor or pete or olly had used or the endless procession of ollys pink ribbons and the tremulousness of a window curtain or the black sphinxlike riddle of a pattern on the bedquilt or the wallpaper then there was sleep that was turbulent and conscious and wakefulness that was lethargic and dim and then infinite weariness and then lapses of utter vacuitythe occasional ominous impinging of the shadow of death  but through this chaos there was always a dominant central figurea figure partly a memory and as such surrounded by consistent associations partly a reality and incongruous with its surroundingsthe figure of donna dolores but whether this figure came back to mr hamlin out of the dusky arches of the mission church in a cloud of incense besprinkling him with holy water or whether it bent over him touching his feverish lips with cool drinks or smoothing his pillow a fact utterly unreal and preposterous seen against the pattern of the wallpaper or sitting on the familiar chair by his bedsideit was always there and when one day the figure stayed longer and the interval of complete consciousness seemed more protracted mr hamlin with one mighty effort moved his lips and said feebly  donna dolores  the figure started leaned its beautiful face blushing a celestial rosy red above his own put its finger to its perfect lips and said in plain english  hush i am gabriel conroys sister     chapter ix  in which mr hamlin passes   with his lips sealed by the positive mandate of the lovely spectre mr hamlin resigned himself again to weakness and sleep when he awoke olly was sitting by his bedside the dusky figure of pete spectacled and reading a good book was dimly outlined against the windowbut that was all the visionif vision it washad fled  olly said mr hamlin faintly  yes said olly opening her eyes in expectant sympathy  how long have i been dri mean how long has thisspell lasted  three days said olly  the  you say a humane and possibly weak consideration for mr hamlin in his new weakness and suffering restricts me to a mere outline of his extravagance of speech  but youre better now supplemented olly  mr hamlin began to wonder faintly if his painful experience of the last twentyfour hours were a part of his convalsecence he was silent for a few moments and then suddenly turned his face toward olly  didnt you say something aboutaboutyour sister the other day  yesshes got back said olly curtly  here  here  well said mr hamlin a little impatiently  well returned olly with a slight toss of her curls shes got back and i reckon its about time she did  strange to say ollys evident lack of appreciation of her sister seemed to please mr hamlinpossibly because it agreed with his own idea of graces superiority and his inability to recognise or accept her as the sister of gabriel  where has she been all this while asked jack rolling his large hollow eyes over olly  goodness knows says shes bin livin in some fammerly down in the southspanish i reckon thets whar she gits those airs and graces  has she ever been herein this room asked mr hamlin  of course she has said olly when i left you to go with gabe to see his wife at wingdam she volunteered to take my place thet waz while you waz flighty mr hamlin but i reckon she admired to stay here on account of seein her bo  her what asked mr hamlin feeling the blood fast rushing to his colourless face  her bo repeated olly thet thar ashley or poinsettor whatever he calls hisself now  mr hamlin here looked so singular and his hand tightened so strongly around ollys that she hurriedly repeated to him the story of graces early wanderings and her absorbing passion for their former associate arthur poinsett the statement was in ollys present state of mind not favourable to grace and she just came up yer only to see arthur agin thets all and she nearly swearin her brothers life awayand pretendin it was only done to save the fammerly name jest ez if it hed been any more comfortable fur gabriel to have been hung in his own name and then goin and accusin thet innocent ole lamb gabe of conspiring with july to take her name away purty goins on i reckon and thet man poinsett by her own showinnever lettin on to see her nor usnor anybody and she sassin me for givin my opinion of himand excusin him by sayin she didnt want him to know whar she was and she refusin to see july at alland pore july lyin thar at wingdam sick with a new baby dont talk to me about her  but your sister didnt run away withwiththis chap she went away to bring you help interrupted jack hastily dragging olly back to earlier history  did she couldnt she trust her bo to go and get help and then come back fur herreckonin he cared for her at all no she waz thet crazy after him she couldnt trust him outer her sightand she left the camp and gabe and me for him and then the idee of her talking to gabriel about bein disgraced by july ez ef she had never done anythin to spile her own name and puttin on such airs and  dry up shouted mr hamlin turning with sudden savageness upon his pillow dry updont you see youre driving me halfcrazy with your infernal buzzing he paused as olly stopped in mingled mortification and alarm and then added in milder tones there thatll do i am not feeling well today send dr duchesne to me if hes here stop one momentthere goodbye go  olly had risen promptly there was always something in mr hamlins positive tones that commanded an obedience that she would have refused to any other thoroughly convinced of some important change in mr hamlins symptoms she sought the doctor at once perhaps she brought with her some of her alarm and anxiety for a moment later that distinguished physician entered with less deliberation than was his habit he walked to the bedside of his patient and would have taken his hand but jack slipped his telltale pulse under the covers and looking fixedly at the doctor said  can i be moved from here  you can but i should hardly advise  i didnt ask that this is a lone hand im playin doctor and if im euchred taint your fault how soon  i should say said dr duchesne with professional caution that if no bad symptoms supervene he made here a half habitual but wholly ineffectual dive for jacks pulse you might go in a week  i must go now  dr duchesne bent over his patient he was a quick as well as a patiently observing man and he saw something in jacks face that no one else had detected seeing this he said you can go now at a great riskthe risk of your life  ill take it said mr hamlin promptly ive been playin agin odds he added with a faint but audacious smile for the last six months and its no time to draw out now go on tell pete to pack up and get me ready  where are you going asked the doctor quietly still gazing at his patient  toblank said mr hamlin impulsively then recognising the fact that in view of his having travelling companions some more definite and practicable locality was necessary he paused a moment and said to the mission of san antonio  very well said the doctor gravely  strange to say whether from the doctors medication or from the stimulus of some reserved vitality hitherto unsuspected mr hamlin from that moment rallied the preparations for his departure were quickly made and in a few hours he was ready for the road  i dont want to have anybody cacklin around me he said in deprecation of any leavetaking i leave the board they can go on with the game  notwithstanding which at the last moment gabriel hung awkwardly and heavily around the carriage in which the invalid was seated  id foller arter ye mr hamlin in a buggy he interpolated in gentle deprecation of his unwieldy and difficult bulk but im sorter kept yer with my wifewho is powerful weak along of a pore small babyabout so longthe same not bein a fammerly man yourself you dont kinder get the hang of i thought it might please ye to know that i got bail yesterday for thet mr perkinsez didnt kill that thar ramirezthe same havin killed hisselfez waz fetched out on the trial which i reckon ye didnt get to hear i admire to see ye lookin so well mr hamlin and im glad ollys goin with ye i reckon grace would hev gone too but shes sorter skary about strangers hevin bin engaged these seving years to a young man by the name o poinsett ez waz one o my counsel and hevin lately had a row with the sameone o them lovers fightswhich bein a young man yourself ye kin kindly allow for  drive on imprecated mr hamlin furiously to the driver what are you waiting for and with the whirling wheels gabriel dropped off apologetically in a cloud of dust and mr hamlin sack back exhaustedly on the cushions  notwithstanding as he increased his distance from one horse gulch his spirits seemed to rise and by the time they had reached san antonio he had recovered his old audacity and dash of manner and raised the highest hopes in the breast of everybody buthis doctor yet that gentleman after a careful examination of his patient one night said privately to pete i think this exaltation will last about three days longer i am going to san francisco at the end of that time i shall returnunless you telegraph to me before that he parted gaily from his patient and seriously from everybody else before he left he sought out padre felipe i have a patient here in a critical condition said the doctor the hotel is no place for him is there any family hereany house that will receive him under your advice for a week at the end of that time he will be better or beyond our ministration he is not a protestanthe is nothing you have had experience with the heathen father felipe  father felipe looked at dr duchesne the doctors wellearned professional fame had penetrated even san antonio the doctors insight and intelligence were visible in his manner and touched the jesuit instantly it is a strange case my son a sad case he said thoughtfully i will see  he did the next day under the direction of father felipe mr hamlin was removed to the rancho of the blessed fisherman and notwithstanding the fact that its hostess was absent was fairly installed as its guest when mrs sepulvida returned from her visit to san francisco she was at first astonished then excited and then i fear gratified  for she at once recognised in this guest of father felipe the mysterious stranger whom she had some weeks ago detected on the plains of the blessed trinity and jack despite his illness was still handsome and had moreover the melancholy graces of invalidism which go far with an habitually ailing sex and so she coddled mr hamlin and gave him her sacred hammock by day over the porch and her best bedroom at night and then at the close of a pleasant day she said archly  i think i have seen you before mr hamlinat the rancho of the blessed trinity you rememberthe house of donna dolores  mr hamlin was too observant of the sex to be impertinently mindful of another woman than his interlocutor and assented with easy indifference  donna maria now thoroughly convinced that mr hamlins attentions on that eventful occasion were intended for herself and even delightfully suspicious of some prearranged plan in his present situation poor donna dolores you know we have lost her for ever  mr hamlin asked when  that dreadful earthquake on the 8th  mr hamlin reflecting that the appearance of grace conroy was on the 10th assented again abstractly  ah yes so sad and yet perhaps for the best you know the poor girl had a hopeless passion for her legal adviserthe famous arthur poinsett ah you did not well perhaps it was only merciful that she died before she knew how insincere that mans attentions were you are a believer in special providences mr hamlin  mr hamlin doubtfully you mean a run of luck  donna maria rapidly ignoring mr hamlins illustration well perhaps i have reason to say so poor donna dolores was my friend yet would you believe there were peopleyou know how ridiculous is the gossip of a town like thisthere are people who believed that he was paying attention to me  mrs sepulvida hung her head archly there was a long pause then mr hamlin called faintly  pete  yes mars jack  aint it time to take that medicine  when dr duchesne returned he ignored all this little byplay and even the anxious inquiries of olly and said to mr hamlin  have you any objection to my sending for dr mackintosha devilish clever fellow  and mr hamlin had none and so after a private telegram dr mackintosh arrived and for three or four hours the two doctors talked in an apparently unintelligible language chiefly about a person whom mr hamlin was satisfied did not exist and when dr mackintosh left dr duchesne after a very earnest conversation with him on their way to the stage office drew a chair beside mr hamlins bed  jack  yes sir  have you got everything fixedall right  yes sir  jack  yes sir  youve made pete very happy this morning  jack looked up at dr duchesnes critical face and the doctor went on gravely  confessing religion to himsaying you believed as he did  a faint laugh glimmered in the dark hollows of jacks eyes  the old man he said explanatory has been preachin mighty heavy at me ever since tother doctor came and i reckoned it might please him to allow that everything he said was so you see the old mans bin right soft on me and between us doctor i aint much to give him in exchange its no square game  then you believe youre going to die said the doctor gravely  i reckon  and you have no directions to give me  theres a black hound at sacramentojim briggs who borrowed and never gave back my silvermounted derringers that i reckoned to give to you tell him hed better give them up or ill  jack interrupted dr duchesne with infinite gentleness laying his hand on the invalids arm you must not think of me  jack pressed his friends hand  theres my diamond pin up the spout at wingdam and the money gone to lawyer maxwell to pay witnesses for that old fool gabriel and then when gabriel and me was escaping i happened to strike the very man perkins who was gabriels principal witness and he was dead broke and i had to give him my solitaire ring to help him get away and be on hand for gabriel and ollys got my gold specimen to be made into a mug for that cub of that old she tigergabriels womanthat madame devarges and my watchwho has got my watch said mr hamlin reflectively  never mind those things jack have you any word to sendtoanybody  no  there was a long pause in the stillness the ticking of a clock on the mantel became audible then there was a laugh in the anteroom where a professional brother of jacks had been waiting slightly under the influence of grief and liquor  scotty ought to know better than to kick up a row in a decent womans house whispered jack faintly tell him to dry up or ill  but his voice was failing him and the sentence remained incomplete  doc after a long effort  jack  dontletonto petei fooledhim  no jack  they were both still for several minutes and then dr duchesne softly released his hand and laid that of his patient white and thin upon the coverlid before him then he rose gently and opened the door of the anteroom two or three eager faces confronted him pete he said gravely i want peteno one else  the old negro entered with a trembling step and then catching sight of the white face on the pillow he uttered one crya cry replete with all the hysterical pathos of his race and ran and dropped on his knees besideit and then the black and the white face were near together and both were wet with tears  dr duchesne stepped forward and would have laid his hand gently upon the old servants shoulder but he stopped for suddenly both of the black hands were lifted wildly in the air and the black face with rapt eyeballs turned toward the ceiling as if they had caught sight of the steadfast blue beyond perhaps they had  o de lord god whose prechiss blood washes de brack sheep and de white sheep all de one colour o de lamb ob god sabe sabe dis por dis por boy o lord god for my sake o de lord god dow knowst fo twenty years pete ole pete has walked in dy wayshas found de lord and him crucifiedand has been dy servant o de lord godo de bressed lord ef its all de same to you let all dat go fo nowt let ole pete go and send down dy mercy and forgiveness fo him     chapter x  in the old cabin again   there was little difficulty in establishing the validity of grace conroys claim to the conroy grant under the bequest of dr devarges her identity was confirmed by mr dumphynone the less readily that it relieved him of a distressing doubt about the late mrs dumphy and did not affect his claim to the mineral discovery which he had purchased from gabriel and his wife it was true that since the dropping of the lead the mine had been virtually abandoned and was comparatively of little market value but mr dumphy still clung to the hope that the missing lead would be discovered  he was right it was some weeks after the death of mr hamlin that gabriel and olly stood again beneath the dismantled rooftree and bare walls of his old cabin on conroy hill but the visit this time was not one of confidential disclosure nor lonely contemplation but with a practical view of determining whether this first home of the brother and sister could be repaired and made habitable for gabriel had steadily refused the solicitations of grace that he should occupy his more recent mansion mrs conroy and infant were at the hotel  thar olly said gabriel i reckon that a cartload o boards and a few days work with willin hands will put that thar shanty back agin ez it used to be when you and me waz childun  yes said olly abstractedly  weve had good times yer olly you and me  yes said olly with eyes still afar  gabriel looked downa great wayon his sister and then suddenly took her hand and sat down upon the doorstep drawing her between his knees after the old fashion  ye aint hearkenin to me olly dear  whereat miss olympia instantly and illogically burst into tears and threw her small arms about gabriels huge bulk she had been capricious and fretful since mr hamlins death and it may be that she embraced the dead man again in her brothers arms hut her outward expression was gracey i was thinking o poor gracey gabe  then said gabriel with intense archness and cunning you was thinkin o present kempany for ef i aint blind thats them coming up the hill  there were two figures slowly coming up the hill outlined against the rosy sunset a man and womanarthur poinsett and grace conroy olly lifted her head and rose to her feet they approached nearer no one spoke the next instantimpulsively i admit inconsistently i protestthe sisters were in each others arms the two men looked at each other awkward reticent superior  then the women having made quick work of it the two men were treated to an equally illogical inconsistent embrace when grace at last crying and laughing released gabriels neck from her sweet arms mr poinsett assumed the masculine attitude of pure reason  now that you have found your sister permit me to introduce you to my wife he said to gabriel taking graces hand in his own  whereat olly flew into poinsetts arms and gave him a fraternal and conciliatory kiss tableau  you dont look like a bride said the practical olly to mrs poinsett under her breath you aint got no veil no orange blossomsand that black dress  weve been married seven years olly said the quickeared and readywitted arthur  and then these people began to chatter as if they had always been in the closest confidence and communion  you know said grace to her brother arthur and i are going east to the states tomorrow and really gabe he says he will not leave here until you consent to take back your houseyour wifes house gabe you know we there was a tremendous significance in this newlyfound personal plural we have deeded it all to you  i hev a dooty to perform to gracey said gabriel conroy with astute deliberation looking at mr poinsett a dooty to thet gal thet must be done afore any transfer of this yer proputty is made i hev to make restitution of certain papers ez hez fallen casooally into my hands this yer paper he added drawing a soiled yellow envelope from his pocket kem to me a week ago the same hevin lied in the express office sens the trial it belongs to gracey i reckon and i hands it to her  grace tore open the envelope glanced at its contents hurriedly uttered a slight cry of astonishment blushed and put the paper into her pocket  this yer paper continued gabriel gravely drawing another from his blouse was found by me in the empire tunnel the night i was runnin from the lynchers it likewise blongs to graceyand the world ginrally its the record of dr devarges fust discovery of the silver lead on this yer hill and continued gabriel with infinite gravity wipes out so to speak this yer mineral right o me and mr dumphy and the stockholders ginrally  it was mr poinsetts turn to take the paper from gabriels hands he examined it attentively by the fading light that is so he said earnestly it is quite legal and valid  and thar ez one paper more continued gabriel this time putting his hand in his bosom and drawing out a buckskin purse from which he extracted a manyfolded paper its the grant that dr devarges gave gracey thet thet pore mexican ramirez ezmaybe ye may rememberwaz killed handed to my wife and july my wifesaid gabriel with a prodigious blushhez been sorter keepin in trust for gracey  he gave the paper to arthur who received it but still retained a warm grasp of gabriels massive hand  and now added gabriel ets gettin late and i reckon ets about the square thing ef wed adjourn this yer meeting to the hotel and ez youre goin away maybe yed make a partin visit with yer wife forgettin and forgivin like to mrs conroy and the babya pore little thingthat ye wouldnt believe it mr poinsett looks like me  but olly and grace had drawn aside and were in the midst of an animated conversation and grace was saying  so i took the stone from the fire just as i take this she picked up a fragment of the crumbling chimney before her it looked black and burnt just like this and i rubbed it hard on the blanket so and it shone just like silver and dr devarges said  we are going grace interrupted her husband we are going to see gabriels wife grace hesitated a moment but as her husband took her arm he slightly pressed it with a certain matrimonial caution whereupon with a quick impulsive gesture grace held out her hand to olly and the three gaily followed the bowed figure of gabriel as he strode through the darkening woods     chapter xi  the return of a footprint   i regret that no detailed account of the reconciliatory visit to mrs conroy has been handed down and i only gather a hint of it from after comments of the actors themselves when the last words of parting had been said and grace and arthur had taken their seats in the wingdam coach gabriel bent over his wifes bedside  it kinder seemed ez ef you and mr poinsett recognised each other at first july said gabriel  i have seen him beforenot here i dont think hell ever trouble us much gabriel said mrs conroy with a certain triumphant lighting of the cold fires of her grey eyes but look at the baby hes laughing he knows you i declare and in gabriels rapt astonishment at this unprecedented display of intelligence in one so young the subject was dropped  why where did you ever see mrs conroy before asked grace of her husband when they had reached wingdam that night  i never saw mrs conroy before returned arthur with legal precision i met a lady in st louis years ago under another name who i dare say is now your brothers wife buti think gracethe less we see of herthe better  why  by the way darling what was that paper that gabriel gave you asked arthur lightly avoiding the previous question  grace drew the paper from her pocket blushed slightly kissed her husband and then putting her arms around his neck laid her face in his breast while he read aloud in spanish the following       this is to give trustworthy statement that on the 18th of may      1848 a young girl calling herself grace conroy sought      shelter and aid at the presidio of san geronimo being      friendlessbut of the b v m and the saintsi adopted her      as my daughter with the name of dolores salvatierra six      months after her arrival on the 12th of november 1848 she was      delivered of a dead child the son of her affianced husband      one philip ashley wishing to keep her secret from the world      and to prevent recognition by the members of her own race and      family by the assistance and advice of an indian peon      manuela she consented that her face and hands should be daily      washed by the juice of the yokotowhose effect is to change      the skin to the colour of bronze with this metamorphosis she      became known by my advice and consent as the daughter of the      indian princess nicata and myself and as such i have      recognised in due form her legal right in the appointment of my      estate       given at the presidio of san geronimo this 1st day of      december 1848      juan hermenizildo salvatierra  but how did gabriel get this asked arthur  idontknow said grace  to whom did you give it  topadre felipe  oh i see said arthur then you are mr dumphys longlost wife  i dont know what father felipe did said grace tossing her head slightly i put the matter in his hands  the whole story  i said nothing about youyou great goose  arthur kissed her by way of acknowledging the justice of the epithet  but i ought to have told mrs sepulvida the whole story when she said you proposed to her youre sure you didnt continued grace looking into her husbands eyes  never said the admirable young man promptly
