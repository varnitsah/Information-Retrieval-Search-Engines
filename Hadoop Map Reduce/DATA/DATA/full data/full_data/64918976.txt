64918976	deep waters  by ww jacobs     dirty work  it was nearly highwater and the nightwatchman who had stepped aboard a lighter lying alongside the wharf to smoke a pipe sat with halfclosed eyes enjoying the summer evening  the bustle of the day was over the wharves were deserted and hardly a craft moved on the river  perfumed clouds of shag hovering for a time over the lighter floated lazily towards the surrey shore  theres one thing about my job said the nightwatchman slowly its done all alone by yourself  theres no foreman ahollering at you and offering you a penny for your thoughts and no mates to run into you from behind with a loaded truck and then ask you why you didnt look where youre going to  from six oclock in the evening to six oclock next morning im my own master  he rammed down the tobacco with an experienced forefinger and puffed contentedly  people like you ud find it lonely he continued after a pause i did at fust  i used to let people come and sit ere with me of an evening talking but i got tired of it arter a time and when one chap fell overboard while e was showing me ow he put his wifes mother in er place i gave it up altogether  there was three foot o mud in the dock at the time and arter i ad got im out he fainted in my arms  arter that i kept myself to myself  say wot you like a mans best friend is imself  theres nobody elsell do as much for im or let im off easier when he makes a mistake  if i felt a bit lonely i used to open the wicket in the gate and sit there watching the road and praps pass a word or two with the policeman  then something appened one night that made me take quite a dislike to it for a time  i was sitting there with my feet outside smoking a quiet pipe when i eard a bit of a noise in the distance  then i eard people running and shouts of stop thief  a man came along round the corner full pelt and just as i got up dashed through the wicket and ran on to the wharf i was arter im like a shot and got up to im just in time to see him throw something into the dock  and at the same moment i eard the other people run past the gate  wots up i ses collaring im  nothing he ses breathing ard and struggling  let me go  he was a little wisp of a man and i shook im like a dog shakes a rat i remembered my own pocket being picked and i nearly shook the breath out of im  and now im going to give you in charge i ses pushing im along towards the gate  wot for he ses purtending to be surprised  stealing i ses  youve made a mistake he ses you can search me if you like  more use to search the dock i ses  i see you throw it in  now you keep quiet else youll get urt  if you get five years i shall be all the more pleased  i dont know ow he did it but e did  he seemed to sink away between my legs and afore i knew wot was appening i was standing upside down with all the blood rushing to my ead  as i rolled over he bolted through the wicket and was off like a flash of lightning  a couple o minutes arterwards the people wot i ad eard run past came back agin  there was a big fat policeman with ema man id seen afore on the beatand when they ad gorn on he stopped to ave a word with me  ot work he ses taking off his elmet and wiping his bald ead with a large red handkerchief  ive lost all my puff  been running  i ses very perlite  arter a pickpocket he ses  he snatched a ladys purse just as she was stepping aboard the french boat with her usband  twelve pounds in it in gold two peppermint lozenges and a postage stamp  he shook his ead and put his elmet on agin  holding it in her little and as usual he ses  asking for trouble i call it  i believe if a woman ad one hand off and only a finger and thumb left on the other shed carry er purse in it  he knew amost as much about wimmen as i do  when is fust wife died she said er only wish was that she could take im with her and she made im promise her faithful that ed never marry agin  his second wife arter a long illness passed away while he was playing hymns on the concertina to her and er mother arter looking at er very hard went to the doctor and said she wanted an inquest  he went on talking for a long time but i was busy doing a bit of ead work and didnt pay much attention to im  i was thinking o twelve pounds two lozenges and a postage stamp laying in the mud at the bottom of my dock and arter a time e said e see as ow i was waiting to get back to my nights rest and went offstamping  i locked the wicket when he ad gorn away and then i went to the edge of the dock and stood looking down at the spot where the purse ad been chucked in  the tide was on the ebb but there was still a foot or two of water atop of the mud  i walked up and down thinking  i thought for a long time and then i made up my mind  if i got the purse and took it to the policestation the police would share the money out between em and tell me they ad given it back to the lady  if i found it and put a notice in the newspaperwhich would cost moneyvery likely a dozen or two ladies would come and see me and say it was theirs then if i gave it to the bestlooking one and the one it belonged to turned up thered be trouble  my idea was to keep itfor a timeand then if the lady who lost it came to me and asked me for it i would give it to er  once i had made up my mind to do wot was right i felt quite appy and arter a look up and down i stepped round to the bears head and ad a couple o goes o rum to keep the cold out  there was nobody in there but the landlord and e started at once talking about the thief and ow he ad run arter him in is shirtsleeves  my opinion is he ses that e bolted on one of the wharves and id imself  he disappeared like magic  was that little gate o yours open  i was on the wharf i ses very cold  you might ha been on the wharf and yet not ave seen anybody come on he ses nodding  wot dye mean i ses very sharp  nothing he ses  nothing  are you trying to take my character away  i ses fixing im with my eye  lo bless me no he ses staring at me  its no good to me  he sat down in is chair behind the bar and went straight off to sleep with his eyes screwed up as tight as they would go  then e opened his mouth and snored till the glasses shook  i suppose ive been one of the best customers he ever ad and thats the way he treated me  for two pins id ha knocked is ugly ead off but arter waking him up very sudden by dropping my glass on the floor i went off back to the wharf  i locked up agin and ad another look at the dock  the water ad nearly gone and the mud was showing in patches  my mind went back to a sailorman wot had dropped is watch overboard two years before and found it by walking about in the dock in is bare feet  he found it more easy because the glass broke when he trod on it  the evening was a trifle chilly for june but ive been used to roughing it all my life especially when i was afloat and i went into the office and began to take my clothes off  i took off everything but my pants and i made sure o them by making braces for em out of a bit of string then i turned the gas low and arter slipping on my boots went outside  it was so cold that at fust i thought id give up the idea  the longer i stood on the edge looking at the mud the colder it looked but at last i turned round and went slowly down the ladder  i waited a moment at the bottom and was just going to step off when i remembered that i ad got my boots on and i ad to go up agin and take em off  i went down very slow the next time and anybody who as been down an iron ladder with thin cold rungs in their bare feet will know why and i had just dipped my left foot in when the wharfbell rang  i oped at fust that it was a runawayring but it kept on and the longer it kept on the worse it got  i went up that ladder agin and called out that i was coming and then i went into the office and just slipped on my coat and trousers and went to the gate  wot dyou want i ses opening the wicket three or four inches and looking out at a man wot was standing there  are you old bill  he ses  im the watchman i ses sharplike  wot dyou want  dont bite me he ses purtending to draw back  i aint done no arm ive come round about that glass you smashed at the bears head  glass i ses ardly able to speak  yes glass he sesthing wot yer drink out of  the landlord says itll cost you a tanner and e wants it now in case you pass away in your sleep  he couldnt come imself cos hes got nobody to mind the bar so e sent me  why  halloa  wheres your boots  aint you afraid o ketching cold  you clear off i ses shouting at him  dye ear me  clear off while youre safe and you tell the landlord that next time e insults me ill smash every glass in is place and then sit im on top of cm  tell im if e wants a tanner out o me to come round imself and see wot he gets  it was a silly thing to say and i saw it arterwards but i was in such a temper i ardly knew wot i was saying  i slammed the wicket in is face and turned the key and then i took off my clothes and went down that ladder agin  it seemed colder than ever and the mud when i got fairly into it was worse than i thought it could ha been  it stuck to me like glue and every step i took seemed colder than the one before  owever when i make up my mind to do a thing i do it  i fixed my eyes on the place where i thought the purse was and every time i felt anything under my foot i reached down and picked it upand then chucked it away as far as i could so as not to pick it up agin  dirty job it was too and in five minutes i was mud up to the neck amost  and i ad just got to wot i thought was the right place and feeling about very careful when the bell rang agin  i thought i should ha gorn out o my mind  it was just a little tinkle at first then another tinkle but as i stood there all in the dark and cold trying to make up my mind to take no notice of it it began to ring like mad  i ad to goive known men climb over the gate afore nowand i didnt want to be caught in that dock  the mud seemed stickier than ever but i got out at last and arter scraping some of it off with a bit o stick i put on my coat and trousers and boots just as i was and went to the gate with the bell going its ardest all the time  when i opened the gate and see the landlord of the bears head standing there i turned quite dizzy and there was a noise in my ears like the roaring of the sea  i should think i stood there for a couple o minutes without being able to say a word  i could think of em  dont be frightened bill ses the landlord  im not going to eat you  he looks as if hes walking in is sleep ses the fat policeman wot was standing near by  dont startle im  he always looks like that ses the landlord  i stood looking at im  i could speak then but i couldnt think of any words good enough not with a policeman standing by with a notebook in is pocket  wot was you ringing my bell for i ses at last  why didnt you answer it before ses the landlord  dyou think ive got nothing better to do than to stand ringing your bell for three quarters of an hour  some people would report you  i know my dooty i ses theres no craft up tonight and no reason for anybody to come to my bell if i was to open the gate every time a parcel of overgrown boys rang my bell i should ave enough to do  well ill overlook it this time seeing as youre an old man and couldnt get another sleepingin job he ses looking at the policeman for him to see ow clever e was  wot about that tanner  thats wot ive come for  you be off i ses starting to shut the wicket  you wont get no tanner out of me  all right he ses i shall stand here and go on ringing the bell till you pay up thats all  he gave it another tug and the policeman instead of locking im up for it stood there laughing  i gave im the tanner  it was no use standing there arguing over a tanner with a purse of twelve quid waiting for me in the dock but i told im wot people thought of im  arf a second watchman ses the policeman as i started to shut the wicket agin  you didnt see anything of that pickpocket did you  i did not i ses  cos this gentleman thought he might ave come in here ses the policeman  ow could he ave come in here without me knowing it  i ses firing up  easy ses the landlord and stole your boots into the bargain  he might ave come when your back was turned ses the policeman and if so he might be iding there now  i wonder whether youd mind me having a look round  i tell you he aint ere i ses very short but to ease your mind ill ave a look round myself arter youve gorn  the policeman shook his ead  well o course i cant come in without your permission he ses with a little cough but i ave an idea that if it was your guvnor ere instead of you hed ha been ony too pleased to do anything e could to help the law  ill beg his pardon tomorrow for asking you in case he might object  that settled it  thats the police all over and thats ow they get their way and do as they like  i could see im in my minds eye talking to the guvnor and letting out little things about broken glasses and suchlike by accident  i drew back to let im pass and i was so upset that when that little rat of a landlord follered im i didnt say a word  i stood and watched them poking and prying about the wharf as if it belonged to em with the light from the policemans lantern flashing about all over the place  i was shivering with cold and temper  the mud was drying on me  if youve finished unting for the pickpocket ill let you out and get on with my work i ses drawing myself up  good night ses the policeman moving off  good night dear ses the landlord  mind you tuck yourself up warm  i lost my temper for the moment and afore i knew wot i was doing i ad got hold of him and was shoving im towards the gate as ard as i could shove  he pretty near got my coat off in the struggle and next moment the policeman ad turned his lantern on me and they was both staring at me as if they couldnt believe their eyesight  hehes turning black ses the landlord  hes turned black ses the policeman  they both stood there looking at me with their mouths open and then afore i knew wot he was up to the policeman came close up to me and scratched my chest with his fingernail  its mud he ses  you keep your nails to yourself i ses  its nothing to do with you and i couldnt elp noticing the smell of it  nobody could  and wot was worse than all was that the tide ad turned and was creeping over the mud in the dock  they got tired of it at last and came back to where i was and stood there shaking their eads at me  if he was on the wharf e must ave made his escape while you was in the bears head ses the policeman  he was in my place a long time ses the landlord  well its no use crying over spilt milk ses the policeman  funny smell about ere aint there  he ses sniffing and turning to the landlord  wot is it  i dunno ses the landlord  i noticed it while we was talking to im at the gate  it seems to foller im about  ive smelt things i like better ses the policeman sniffing agin its just like the foreshore when somebody as been stirring the mud up a bit  unless its a case of tempted suicide he ses looking at me very ard  ah ses the landlord  theres no mud on is clothes ses the policeman looking me over with his lantern agin  he must ave gone in naked but i should like to see is legs to make all right  all right  keep your air on  you look arter your own legs then i ses very sharp and mind your own business  it is my business he ses turning to the landlord  was e strange in his manner at all when e was in your place tonight  he smashed one o my best glasses ses the landlord  so he did ses the policeman  so he did  id forgot that  do you know im well  not more than i can elp ses the landlord  hes been in my place a good bit but i never knew of any reason why e should try and do away with imself  if hes been disappointed in love he aint told me anything about it  i suppose that couple o fools ud ave stood there talking about me all night if id ha let em but i had about enough of it  look ere i ses youre very clever both of you but you neednt worry your eads about me  ive just been having a mudbath thats all  a mudbath  ses both of em squeaking like a couple o silly parrots  for rheumatics i ses  i ad it something cruel tonight and i thought that praps the mud ud do it good  i read about it in the papers  theres places where you pay pounds and pounds for em but being a pore man i ad to ave mine on the cheap  the policeman stood there looking at me for a moment and then e began to laugh till he couldnt stop imself  loveaduck he ses at last wiping his eyes  i wish id seen it  must ha looked like a fat mermaid ses the landlord wagging his silly ead at me  i can just see old bill sitting in the mud acombing his air and singing  they ad some more talk o that sort just to show each other ow funny they was but they went off at last and i fastened up the gate and went into the office to clean myself up as well as i could  one comfort was they adnt got the least idea of wot i was arter and i ad a fancy that the one as laughed last would be the one as got that twelve quid  i was so tired that i slept nearly all day arter i ad got ome and i ad no sooner got back to the wharf in the evening than i see that the landlord ad been busy  if there was one silly fool that asked me the best way of making mudpies i should think there was fifty  little things please little minds and the silly way some of em went on made me feel sorry for my sects  by eight oclock owever they ad all sheered off and i got a broom and began to sweep up to elp pass the time away until lowwater  ony one craft ad come up that daya ketch called the peewitand as she was berthed at the end of the jetty she wasnt in my way at all  her skipper came on to the wharf just afore ten  fat silly old man e was named fogg  always talking about is ealth and taking medicine to do it good  he came up to me slow like and when e stopped and asked me about the rheumatics the broom shook in my and  look here i ses if you want to be funny go and be funny with them as likes it  im fair sick of it so i give you warning  funny he ses staring at me with eyes like a cow  wot dye mean theres nothing funny about rheumatics i ought to know im a martyr to it  did you find as ow the mud did you any good  i looked at im hard but e stood there looking at me with his fat baby face and i knew he didnt mean any harm so i answered im perlite and wished im good night  ive ad pretty near everything a man can have he ses casting anchor on a empty box but i think the rheumatics was about the worst of em all  i even tried bees for it once  bees  i ses  bees  beestings he ses  a man told me that if i could ony persuade a few bees to sting me that ud cure me  i dont know what e meant by persuading they didnt want no persuading  i took off my coat and shirt and went and rocked one of my neighbours beehives next door and i thought my last hour ad come  he sat on that box and shivered at the memory of it  now i take dr peppers pellets instead he ses  ive got a box in my stateroom and if youd like to try em youre welcome  he sat there talking about the complaints he had ad and wot he ad done for them till i thought i should never have got rid of im  he got up at last though and arter telling me to always wear flannel next to my skin climbed aboard and went below  i knew the hands was aboard and arter watching is cabinskylight until the light was out i went and undressed  then i crept back on to the jetty and arter listening by the peewit to make sure that they was all asleep i went back and climbed down the ladder  it was colder than ever  the cold seemed to get into my bones but i made up my mind to ave that twelve quid if i died for it  i trod round and round the place where i ad seen that purse chucked in until i was tired and the rubbish i picked up by mistake you wouldnt believe  i suppose i ad been in there arf an hour and i was standing up with my teeth clenched to keep them from chattering when i appened to look round and see something like a white ball coming down the ladder  my art seemed to stand still for a moment and then it began to beat as though it would burst  the white thing came down lower and lower and then all of a sudden it stood in the mud and said ow  who is it i ses  who are you  halloa bill it ses  aint it perishing cold  it was the voice o capn fogg and if ever i wanted to kill a fellow creetur i wanted to then  ave you been in long bill he ses  about ten minutes i ses grinding my teeth  is it doing you good he ses  i didnt answer im  i was just going off to sleep he ses when i felt a sort of hot pain in my left knee  o course i knew what it meant at once and instead o taking some of the pellets i thought id try your remedy instead  its a bit nippy but i dont mind that if it does me good  he laughed a silly sort o laugh and then im blest if e didnt sit down in that mud and waller in it  then hed get up and come forard two or three steps and sit down agin  aint you sitting down bill he ses arter a time  no i ses im not  i dont think you can expect to get the full benefit unless you do he ses coming up close to me and sitting down agin  its a bit of a shock at fust but  halloa  wots up i ses  sitting on something hard he ses  i wish people ud be more careful  he took a list to port and felt under the starboard side  then he brought his and up and tried to wipe the mud off and see wot he ad got  wot is it  i ses with a nasty sinking sort o feeling inside me  i dont know he ses going on wiping  its soft outside and ard inside  it  lets ave a look at it i ses holding out my and  its nothing he ses in a queer voice getting up and steering for the ladder  bit of oystershell i think  he was up that ladder hand over fist with me close behind im and as soon as he ad got on to the wharf started to run to is ship  good night bill he ses over is shoulder  arf a moment  i ses follering im  i must get aboard he ses i believe ive got a chill and afore i could stop im he ad jumped on and run down to is cabin  i stood on the jetty for a minute or two trembling all over with cold and temper  then i saw he ad got a light in is cabin and i crept aboard and peeped down the skylight  and i just ad time to see some sovereigns on the table when he looked up and blew out the light
