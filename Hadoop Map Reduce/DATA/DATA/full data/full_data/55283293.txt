55283293	a blot in the scutcheon  by robert browning     transcribers comments on the preparation of this etext  closing brackets ie  have been added to some of the stage directions  leading blanks are reproduced from the printed text  eg       guendolen  where are you taking me      tresham                              he fell just here      introductory note   robert browning stands in respect to his origin and his career in marked contrast to the two aristocratic poets beside whose dramas his blot in the scutcheon is here printed  his father was a bank clerk and a dissenter at a time when dissent meant exclusion from society the poet went neither to one of the great public schools nor to oxford or cambridge and no breath of scandal touched his name born in london in 1812 he was educated largely by private tutors and spent two years at london university but the influence of his father a man of wide reading and cultivated tastes was probably the most important element in his early training  he drew well was something of a musician and wrote verses from an early age though it was the accidental reading of a volume of shelley which first kindled his real inspiration  this indebtedness is beautifully acknowledged in his first published poem pauline 1833  apart from frequent visits to italy there is little of incident to chronicle in brownings life with the one great exception of his more than fortunate marriage in 1846 to elizabeth barrett the greatest of english poetesses  brownings dramatic period extended from 1835 to the time of his marriage and produced some nine plays not all of which however were intended for the stage  paracelsus the first of the series has been fairly described as a conversational drama and pippa passes though it has been staged is essentially a poem to read  the historical tragedy of strafford has been impressively performed but king victor and king charles the return of the druses colombes birthday a souls tragedy and luria while interesting in many ways can hardly be regarded as successful stageplays  a blot in the scutcheon was performed at drury lane but its chances of a successful run were spoiled by the jealousy of macready the manager  the main cause of brownings weakness as a playwright lay in the fact that he was so much more interested in psychology than in action but in the present tragedy this defect is less prominent than usual and in spite of flaws in construction it reaches a high pitch of emotional intensity the characters are drawn with vividness and the lines are rich in poetry     a blot in

believe a brothers love      for a sole sister must exceed them all      for see now only see theres no alloy      of earth that creeps into the perfectst gold      of other lovesno gratitude to claim      you never gave her life not even aught      that keeps lifenever tended her instructed      enriched herso your love can claim no right      oer her save pure loves claim  thats what i call      freedom from earthliness  youll never hope      to be such friends for instance she and you      as when you hunted cowslips in the woods      or played together in the meadow hay      oh yeswith age respect comes and your worth      is felt theres growing sympathy of tastes      theres ripened friendship theres confirmed esteem      much head these make against the newcomer      the startling apparition the strange youth      whom one halfhours conversing with or say      mere gazing at shall change beyond all change      this ovid ever sang about your soul     her soul that isthe sisters soul  with her      twas winter yesterday now all is warmth      the green leafs springing and the turtles voice      arise and come away  come whitherfar      enough from the esteem respect and all      the brothers somewhat insignificant      array of rights  all which he knows before      has calculated on so long ago      i think such love apart from yours and mine      contented with its little term of life      intending to retire betimes aware      how soon the background must be placed for it      i think am sure a brothers love exceeds      all the worlds love in its unworldliness       mildred  what is this for       tresham                     this mildred is it for      or no i cannot go to it so soon      thats one of many points my haste left out      each day each hour throws forth its silkslight film      between the being tied to you by birth      and you until those slender threads compose      a web that shrouds her daily life of hopes      and fears and fancies all her life from yours      so close you live and yet so far apart      and must i rend this web tear up break down      the sweet and palpitating mystery      that makes her sacred  youfor you i

happy ways      to hide love from the loveless any more      i think i might have urged some little point      in my defence to thorold he was breathless      for the least hint of a defence  but no

and hope      and love of mewhom you loved too and yet      suffered to sit here waiting his approach      while you were slaying him  oh doubtlessly      you let him speak his poor confused boysspeech      do his poor utmost to disarm your wrath      and respite meyou let him try to give      the story of our love and ignorance      and the brief madness and the long despair      you let him plead all this because your code      of honour bids you hear before you strike      but at the end as he looked up for life      into your eyesyou struck him down       tresham                              no  no      had i but heard himhad i let him speak      half the truthlesshad i looked long on him      i had desisted  why as he lay there      the moon on his flushed cheek i gathered all      the story ere he told it  i saw through      the troubled surface of his crime and yours      a depth of purity immovable      had i but glanced where all seemed turbidest      had gleamed some inlet to the calm beneath      i would not glance  my punishments at hand      there mildred is the truth and yousay on      you curse me       mildred       as i dare approach that heaven      which has not bade a living thing despair      which needs no code to keep its grace from stain      but bids the vilest worm that turns on it      desist and be forgiveniforgive not      but bless you thorold from my soul of souls           falls on his neck      there  do not think too much upon the past      the cloud thats broke was all the same a cloud      while it stood up between my friend and you      you hurt him neath its shadow  but is that      so past retrieve  i have his heart you know      i may dispose of it  i give it you      it loves you as mine loves  confirm me henry
