and to the imagination a vast country more than three thousand miles in width  its eastern face presents a broken outline to the wild surges of the atlantic  its western coast commands from majestic heights the broad bosom of the pacific  along its southern boundary is a fertile country of lake and plain and woodland loud already with the murmur of a rising industry and in summer waving with the golden wealth of the harvest  but on its northern side canada is set fast against the frozen seas of the pole and the desolate region of barren rock and icebound island that is joined to the polar ocean by a common mantle of snow  for hundreds and hundreds of miles the vast fortress of ice rears its battlements of shining glaciers  the unending sunshine of the arctic summer falls upon untrodden snow  the cold light of the 2 aurora illumines in winter an endless desolation  there is no sound save when at times the melting water falls from the glistening sides of some vast pinnacle of ice or when the leaden sea forces its tide between the rockbound islands  here in this vast territory civilization has no part and man no place  life struggles northward only to die out in the arctic cold  the green woods of the lake district and the blossoms of the prairies are left behind  the fertility of the great west gives place to the rockstrewn wilderness of the barren grounds  a stunted and deformed vegetation fights its way to the arctic circle  rude grasses and thin moss cling desperately to the naked rock  animal life pushes even farther  the seas of the frozen ocean still afford a sustenance  even mankind is found eking out a savage livelihood on the shores of the northern sea  but gradually all fades until nothing is left but the endless plain of snow stretching towards the pole  yet this frozen northern land and these forbidding seas have their history  deeds were here done as great in valour as those which led to the conquest of a mexico or the acquisition of a peru  but unlike the captains and conquerors of the south the explorers have 3 come and gone and left behind no trace of their passage  their hopes of a land of gold their vision of a new seaway round the world are among the forgotten dreams of the past  robbed of its empty secret the north still stretches silent and untenanted with nothing but the splendid record of human courage to illuminate its annals  for us in our own day the romance that once clung about the northern seas has drifted well nigh to oblivion  to understand it we must turn back in fancy three hundred years  we must picture to ourselves the aspect of the new world at the time when elizabeth sat on the throne of england and when the kingdoms of western europe britain france and spain were rising from the confusion of the middle ages to national greatness  the existence of the new world had been known for nearly a hundred years  but it still remained shadowed in mystery and uncertainty  it was known that america lay as a vast continent or island as men often called it then midway between europe and the great empires of the east  columbus and after him verrazano and others had explored its eastern coast finding everywhere a land of dense forests peopled here and there with naked savages that fled at their 4 approach  the servants of the king of spain had penetrated its central part and reaped in the spoils of mexico the reward of their savage bravery  from the central isthmus balboa had first seen the broad expanse of the pacific  on this ocean the spaniard pizarro had been borne to the conquest of peru  even before that conquest magellan had passed the strait that bears his name and had sailed westward from america over the vast space that led to the island archipelago of eastern asia  far towards the northern end of the great island the fishermen of the channel ports had found their way in yearly sailings to the cod banks of newfoundland  there they had witnessed the silent procession of the great icebergs that swept out of the frozen seas of the north and spoke of oceans still unknown leading one knew not whither  the boldest of such sailors one jacques cartier fighting his way westward had entered a great gulf that yawned in the opening side of the continent and from it he had advanced up a vast river the like of which no man had seen  hundreds of miles from the gulf he had found villages of savages who pointed still westward and told him of wonderful countries of gold and silver that lay beyond the palisaded settlement of hochelaga  5  but the discoveries of columbus and those who followed him had not solved but had only opened the mystery of the western seas  true a way to the asiatic empire had been found  the road discovered by the portuguese round the base of africa was known  but it was long and arduous beyond description  even more arduous was the seaway found by magellan the whole side of the continent must be traversed  the dreadful terrors of the straits that separate south america from the land of fire must be essayed and beyond that a voyage of thirteen thousand miles across the pacific during which the little caravels must slowly make their way northward again till the latitude of cathay was reached parallel to that of spain itself  for any other seaway to asia the known coastline of america offered an impassable barrier in only one region and that as yet unknown might an easier and more direct way be found towards the eastern empires  this was by way of the northern seas either round the top of asia or more direct still perhaps by entering those icebound seas that lay beyond the great banks of newfoundland and the coastal waters visited by jacques cartier  into the entrance of these waters the ships of the cabots flying the 6 english flag had already made their way at the close of the fifteenth century  they seem to have reached as far or nearly as far as the northern limits of labrador and sebastian cabot had said that beyond the point reached by their ships the sea opened out before them to the west  no further exploration was made indeed for threequarters of a century after the cabots but from this time on the idea of a northwest passage and the possibility of a great achievement in this direction remained as a tradition with english seamen  it was natural then that the english sailors of the sixteenth century should turn to the northern seas  the eastern passage from the german ocean round the top of russia and asia was first attempted  as early as the reign of edward the sixth a company of adventurers commonly called the muscovy company sailed their ships round the north of norway and opened a connection with russia by way of the white sea but the sailing masters of the company tried in vain to find a passage in this direction to the east  their ships reached as far as the kara sea at about the point where the present boundary of european russia separates it from siberia  beyond this extended countless leagues of 7 impassable ice and the rockbound desolation of northern asia  it remained to seek a passage in the opposite direction by way of the arctic seas that lay above america  to find such a passage and with it a ready access to cathay and the indies became one of the great ambitions of the elizabethan age  there is no period when great things might better have been attempted  it was an epoch of wonderful national activity and progress the spirit of the nation was being formed anew in the protestant reformation and in the rising conflict with spain  it was the age of drake of raleigh of shakespeare the time at which were aroused those wide ambitions which were to give birth to the british empire  in thinking of the exploits of these elizabethan sailors in the arctic seas we must try to place ourselves at their point of view and dismiss from our minds our own knowledge of the desolate and hopeless region against which their efforts were directed  the existence of greenland often called frisland and of labrador was known from the voyages of the cabots and the cortereals  it was known that between these two coasts the sea swept in a powerful current out of the north of 8 what lay beyond nothing was known  there seemed no reason why frobisher or davis or henry hudson might not find the land trend away to the south again and thus offer after a brief transit of the dangerous waters of the north a smooth and easy passage over the pacific  perhaps we can best understand the hopes and ambitions of the time if we turn to the writings of the elizabethans themselves  one of the greatest of them sir humphrey gilbert afterwards lost in the northern seas wrote down at large his reasons for believing that the passage was feasible and that its discovery would be fraught with the greatest profit to the nation  in his discourse to prove a northwest passage to cathay gilbert argues that all writers from plato down have spoken of a great island out in the atlantic that this island is america which must thus have a water passage all round it that the ocean currents moving to the west across the atlantic and driven along its coast as cartier saw past newfoundland evidently show that the water runs on round the top of america  a northwest passage must therefore exist  of the advantages to be derived from its discovery gilbert was in no doubt   9  it were the only way for our princes he wrote to possess themselves of the wealth of all the east parts of the world which is infinite through the shortness of the voyage we should be able to sell all manner of merchandise brought from thence far better cheap than either the portugal or spaniard doth or may do  also we might sail to divers very rich countries both civil and others out of both their jurisdiction that of the portuguese and spaniards where there is to be found great abundance of gold silver precious stones cloth of gold silks all manner of spices grocery wares and other kinds of merchandise of an inestimable price   gilbert also speaks of the possibility of colonizing the regions thus to be discovered  the quaint language in which he describes the chances of what is now called imperial expansion is not without its irony   we might inhabit some part of those countries he says and settle there such needy people of our country which now trouble the commonwealth and through want here at home are enforced to commit 10 outrageous offences whereby they are daily consumed with the gallows we shall also have occasion to set poor mens children to learn handicrafts and thereby to make trifles and such like which the indians and those people do much esteem by reason whereof there should be none occasion to have our country cumbered with loiterers vagabonds and such like idle persons   undoubtedly gilberts way of thinking was also that of many of the great statesmen and sailors of his day  especially was this the case with sir martin frobisher a man we are told thoroughly furnished with knowledge of the sphere and all other skills appertaining to the art of navigation  the northwest passage became the dream of frobishers ambition  year after year he vainly besought the queens councillors to sanction an expedition  but the opposition of the powerful muscovy company was thrown against the project  frobisher although supported by the influence of the earl of warwick agitated and argued in vain for fifteen years till at last in 1574 the necessary licence was granted and the countenance of the queen was assured to the enterprise  even then about two years 11 passed before the preparations could be completed  frobishers first expedition was on a humble scale  his company numbered in all thirtyfive men  they embarked in two small barques the gabriel and the michael neither of them of more than twentyfive tons and a pinnace of ten tons  they carried food for a year  the ships dropped down the thames on june 7 1576 and as they passed greenwich where the queens court was the little vessels made a brave show by the discharge of their ordnance  elizabeth waved her hand from a window to the departing ships and sent one of her gentlemen aboard to say that she had a good liking of their doings  from such small acts of royal graciousness has often sprung a wonderful devotion  frobishers little ships struck boldly out on the atlantic  they ran northward first and crossed the ocean along the parallel of sixty degrees north latitude  favourable winds and strong gales bore them rapidly across the sea  on july 11 they sighted the southern capes of greenland or frisland as they called it that rose like pinnacles of steeples snowcrowned and glittering on the horizon  they essayed a landing but the masses of shore ice and the 12 drifting fog baffled their efforts  here off cape desolation the full fury of the arctic gales broke upon their ships  the little pinnace foundered with all hands  the michael was separated from her consort in the storm and her captain losing heart made his way back to england to report frobisher cast away  but no terror of the sea could force frobisher from his purpose  with his single ship the gabriel its mast sprung its topmast carried overboard in the storm he drove on towards the west  he was determined so writes a chronicler of his voyages to bring true proof of what land and sea might be so far to the northwestwards beyond any that man hath heretofore discovered  his efforts were rewarded  on july 28 a tall headland rose on the horizon queen elizabeths foreland so frobisher named it  as the gabriel approached a deep sound studded with rocky islands at its mouth opened to view  its position shows that the vessel had been carried northward and westward past the coast of labrador and the entrance of hudson strait  the voyagers had found their way to the vast polar island now known as baffin island  into this at the point which the ship had reached there extends a deep inlet 13 called after its discoverer frobishers strait  frobisher had found a new land and its form with a great sea passage running westward and land both north and south of it made him think that this was truly the highway to the orient  he judged that the land seen to the north was part of asia reaching out and overlapping the american continent  for many days heavy weather and fog and the danger of the drifting ice prevented a landing  the month of august opened with calm seas and milder weather  frobisher and his men were able to land in the ships boat  they found before them a desolate and uninviting prospect a rockbound coast fringed with islands and with the huge masses of grounded icebergs  for nearly a month frobishers ship stood on and off the coast  fresh water was taken on board  in a convenient spot the ship was beached and at low tide repairs were made and leaks were stopped in the strained timbers of her hull  in the third week canoes of savages were seen and presently the natives were induced to come on board the gabriel and barter furs for lookingglasses and trinkets  the savages were like tartars with long black hair broad faces and flat noses  they seemed friendly and welldisposed  five of the english 14 sailors ventured to join the natives on land contrary to the express orders of the captain  they never returned nor could any of the savages be afterwards induced to come within reach  one man only paddling in the sea in his skin canoe was enticed to the ships side by the tinkling of a little bell and so seized and carried away  but his own sailors though he vainly searched the coast frobisher saw no more  after a weeks delay the gabriel set sail on august 26 for home and in spite of terrific gales was safely back at her anchorage at harwich early in october  contrary to what we should suppose the voyage was viewed as a brilliant success  the queen herself named the newly found rocks and islands meta incognita  frobisher was at once specially famous for the great hope he brought of a passage to cathay  a strangelooking piece of black rock that had been carried home in the gabriel was pronounced by a metallurgist one baptista agnello to contain gold true agnello admitted in confidence that he had coaxed nature to find the precious metal  but the rumour of the thing was enough  the cupidity of the london merchants was added to the ambitions of the court  there was no trouble about finding 15 ships and immediate funds for a second expedition  the new enterprise was carried out in the following year 1577  the gabriel and the michael sailed again and with them one of the queens ships the aid  this time the company included a number of soldiers and gentlemen adventurers  the main object was not the discovery of the passage but the search for gold  the expedition sailed out of harwich on may 31 1577 following the route by the north of scotland  a weeks sail brought the ships with a merrie wind to the orkneys  here a day or so was spent in obtaining water  the inhabitants of these remote islands were found living in stone huts in a condition almost as primitive as that of american savages  the good man wife children and other members of the family wrote master settle one of frobishers company eat and sleep on one side of the house and the cattle on the other very beastly and rude  from the orkneys the ships pursued a very northerly course entering within the arctic circle and sailing in the perpetual sunlight of the polar day  near iceland they saw huge pine trees drifting roots and all across the ocean  wild storms 16 beset them as they passed the desolate capes of greenland  at length on july 16 the navigators found themselves off the headlands of meta incognita  here frobisher and his men spent the summer  the coast and waters were searched as far as the inclement climate allowed  the savages were fierce and unfriendly  a few poor rags of clothing found among the rocks bespoke the fate of the sailors of the year before  fierce conflicts with the natives followed  several were captured  one woman so hideous and wrinkled with age that the mariners thought her a witch was released in pious awe  a younger woman with a baby at her back was carried captive to the english ships  the natives in return watched their opportunity and fell fiercely on the english as occasion offered leaping headlong from the rocks into the sea rather than submit to capture  to the perils of conflict was added the perpetual danger of moving ice even in the summer seas great gales blew and giant masses of ice drove furiously through the strait  no passage was possible  in vain frobisher landed on both the northern and the southern sides and tried to penetrate the rugged country  all about the land was barren and forbidding  17 mountains of rough stone crowned with snow blocked the way  no trees were seen and no vegetation except a scant grass here and there upon the flatter spaces of the rocks  but neither the terrors of the ice nor the fear of the savages could damp the ardour of the explorers  the landing of frobisher and his men on meta incognita was carried out with something of the pomp dear to an age of chivalrous display that marked the landing of columbus on the tropic island of san salvador  the captain and his men moved in marching order they knelt together on the barren rock to offer thanks to god and to invoke a blessing on their queen  great cairns of stone were piled high here and there as a sign of englands sovereignty while as they advanced against the rugged hills of the interior the banner of their country was proudly carried in the van  their thoughts were not of glory only  it was with the ardour of treasureseekers that they fell to their task forgetting in the lust for gold the chill horror of their surroundings and when the arctic sunlight glittered on the splintered edges of the rocks the crevices of the barren stone seemed to the excited minds of the explorers to be filled with virgin gold carried by subterranean 18 streams  the three ships were loaded deep with worthless stone a fitting irony on their quest then at the end of august they were turned again eastward for england  tempest and fog enveloped their passage  the ships were driven asunder  each thought the others lost  but by good fortune all safely arrived the captains ship landing at milford haven the others at bristol and yarmouth  fortunately for frobisher the worthless character of the freight that he brought home was not readily made clear by the crude methods of the day  for the next summer found him again off the shores of meta incognita eagerly searching for new mines  this time he bore with him a large company and ample equipment  fifteen ships in all sailed under his command  among his company were miners and artificers  the frames of a house ready to set up were borne in the vessels  felton a ships captain and a group of frobishers gentlemen were to be left behind to spend the winter in the new land  from the first the voyage was inauspicious  the ships had scarcely entered the straits before a great storm broke upon them  land and sea were blotted out in driving snow  the open water into which they had sailed was soon 19 filled with great masses of ice which the tempest cast furiously against the ships  to their horror the barque dionise rammed by the ice went down in the swirling waters  with her she carried all her cargo including a part of the timbers of the house destined for the winters habitation  but the stout courage of the mariners was undismayed  all through the evening and the night they fought against the ice with capstan bars with boats oars and with great planks they thrust it from the ships  some of the men leaped down upon the moving floes and bore with might and main against the ships to break the shock  at times the little vessels were lifted clear out of the sea their sides torn with the fierce blows of the icepack their seams strained and leaking  all night they looked for instant death  but with the coming of the morning the wind shifted to the west and cleared the ice from the sea and god sent to the mariners so runs their chronicle so pleasant a day as the like we had not of a long time before as after punishment consolation  but their dangers were not ended  as the ships stood on and off the land they fell in with a great berg of ice that reared its height four hundred feet above the masts and lay 20 extended for a half mile in length  this they avoided  but a few days later while they were still awaiting a landing a great mist rolled down upon the seas so that for five days and nights all was obscurity and no ship could see its consorts  current and tide drove the explorers to and fro till they drifted away from the mouth of frobisher strait southward and westward  then another great sound opened before them to the west this was the passage of hudson strait and had frobisher followed it he would have found the vast inland sea of hudson bay open to his exploration  but intent upon his search for ore he fought his way back to the inhospitable waters that bear his name  there at an island which had been christened the countess of warwicks island the fleet was able to assemble by august 1  but the illfortune of the enterprise demanded the abandonment of all idea of settlement frobisher and his men made haste to load their vessels with the worthless rock which abounded in the district  in one great black island alone there was discovered such a quantity of it that if the goodness might answer the plenty thereof it might reasonably suffice all the goldgluttons of the world  in leaving meta incognita frobisher and his 21 companions by no means intended that the enterprise should be definitely abandoned  such timbers of the house as remained they buried for use next year  a little building or fort of stone was erected to test whether it would stand against the frost of the arctic winter  in it were set a number of little toys bells and knives to tempt the cupidity of the eskimos who had grown wary and hostile to the newcomers  pease corn and grain were sown in the scant soil as a provision for the following summer  on the last day of august the fleet departed on its homeward voyage  the passage was long and stormy  the ships were scattered and found their way home as best they might some to one harbour and some to another  but by the beginning of october the entire fleet was safely back in its own waters  the expectations of a speedy return to meta incognita were doomed to disappointment  the ore that the ships carried proved to be but worthless rock and from the commercial point of view the whole expedition was a failure  frobisher was never able to repeat his attempt to find the northwest passage  in its existence his faith remained as firm as ever  but although his three voyages resulted in no discoveries of 22 profit to england his name should stand high on the roll of honour of great english seacaptains  he brought to bear on his task not only the splendid courage of his age but also the earnest devotion and intense religious spirit which marked the best men of the period of the reformation  the first article of frobishers standing orders to his fleet enjoined his men to banish swearing dice and cardplaying and to worship god twice a day in the service of the church of england  the watchword of the fleet to be called out in fog or darkness as a means of recognition was before the world was god and the answer shouted back across the darkness after god came christ his son  at all convenient times and places sermons were preached to the company of the fleet by frobishers chaplain master wolfall a godly man who had left behind in england a large living and a good honest woman to wife and very towardly children in order to spread the gospel in the new land  frobishers personal bravery was of the highest order  we read how in the rage of a storm he would venture tasks from which even his boldest sailors shrank in fear  once when his ship was thrown on her beam ends and the water poured into the waist the commander worked his way along 23 the lee side of the vessel engulfed in the roaring surges to free the sheets  with these qualities martin frobisher combined a singular humanity towards both those whom he commanded and natives with whom he dealt  it is to be regretted that a man of such high character and ability should have spent his efforts on so vain a task  although the gold mines of meta incognita had become discredited it was not long before hope began to revive in the hearts of the english merchants  the new country produced at least valuable sealskins there was always the chance too that a lucky discovery of a western passage might bring fabulous wealth to the merchant adventurers  it thus happened that not many years elapsed before certain wealthy men of london and the west country especially one master william sanderson backed by various gentlemen of the court decided to make another venture  they chose as their captain and chief pilot john davis who had already acquired a reputation as a bold and skilful mariner  in 1585 davis in command of two little ships the sunshine and the moonshine set out from dartmouth  the memory of this explorer will always be associated with the great 24 strait or arm of the sea which separates greenland from the arctic islands of canada and which bears his name  to these waters his three successive voyages were directed and he has the honour of being the first on the long roll of navigators whose watchword has been farther north and who have carried their ships nearer and nearer to the pole  davis started by way of the english channel and lay stormbound for twelve days under the scilly islands a circumstance which bears witness to the imperfect means of navigation of the day and to the courage of seamen  the ships once able to put to sea the voyage was rapid and in twenty days davis was off the southwest coast of greenland  all about the ships were fog and mist and a great roaring noise which the sailors thought must be the sea breaking on a beach they lay thus for a day trying in vain for soundings and firing guns in order to know the whereabouts of the ships  they lowered their boats and found that the roaring noise came from the grinding of the ice pack that lay all about them  next day the fog cleared and revealed the coast which they said was the most deformed rocky and mountainous land that ever they saw  this was greenland  the commander 25 suiting a name to the miserable prospect before him called it the land of desolation  davis spent nearly a fortnight on the coast  there was little in the inhospitable country to encourage his exploration  great cliffs were seen glittering as with gold or crystal but the ore was the same as that which frobisher had brought from meta incognita and the voyagers had been warned  of vegetation there was nothing but scant grass and birch and willow growing like stunted shrubs close to the ground eskimos were seen plying along the coast in their canoes of seal skin they called to the english sailors in a deep guttural speech low in the throat of which nothing was intelligible  one of them pointed upwards to the sun and beat upon his breast  by imitating this gesture which seemed a pledge of friendship the sailors were able to induce the natives to approach  they presently mingled freely with daviss company  the captain shook hands with all who came to him and there was a great show of friendliness on both sides  a brisk trade began  the savages eagerly handed over their garments of sealskin and fur their darts oars and everything that they had in return for little trifles even for pieces of paper  they seemed to the english sailors a very tractable 26 people void of craft and double dealing seeing that the english were eager to obtain furs they pointed to the hills inland as if to indicate that they should go and bring a large supply  but davis was anxious for further exploration and would not delay his ships  on august 1 the wind being fair he put to sea directing his course to the northwest  in five days he reached the land on the other side of davis strait  this was the shore of what is now called baffin island in latitude 66° 40 and hence considerably to the north of the strait which frobisher had entered  at this season the sea was clear of ice and davis anchored his ships under a great cliff that glittered like gold  he called it mount raleigh and the sound which opened out beside it exeter sound  a large headland to the south was named cape walsingham in honour of the queens secretary davis and his men went ashore under mount raleigh where they saw four white bears of a monstrous bigness three of which they killed with their guns and boarspears  there were low shrubs growing among the cliffs and flowers like primroses  but the whole country as far as they could see was without wood or grass  nothing was in sight except the open iceless sea to the east and on the land side 27 great mountains of stone  though the land offered nothing to their search the air was moderate and the weather singularly mild  the broad sheet of open water of the very colour of the ocean itself buoyed up their hopes of the discovery of the western passage  davis turned his ships to the south coasting the shore  here and there signs of man were seen a pile of stones fashioned into a rude wall and a human skull lying upon the rock  the howling of wolves as the sailors thought it was heard along the shore but when two of these animals were killed they were seen to be dogs like mastiffs with sharp ears and bushy tails  a little farther on sleds were found one made of wood and sawn boards the other of whalebone  presently the coastline was broken into a network of barren islands with great sounds between  when davis sailed southward he reached and passed the strait that had been the scene of frobishers adventures and like frobisher himself also passed by the opening of hudson strait  davis was convinced that somewhere on this route was the passage that he sought  but the winds blew hard from the west rendering it difficult to prosecute his search  the short season was already closing in and it was dangerous to 28 linger  reluctantly the ships were turned homeward and though separated at sea the sunshine and the moonshine arrived safely at dartmouth within two hours of each other  while this first expedition had met with no conspicuous material success davis was yet able to make two other voyages to the same region in the two following seasons  in his second voyage that of 1586 he sailed along the edge of the continent from above the arctic circle to the coast of labrador a distance of several hundred miles his search convinced him that if a passage existed at all it must lie somewhere among the great sounds that opened into the coast one of which of course proved later on to be the entrance to hudson bay moreover davis began to see that owing to the great quantity of whales in the northern waters and the ease with which sealskins and furs could be bought from the natives these ventures might be made a source of profit whether the western passage was found or not  in his second voyage alone he bought from the eskimos five hundred sealskins the natives seem especially to have interested him and he himself wrote an account of his dealings with them  they were found to be people of good stature well proportioned in body 29 with broad faces and small eyes wide mouths for the most part unbearded and with great lips  they were so davis said very simple in their conversation but marvellous thievish  they made off with a boat that lay astern of the moonshine cut off pieces from clothes that were spread out to dry and stole oars spears swords and indeed anything within their reach  articles made of iron seemed to offer an irresistible temptation in spite of all pledges of friendship and of the lifting up of hands towards the sun which the eskimos renewed every morning they no sooner saw iron than they must perforce seize upon it to stop their pilfering davis was compelled to fire off a cannon among them whereat the savages made off in wild terror  but in a few hours they came flocking back again holding up their hands to the sun and begging to be friends  when i perceived this said davis it did but minister unto me an occasion of laughter to see their simplicity and i willed that in no case should they be any more hardly used but that our own company should be more vigilant to keep their things supposing it to be very hard in so short a time to make them know their own evils  the natives ate all their meat raw lived 30 mostly on fish and ate grass and ice with delight  they were rarely out of the water but lived in the nature of fishes except when dead sleep took them and they lay down exhausted in a warm hollow of the rocks  davis found among them copper ore and black and red copper  but frobishers experience seems to have made him loath to hunt for mineral treasure  on his last voyage 1587 davis made a desperate attempt to find the desired passage by striking boldly towards the far north  he skirted the west shore of greenland and with favourable winds ran as far north as 72° 12 thus coming into the great sheet of polar water now called baffin bay  this was at the end of the month of june  in these regions there was perpetual day the sun sweeping in a great circle about the heavens and standing five degrees above the horizon even at midnight  to the northward and westward as far as could be seen there was nothing but open sea  davis thought himself almost in sight of the goal  then the wind turned and blew fiercely out of the north unable to advance davis drove westward across the path of the gale at forty leagues from greenland he came upon a sheet of ice that forced him to turn back 31 towards the south  there was no ice towards the north he wrote in relating his experience but a great sea free large very salt and blue and of an unsearchable depth  it seemed most manifest that the passage was free and without impediment towards the north  when davis returned home he was still eager to try again  but the situation was changed  walsingham who had encouraged his enterprise was dead and the whole energy of the nation was absorbed in the great struggle with spain  davis sailed no more to the northern seas  with each succeeding decade it became clear that the hopes aroused by the new world lay not in finding a passage by the iceblocked sounds of the north but in occupying the vast continent of america itself  many voyages were indeed attempted before the hope of a northern passage to the indies was laid aside  weymouth knight and others followed in the track of frobisher and davis  but nothing new was found  the seafaring spirit and the restless adventure which characterized the elizabethan period outlived the great queen  the famous voyage of henry hudson in 1610 revealed the existence of the great inland sea which bears his name  32 hudson already famous as an explorer and for his discovery of the hudson river was sent out by sir john wolstenholme and sir dudley digges to find the northwest passage  the story of his passage of the strait his discovery of the great bay the mutiny of his men and his tragic and mysterious fate forms one of the most thrilling narratives in the history of exploration  but it belongs rather to the romantic story of the great company whose corporate title recalls his name and memory than to the present narrative  after hudson came the exploits of bylot one of his pilots and a survivor of the tragedy and of william baffin who tried to follow daviss lead in searching for the western passage in the very confines of the polar sea  finally there came 1631 the voyage of captain luke fox who traversed the whole western coast of hudson bay and proved that from the main body of its waters there was no outlet to the pacific  the hope of a northwest passage in the form of a wide and glittering sea an easy passage to asia was dead  other causes were added to divert attention from the northern waters  the definite foundation of the colonies of virginia and massachusetts bay opened the path to new 33 hopes and even wider ambitions of empire  then as the seventeenth century moved on its course the shadow of civil strife fell dark over england  the fierce struggle of the great rebellion ended for a time all adventure overseas  when it had passed the days of bold seafarers gazing westward from the decks of their little caravels over the glittering ice of the arctic for a pathway to the orient were gone and the first period of northern adventure had come to an end     34  chapter ii  hearnes overland journey to the northern ocean  in course of time the inaccurate knowledge and vague hopes of the early navigators were exchanged for more definite ideas in regard to the american continent  the progress of discovery along the pacific side of the continent and the occupation by the spaniards of the coast of california led to a truer conception of the immense breadth of north america  voyages across the pacific to the philippines revealed the great distance to be traversed in order to reach the orient by the western route  at the same time the voyages of captain fox and his contemporary captain james had proved hudson bay to be an enclosed sea in consequence for about a century no further attempt was made to find a northwest passage  in the meantime the english came into connection with the far north in a different way  35 the early explorers had brought home the news of the extraordinary wealth of america in furbearing animals  soon the fur trade became the most important feature of the settlements on the american coast and from both new england and new france enormous quantities of furs were exported to europe  this commerce was with the indians and everything depended upon a ready and convenient access to the interior  thus it came about that when the peculiar configuration of hudson bay was known to combine an access to the remotest parts of the continent with a short sea passage to europe its shores naturally offered themselves as the proper scene of the trade in furs  the great rivers that flowed into the baythe severn the nelson the albany the rupertoffered a connection in all directions with the dense forests and the broad plains of the interior  the two competing nations both found their way to the great bay the english by sea through hudson strait the french overland by the portage way from the upper valley of the ottawa  so it happened that there was established by royal charter in 1670 that notable body whose corporate title is the governor and company of adventurers of 36 england trading into hudsons bay  the company was founded primarily to engage in the fur trade  but it was also pledged by its charter to promote geographical discovery and both the honour of its sovereign rights and the promptings of its own commercial interest induced it to expand its territory of operations to the greatest possible degree during its early years necessity compelled it to cling to the coast its operations were confined to forts at the mouth of the nelson the churchill and other rivers to which the indian traders annually descended with their loads of furs  moreover the hostility of the french who had founded the rival company of the north cramped the activities of the english adventurers  during the wars of king william and queen anne the territory of the bay became the scene of armed conflict  expeditions were sent overland from canada against the english company  the little forts were taken and retaken and the echoes of the european struggle that was fought at blenheim and at malplaquet woke the stillness of the northern woods of america  but after the treaty of utrecht in 1713 the whole country of the bay was left to the english  the hudsons bay company were therefore 37 enabled to expand their operations  by establishing forts farther and farther in the interior they endeavoured to come into more direct relation with the sources of their supply  they were thus early led to surmise the great potential wealth of the vast region that lay beyond their forts and to become jealous of their title thereto  their aversion to making public the knowledge of their territory lent to their operations an air of mystery and secrecy and their enemies accused them of being hostile to the promotion of discovery  for their own purposes however the company were willing to have their territory explored as the necessities of their expanding commerce demanded  as early as the close of the seventeenth century 1691 a certain henry kelsey in the service of the company had made his way from york fort to the plains of the saskatchewan  after the treaty of utrecht had brought peace and a clear title to the basin of the bay the company endeavoured to obtain more accurate knowledge of their territory and resources  it had long been rumoured that valuable mines of copper lay in the far north  the early explorers spoke of the eskimos as having copper ore indians who came from the northwest to trade at fort churchill reported the 38 existence of a great mountain of copper beside a river that flowed north into the sea in proof of this they exhibited ornaments and weapons rudely fashioned from the metal  it is probable that attempts were made quite early in the century by the servants of the company to reach this coppermine river by advancing into the interior  but more serious attempts were made by sea voyages along the western shore of the bay  such an expedition was sent out from england under governor knight of the hudsons bay company and captains barlow and vaughan  in 1719 their two ships the albany and the discovery sailed from england and were never seen again  not until half a century later was the story of their shipwreck on marble island in the north of hudson bay and the protracted fate of the survivors learned from savages who had been witnesses of the grim tragedy  other expeditions were sent northward from time to time but without success either in finding copper or in finding a passage westward through the arctic which always remained at least an ostensible object of the search  it so happened that in 1768 the northern indians brought down to churchill such striking specimens of copper ore that the interest of the 39 governor moses norton was aroused to the highest point  a man of determined character he took ship straightway to england and obtained from the directors of the company permission to send an expedition through the interior from fort churchill to the coppermine river  the accomplishment of this task he entrusted to one samuel hearne whose overland journey successfully carried out in the years 1769 to 1772 was to prove one of the great landmarks in the exploration of the far north  hearne a youth of twentyfour years had been trained in a rugged school  he had gone to sea at the age of eleven and at this tender age had taken part in his first seafight  he served as a naval midshipman during the seven years war  at its conclusion he became a mate on one of the ships of the hudsons bay company in which position his industry and ingenuity distinguished him among his associates  for some years hearne was employed in the fur trade north of the churchill and gained a thorough knowledge of the coast of the bay  for the expedition inland norton needed especially a man able to record with scientific accuracy the exact positions which he reached  nortons choice fell upon hearne  the young man was instructed to make his 40 way to the athabaska country and thence to find if he could the river of the north whence the copper came and to trace the river to the sea  he was to note the position of any mines to prepare the way for trade with the indians and to find out from travel or enquiry whether there was a water passage through the continent  two white men a sailor and a landsman were sent in hearnes service  he had as guides an indian chief chawchinahaw with a small band of his followers  on november 6 1769 the little party set out honoured by a salute of seven guns from the huge fortress of fort prince of wales the massive ruins of which still stand as one of the strangest monuments of the continent  the country which the explorer was to traverse in this and his succeeding journeys may be ranked among the most inhospitable regions of the earth  the northern limit of the great american forest runs roughly in a line northwestward from churchill to the mouth of the mackenzie river  east and north of this line is the country of the barren grounds for the most part a desolate waste of rock  it is broken by precipitous watercourses and wide lakes and has no vegetation except the mosses and grasses which support great wandering 41 herds of caribou  a few spruce trees and hardy shrubs struggle northward from the limits of the great woods  even these die out in the bitter climate and then the explorer sees about him nothing but the wide waste of barren rock and running water or in winter the endless mantle of the northern snow  it is not strange that hearnes first attempt met with complete failure  his indian companions had indeed no intention of guiding him to the athabaska country  they deliberately kept to the north of the woods along the edge of the barren grounds where hearne and his companions were exposed to the intense cold which set in a few days after their departure  when they camped at night only a few poor shrubs could be gathered to make a fire and the travellers were compelled to scoop out holes in the snow to shelter their freezing bodies against the bitter blast  the indians determined to prevent the white men from reaching their goal provided very little game hearne and his two servants were reduced to a ration of half a partridge a day for each man  each day the indian chief descanted at length upon the horrors of cold and famine that still lay before them each day with the obstinate pluck of his race hearne struggled on thus 42 for nearly two hundred miles they made their way out into the snowcovered wilderness  at length a number of the indians determined to end the matter made off in the night carrying with them a good part of the supplies  the next day chawchinahaw himself announced that further progress was impossible  he and his braves made off to the west inviting hearne with mocking laughter to get home as best he might  the three white men with a few indians not of chawchinahaws band struggled back through the snow to fort prince of wales  the whole expedition had lasted five weeks  in spite of this failure neither governor norton nor hearne himself was discouraged  in less than three months on february 23 1770 hearne was off again for the north  convinced that white men were of no use to him he had the hardihood to set out accompanied only by indians three from the northern country and three belonging to what were called at churchill the home guard or southern indians  there was no salute from the fort this time for the cannon on its ramparts were buried deep in snow  illustration samuel hearne  from an engraving in the dominion archives  hearnes second expedition though more protracted than the first was doomed also to failure  the little party followed on the former 43 trail along the seal river and thence with the first signs of opening spring struck northwards over the barren grounds  leaving the woods entirely behind hearne found himself in the broken and desolate country between fort churchill and the three or four great rivers still almost unknown that flow into the headwaters of chesterfield inlet  in the beginning of june as the snow began to melt progress grew more and more difficult  snowshoes became a useless encumbrance and on the 10th of the month even the sledges were abandoned  every man must now shoulder a heavy load  hearne himself staggered under a pack which included a bag of clothes a box of papers a hatchet and other tools and the clumsy weight of his quadrant and its stand  this article was too precious to be entrusted to the indians for by it alone could the position of the explorers be recorded  the party was miserably equipped  unable to carry poles with them into a woodless region they found their one wretched tent of no service and were compelled to lie shelterless with alternations of bitter cold and drenching rain  for food they had to depend on such fish and game as could be found  in most cases it was eaten raw as they had nothing with which to make a fire  44 worse still for days together food failed them  hearne relates that for four days at the end of june he tramped northward making twenty miles a day with no other sustenance than water and such support as might be drawn from an occasional pipe of tobacco  intermittent starvation so enfeebled his digestion that the eating of food when found caused severe pain  once for seven days the party had no other food than a few wild berries some old leather and some burnt bones  on such occasions as this hearne tells us his indians would examine their wardrobe to see what part could be best spared and stay their hunger with a piece of rotten deer skin or a pair of wornout moccasins  as they made their way northward the party occasionally crossed small rivers running north and east but of so little depth that they were able to ford them  presently however one great river proved too deep to cross on foot  it ran northeast hearnes indians called it the cathawachaga and the canadian explorer tyrrell identifies it with the river now called the kazan  here the party fell in with a band of indians who carried them across the river in their canoes  on the northern side of the cathawachaga hearne and his men rested for a week finding 45 a few deer and catching fish as the guides now said that in the country beyond there were other large rivers hearne bought a canoe from one of the indians and gave in exchange for it a knife which had cost a penny in england  in july the travellers moved on northwestward with better fortune deer became plentiful  bands of roving indian hunters now attached themselves to the exploring party  hearnes guide declared that it would be impossible to reach the coppermine that season and that they must spend a winter in the indian country  the truth was that hearnes followers had no intention of going farther to the north but preferred to keep company with the bands of hunters  it was useless for hearne to protest  he and his indians drifted along to the west with the hunting parties now so numerous that by the end of july about seventy deerskin tents were pitched so as to form a little village  there were about six hundred persons in the party  each morning as they broke camp and set out on the march the whole ground for a large space around wrote hearne seemed to be alive with men women children and dogs  the country through which hearne travelled or wandered in this midsummer of 1770 46 between the rivers kazan and dubawnt was barren indeed  there were no trees and no vegetation except moss and the plant called by the indians wishacapuccathe labrador tea that is found everywhere in the swamps of the northern forests  animal life was however abundant  the caribou roaming the barren grounds in the summer to graze on the moss were numerous  there was ample food for all the party and the animals were indeed slaughtered recklessly merely for the skins and the more delicate morsels of the flesh  the dubawnt river midway in its course expands into dubawnt lake a great sheet of water some sixtyfive miles long and forty miles broad it lies in the same latitude as the south of greenland  no more desolate scene can be imagined than the picture revealed by modern photographs of the country  the low shores of the lake offer an endless prospect of barren rock and broken stone  in the century and a half that have elapsed since hearnes journey only one or two intrepid explorers have made their way through this region  it still lies and probably will lie for centuries unreclaimed and unreclaimable for the uses of civilization  hearne and his indian hunters moved 47 westward and southward passing in a circle round the west shore of lake dubawnt though at a distance of some miles from it  the luckless travellers had now but little chance of reaching the object of their search  they were hundreds of miles away even from the head waters of the coppermine the season was already late the indian guides were quite unmanageable while the natives whom hearne met clamoured greedily for european wares ammunition and medicine and cried out in disgust at his inability to supply their wants  then came an accident fortunate perhaps that compelled hearne to abandon his enterprise  while he was taking his noon observations which showed him to be in latitude 63° 10 north he left his quadrant standing and sat down on the rocks to eat his dinner  a sudden gust of wind dashed the delicate instrument to the ground where it lay in fragments  this capped the climax  unable any longer to ascertain his exact whereabouts with no trustworthy guidance and no prospect of winter supplies or equipment hearne turned back towards the south this was on august 12 after a journey of nearly six months into the unknown north  the return occupied three months and a 48 half  they were filled with hardship  on the very first day of the long march a band of indians from the north finding hearne defenceless plundered him of wellnigh all he had  nothing can exceed wrote hearne the cool deliberation of the villains  a committee of them entered my tent the ringleader seated himself on my left hand  they first begged me to lend them my skipertogan1 to fill a pipe of tobacco  after smoking two or three pipes they asked me for several articles which i had not and among others for a pack of cards but on my answering that i had not any of the articles they mentioned one of them put his hand on my baggage and asked if it was mine  before i could answer in the affirmative he and the rest of his companions six in number had all my treasure spread on the ground  one took one thing and one another till at last nothing was left but the empty bag which they permitted me to keep  at hearnes urgent request a few necessary articles were restored to him  from his indian guides also the marauders took all they had except their guns a little ammunition and a few tools  thus miserably equipped hearne and his 49 followers set out for home  their only tent consisted of a blanket thrown over three long sticks  they had no winter clothing neither snowshoes nor sleds and their food was such as could be found by the way  the month of september was unusually severe and when the winter set in the party suffered intensely from the cold while the want of snowshoes made their march increasingly difficult  the marvel is that hearne ever reached the fort at all  he would not have done so very probably had it not been his fortune to fall in with an indian chief named matonabbee a man of strange and exceptional character to whom he owed not only his return to fort prince of wales but his subsequent successful journey to the coppermine  this indian chief when he fell in with hearne september 20 1770 was crossing the barren grounds on his way to the fort with furs  as a young man matonabbee had resided for years among the english  he had some knowledge of the language and was able to understand that a certain merit would attach to the rescue of hearne from his predicament  moreover the chief had himself been to the coppermine river and it was partly owing to his account of it that governor 50 norton had sent hearne into the barren grounds  illustration fort churchill or prince of wales  drawn by samuel hearne  matonabbee hastened to relieve the young explorers sufferings  he provided him with warm deerskins and from his ample supplies prepared a great feast for the good cheer of his new acquaintance  an orgy of eating followed dear to the indian heart and after this without firewater to drink the indians sang and danced about the fires of the bivouac  matonabbee and hearne travelled together for several days towards the fort making only about twelve miles a day the indian then directed hearne to go eastward to a little river where wood enough could be found for snowshoes and sledges while he himself went forward at such a slow pace as to allow hearne and his party to overtake him  this was done and hearne now better equipped rejoined matonabbee after which they continued together for a fortnight making good progress over the snow  as they drew near the fort their ammunition was almost spent and the game had almost disappeared  by matonabbees advice hearne accompanied by four indians left the main party in order to hasten ahead as rapidly as possible  the daylight was now exceedingly short but the moon and the aurora borealis 51 illuminated the brilliant waste of snow  the weather was intensely cold  one of hearnes dogs was frozen to death  but in spite of hardship the advance party reached fort prince of wales safe and sound on november 25 1770  matonabbee arrived a few days later  strange as it may seem hearne was off again in less than a fortnight on his third quest of the coppermine  the time that he had spent in matonabbees company had given him a great opinion of the character of the chief the most sociable kind and sensible indian i have ever metso hearne described him  the chief himself had offered to lead hearne to the great river of the north  governor norton willingly furnished ammunition supplies and a few trading goods  the expedition started in the depth of winter  but this time with better information to guide them the travellers made no attempt to strike directly northward  instead they moved towards the west so as to cross the lower reaches of the barren grounds as soon as possible and proceed northward by way of the basin of the great slave lake where they would find a wooded country reaching far to the north  a glance at the map will show the immensity of the task before them  the distance from fort churchill 52 to the slave lake even as the crow flies is some seven hundred miles and from thence to the arctic sea four hundred and fifty and the actual journey is longer by reason of the sinuous course which the explorer must of necessity pursue  the whole of this vast country was as yet unknown no white man had looked upon the mackenzie river nor upon the vast lakes from which it flows it speaks well for the quiet intrepidity of hearne that he was ready alone to penetrate the trackless waste of an unknown country among a band of savages and amid the rigour of the northern winter  the journey opened gloomily enough  the month of december was spent in toiling painfully over the barren grounds  the sledges were insufficient and hearne as well as his companions had to trudge under the burden of a heavy load  at best some sixteen or eighteen miles could be traversed in the short northern day  intense cold set in game seemed to have vanished and christmas found the party plodding wearily onward foodless moving farther each day from the little outpost of civilization that lay behind them on the bleak shores of hudson bay   i must confess wrote hearne in his 53 journal that i never spent so dull a christmas and when i recollected the merry season which was then passing and reflected on the immense quantities and great variety of delicacies which were then expending in every part of christendom i could not refrain from wishing myself again in europe if it had only been to have had an opportunity of alleviating the extreme hunger that i suffered with the refuse of the table of one of my acquaintances   at the end of the month december 1770 they reached the woods a thick growth of stunted pine and poplar with willow bushes growing in the frozen swamps  here they joined a large party of matonabbees band for the most part women and children  the women were by no means considered by the chief as a hindrance to the expedition  indeed he attributed hearnes previous failure to their absence  women he once told his english friend were made for labour one of them can carry or haul as much as two men can do they pitch our tents make and mend our clothing and in fact there is no such thing as travelling in this country for any length of 54 time without their assistance women he added though they do everything are maintained at a trifling expense for as they always stand cook the very licking of their fingers in scarce times is sufficient for their subsistence acting on these salutary opinions the chief was a man of eight wives and hearne was shocked later on to find the indian willing to add to his little flock by force without the slightest compunction  the two opening months of the year 1771 were spent in travelling westward towards wholdaia lake  the country was wooded though here and there the observer standing on the higher levels could see the barren grounds to the northward  the cold was intense especially when a frozen lake or river exposed the travellers to the full force of the wind  but game was plentiful  at intervals the party halted and killed caribou in such quantities that three and four days were sometimes spent in camp in a vain attempt to eat the spoils of the chase  the indians hearne remarked slaughtered the game recklessly with no thought of the morrow  wholdaia lake was reached on march 2  this is a long sheet of water lying some thirty miles north of the parallel of sixty degrees  at 55 the point where hearne crossed it on the ice it was twentyseven miles broad its length appears to be four or five times as great  it is still almost unknown for it lies far beyond the confines of present settlement and has been seen only by explorers  from wholdaia lake the course was continued westward  the weather was moderate  there was abundant game the skies overhead were bright and the journey assumed a more agreeable aspect  here and there bands of roving indians were seen as also were encampments of hunters engaged in snaring deer in the forest  in the middle of april the party rested for ten days in camp beside a little lake which marked the westward limit of their march  from here on the course was to lie northward again  the indians were therefore employed in gathering staves and birchbark to be used for tent poles and canoes when the party should again reach the barren grounds on their northern route  the opening of may found the party at lake clowey whose waters run westward to the great slave lake  here they again halted and the indians built birchbark canoes out of the material they had carried from the woods  in traversing the barren grounds where both the 56 direction and the nature of the rivers render them almost useless for navigation the canoe plays a part different from that which is familiar throughout the rest of canada  during the greater part of the journey often for a stretch of a hundred miles at a time the canoe is absolutely useless or worse since it must be carried  here and there however for the crossing of the larger rivers it is indispensable  large numbers of indians were assembling at clowey lake during hearnes stay there and were likewise engaged in building canoes  a considerable body of them hearing that matonabbee and his band were on the way to the coppermine eagerly agreed to travel with them  it seemed to them an excellent opportunity for making a combined attack on their hereditary enemy the eskimos at the mouth of the river  the savages thereupon set themselves to make wooden shields about three feet long with which to ward off the arrows of the eskimos  on may 20 a new start was made to the north  matonabbee and his great company of armed indians now assumed the appearance of a war party and hurried eagerly towards the enemys country  two days after leaving lake clowey they passed out of the woods on 57 to the barren grounds  to facilitate their movements most of the women were presently left behind together with the children and dogs  a number of the braves weary already of the prospect of the long march turned back but matonabbee hearne and about one hundred and fifty indians held on with all speed towards the north  their path as traced on a modern map runs by way of clintoncolden and aylmer lakes and thence northward to the mouth of the coppermine  by the latter part of june the ice was breaking up and on the 22nd the party made use of their canoes which had been carried for over a month in order to cross a great river rejoicing in the ponderous name of the congecathawachaga on the farther side they met a number of copper indians who were delighted to learn of matonabbees hostile design against the eskimos they eagerly joined the party celebrating their accession by a great feast  the copper indians expressed their pleasure at learning from hearne that the great king their father proposed to send ships to visit them by the northern sea  they had never seen a white man before and examined hearne with great curiosity disapproving strongly of the colour of his skin and comparing his hair to a stained buffalo tail  58  the whole party moved on together  the weather was bad with alternating sleet and rain and the path broken and difficult  july 4 found them at the stony mountains a rugged and barren set of hills that seemed from a distance like a pile of broken stones  nine days more of arduous travel brought the warriors in sight of their goal from the elevation of the low hills that rose above its banks hearne was able to look upon the foaming waters of the coppermine as it plunged over the broken stones of its bed in a series of cascades  a few trees or rather a few burnt stumps fringed the banks but the trees which here and there remained unburned were so crooked and dwarfish as merely to heighten the desolation of the scene  immediately on their arrival at the coppermine matonabbee and his indians began to make their preparations for an attack upon the eskimos who were known to frequent the mouth of the river  spies were sent out in advance towards the sea and the remainder of the indians showed an unwonted and ominous energy in building fires and roasting meat so that they might carry with them a supply so large as to make it unnecessary to alarm the eskimos by the sound of the guns of the hunters 59 in search of food  hearne occupied himself with surveying the river  he was sick at heart at the scene of bloodshed which he anticipated but was powerless to dissuade his companions from their design  two days later july 15 1771 the spies brought back word that a camp of eskimos five tents in all had been seen on the further side of the river  it was distant about twelve miles and favourably situated for a surprise  matonabbee and his braves were now filled with the fierce eagerness of the savage they crossed hurriedly to the west side of the river where each indian painted the shield that he carried with rude daubs of red and black to imitate the spirits of the earth and air on whom he relied for aid in the coming fight noiselessly the indians proceeded along the banks of the river trailing in a serpentine course among the rocks so as to avoid being seen upon the higher ground  they seemed to hearne to have been suddenly transformed from an undisciplined rabble into a united band northern and copper indians alike were animated by a single purpose and readily shared with one another the weapons of their common stock  the advance was made in the middle of the night but at this season of the year the whole 60 scene was brilliant with the light of the midnight sun  the indians stole to within two hundred yards of the place indicated by the guides  from their ambush among the rocks they could look out upon the tents of their sleeping victims  the camp of the eskimos stood on a broad ledge of rock at the spot where the coppermine narrowed between lofty walls of red sandstone roars foaming over a cataract some three hundred yards in extent  the indians sure of their prey paused a few moments to make final preparations for the onslaught  they cast aside their outer garments bound back their hair from their eyes and hurriedly painted their foreheads and faces with a hideous coating of red and black  then with weapons in hand they rushed forth upon their sleeping foe  hearne unable to leave the spot was compelled to witness in all its details the awful slaughter which followed   in a few seconds he wrote in his journal the horrible scene commenced it was shocking beyond description the poor unhappy victims were surprised in the midst of their sleep and had neither time nor power to make any resistance men 61 women and children in all upwards of twenty ran out of their tents stark naked and endeavoured to make their escape but the indians having possession of all the landside to no place could they fly for shelter  one alternative only remained that of jumping into the river but as none of them attempted it they all fell a sacrifice to indian barbarity  the shrieks and groans of the poor expiring wretches were truly dreadful   but it is needless to linger on the details of the massacre which hearne was thus compelled to witness and the revolting mutilation of the corpses which followed it  to matonabbee and the other indians the whole occurrence was viewed as a proper incident of tribal war and the feeble protests which hearne contrived to make only drew down upon him the expression of their contempt  after the massacre followed plunder  the indians tore down the tents of the eskimos and with reckless folly threw tents tent poles and great quantities of food into the waters of the cataract  having made a feast of fresh fish on the ruins of the camp they then announced to hearne that they were ready to assist him in 62 going on to the mouth of the river  the desolate scene was left behindthe broad rock strewn with mangled bodies of the dead and the broken remnants of their poor belongings  half a century later the explorer franklin visited the spot and saw the skulls and bones of the eskimos still lying about one of franklins indians then an aged man had been a witness of the scene  from the hills beside the bloody falls as the cataract is called the eye could discern at a distance of some eight miles the open water of the arctic and the glitter of the ice beyond  hearne followed the river along its precipitous and broken course till he stood upon the shore of the sea  one may imagine with what emotion he looked out upon that northern ocean to reach which he had braved the terrors of the arctic winter and the famine of the barren grounds  he saw before him about threequarters of a mile of open sea studded with rocks and little islands beyond that the clear white of the icepack stretched to the farthest horizon  hearne viewed this scene in the bright sunlight of the northern day but while he still lingered thick fog and drizzling rain rolled in from the sea and shut out the view  for the sake of form as he said he 63 erected a pile of stones and took possession of the coast in the name of the hudsons bay company  then filled with the bitterness of a vain quest hearne turned his face towards the south to commence his long march to the settlements  up to this point nothing had been seen of the supposed mountains of copper which formed the principal goal of hearnes undertaking  the eagerness of the indians had led them to hasten directly to the camp of the eskimos regardless of all else  but on the second day of the journey home the guides led hearne to the site of this northern eldorado  it lay among the hills beside the coppermine river at a spot thirty miles from the sea and almost directly south of the mouth of the river  the prospect was strange  some mighty force as of an earthquake seemed to have rent asunder the solid rock and strewn it in a confused and broken heap of boulders  through these a rivulet ran to join the coppermine  here said the indians was copper so great in quantity that it could be gathered as easily as one might gather stones at churchill  filled with a new eagerness hearne and his companions searched for four hours among the rocks  here and there a few splinters of native 64 copper were seen  one piece alone weighing some four pounds offered a slight reward for their quest  this hearne carried away with him convinced now that the mountain of copper and the inexhaustible wealth of the district were mere fictions created by the cupidity of the savages or by the natural mystery surrounding a region so grim and inaccessible as the rocky gorge by which the coppermine rushes to the cold seas of the north  after hearnes visit no explorer reached the lower waters of the coppermine till captain afterwards sir john franklin made his memorable and marvellous overland journey of 1821  since franklins time the region has been crossed only two or three times by explorers they agree in stating that loose copper and copper ore are freely found  but it does not seem that since 1771 any white man has ever looked upon the valley of the great boulders which the indians described to hearne as containing a fabulous wealth of copper  the solitary piece of metal which he brought home is still preserved by the hudsons bay company  there is no need to follow in detail the long journey which hearne had to take in order to 65 return to the fort  the march lasted nearly a year during which he was exposed to the same hardship famine and danger as on his way to the sea  the route followed on the return was different  the party ascended the valley of the coppermine as far as point lake a considerable body of water visited later by franklin and distant one hundred and sixty miles from the sea  this was reached on september 3 1771  four months were spent in travelling almost directly south  they passed over a rugged country of stone and marsh buried deep in snow with here and there a clump of stunted pine or straggling willow  bitter weather with great gales and deep snow set in in october  snowshoes and sledges were made  many small lakes and rivers now fast frozen were traversed but the whole country is still so little known that hearnes path can hardly be traced with certainty by the middle of november the clumps of trees thickened into the northern edge of the great forest  the way now became easier  they had better shelter from the wind and firewood was abundant  for food the party carried dried meat from point lake and as they passed into the thicker woods they were fortunate enough to find a few rabbits and wood partridges  66 some fish were caught through the ice of the river  but in nearly two months of walking only two deer were seen  on christmas eve hearne found himself on the shores of a great frozen lake so vast that as the indians rightly informed him it reached three hundred miles east and west  this is the great slave lake hearne speaks of it as athaspuscow lake  the latter name is the same as that now given to another lake athabaska of canadian mapsthe word being descriptive and meaning the lake with the beds of reeds  hearne and his party crossed the great lake on the ice  a new prospect now opened  deer and beaver were plentiful among the islands  great quantities of fine fish abounded in the waters under the ice  as they reached the southern shore the jumble of rocks and hills and stunted trees of the barren north was left behind and the travellers entered a fine level country over which wandered great herds of buffalo and moose  for about forty miles they ascended the course of the athabaska river finding themselves among splendid woods with tall pines and poplars such as hearne had never seen  from the athabaska they struck eastward plunging into so dense a forest that 67 at times the axes had to be used to clear the way  for two months january and february of 1772 they made their way through the northern forest  the month of march found them clear of the level country of the athabaska and entering upon the hilly and broken region which formed the territory of the northern indians  at the end of march the first thaws began rendering walking difficult in the bush  in traversing the open lakes and plains they were frequently exposed to the violent gales of the equinoctial season  by the middle of april the signs of spring were apparent  flocks of waterfowl were seen overhead flying to the north their course was shaped directly to the east so that the party were presently traversing the same route as on their outward journey and making towards wholdaia lake  the month of may opened with fine weather and great thaws  such intense heat was experienced in the first week of this month that for some days a march of twelve miles a day was all that the travellers could accomplish  canoes were now built for the passage of the lakes and rivers  by may 25 the expedition was clear of all the woods and out on the barren grounds they passed the cathawachaga river still covered with ice 68 on the last day of may  a month of travel over the barren grounds brought them on the last day of june 1772 to the desolate but welcome surroundings of fort prince of wales  hearne had been absent on his last journey one year six months and twentythree days  from his first journey into the wilderness until his final return there had elapsed two years seven months and twentyfour days  hearne was not left without honour  the hudsons bay company retained him in their service at various factories and three years after his famous expedition they made him governor of fort prince of wales during his service there he had the melancholy celebrity of surrendering the great fort unfortunately left without men enough to defend it to a french fleet under admiral la pérouse  among the spoils of the captors was hearnes manuscript journal which the generous victors returned on the sole condition that it should be published as soon as possible  hearne returned to england in 1787 and was chiefly busied with revising and preparing his journal until his death in 1792  no better appreciation of his work has been written than the words with which he concludes the account of his safe return after his years 69 of wandering  though my discoveries he writes are not likely to prove of any material advantage to the nation at large or indeed to the hudsons bay company yet i have the pleasure to think that i have fully complied with the orders of my masters and that it has put a final end to all disputes concerning a northwest passage through hudsons bay    1 bag for flint and steel tobacco etc     70  chapter iii  mackenzie descends the great river of the north  the next great landmark in the exploration of the far north is the famous voyage of alexander mackenzie down the river which bears his name and which he traced to its outlet into the arctic ocean  this was in 1789  by that time the pacific coast of america and the coast of siberia over against it had already been explored  even before hearnes journey the danish navigator bering sailing in the employ of the russian government had discovered the strait which separates asia from america and which commemorates his name  four years after hearnes return 1776 the famous navigator captain cook had explored the whole range of the american coast to the north of what is now british columbia had passed bering strait and had sailed along the arctic coast as far as icy cape  illustration sir alexander mackenzie  from the painting by sir t lawrence  the general outline of the north of the 71 continent of america and at any rate the vast distance to be traversed to reach the pacific from the atlantic could now be surmised with some accuracy  but the internal geography of the continent still contained an unsolved mystery  it was known that vast bodies of fresh water far beyond the basin of the saskatchewan and the columbia emptied towards the north hearne had revealed the existence of the great slave lake and the advance of daring furtraders into the north had brought some knowledge of the great stream called the peace which rises far in the mountains of the west and joins its waters to lake athabaska  it was known that this river after issuing from the athabaska lake moved onwards as a new river in a vast flood towards the north carrying with it the tribute of uncounted streams  these rivers did not flow into the pacific  nor could so great a volume of water make its way to the sea through the shallow torrent of the coppermine or the rivers that flowed northeastward over the barren grounds  there must exist somewhere a mighty river of the north running to the frozen seas  it fell to the lot of alexander mackenzie to find the solution of this problem  the 72 circumstances which led to his famous journey arose out of the progress of the fur trade and its extension into the far west  the british possession of canada in 1760 had created a new situation  the monopoly enjoyed by the hudsons bay company was rudely disturbed  enterprising british traders from montreal passing up the great lakes made their way to the valley of the saskatchewan and whether legally or not contrived to obtain an increasing share of the furs brought from the interior  these traders were at first divided into partnerships and small groups but presently for the sake of cooperation and joint defence they combined 1787 into the powerful body known as the northwest company which from now on entered into desperate competition with the great corporation that had first occupied the field  the hudsons bay company and its rival sought to carry their operations as far inland as possible in order to tap the supplies at their source  they penetrated the valleys of the assiniboine the red and the saskatchewan rivers and founded among others the forts which were destined to become the present cities of winnipeg brandon and edmonton  the annals of northwest canada during the next thirtythree years are made up of the 73 recital of the commercial rivalry and at times the actual conflict under arms of the two great trading companies  it was in the service of the northwest company that alexander mackenzie made his famous journey  he had arrived in canada in 1779 after five years spent in the countinghouse of a trading company at montreal he had been assigned for a year to a post at detroit and in 1785 had been elevated to the dignity of a bourgeois or partner in the northwest company  in this capacity alexander mackenzie was sent out to the athabaska district to take control in that vast and scarcely known region of the posts of the traders now united into the northwest company  a glance at the map of canada will show the commanding geographical position occupied by lake athabaska in a country where the waterways formed the only means of communication  it receives from the south and west the great streams of the athabaska and the peace which thus connect it with the prairies of the saskatchewan valley and with the rocky mountains  eastward a chain of lakes and rivers connects it and the forest country which lies about it with the barren grounds and the forts on hudson bay while to the north 74 issuing from lake athabaska a great and unknown river led into the forests moving towards an unknown sea  it was mackenzies first intention to make lake athabaska the frontier of the operations of his company  acting under his instructions his cousin roderick mackenzie who served with him selected a fine site on a cape on the south side of the lake and erected the post that was named fort chipewyan  beautifully situated with good timber and splendid fisheries and easy communication in all directions the fort rapidly became the central point of trade and travel in the far northwest  but it was hardly founded before mackenzie had already conceived a wider scheme  chipewyan should be the emporium but not the outpost of the fur trade using it as a base he would descend the great unknown waterway which led north and thus bring into the sphere of the companys operations the whole region between lake athabaska and the northern sea  alexander mackenzies object was in name at least commercialthe extension of the trade of the northwest company  but in reality his incentive was that instinctive desire to widen the bounds of geographical knowledge and to roll back the 75 mystery of unknown lands and seas which had already raised hearne to eminence and which later on was to lead franklin to his glorious disaster  it was on wednesday june 3 1789 that alexander mackenzies little flotilla of four birchbark canoes set out across lake athabaska on its way to the north  in mackenzies canoe were four frenchcanadian voyageurs two of them accompanied by their wives and a german  two other canoes were filled with indians who were to act as guides and interpreters  at their head was a notable brave who had been one of the band of matonabbee hearnes famous guide  from his frequent visits to the english post at fort churchill he had acquired the name of the english chief  another canoe was in charge of leroux a frenchcanadian in the service of the company who had already descended the slave river as far as the great slave lake  leroux and his men carried trading goods and supplies  the first part of the journey was by a route already known  the voyageurs paddled across the twenty miles of water which here forms the breadth of lake athabaska entered a river running from the lake and followed its 76 winding stream  they encamped at night seven miles from the lake  the next morning at four oclock the canoes were on their way again descending the winding river through a low forest of birch and willow  after a paddle of ten miles a bend in the little river brought the canoes out upon the broad stream of the peace river its waters here being upwards of a mile wide and running with a strong current to the north  on our modern maps this great stream after it leaves lake athabaska is called the slave river but it is really one and the same mighty river carrying its waters from the valleys of british columbia through the gorges of the rocky mountains passing into the great slave lake and then under the name of the mackenzie emptying into the arctic  in the next five days mackenzies canoes successfully descended the river to the great slave lake a distance of some two hundred and thirtyfive miles  the journey was not without its dangers  the slave river has a varied course at times it broadens out into a great sheet of water six miles across flowing with a gentle current and carrying the light canoes gently upon its unruffled surface  in other places it is confined into a narrow channel breaks into swift eddies and pours in 77 boiling rapids over the jagged rocks  over the upper rapids of the river mackenzie and his men were able to run their canoes fully laden but lower down were long and arduous portages rendered dangerous by the masses of broken ice still clinging to the banks of the river  as they neared the great slave lake boisterous gales from the northeast lashed the surface of the river into foam and brought violent showers of rain  but the voyageurs were trained men accustomed to face the dangers of northern navigation  a week of travel brought them on june 9 to the great slave lake  it was still early in the season  the rigour of winter was not yet relaxed  as far as the eye could see the surface of the lake presented an unbroken sheet of ice  only along the shore had narrow lanes of open water appeared  the weather was bitterly cold and there was no immediate prospect of the breakup of the ice  for a fortnight mackenzie and his party remained at the lake skirting its shores as best they could and searching among the bays and islands of its western end for the outlet towards the north which they knew must exist  heavy rain alternating with bitter cold caused them much hardship  at times it froze so 78 hard that a thin sheet of new ice covered even the open water of the lake  but as the month advanced the mass of old ice began slowly to break strong winds drove it towards the north and the canoes were presently able to pass with great danger and difficulty among the broken floes  mackenzie met a band of yellow knife indians who assured him that a great river ran out of the west end of the lake and offered a guide to aid him in finding the channel among the islands and sandbars of the lake  convinced that his search would be successful mackenzie took all the remaining supplies into his canoes and sent back leroux to chipewyan with the news that he had gone north down the great river  but even after obtaining his guide mackenzie spent four days searching for the outlet  it was not till the end of the month of june that his search was rewarded and at the extreme southwest the lake after stretching out among islands and shallows was found to contract into the channel of a river  the first day of july saw mackenzies canoes floating down the stream that bears his name  from now on progress became easier  at this latitude and season the northern day gave the voyageurs twenty hours of sunlight in each day 79 and with smooth water and a favouring current the descent was rapid  five days after leaving the great slave lake the canoes reached the region where the waters of the great bear lake then still unknown drain into the mackenzie  the indians of this district seemed entirely different from those known at the trading posts  at the sight of the canoes and the equipment of the voyageurs they made off and hid among the rocks and trees beside the river mackenzies indians contrived to make themselves understood by calling out to them in the chipewyan language but the strange indians showed the greatest reluctance and apprehension and only with difficulty allowed mackenzies people to come among them  mackenzie notes the peculiar fact that they seemed unacquainted with tobacco and that even firewater was accepted by them rather from fear of offending than from any inclination  knives hatchets and tools however they took with great eagerness  on learning of mackenzies design to go on towards the north they endeavoured with every possible expression of horror to induce him to turn back  the sea they said was so far away that winter after winter must pass before mackenzie could hope to reach it he would be an old man 80 before he could complete the voyage  more than this the river so they averred fell over great cataracts which no one could pass he would find no animals and no food for his men the whole country was haunted by monsters  mackenzie was not to be deterred by such childish and obviously interested terrors  his interpreters explained that he had no fear of the horrors that they depicted and by a heavy bribe consisting of a kettle an axe and a knife he succeeded in enlisting the services of one of the indians as a guide  that the terror of the far north professed by these indians or at any rate the terror of going there in strange company was not wholly imaginary was made plain from the conduct of the guide  when the time came to depart he showed every sign of anxiety and fear he sought in vain to induce his friends to take his place finding that he must go he reluctantly bade farewell to his wife and children cutting off a lock of his hair and dividing it into three parts which he fastened to the hair of each of them  on july 5 the party set out with their new guide and on the same afternoon passed the mouth of the great bear river which joins the mackenzie in a flood of seagreen water fresh but coloured like that of the ocean  below 81 this point they passed many islands  the banks of the river rose to high mountains covered with snow  the country so the guide said was here filled with bears but the voyageurs saw nothing worse than mosquitoes which descended in clouds upon the canoes  as the party went on to the north the guide seemed more and more stricken with fear and consumed with the longing to return to his people  in the morning after breaking camp nothing but force would induce him to embark and on the fourth night during the confusion of a violent thunderstorm he made off and was seen no more  the next day however mackenzie supplied his place this time by force from a band of roving indians  the new guide told him that the sea was not far away and that it could be reached in ten days  as the journey continued the river was broken into so many channels and so dotted with islands that it was almost impossible to decide which was the main waterway  the guides advice was evidently influenced by his desire to avoid the eskimos and like his predecessor to keep away from the supposed terrors of the north  the shores of the river were now at times low though usually lofty mountains could be seen about ten miles 82 away  trees were still present especially fir and birch though in places both shores of the river were entirely bare and the islands were mere banks of sand and mud to which great masses of ice adhered  an observation taken on july 10 showed that the voyageurs had reached latitude 67° 47 north  from the extreme variation of the compass and from other signs mackenzie was now certain that he was approaching the northern ocean  he was assured that in a few days more of travel he could reach its shores  but in the meantime his provisions were running low  his indian guide a prey to fantastic terrors endeavoured to dissuade him from his purpose while his canoe men now far beyond the utmost limits of the country known to the fur trade began to share the apprehensions of the guide and clamoured eagerly for return  mackenzie himself was of the opinion that it would not be possible for him to return to chipewyan while the rivers were still open and that the approach of winter must surprise him in these northern solitudes  but in spite of this he could not bring himself to turn back  with his men he stipulated for seven days if the northern ocean were not found in that time he would turn south again  83  the expedition went forward  on july 10 they made a course of thirtytwo miles the river sweeping with a strong current through a low flat country a mountain range still visible in the west and reaching out towards the north  at the spot where they pitched their tents at night on the river bank they could see the traces of an encampment of eskimos  the sun shone brilliantly the whole night never descending below the horizon  mackenzie sat up all night observing its course in the sky  at a quarter to four in the morning the canoes were off again the river winding and turning in its course but heading for the northwest  here and there on the banks they saw traces of the eskimos the marks of camp fires and the remains of huts made of driftwood covered with grass and willows  this day the canoes travelled fiftyfour miles  the prospect about the travellers was gloomy and dispiriting  the low banks of the river were now almost treeless except that here and there grew stunted willow not more than three feet in height  the weather was cloudy and raw with gusts of rain at intervals  the discontent of mackenzies companions grew apace the guide was evidently at the end of his knowledge while the violent rain the biting cold 84 and the fear of an attack by hostile savages kept the voyageurs in a continual state of apprehension  july 12 was marked by continued cold and the canoes traversed a country so bare and naked that scarcely a shrub could be seen  at one place the land rose in high banks above the river and was bright with short grass and flowers though all the lower shore was now thick with ice and snow and even in the warmer spots the soil was only thawed to a depth of four inches  here also were seen more eskimo huts with fragments of sledges a square stone kettle and other utensils lying about  mackenzie was now at the very delta of the great river where it discharges its waters broken into numerous and intricate channels into the arctic ocean  on sunday july 12 the party encamped on an island that rose to a considerable eminence among the flat and dreary waste of broken land and ice in which the travellers now found themselves  the channels of the river had here widened into great sheets of water so shallow that for stretches of many miles east and west the depth never exceeded five feet  mackenzie and english chief his principal follower ascended to the highest ground on the island 85 from which they were able to command a wide view in all directions  to the south of them lay the tortuous and complicated channels of the broad river which they had descended east and north were islands in great number but on the westward side the eye could discern the broad field of solid ice that marked the arctic ocean  mackenzie had reached the goal of his endeavours  his followers when they learned that the open sea the mer douest as they called it was in sight were transformed instead of sullen illwill they manifested the highest degree of confidence and eager expectation they declared their readiness to follow their leader wherever he wished to go and begged that he would not turn back without actually reaching the shore of the unknown sea  but in reality they had already reached it  that evening when their camp was pitched and they were about to retire to sleep under the full light of the unsinking sun the inrush of the arctic tide threatening to swamp their baggage and drown out their tents proved beyond all doubt that they were now actually on the shore of the ocean  for three days mackenzie remained beside the arctic ocean  heavy gales blew in from 86 the northwest and in the open water to the westward whales were seen  mackenzie and his men in their exultation at this final proof of their whereabouts were rash enough to start in pursuit in a canoe  fortunately a thick curtain of fog fell on the ocean and terminated the chase  in memory of the occurrence mackenzie called his island whale island  on the morning of july 14 1789 mackenzie convinced that his search had succeeded ordered a post to be erected on the island beside his tents on which he carved the latitude as he had calculated it 69° 14 north his own name the number of persons who were with him and the time that was spent there  this day mackenzie spent in camp for a great gale blowing with rain and bitter cold made it hazardous to embark  but on the next morning the canoes were headed for the south and the return journey was begun it was time indeed  only about five hundred pounds weight of supplies was now left in the canoesenough it was calculated to suffice for about twelve days  as the return journey might well occupy as many weeks the fate of the voyageurs must now depend on the chances of fishing and the chase  87  as a matter of fact the ascent of the river which mackenzie conducted with signal success and almost without incident occupied two months the weather was favourable  the wild gales which had been faced in the arctic delta were left behind and under mild skies and unending sunlight and with wild fowl abundant about them the canoes were urged steadily against the stream  the end of the month of july brought the explorers to the great bear river from this point an abundance of berries on the banks of the streamthe huckleberry the raspberry and the saskatoonafforded a welcome addition to their supplies  as they reached the narrower parts of the river where it flowed between high banks the swift current made paddling useless and compelled the men to haul the canoes with the towing line  at other times steady strong winds from the north enabled them to rig their sails and skim without effort over the broad surface of the river  mackenzie noted with interest the varied nature and the fine resources of the country of the upper river  at one place petroleum having the appearance of yellow wax was seen oozing from the rocks at another place a vast seam of coal in the river bank was observed to be burning  on august 22 the canoes were 88 driven over the last reaches of the mackenzie with a west wind strong and cold behind them and were carried out upon the broad bosom of the great slave lake  the voyageurs were once more in known country  the navigation of the lake now free from ice was without difficulty and the canoes drove at a furious rate over its waters  on august 24 three canoes were sighted sailing on the lake and were presently found to contain leroux and his party who had been carrying on the fur trade in that district during mackenzies absence  the rest of the journey offered no difficulty  there remained indeed some two hundred and sixty miles of paddle and portage to traverse the slave river and reach fort chipewyan  but to the stout arms of mackenzies trained voyageurs this was only a summer diversion  on september 12 1789 alexander mackenzie safely reached the fort  his voyage had occupied one hundred and two days  its successful completion brought to the world its first knowledge of that vast waterway of the northern country whose extensive resources in timber and coal in mineral and animal wealth still await development     89  chapter iv  the memorable exploits of sir john franklin  the generation now passing away can vividly recall as one of the deepest impressions of its childhood the profound and sustained interest excited by the mysterious fate of sir john franklin  his splendid record by sea and land the fact that he was one of nelsons men and had fought at copenhagen and trafalgar his feats as an explorer in the unknown wilds of north america and the torrid seas of australasia and more than these his high christian courage and his devotion to the flag and country that he servedall had made of franklin a hero whom the nation delighted to honour  his departure in 1846 with his two stout ships the erebus and the terror and a total company of one hundred and thirtyfour men including some of the ablest naval officers of the day was hailed with high hopes that the mysterious north would at length be 90 robbed of its secret  then as the years passed and the ships never returned and no message from the explorers came out of the silent north the nation defiant of difficulty and danger bent its energies towards the discovery of their fate  no less than fortytwo expeditions were sent out in search of the missing ships  the efforts of the government were seconded by the munificence of private individuals and by the generosity of naval officers who gladly gave their services for no other reward than the honour of the enterprise  the energies of the rescue parties were quickened by the devotion of lady franklin who refused to abandon hope and consecrated her every energy and her entire fortune to the search for her lost husband  her conduct and her ardent appeals awoke a chivalrous spirit at home and abroad men such as kane bellot mclintock and de haven volunteered their services in the cause  at length as with the passage of years anxiety deepened into despair and as little by little it was learned that all were lost the brave story of the death of franklin and his men wrote itself in imperishable letters on the hearts of their fellowcountrymen  it found no parallel till more than half a century later when another and a 91 similar tragedy in the silent snows of the antarctic called forth again the mingled pride and anguish with which britain honours the memory of those fallen in her cause  john franklin belonged to the school of naval officers trained in the prolonged struggle of the great war with france  he entered the royal navy in 1800 at fourteen years of age and within a year was engaged on his ship the polyphemus in the great seafight at copenhagen during the brief truce that broke the long war after 1801 franklin served under flinders the great explorer of the australasian seas  on his way home in 1803 he was shipwrecked in torres strait and with ninetythree others of the company of hms porpoise was cast up on a sandbar seven hundred and fifty miles from the nearest port  the party were rescued franklin reached england and at once set out on a voyage to the china seas in the service of the east india company during the voyage the merchant fleet with which he sailed offered battle to a squadron of french menofwar which fled before them  the next year saw franklin serving as signal midshipman on board the bellerophon at trafalgar  he remained in active service during the war served in america and was 92 wounded in the british attempt to capture new orleans  after the war franklin now a lieutenant found himself like so many other naval officers unable after the stirring life of the past fifteen years to settle into the dull routine of peace service  maritime discovery especially since his voyage with flinders had always fascinated his mind and he now offered himself for service in that arctic region with which his name will ever be associated  the long struggle of the war had halted the progress of discoveries in the northern seas  but on the conclusion of peace the attention of the nation and of naval men in particular was turned again towards the north  the admiralty naturally sought an opportunity of giving honourable service to their officers and men  great numbers of them had been thrown out of employment  some migrated to the colonies or even took service abroad  at the same time the writings of captain scoresby a whaling captain of scientific knowledge who published an account of the greenland seas and the influence of such men as sir john barrow the secretary of the admiralty did much to create a renewal of public interest in the north  it was now recognized that the northwest passage offered no commercial 93 attractions  but it was felt that it would not be for the honour of the nation that the splendid discoveries of hearne cook and mackenzie should remain uncompleted  to trace the arctic waterway from the atlantic to the pacific became now a supreme object not of commercial interest but of geographical research and of national pride  to this was added the fact that the progress of physical and natural science was opening up new fields of investigation for the explorers of the north  franklin first sailed north in 1818 as second in command of the first arctic expedition of the nineteenth century  two brigs hms dorothea under captain buchan and hms trent under lieutenant john franklin set out from the thames with a purpose which in audacity at least has never been surpassed  the new sentiment of supreme confidence in the navy inspired by the conquest of the seas is evinced by the fact that these two squarerigged sailing ships clumsy and antiquated built up with sundry extra beams inside and iron bands without were directed to sail straight north across the north pole and down the world on the other side  they did their best  they went churning northward through the foaming seas and when they found that 94 the ice was closing in on them and that they were being blown down upon it in a gale as on to a lee shore the order was given to put the helm up and charge full speed at the ice  it was the only possible way of escape and it meant either sudden and awful death under the ice floes or else the piling up of the ships safe on top of themtaking the ice as arctic sailors call it  the dorothea and the trent went driving at the ice with such a gale of snow about them that neither could see the other as they ran  they took the ice with a mighty crash amid a wild confusion of the elements and when the storm cleared the two old hulls lay shattered but safe on the surface of the icepack  the whole larboard side of the dorothea was smashed but they brought her somehow to spitzbergen and there by wonderful patching enabled her to sail home  the next year 1819 lieutenant franklin was off again on an arctic journey the record of which written by himself forms one of the most exciting stories of adventure ever written  the design this time was to follow the lead of hearne and mackenzie  beginning where their labours ended franklin proposed to embark on the polar sea in canoes and follow the coast line  franklin left england at the 95 end of may  he was accompanied by dr richardson a naval surgeon afterwards sir john richardson and second only to franklin himself as an explorer and writer midshipman back later on to be admiral sir george back midshipman hood and one hepburn a stouthearted sailor of the royal navy  they sailed in the hudsons bay company ship prince of wales and passed through the straits to york factory  thence by canoe they went inland up the hayes river through lake winnipeg and thence up the saskatchewan to cumberland house a hudsons bay fort established by samuel hearne a few years after his famous journey  from york factory to cumberland house was a journey of six hundred and ninety miles  but this was only a beginning  during the winter of 181920 franklin and his party made their way from cumberland house to fort chipewyan on lake athabaska a distance by the route traversed of eight hundred and fiftyseven miles  from this fort the party accompanied by canadian voyageurs and indian guides made their way in the summer of 1820 to fort providence a lonely post of the northwest company lying in latitude 62° on the northern shore of the great slave lake  96  these were the days of rivalry and even open war between the two great fur companies the hudsons bay and the northwest  the admiralty had commended franklins expeditions to the companies who were to be requisitioned for the necessary supplies  but the disorders of the fur trade and the demoralization of the indians owing to the free distribution of ardent spirits by the rival companies rendered it impossible for the party to obtain adequate supplies and stores undeterred by difficulties franklin set out from fort providence to make his way to the arctic seas at the mouth of the coppermine  the expedition reached the height of land between the great slave lake and the coppermine on the borders of the country which had been the scene of hearnes exploits  the northern forest is here reduced to a thin growth of stunted pine and willow  it was now the end of august  the brief northern summer was drawing to its close  it was impossible to undertake the navigation of the arctic coast till the ensuing summer franklin and his party built some rude log shanties which they called fort enterprise  here after having traversed over two thousand miles in all from york factory they spent their second winter in the 97 north  it was a season of great hardship  with the poor materials at their hand it was impossible to make their huts weatherproof  the wind whistled through the illplastered seams of the logs  so intense was the winter cold that the trees about the fort froze hard to their centres  in cutting firewood the axes splintered as against stone  in the officers room the thermometer sixteen feet from the log fire marked as low as fifteen degrees below zero in the day and forty below at night  for food the party lived on deers meat with a little fish tea twice a day without sugar and on sunday a cup of chocolate as the luxury of the week to every man  but undismayed by cold and hardship they kept stoutly at their work  richardson investigated the mosses and lichens beneath the snow and acquainted himself with the mineralogy of the neighbourhood  franklin and the two lieutenants carried out observations their fingers freezing with the cold of fortysix below zero at noon of the brief threehour day in the heart of winter  sunday was a day of rest  the officers dressed in their best attire  franklin read the service of the church of england to his assembled company  for the frenchcanadian roman catholics franklin did the best he 98 could he read to them the creed of the church of england in french  in the leisure part of the day a bundle of london newspapers was perused again and again  the winter passed safely the party now entered upon the most arduous part of their undertaking  canoes were built and dragged on improvised sledges to the coppermine  franklin descended the river surveying its course as he went  he passed by the scene of the massacre witnessed by hearne and found himself late in july of 1821 on the shores of the arctic  the distance from fort enterprise was three hundred and thirtyfour miles for one hundred and seventeen of which the canoes and baggage had been hauled over snow and ice  franklin and his followers in two canoes embarked on the polar sea and traced the course of the coast eastward for five hundred and fifty miles  the sailors were as men restored to their own element  but the canadian voyageurs were filled with dread at the great waves of the open ocean  all that franklin saw of the arctic coast encouraged his belief that the american continent is separated by stretches of sea from the great masses of land that had been already discovered in the arctic  99 the northwest passage iceblocked and useless was still a geographical fact  eager in the pursuit of his investigations he went on eastward as long as he daredtoo long in fact  food was running low  his voyageurs had lost heart appalled at the immense spaces of ice and sea through which their frail canoes went onward into the unknown  reluctantly franklin decided to turn back  but it was too late to return by water  the northern gales drove the ice in against the coast  franklin and his men dragging and carrying one of the canoes took to the land in order to make their way across the barren grounds  by this means they hoped to reach the upper waters of the coppermine and thence fort enterprise where supplies were to have been placed for them during the summer  their journey was disastrous bitter cold set in as they marched  food failed them  day after day they tramped on often with blinding snow in their faces with no other sustenance than the bitter weed called tripe de roche that can here and there be scraped from the rocks beneath the snow  at times they found frozen remnants of deer that had been killed by wolves a few bones with putrid meat adhering to them  these they eagerly devoured but 100 often day after day passed without even this miserable sustenance  at night they lay down beside a clump of willows trying often in vain to make a fire of the green twigs dragged from under the snow  so great was their famine franklin says that the very sensation of hunger passed away leaving only an exhaustion too great for words  lieutenant back gaunt and emaciated staggered forward leaning on a stick refusing to give in  richardson could hardly walk while lieutenant hood emaciated to the last degree was helped on by his comrades as best they could  the canadians and indians suffered less in body but lacking the stern purpose of the officers they were distraught with the horror of the death that seemed to await them  in their fear they had refused to carry the canoe and had smashed it and thrown it aside  in this miserable condition the party reached on september 26 the coppermine river to find it flowing still unfrozen in an angry flood which they could not cross  in vain they ranged the banks above and below  below them was a great lake beside and above them a swift deep current broken by rapids  there was no crossing they tried to gather willow faggots and bind them into a raft  but the green wood sank so 101 easily that only one man could get upon the raft to paddle or pole it in the running water was impossible  a line was made of strips of skin and richardson volunteered to swim the river so as to haul the raft across with the line  the bitter cold of the water paralysed his limbs  he was seen to sink beneath the leaping waters  his companions dragged him back to the bank where for hours he lay as if lifeless beside the fire of willow branches so emaciated that he seemed a mere skeleton when they took off his wet clothing his comrades gazed at him with a sort of horror  thus for days they waited  at last with infinite patience one of the canadians made a sort of canoe with willow sticks and canvas  in this with a line attached they crossed the river one by one  they were now only forty miles from fort enterprise  but their strength was failing  hood could not go on  the party divided franklin and back went forward with most of the men while richardson and sailor hepburn volunteered to stay with hood till help could be sent  the others left them in a little tent with some rounds of ammunition and willow branches gathered for the fire  a little further on the march three of franklins followers 102 too exhausted to go on dropped out proposing to make their way back to richardson and hood  the little party at the tent in the snow waited in vain  days passed and no help came  one of the three men who had left franklin an indian called michel joined them saying that the others had gone astray in the snow  but he was strange and sullen sleeping apart and wandering off by himself to hunt  presently from the mans strange talk and from some meat which he brought back from his hunting and declared to be part of a wolf richardson realized the awful truth that michel had killed his companions and was feeding on their bodies  a worse thing followed  richardson and hepburn gathering wood a few days later heard the report of a gun from beside the fire where they had left lieutenant hood who was now in the last stage of exhaustion they returned to find michel beside the dead body of their comrade  he had been shot through the back of the head  michel swore that hood had killed himself  richardson knew the truth but both he and hepburn were too enfeebled by privation to offer fight to the armed and powerful madman  the three set out for fort enterprise michel carrying a loaded gun two 103 pistols and a bayonet muttering to himself and evidently meditating a new crime  richardson a man of iron nerve forestalled him  watching his opportunity he put a pistol to the indians head and blew his brains out  richardson and hepburn dragged themselves forward mile by mile encouraged by the thought of the blazing fires and the abundant food that they expected to find at fort enterprise  they reached the fort just in the dusk of an october evening  all about it was silence there were no tracks in the newly fallen snow  only a thin thread of smoke from the chimney gave a sign of life  hurriedly they made their way in  to their horror and dismay they found franklin and three companions two canadians and an indian stretched out in the last stages of famine  no words can convey an idea wrote dr richardson later on of the filth and wretchedness that met our eyes on looking around  our own misery had stolen upon us by degrees and we were accustomed to the contemplation of each others emaciated figures but the ghastly countenances dilated eyeballs and sepulchral voices of captain franklin and those with him were more than we could bear franklin on his part was equally dismayed at the appearance of richardson and hepburn  104 we were all shocked he says in his journal at beholding the emaciated countenances of the doctor and hepburn as they strongly evidenced their extremely debilitated state the alteration in our appearance was equally distressing to them for since the swellings had subsided we were little more than skin and bone  the doctor particularly remarked the sepulchral tone of our voices which he requested us to make more cheerful if possible unconscious that his own partook of the same key  franklin related to the newcomers how he and his followers had reached fort enterprise and to their infinite disappointment and grief had found it perfectly desolate  there was no depot of provisions as had been arranged nor any trace of a letter or other message from the traders at fort providence or from the indians  lieutenant back who had reached the fort a little in advance of franklin had gone on in the hope of finding indian hunters or perhaps of reaching fort providence and sending relief  they had no food except a little tripe de roche and franklin had thus found himself as he explained to richardson in the deserted fort with five companions in a state of utter destitution  food there was none  105 from the refuse heaps of the winter before now buried under the snow they dug out pieces of bone and a few deerskins on this with a little tripe de roche they endeavoured to subsist  the log house was falling into decay the seams gaped and the piercing air entered on every side with the thermometer twenty below zero  franklin and his companions had tried in vain to stop the chinks and to make a fire by tearing up the rough boards of the floor  but their strength was insufficient  already for two weeks before their arrival at fort enterprise they had had no meat it was impossible that they could have existed long in the miserable shelter of the deserted fort  franklin had endeavoured to go on leaving three of his companions now too exhausted to walk far he and the other two a canadian and an eskimo set out to try to reach help in the direction of fort providence  the snow was deep and their strength was so far gone that in six hours they only struggled four miles on their way  at night they lay down beside one another in the snow huddled together for warmth with a bitter wind blowing over their emaciated bodies  the next morning in recommencing their march franklin stumbled and fell breaking his snowshoe in the 106 fall realizing that he could never hope to traverse the one hundred and eightysix miles to fort providence he directed his companions to go on and he himself made his way back to fort enterprise  there he had remained for a fortnight until found by richardson and hepburn  so weak had franklin and his three companions become that they could not find the strength to go on cutting down the log buildings of the fort to make a fire  adam the indian lay prostrate in his bunk his body covered with hideous swellings  the two canadians peltier and samandré suffered such pain in their joints that they could scarcely move a step  a herd of deer had appeared on the ice of the river near by but none of the men had strength to pursue them nor could any one of them said franklin have found the strength to raise a gun and fire it  such had been the position of things when richardson and hepburn themselves almost in the last stage of exhaustion found their unhappy comrades  richardson was a man of striking energy of the kind that knows no surrender  he set himself to gather wood built up a blazing fire dressed as well as he could the swollen body of the indian and tried to bring some order into the filth and squalor 107 of the hut hepburn meantime had killed a partridge which the doctor then divided among them in six parts the first fresh meat that franklin and those with him had tasted for thirtyone days  this done the doctor so runs franklins story brought out his prayer book and testament and some prayers and psalms and portions of scripture appropriate to the situation were read  but beyond the consolation of manifesting a brave and devout spirit there was little that richardson could do for his companions  the second night after his arrival peltier died  there was no strength left in the party to lift his body out into the snow  it lay beside them in the hut and before another day passed samandré the other canadian lay dead beside it  for a week the survivors remained in the hut waiting for death  then at last and just in time help reached them  on november 7 nearly a month after franklins first arrival at the fort they heard the sound of a musket and the shouting of men outside three indians stood before the door  the valiant lieutenant back after sufferings almost as great as their own had reached a band of indian hunters and had sent three men travelling at top speed with enough food to 108 keep the party alive till further succour could be brought  franklin and his friends were saved by one of the narrowest escapes recorded in the history of northern adventure  another week passed before the relief party of the indians reached them and even then franklin and his companions were so enfeebled by privation that they could only travel with difficulty and a month passed before they found themselves safe and sound within the shelter of fort providence on the great slave lake  there they remained till the winter passed a seven weeks journey took them to york factory on hudson bay whence they sailed to england  franklins journey overland and on the waters of the polar sea had covered in all five thousand five hundred and fifty miles and had occupied nearly three years  on his return to england franklin found himself at once the object of a wide public interest  already during his absence he had been made a commander and the admiralty now promoted him to the rank of captain while the national recognition of his services was shortly afterwards confirmed by the honour of knighthood  one might think that after the perils which he had braved and the horrors which he had experienced sir john would have 109 been content to retire upon his laurels  but it was not so  there is something in the snowcovered land of the arctic its isolation from the world and the long silence of its winter darkness that exercises a strange fascination upon those who have the hardihood to brave its perils  it was a moment too when interest in arctic discovery and the advancement thereby of scientific knowledge had reached the highest point yet known  during franklins absence captain ross and lieutenant parry had been sent by sea into the arctic waters  parry had met with wonderful success striking from baffin bay through the northern archipelago and reaching halfway to bering strait  franklin was eager to be off again  the year 1825 saw him start once more to resume the survey of the polar coast of america  the plan now was to learn something of the western half of the north american coast so as to connect the discoveries of sir alexander mackenzie with those made by cook and others through bering strait  franklin was again accompanied by his gallant friend dr richardson  they passed again overland through the fur country where the recent union of the rival companies had brought about a new era  they descended the mackenzie river 110 wintered on great bear lake and descended thence to the sea  franklin struck out westward his party surveying the coast in open boats  their journey from their winter quarters to the sea and along the coast covered a thousand miles and extended to within one hundred and sixty miles of the point that had then been reached by explorers from bering strait  at the same time richardson going eastward from the mackenzie surveyed the coast as far as the coppermine river  their discoveries thus connected the pacific waters with the atlantic with the exception of one hundred and sixty miles on the northwest where water was known to exist and only ice blocked the way and of a line north and south which should bring the discoveries of parry into connection with those of franklin  these two were the missing links now needed in the chain of the northwest passage  but more than twenty years were to elapse before the discoveries thus made were carried to their completion  franklin himself claimed by other duties was unable to continue his work in the arctic and his appointment to the governorship of tasmania called him for a time to another sphere  yet little by little the exploration of the arctic regions was carried 111 on each explorer adding something to what was already known and each hoping that the honour of the discovery of the great passage would fall to his lot  franklins comrade back now a captain and presently to be admiral made his way in 1834 from canada to the polar sea down the river that bears his name  three years later simpson in the service of the hudsons bay company succeeded in traversing the coast from the mackenzie to point barrow completing the missing link in the western end of the chain  john and james ross brought the exploration of the northern archipelago to a point that made it certain that somewhere or other a way through must exist to connect baffin bay with the coastal waters  at last the time came in 1844 when the british admiralty determined to make a supreme effort to unite the explorations of twentyfive years by a final act of discovery  the result was the last expedition of sir john franklin glorious in its disaster and leaving behind it a tale that will never be forgotten while the annals of the british nation remain     112  chapter v  the tragedy of franklins fate  the month of may 1845 found two stout ships the erebus and the terror riding at anchor in the thames  both ships were already well known to the british public  they had but recently returned from the antarctic seas where captain sir james ross in a voyage towards the south pole had attained the highest southern latitude yet reached both were fine squarerigged ships strengthened in every way that the shipwrights of the time could devise  between their decks a warming and ventilating apparatus of the newest kind had been installed and as a greater novelty still the attempt was now made for the first time in history to call in the power of steam for the fight against the arctic frost  each vessel carried an auxiliary screw and an engine of twenty horsepower  when we remember that a modern steam vessel with a horsepower of many thousands is still 113 powerless against the northern ice the erebus and the terror arouse in us a forlorn pathos  but in the springtime of 1845 as they lay in the thames an object of eager interest to the flocks of sightseers in the neighbourhood they seemed like very leviathans of the deep  vast quantities of stores were being loaded into the ships enough it was said for the subsistence of the one hundred and thirtyfour members of the expedition for three years  for it was now known that arctic explorers must be prepared to face the winter icebound in their ships through the long polar night  that the winter could be faced with success had been shown by the experience of sir william parry whose ships the fury and the hecla had been icebound for two winters 182123 and still more by that of captain john ross who brought home the crew of the victory safe and sound in 1833 after four winters in the ice  illustration sir john franklin  from the national portrait gallery  all england was eager with expectancy over the new expedition  it was to be commanded by sir john franklin the greatest sailor of the day who had just returned from his five years in van diemens land and carried his fiftynine winters as jauntily as a midshipman  the era was auspicious  a new reign under a 114 queen already beloved had just opened  there was every hope of a long some people said a perpetual peace it seemed fitting that the new triumphs of commerce and science of steam and the magnetic telegraph should replace the older and cruder glories of war  the expedition was well equipped for scientific research but its main object was the discovery of the northwest passage  we have already seen what this phrase had come to mean  it had now no reference to the uses of commerce  the question was purely one of geography  the ocean lying north of america was known to be largely occupied by a vast archipelago between which were open sounds and seas filled for the greater part of the year with huge packs of ice  in the arctic winter all was frozen into an unending plain of snow broken by distorted hummocks of ice and here and there showing the frowning rocks of a mountainous country swept clean by the arctic blast  in the winter deep night and intense cold settled on the scene  but in the short arctic summer the icepack moved away from the shores  lanes of water extended here and there and sometimes by the good fortune of a gale a great sheet of open sea with blue tossing waves gladdened the heart of the 115 sailor  through this region somewhere a waterway must exist from east to west  the currents of the sea and the driftwood that they carried proved it beyond a doubt  exploration had almost proved it also  ships and boats had made their way from bering strait to the coppermine  north of this they had gone from baffin bay through lancaster sound and on westward to a great sea called melville sound a body of water larger than the irish sea  the two lines east and west overlapped widely  all that was needed now was to find a channel north and south to connect the two  this done the northwest passage the willothewisp of three hundred and fifty years had been found  a glance at the map will make clear the instructions given to sir john franklin  he was to go into the arctic by way of baffin bay and to proceed westward along the parallel of 74° 15 north latitude which would take him through the already familiar waters of lancaster sound and barrow strait leading into melville sound  this line he was to follow as far as cape walker in longitude 98° from which point it was known that waters were to be found leading southward  beyond this position franklin was left to his own 116 discretion his instructions being merely to penetrate to the southward and westward in a course as direct to bering strait as the position of the land and the condition of the ice should allow  the erebus and the terror sailed from england on june 19 1845 the officers and sailors who manned their decks were the very pick of the royal navy and the merchant service men inured to the perils of the northern ocean and trained in the fine discipline of the service captain crozier of the terror was second in command  he had been with ross in the antarctic  commander fitzjames lieutenants fairholme gore and others were tried and trained men  the ships were so heavily laden with coal and supplies that they lay deep in the water  every inch of stowage had been used and even the decks were filled up with casks  a transport sailed with them across the atlantic carrying further supplies  thus laden they made their way to the whale fish islands near disco on the west coast of greenland  here the transport unloaded its stores and set sail for england  it carried with it five men of franklins company leaving one hundred and twentynine in the illfated expedition  117  the ships put out from the coast of greenland on or about july 12 1845 to make their way across baffin bay to lancaster sound a distance of two hundred and twenty miles  in these waters are found the great floes of ice which davis had first seen called by arctic explorers the middle ice  the erebus and the terror spent a fortnight in attempting to make the passage across and here they were seen for the last time at sea  a whaling ship the prince of wales sighted the two vessels on july 26  a party of franklins officers rowed over to the ship and carried an invitation to the master to dine with sir john on the next day  but the boat had hardly returned when a fine breeze sprang up and with a clear sea ahead the erebus and the terror were put on their course to the west without even taking time to forward letters to england  thus the two ships vanished into the arctic ice never to be seen of englishmen again  the summer of 1845 passed no news came the winter came and passed away the spring and summer of 1846 and still no message  england absorbed in political struggles at homethe corn law repeal and the vexed question of irelandhad still no anxiety over franklin  no message could have come except 118 by the chance of a whaling ship or in some roundabout way through the territories of the hudsons bay company after all but a slender chance  the summer of 1846 came and went and then another winter and now with the opening of the new year 1847 the first expression of apprehension began to be heard  it was remembered how deeply laden the ships had been  the fear arose that perhaps they had foundered with all hands in the open waters of baffin bay leaving no trace behind  even the naval men began to shake their heads  captain sir john ross wrote to the admiralty to express his fear that franklins ships had been frozen in in such a way that their return was impossible  the admiralty took advice  the question was gravely discussed with the leading arctic seamen of the day  it was decided that until two years had elapsed from the time of departure may 1845 to may 1847 no measures need be taken for the relief of the erebus and the terror  the date came and passed  anxiety was deepening  the admiralty decided to act great stores of pemmican some eight tons together with suitable boats and experienced crews were sent in june 1847 to hudson bay ready for an expedition along the northern coast  a ship 119 was sent with supplies to meet franklin in bering strait and two more vessels were strengthened and equipped to be ready to follow on the track of the erebus and the terror in 1848  as this last year advanced and winter passed into summer a shudder of apprehension was felt throughout the nation  it was felt now that some great disaster had happened or even now was happening  it was known that franklins expedition had carried food for at best three years the three years had come and gone  franklins men if anywhere alive must be suffering all the horrors of starvation in the frozen fastness of the arctic  we may imagine the awful pictures that rose up before the imagination of the friends and relatives the wives and children of the one hundred and twentynine gallant men who had vanished in the erebus and the terrorvisions of ships torn and riven by the heaving ice of men foodless and shelterless in the driving snow looking out vainly from the bleak shores of some rocky coast for the help that never cameawful pictures indeed yet none more awful than the grim reality  a generous frenzy seized upon the nation  the cry went up from the heart of the people that franklin must be found he and his men 120 must be rescuedthey would not speak of them as dead  ships must be sent out with all the equipment that science could devise and the wealth of a generous nation could supply  ships were sent out  year after year ships fought their way from baffin bay to the islands of the north  ships sailed round the distant horn and through the pacific to bering strait  down the mackenzie and the great rivers of the north the canoes of the voyageurs danced in the rapids and were paddled swiftly over the wider stretches of moving water  over the frozen snow the sledges toiled against the storm  and still no word of franklin till all the weary outline of the frozen coast was traced in their wanderings till twentyone thousand miles of arctic sea and shore had been tracked out  thus the great epic of the search for franklin ran slowly to its close  with each year the hope that was ever deferred made the heart sick  anxiety deepened into dread and even dread gave way to the cruel certainty of despair  not till twelve years had passed was the search laid aside not until little by little the evidence was found that told all that we know of the fate of the erebus and the terror  first in the field was richardson the gallant 121 friend and comrade of franklins former journeys  he would not believe that franklin had failed  he knew too well the temper of the man  franklin had been instructed to strike southward from the arctic seas to the american coast  on that coast he would be found  thither went sir john richardson taking with him a man of like metal to himself one john rae a hudsons bay man fashioned in the north  down the mackenzie they went and then eastward along the coast searching for traces of the erebus and the terror  for two years they searched tracing their way from the mackenzie to the coppermine  but no vestige of franklin did they find  the queens ships were searching too  sir james ross with the enterprise and the investigator went into lancaster sound  the plover and the herald went to bering strait  the north star went in at wolstenholme sound  the resolute the assistance the sophiaa very flock of admiralty shipsspread their white wings for the arctic seas  the hudsons bay company sent sir john ross a tried explorer in the yacht felix  lady franklin the sorrowstricken wife of the lost commander sent out captain forsyth in the prince albert  one robert spedden sailed his private yacht the 122 nancy dawson in through bering strait and henry grinnell of new york be his name honoured sent out two expeditions at his own charge  by water and overland there went out between 1847 and 1851 no less than twentyone expeditions searching for the erebus and the terror  thus passed six years from the time when franklin sailed out of the thames and still no trace no vestige had been found to tell the story of his fate  then at last news came the first news of the erebus and the terror since they were sighted by the whaling ship in 1845 the news in a way was neither good nor bad  but it showed that at least the melancholy forebodings of those who said that the heavily laden ships must have foundered before they reached the arctic were entirely mistaken  captain penny master of the lady franklin had sailed under admiralty orders in 1850 and had followed on the course laid down in franklins instructions  he returned in 1851 bringing news that on beechey island a little island lying on the north side of barrow strait he had found the winter quarters that must have been occupied by the expedition in 184546 the first winter after its departure  there were the remains of a large storehouse 123 a workshop and an observatory a blacksmiths forge was found with many coal bags and cinders lying about and odds and ends of all sorts easily identified as coming from the lost ships  most ominous of all was the discovery of over six hundred empty cans that had held preserved meat the main reliance of the expedition  these were found regularly piled in little mounds  the number of them was far greater than franklins men would have consumed during the first winter and to make the conclusion still clearer the preparation was of a brand of which the admiralty since 1845 had been compelled to destroy great quantities owing to its having turned putrid in the tins  it was plain that the food supply of the erebus and the terror must have been seriously depleted and the dangers of starvation have set in long before three years were completed  three graves were found on beechey island with headboards marking the names and ages of three men of the crew who had died in the winter near a cape of the island was a cairn built of stone  it was evidently intended to hold the records of the expedition  yet strange to say neither in the cairn nor anywhere about it was a single document to be found  124  the greatest excitement now prevailed  hope ran high that at least some survivors of the men of the erebus and the terror might be found even if the ships themselves had been lost  the admiralty redoubled its efforts  already captains collinson and mclure had been sent out in 1850 to sail round the horn and were on their way into the arctic region via bering strait  to these were now added a squadron under captain sir edward belcher consisting of the assistance with a steam tender named the pioneer the resolute with its tender the intrepid and the north star  stations were to be made at beechey island and at two other points in the region now indicated as the scene of sir john franklins operations  from these sledge and boat parties were to be sent out in all directions  at the same time lady franklin dispatched the albert under captain kennedy and lieutenant bellot an officer of the french navy who had given his services to the cause  once again hope was doomed to disappointment  the story of the expeditions was an almost unbroken record of disaster  captain mclure in the investigator separated from his consort and vanished into the northern ice for three years nothing was heard of his vessel  125 the gallant bellot attempting to carry dispatches over the ice sealed his devotion with his life  belchers ships the assistance and the resolute with their two tenders froze fast in the ice  despite the earnest protests of some of his officers belcher abandoned them and in the end was able to return home  the admiralty had to face the loss of four good ships with large quantities of stores  it had been better perhaps had they remained lost  one of the abandoned ships the resolute its hatches battened down floated out of the ice and was found by an american whaler masterless tossing in the open waters of baffin bay  belcher may have been right in abandoning his ships to save the crews but his judgment and even his courage were severely questioned and unhappy bitterness was introduced where hitherto there had been nothing but the record of splendid endeavour and mutual help  the only bright spot was seen in the achievement of captain afterwards sir robert mclure who reappeared with his crew safe and sound after four winters in the arctic  he had made his way in the investigator 1850 to 1853 from bering strait to within sight of melville sound  he had spent three winters in the ice the last two years in one and the same spot 126 fast frozen to all appearances for ever  with supplies dangerously low and his crew weakened by exposure and privation mclure reluctantly left his ship  he and his men fortunately reached the ships of sir edward belcher having thus actually made the northwest passage  the disasters of 185354 cast a deeper gloom than ever over the search for franklin  moreover the rising clouds in the east and presently the outbreak of the crimean war prevented further efforts  ships and men were needed elsewhere than in the northern seas  it began to look as if failure was now final and that nothing more could be done following naval precedent a courtmartial had been held to investigate the action of captain sir edward belcher  the solemn silence wrote captain mclure afterwards with which the venerable president of the court returned captain belcher his sword with a bare acquittal best conveyed the painful feelings which wrung the hearts of all professional men upon that occasion and all felt that there was no hope of the mystery of franklins fate being cleared up in our time except by some unexpected miracle  the unexpected happened  strangely enough 127 it was just at this juncture that a letter sent by dr john rae from the hudson bay country brought to england the first authentic news of the fate of franklins men  rae had been sent overland from the northwest shores of hudson bay to the coast of the arctic at the point where the back or great fish river runs in a wide estuary to the sea  he had wintered on the isthmus now called after him which separates regents inlet from repulse bay and in the spring of 1854 had gone westward with sledges towards the mouth of the back  on his way he fell in with eskimos who told him that several years before a party of about forty white men had been seen hauling a boat and sledges over the ice  this was on the west side of the island called king williams land  none of the men so the savages said could speak to them in their own language but they made signs to show that they had lost their ships and that they were trying to make their way to where deer could be found  all the men looked thin and the eskimos thought they had very little food they had bought some seals flesh from the savages  they hauled their sledges and the boat along with dragropes at which all were tugging except one very tall big man who seemed to be a chief and 128 walked by himself  later on in the same season so the eskimos said they had found the bodies of a lot of men lying on the ice and had seen some graves and five dead bodies on an island at the mouth of a river  some of the bodies were lying in tents  the big boat had been turned over as if to make a shelter and under it were dead men  one that lay on the island was the body of the chief he had a telescope strapped over his shoulders and his gun lay underneath him  the savages told dr rae that they thought that the last survivors of the white men must have been feeding on the dead bodies as some of these were hacked and mutilated and there was flesh in the kettles  there were signs that some of the party might have escaped for on the ground there were fresh bones and feathers of geese showing that the men were still alive when the wild fowl came north which would be about the end of may  there was a quantity of gunpowder and ammunition lying around and the eskimos thought that they had heard shots in the neighbourhood though they had seen no living men but only the corpses on the ice  a great number of relicstelescopes guns compasses spoons forks and so onwere gathered by the natives and of these dr rae 129 forwarded a large quantity to england  they left no doubt as to the identity of the unfortunate victims  there was a small silver plate engraved sir john franklin kcb and a spoon with a crest and the initials frmc those of captain crozier and a great number of articles easily recognized as coming from the erebus and the terror  one may well imagine the intense interest which dr raes discoveries aroused in england  rae had been unable it is true to make his way to the actual scene of the disaster as described by the eskimos but it was now felt that at last certain tidings had been received of the death of franklin and his men  dr rae and his party received the ten thousand pounds which the government had offered to whosoever should bring correct news of the fate of the expedition  in all except a few hearts hope was now abandoned  it was felt that all were dead  anxious though the government was to obtain further details of the tragedy it was not thought proper at such a national crisis as the crimean war to dispatch more ships to the arctic something however was done  a chief factor of the hudsons bay company named anderson was sent overland in 1855 to explore 130 the mouth of the back river  he found in and around montreal island at the mouth of the river numerous relics of the disaster  a large quantity of chips and shavings seemed to indicate the place where the savages had broken up the boat  but no documents or papers were found nor any bodies of the dead  anderson had no interpreter and could only communicate by signs with the savages whom he found alone on the island  but he gathered from them that the white men had all died for want of food  for two years nothing more was done  then as the war cloud passed away the unsolved mystery began again to demand solution  some faint hope too struggled to life  it was argued that perhaps some of the white men were still alive  the imagination conjured up a ghastly picture of a few survivors still alive when with the coming of the wild fowl life and warmth returned  with what horror must they have turned their backs upon the hideous scene of their sufferings leaving the dead as they lay and preferring to leave unwritten the chronicle of an experience too awful to relate  there penned in between the barren grounds and the sea they might have somehow continued to live there they might still be found  131  it was through the personal efforts of lady franklin who devoted thereto the last remnant of her fortune that the final expedition was sent out in 1857  the yacht fox was commanded by captain mclintock he had already spent many years in the arctic  touched by the poignant grief of lady franklin he gave his service gratuitously in a last effort to trace the fate of the missing men  other officers gave their services and even money to the search  the little fox sailed in 1857 to search the waters between beechey island and the mouth of the back  when she returned to england two years later she brought back with her the first and the last direct information ever received from the erebus and the terror  in a cairn on the west coast of king williams island was found a document placed there from franklins ships  it was dated may 28 1847 two years after the ships left england  it read hm ships erebus and terror wintered in the ice lat 70° 5 n long 98° 23 west having wintered in 184546 at beechey island after having ascended wellington channel to lat 77° and returned by the west side of cornwallis island  sir john franklin commanding the expedition  all well  132  this showed that franklin had as already gathered explored the channels west and north from lancaster sound and finding no way through had wintered on beechey island 184546  striking south from there his ships had been caught in the open icepack where they had passed their second winter  at the time of writing franklin must have been looking eagerly forward to their coming liberation and the prosecution of their discoveries towards the american coast  but the document did not end there  it had evidently been placed in the cairn in may of 1847 a year later the cairn had been reopened and to the document a note had been appended written in fine writing round the edge of the original  the torn edge of the paper leaves part of the date missing  it runs  848  hm ships erebus and terror were deserted on the 22 of april 5 leagues nnw of this  been beset since 12th sept 1846  the officers and crews consisting of 105 souls under the command  tain f r m crozier landed here in lat 69° 37 42 long 98° 41  no words could convey better than these simple lines the full horror of the disaster two winters frozen in the icepack till the 133 lack of food and the imminence of starvation compelled the officers and men to leave the ships long before the summer season and try to make their way over ice and snow to the south  and franklin  the other edge of the paper contained in the same writing a note that ran sir john franklin died on the 11th june 1847 and the total loss by death to the expedition has been to date 9 officers and 14 men  f r m crozier captain and senior officer  james fitzjames captain hms erebus  at one corner of the paper are the final words that taken along with the stories of the eskimos explained the last chapter of the tragedyand start tomorrow 26th for backs fish river  mclintock did all that could be done  he and his party traced out the coast on both sides of king williams island and having reached the mouth of the back river he traced the course of crozier and his perishing companions step by step backwards over the scene of the disaster  the eskimos whom he met told him of the freezing in of the two great ships how the white men had abandoned them and walked over the ice how one ship had been crushed in the ice a few months later and had gone down and how the other ship 134 had lain a wreck for years and years beside the coast of king williams island  one aged woman who had visited the scene told mclintocks party that there had been on the wrecked ship the dead body of a tall man with long teeth and large bones  the searchers themselves found more direct testimony still  a few miles south of cape herschel lay the skeleton of one of franklins men outstretched on the ground just as he had fallen on the fatal march the head pointing towards the back river  at another point there was found a boat with two corpses in it the one lying in the stern carefully covered as if by the act of his surviving comrade the other lying in the bow two loaded muskets standing upright beside the body a great number of relics that marked the path of croziers men were found along the shore of king williams island  in one place a plundered cairn was discovered  but strangely enough no document or writing to tell anything of the fate of the survivors after they started on their last march  that all perished by the way there can be little doubt  but it is altogether probable that before the final catastrophe overtook them they had endeavoured to place somewhere a record of their achievements and their 135 sufferings  such a record may still lie buried among the stones of the desolate region where they died and it may well be that some day the chance discovery of an explorer will bring it to light  but it can tell us little more than we already know by inference of the tragic but inspiring disaster that overwhelmed the men of the erebus and the terror     136  chapter vi  epilogue  the conquest of the pole  it is no part of the present narrative to follow in detail the explorations and discoveries made in the polar seas in recent times after the great episode of the loss of franklin and the search for his ships public interest in the northwest passage may be said to have ended  the journey made by sir robert mclure and his men after abandoning their ship had proved that such a waterway existed but the knowledge of the northern regions acquired in the attempt to find the survivors of the erebus and the terror made it clear that the passage was valueless not merely for commerce but even for the uses of exploration  for the time being a strong reaction set in and popular opinion condemned any further expenditure of life and money in the frozen regions of the arctic  but although the sensational aspect of northern discovery had thus largely disappeared a new incentive 137 began to make itself increasingly felt the progress of physical science the rapid advance in the knowledge of electricity and magnetism and the rise of the science of biology were profoundly altering the whole outlook of the existing generation towards the globe that they inhabited  the sea itself like everything else became an object of scientific study  its currents and its temperature its relation to the land masses which surrounded it acquired a new importance in the light of geological and physical research  the polar waters offered a fruitful field for the new investigations  in place of the adventurous explorers of frobishers day searching for fabled empires and golden cities there appeared in the seas of the north the inquisitive man of science eagerly examining the phenomena of sea and sky to add to the stock of human knowledge  very naturally there grew up under such conditions an increasing desire to reach the pole itself and to test whether the theoretical conclusions of the astronomer were borne out by the actual observations of one standing upon the apex of the spinning earth  the attempt to reach the pole became henceforth the great preoccupation of arctic discovery  from this time on the story of what has been done in 138 the northern seas belongs not to canada but to the world at large  the voyages of such men as frobisher davis and hudson and the journeys of men like hearne and mackenzie led to the opening up of this vast country and belong to canadian history  but in recent arctic discovery the point of interest had never been found in the lands about the northern seas but only in the arctic ocean itself and in the effort to penetrate farther and farther north  little by little this effort was rewarded  a series of intrepid explorers forced their way onward until at last the pole itself was reached and the frozen north had yielded up its hollow mystery  the struggle to reach the pole was the form in which arctic exploration came to life again after the paralysing effect of the franklin tragedy some of the franklin relief expeditions had reached very high latitudes and shortly after the great tragedy the exploring ships of dr kane and dr hayes and the polaris under captain hall had all passed the eightieth parallel and been within less than ten degrees of the pole  the idea grew that there might be an open polar sea navigable at times to the very apex of the world  in 1875 the alert and the discovery two ships of the british navy 139 were sent out with the express purpose of reaching the north pole  they sailed up the narrow waters that separate greenland from the large islands lying west of it  the alert wintered as far north as latitude 82° 24  a sledge party that was sent out under captain markham went as far as latitude 83° 20 and the expedition returned with the proud distinction of having carried its flag northward beyond all previous explorations  but other nations were not to lag behind  an american expedition 1881 under lieutenant greeley carried on the exploration of the extreme north of greenland and of the interior of grinnell land that lies west of it  two of greeleys men lieutenant lockwood and a companion followed the greenland coast northward in a sledge and passed markhams latitude reaching 83° 24 north which remained for many years as the highest point attained  greeleys expedition became the subject of a tragedy almost comparable to the great franklin disaster  the vessels sent with supplies failed to reach their destination  for four years greeley and his men remained in the arctic regions  of the twentythree men in the party only six were found alive when captain schley of the united states navy at last brought relief  140  after the greeley expedition the fight towards the pole was carried on by a series of gallant explorers none of whom strange to narrate were british  commander r e peary of the united states navy came prominently before the world as an arctic navigator in the last decade of the nineteenth century  in 1892 he crossed northern greenland in the extreme latitude of 81° 37 a feat of the highest order  still more striking was the work of dr fridtjof nansen which attracted the attention of the whole world  nansen had devoted profound study to the question of the northern drift of the polar waters  it had often been observed that driftwood and wreckage seemed in many places to float towards the pole  trees that fall in the siberian forests and float down the great rivers to the northern sea are frequently found washed up on the shores of greenland having apparently passed over the pole itself  a strong current flows northward through bering strait and it is a matter of record that an american vessel the jeanette which stuck fast in the ice near wrangel land in 1879 drifted slowly northward with the ice for two years and made its way in this fashion some four hundred miles towards the 141 pole  dr nansen formed the bold design of carrying a ship under steam into one of the currents of the far north allowing it to freeze in and then trusting to the polar drift to do the rest  the adventures of nansen and his men in this enterprise are so well known as scarcely to need recital  a stout wooden vessel of four hundred tons the fram or the forwards was specially constructed to withstand the grip of the polar ice  in 1893 she sailed from norway and made her way by the kara sea to the new siberian islands  in october the fram froze into the ice and there she remained for three years drifting slowly forwards in the heart of the vast mass  her rudder and propeller were unshipped and taken inboard her engine was taken to pieces and packed away while on her deck a windmill was erected to generate electric power  in this situation snugly on board their stout ship nansen and his crew settled down into the unbroken night of the arctic winter  the ice that surrounded them was twelve feet thick and escape from it even had they desired it would have been impossible  they watched eagerly the direction of their drift worked out by observation of the stars for the first few weeks propelled by northern winds the fram moved southwards  then 142 slowly the northern current began to make itself felt but during the whole of this first winter the fram only moved a few miles onward towards her goal  all the next summer the ship remained fast frozen and drifted about two hundred miles  with her rate of progress and direction nansen reckoned that she would reach not the pole but spitzbergen and would take four and a half years more to do it  all through the next winter the fram moved slowly northwards and westwards  in the spring of 1895 she was still about five hundred miles from the pole and her present path would miss it by about three hundred and fifty miles  nansen resolved upon an enterprise unparalleled in hardihood  he resolved to take with him a single companion to leave the fram and to walk over the ice to the pole and thence as best he might to make his way not back to his ship again for that was impossible but to the nearest known land  the whole distance to be covered was almost a thousand miles  dr nansen and lieutenant johansen left the fram on march 13 1895 to make this attempt  they failed in their enterprise  to struggle towards the pole over the packice at times reared in rough hillocks and at times split with lanes of open water proved 143 a feat beyond the power of man  nansen and his companion got as far as latitude 86° 13 a long way north of all previous records  by sheer pluck and endurance they managed to make their way southward again  they spent the winter on an arctic island in a hut of stone and snow and in june of the next year 1896 at last reached franz joseph land where they fell in with a british expedition  they reached norway in time to hear the welcome news that the fram after a third winter in the ice had drifted into open sea again and had just come safely into port  equally glorious but profoundly tragic was the splendid attempt of professor andrée to reach the pole in a balloon which followed on the heels of nansens enterprise  andrée who was a professor in the technical school at stockholm had been for some years interested in the rising science of aerial navigation  he judged that by this means a way might be found to the pole where all else failed  by the generous aid of the king of sweden baron dickson and others he had a balloon constructed in paris which represented the very latest progress towards the mastery of the air in the days before the aeroplane and the lightweight motor had opened a new chapter in 144 history andrées balloon was made of 3360 pieces of silk sewn together with three miles of seams  it contained 158000 cubic feet of hydrogen it carried beneath it a huge wicker basket that served as a sort of house for andrée and his companions and to the netting of this were lashed provisions sledges frame boats and other appliances to meet the needs of the explorers if their balloon was wrecked on the northern ice  there was no means of propulsion but three heavy guide ropes trailing on the ground afforded a feeble and uncertain control  the whole reliance of andrée was placed consciously and with full knowledge of the consequences on the possibility that a strong and favouring wind might carry him across the pole  the balloon was taken on shipboard to spitzbergen and there inflated in a tall shed built for the purpose  andrée was accompanied by two companions strindberg and fraenkel  on july 11 1897 the balloon was cast loose and with a southerly wind and bright sky it was seen to vanish towards the north it is known from a message sent by a pigeon that two days later all was well and the balloon still moving towards its goal  since then no message or token has ever been found to tell us the fate of the three brave men and 145 the names of andrée and his companions are added to the long list of those who have given their lives for the advancement of human knowledge  with the opening of the present century the progress of polar exploration was rapid  peary continued his explorations towards the north of greenland and in 1906 by reaching latitude 87° 6 he wrested from nansen the coveted record of farthest north  at the same time captain sverdrup the commander of the fram the duke of the abruzzi and many others were carrying out scientific expeditions in polar waters  the voyage made in 1904 by captain roald amundsen a norwegian later on to be worldfamous as the discoverer of the south pole is of especial interest for he succeeded in carrying his little ship from the atlantic to the pacific by way of bering straitthe only vessel that has ever actually made the northwest passage  but the great prize fell to captain peary  on september 6 1909 the world thrilled with the announcement that peary had reached the pole  his ship the roosevelt had sailed in the summer of 1908  peary wintered at etah in the north of greenland and in the ensuing year accompanied by captain bartlett with five white men and 146 seventeen eskimos he set out to reach the pole by sledge  by arrangement pearys companions accompanied him a certain distance carrying supplies and then turned back in successive parties  the final dash for the pole was made by the commander himself accompanied only by a negro servant and four eskimos  on april 6 1909 they reached the pole and hoisted there the flag of the united states  to make doubly certain of their discovery peary and his men went some ten miles beyond the pole and eight miles in a lateral direction  they saw nothing but ice about them and no indication of the neighbourhood of any land     147  bibliographical note  for the earlier voyages of the english to the northern seas the first and principal
