of cavanagh forest ranger i have read it with mingled feelingswith keen appreciation of your sympathetic understanding of the problems which confronted the forest service before the western people understood it and with deep regret that i am no longer officially associated with its work although i am as deeply interested and almost as closely in touch as ever  the western frontier to the lasting sorrow of all old hunters like yourself has now practically disappeared its people faced life with a manly dependence on their own courage and capacity which did them and still does them high honor some of them were naturally slow to see the advantages of the new order but now that they have seen it there is nowhere more intelligent convinced and effective support of the conservation policies than in the west the establishment of the new order in some places was not childs play but there is a strain of fairness among the western people which you can always count on in such a fight as the forest service has made and won  the service contains the best body of young men i know and many splendid veterans it is ninetenths made up of western men it has met the west on its own ground and it has won the contestan episode of which you have so well describedbecause the west believes in what it stands for  i have lived much among the western mountain men i have studied their problems differed with some of them and worked with many of them sometimes i have lost and sometimes i have won but every time the fight was worth while i have come out of it all with a respect and liking for the west which will last as long as i do                                                 very sincerely yours                                                        gifford pinchot    march 14 1910    cavanagh forest ranger       cavanagh forest ranger  i  the desert chariot   lee virginia wetherford began her return journey into the mountain west with exultation from the moment she opened her carwindow that august morning in nebraska the plain called to her sustained her illusions it was all quite as big as tawny as she remembered itfit arena for the epic deeds in which her father had been a leader bold and free  her memories of roaring fork and its people were childish and romantic she recalled vividly the stagecoach which used to amble sedately not to say wheezily from the railway to the fork and from the fork back to the railway in the days when she had ridden away in it a tearful despairing longlimbed girl and fully expected to find it waiting for her at sulphur city with old tom quentan still as its driver  the years of absence had been years of growth and though she had changed from child to woman in these suns and moons she could not think of the fork as anything other than the romantic town she had lefta list wherein spurred and steelgirt cowmen strode lamely over uneven sidewalks or swooped like the red nomads of the desert in mad troops through the starlit night  the first hint of the new west came to her by way of the pretentious hotel alma which stood opposite the station at sulphur and to which she was led by a colored porter of most elaborate and kindly manners  this house which furnished an excellent dinner and an absorbing mixture of types both american and european was vaguely disturbing to her it was plainly not of the oldtime westthe west her father had dominated in the days before the invasion it was indeed distinctly built for the tourist trade and was filled with all that might indicate the comfortable nearness of big game and good fishing  upon inquiry as to the stage she was amazed to hear that an automobile now made the journey to the fork in five hours and that it left immediately after the midday meal  this was still more disconcerting than the hotel but the closer she came to the ride the more resigned she became for she began to relive the long hours of torture on the trip outward during which she had endured clouds of dust and blazing heat there were some disadvantages in the old stage romantic as her conception of it had been furthermore the coach had gone so she made application for her seat at once  at two oclock as the car came to the door she entered it with a sense of having stepped from one invading chariot of progress to another so big and shining and up to date was its glittering body shining with brass and glowing with brave red paint it was driven also by a small lean young fellow whom the cowboys on her fathers ranch would have called a lunger so thin and small were his hands and arms he was quite as far from old tom quentan as the car was from the coach on which he used to perch  the owner of the machine perceiving under virginias veil a girls pretty face motioned her to the seat with the driver and rode beside her for a few minutes standing on the footboard to inquire if she were visiting friends in the fork  yes she replied curtly i am  something in her tone discouraged him from further inquiry and he soon dropped away  the seats were apparently quite filled with men when at the last moment a middleaged woman with a penetrating nasal drawling utterance inquired if she were expected to be squoze in betwixt them two strange men on that there back seat  lee virginia turned and was about to greet the woman as an old acquaintance when something bold and vulgar in the complaining vixens face checked the impulse  the stageagent called her miss mcbride and with exaggerated courtesy explained that travel was heavy and that he had not known that she was intending to go  one of the men a slender young fellow moved to the middle of the seat and politely said you can sit on the outside madam  she clambered in with doleful clamor well i never rode in one of these pesky things before and if you git me safe down to the fork ill promise never to jump the brute another time  a chuckle went round the car but it soon died out for the newcomer scarcely left off talking for the next three hours and virginia was very glad she had not claimed acquaintanceship  as they whirled madly down the valley the girl was astonished at the transformation in the hot dry land wire fences ran here and there enclosing fields of alfalfa and wheat where once only the sagebrush and the greasewood grew painted farmhouses shone on the banks of the creeks and irrigating ditches flashed across the road with an air of business and decision  for the first halfhour it seemed as if the dominion of the cattleman had ended but as the swift car drew away from the valley of the bear and climbed the divide toward the north the free range was disclosed with few changes save in the cattle which were all of the harmless or hornless variety appearing tame and spiritless in comparison with the oldtime halfwild broadhorn breeds  no horsemen were abroad and nothing was heard but the whirr of the motor and the steady flow of the garrulous woman behind not till the machine was descending the long divide to the west did a single cowboy come into view to remind the girl of the heroic past and this one but a symbola figure of speech leaning forward upon his reeling foaming steed he spurred along the road as if pursued casting backward apprehensive glances as if in the brassy eyes of the car he read his doomthe doom of all his kind  some vague perception of this symbolism came into virginias thought as she watched the swift and tireless wheels swallow the shortening distance between the heels of the flying pony and the gilded seat in which she sat vain was the attempt to outride progress the rider pulled out and as they passed him the girl found still greater significance in the fact that he was one of her fathers oldtime cowboysa grizzled middleaged lightweight centaur whom she would not have recognized had not the driver called him by his quaint wellknown nickname  soon afterward the motor overhauled and passed the battered stage lumbering along bereft of its passengers sunk to the level of carrying the baggage for its contemptuous aristocratic supplanter and as lee virginia looked up at the driver she caught the glance of a simpleminded farmboy looking down at her tom quentan no longer guided the plunging reeling broncos on their swift and perilous wayhe had sturdily declined to play second fiddle to a kerosene tank  lee began to wonder if she should find the fork much changedher mother was a bad correspondent  her unspoken question opportunely asked by another was answered by mrs mcbride oh lord yes summer tourists are crawlin all over us sence this otto line began pears like all the barearmed boobies and crosslegged little rips in omaha and denver has jest got to ride in and look us over two of them new hotels in sulphur dont do a thing but feed these tenderfeet i spose prohibition will be the next grandstandplay on the part of our townlot boomers we old cowpunchers dont care whether the town grows or not but these hyer bankers and truckfarmers are all for raisin the price o land and taxin us quiet fellers out of our boots  virginia winced a little at this for it flashed over her that all the women with whom she had grown up spoke very much in this fashionusing breeding terms almost as freely as the ranchers themselves it was natural enough what else could they do in talking to men who knew nothing but cows and yet it was no longer wholly excusable even to the men who laughed openly in reply  the mountains too yielded their disappointment for the first hour or two they seemed lower and less mysterious than of old they neither wooed nor threatenedonly the plain remained as vast and as majestic as ever the fences the occasional farms in the valleys could not subdue its outspread serene majesty to prettiness it was still of desert sternness and breadth  from all these impersonal considerations the girl was brought back to the vital phases of her life by the harsh voice of one of the men lize wetherford is goin to get jumped one o these days for sellin whiskey without a license ive told her so too everybody knows shes adoin it and what beats me is her goin along in that way when a little time and money would set her straight with the law  the shock of all this lay in the fact that eliza wetherford was the mother to whom lee virginia was returning after ten years of life in the east and the significance of the mans words froze her blood for an instant there was an accent of blunt truth in his voice and the mere fact that a charge of such weight could be openly made appalled the girl although her recollections of her mother were not entirely pleasant  the young fellow on the back seat slowly said i dont complain of lize sellin bad whiskey but the grub she sets up is fierce  the grub aint so bad its the way she stacks it up remarked another but then these little flybit cowtowns are all alike and all bad so far as hotels are concerned  lee virginia crimson and burning hot was in agony lest they should go further in their criticism  she knew that her mother kept a boardinghouse and while she was not proud of it there was nothing precisely disgraceful in itmany widowed women found it the last resort but this brutal comment on the way in which her business was carried on was like a slash of mud in the face her joy in the ride her impersonal exultant admiration of the mountains was gone and with flaming cheeks and beating heart she sat tense and bent dreading some new and keener thrust  happily the conversation turned aside and fell upon the governments forest policy and sam gregg a squat widemouthed harshvoiced individual cursed the action of ross cavanagh the ranger in the district above the fork he thinks hes secretary of war but i reckon he wont after i interview him he cant shuffle my sheep around over the hills at his own sweet will  the young fellow on the back seat quietly interposed you want to be sure youve got the cinch on cavanagh good and square sam or hell be aridin you  he certainly is an arbitrary cuss said the old woman they say he was one of teddys roughriders in the war he sure can ride and handle a gun pears like he thinks hes runnin the whole range she continued after a pause caint nobody so much as shoot a grouse since he came on and the supervisor upholds him in it  lee virginia wondered about all this supervision for it was new to her  gregg the sheepman went on as i tell redfield i dont object to the forest policyits a good thing for me i get my sheep pastured cheaper than i could do any other way but it makes me hot to have grazing lines run on me and my herders jacked up every time they get over the line ross run one bunch off the reservation last friday im going to find out about that hell learn he cant get arbitrary with me  lee virginia glancing back at this man felt sorry for any one who opposed him for she recalled him as one of the fiercest of the cattlemenone ever ready to cut a farmers fence or burn a sheepherders wagon  the old woman chuckled pears like youve changed your tune since 98 sam  he admitted his conversion shamelessly im for whatever will pay best just now with a high tariff sheep are the boys so long as i can get on the reserve at seven cents a headlambs freeim going to put every dollar ive got into sheep  youre going to get thrown off altogether one of these days said the young man on the back seat  thereupon a violent discussion arose over the question of the right of a sheepman to claim first grass for his flocks and gregg boasted that he cared nothing for the deadline ill throw my sheep where i please he declared theyve tried to run me out of deer creek but im there to stay i have ten thousand more on the way and the man that tries to stop me will find trouble  the car was descending into the valley of the roaring fork now and wire fences and alfalfa fields on either side gave further evidence of the change in the lands dominion new houses of frame and old houses in fresh paint shone vividly from the green of the willows and cottonwoods a ballground on the outskirts of the village was another guarantee of progress the cowboy was no longer the undisputed prince of the country fair  down past the courthouse refurbished and deeper sunk in trees lee virginia rode recalling the wild night when three hundred armed and vengeful cowboys surrounded it holding three cattlebarons and their hired invaders against all comers resolute to be their own judge jury and hangman it was all as peaceful as a sunday afternoon at this moment with no sign of the fierce passions of the past  there were new storebuildings and cement walks along the main street of the town and here and there a real lawn cut by a lawnmower but as the machine buzzed on toward the river the familiar little old battlemented buildings came to view the palace hotel half log half battlement remained on its perilous site beside the river the triangle where the trails met still held halseys three forks saloon and next to it stood markheits general store from which the cowboys and citizens had armed themselves during the ten days war of cattlemen and rustlers  the car crossed the roaring fork and drew up before two small shacks one of which bore a faded sign the wetherford house and the other in fresher paint the wetherford café on the sidewalk a group of indians were sitting and a halfdozen slouching white men stood waiting at the door  at sight of her mothers hotel virginia forgot every other building every other object and when the driver asked respectfully where will you want to get off miss she did not reply but rose unsteadily in her seat blindly reaching for her bag and her wraps her slim grayrobed figure graceful even in her dismay appealed to every onlooker but gregg was the one to offer a hand  allow me miss he said with the smile of a wolf  declining his aid she took her bag from the driver and walked briskly up the street as if she were a resident and knew precisely where she wanted to go one o those eastern tourists i reckon she heard the old woman say  as she went past the hotelporch her heart beat hard and her breath shortened in a flash she divined the truth she understood why her mother had discouraged her coming home it was not merely on account of the moneyit was because she knew that her business was wrong  what a squalid little den it was how cheap bald and petty the whole town seemed of a sudden lee virginia halted and turned there was only one thing to be done and that was to make herself known she retraced her steps pulled open the broken screen door and entered the café it was a low dingy diningroom filled with the odor of ham and bad coffee at the tables ten or fifteen men a motley throng were busily feeding their voracious jaws and on her left behind a showcase filled with cigars stood her mother looking old unkempt and worried the changes in her were so great that the girl stood in shocked alarm at last she raised her veil mother she said dont you know me  a look of surprise went over the older womans flabby facea glow which brought back something of her other self as she cried why lee virginny where did you come from  the boarders stopped chewing and stared in absorbed interest while virginia kissed her blowsy mother  by the lord its little virginny said one old fellow its her daughter  upon this a mutter of astonishment arose and the waitergirls giggling marvelling and envious paused their platters in hand to exchange comment on the newcomers hat and gown a cowboy at the washingsink in the corner suspended his facepolishing and gaped over his shoulder in silent ecstasy  for a full minute so it seemed this singular interesting absorbed immobility lasted then a seedy little man rose and approached the girl his manner was grotesquely graceful as he said we are all glad to greet you home again miss virginia  she gave her hand hesitatingly its mr sifton isnt it  it is he replied the same old hapenny only a little more wornworn not polished he added with a smile  she remembered him thenan englishman a remittance man a lord they used to say his eyes were kind and his mouth despite its unshaved stubble of beard was refined a harmless little manhis own worst enemy as the saying goes  thereupon others of the men came forward to greet her and though she had some difficulty in recognizing one or two of them so hardly had the years of her absence used them she eventually succeeded in placing them all  at length her mother led her through the archway which connected the two shanties thence along a narrow hall into a small bedroom into which the western sunset fell it was a shabby place but as a refuge from the crowd in the restaurant it was grateful  lize looked at her daughter critically i dont know what im going to do with a girl like youwhy youre purtypurty as a picture you were skinny as a childim fair dazed great snakes how you have opened outyoure the living image of your dadwhat started you back i told you to stay where you was  the girl stared at her helplessly trying to understand herself and her surroundings there was in truth something singularly alien in her mothers attitude she seemed on the defensive not wishing to be too closely studied her manner is not even affectionateonly friendly it is as if i were only an embarrassing visitor the girl thought aloud she said i had no place to go after aunt celia died i had to come home  you wrote they was willing to keep you  they were but i couldnt ask it of them i had no right to burden them and besides mrs hall wrote me that you were sick  i am but i didnt want you to come back lay off your things and come out to supper well talk afterward  the eatinghouse the rooms and hallways were all of that desolate shabbiness which comes from shiftlessness joined with poverty the carpets were frayed and stained with tobaccojuice and the dusty windows were littered with dead flies the curtains were ragged the paper peeling from the walls and the plastering cracked into unsightly lines everything on which the girls eyes fell contrasted strongly with her aunts home on the brandywinenot because that house was large or luxurious but because it was exquisitely in order and sweet with flowers and dainty arrangement of color  she understood now the final warnings uttered by her friends you will find everything changed they had said because you are changed  she regretted bitterly that she had ever left her eastern friends her mother in truth showed little pleasure at her coming and almost nothing of the illness of which a neighbor had written it was indeed this letter which had decided her to return to the west she had come led by a sense of duty not by affection for she had never loved her mother as a daughter shouldthey were in some way antipatheticand now she found herself an unwelcome guest  then too the west had called to her the west of her childhood the romantic chivalrous west the west of the miner the cattleman the wolf and the eagle she had returned led by a poetic sentiment and here now she sat realizing as if by a flash of inward light that the west she had known as a child had passed had suddenly grown old and commonplacein truth it had never existed at all  one of the waitresses whose elaborately puffed and waved hair set forth her senseless vanity called from the door you can come out now your ma says your suppers ready  with aching head and shaking knees virginia reentered the diningroom which was now nearly empty of its guests but was still misty with the steam of food and swarming with flies these pests buzzed like bees around the soiled places on the tablecloths and one of her mothers first remarks was a fretful apology regarding her trials with those insects seems like you cant keep em out she said  lee virginia presented the appearance of some settlement worker some fair lady on a visit to the poor as she took her seat at the table and gingerly opened the small moist napkin which the waiter dropped before her her appetite was gone her appetite failed at the very sight of the fried eggs and hot and sputtering bacon and she turned hastily to her coffee a fly was in that she uttered a little choking cry and buried her face in her handkerchief and sobbed  lize turned upon the waitress and lashed her with stinging phrases cant you serve things better than this take that cup away my god you make me tiredfumblin around here with your eyes on the men pay more attention to your work and less to your crimps and youll please me a whole lot better  with desperate effort lee conquered her disgust never mind im tired and a little upset i dont need any dinner  the slob will go just the same ive put up with her because help is scarce but heres where she gits off  in this moment virginia perceived that her mother was of the same nature with mrs mcbridenot one whit more refinedand the gulf between them swiftly widened hastily sipping her coffee she tried hard to keep back the tears but failed and no sooner did her mother turn away than she fled to her room there to sob unrestrainedly her despair and shame oh i cant stand it she called i cant i cant  outside the mountains deepened in splendor growing each moment more mysterious and beautiful under the sunset sky but the girl derived no comfort from them her loneliness and her perplexities had closed her eyes to their majestic drama she felt herself alien and solitary in the land of her birth  lize came in half an hour later pathetic in her attempt at slicking up she was still handsome in a largefeatured way but her gray hair was there and her face laid with a network of fretful lines her color was bad at the moment her cheeks were yellow and sunken  she complained of being short of breath and lame and tired im always tired she explained pears like sometimes i cant scarcely drag myself around but i do  a pang of comprehending pain shot through virginias heart if she could not love she could at least pity and help and reaching forth her hand she patted her mother on the knee poor old mammy she said im going to help you  lize was touched by this action of her proud daughter and smiled sadly this is no place for you its nothin but a measly little old cowtown gone to seedand im gone to seed with it i know it but what is a feller to do im stuck here and ive got to make a living or quit i cant quit i aint got the grit to eat a dose and so i stagger along  ive come back to help you mother you must let me relieve you of some of the burden  what can you do child lize asked gently  i can teach  not in this town you cant  why not  well theres a terrible prejudice againstwell against me and besides the places are all filled for the next year the wetherfords aint among the first circles any more  this daunted the girl more than she could express but she bravely made advance but there must be other schools in the country  there area few but i reckon you better pull out and go back at least to sulphur they dont know so much about me there and besides theyre a little more like your kind  lee virginia remembered greggs charge against her mother what do you mean by the prejudice against you she asked  lize was evasive since i took to running this restaurant my old friends kind o fell offbut never mind that tonight tell me about things back east i dont spose ill ever get as far as omaha again i used to go with ed every time i felt like it he was good to me your father if ever there was a prince of a man ed wetherford was him  the girls thought was now turned into other halfforgotten channels i wish you would tell me more about father i dont remember where he was buried  neither do i childi mean i dont know exactly you see after that cattlewar he went away to texas  i remember but its all very dim  well he never came back and never wrote and byandby word came that he had died and was buried but i never could go down to see where his grave was at  didnt you know the name of the town  yes but it was a new place away down in the pan handle and nobody i knew lived there and i never knew anything more  lee sighed hopelessly i hate to think of him lying neglected down there  pears like the whole world we lived in in them days has slipped off the map replied the older woman and as the room was darkening she rose and lighted a dusty electric globe which dangled from the ceiling over the small table well i must go back into the restaurant i haint got a girl i can trust to count the cash  left alone lee virginia wept no more but her face settled into an expression of stern sadness it seemed as if her girlhood had died out of her and that she was about to begin the same struggle with work and worry which had marked the lives of all the women she had known in her childhood  out on the porch a raw youth was playing wailing tunes on a mouthorgan and in the parlor a man was uttering silly jokes to a tittering girl the smell of cheap cigars filled the hallway and penetrated to her nostrils every sight and sound sickened her can it be that the old town the town of my childhood was of this characterso sordid so vulgar she asked herself and motherwhat is the matter with her she is not even glad to see me  weary with her perplexities she fastened her door at last and went to bed hoping to endfor a few hours at leastthe ache in her heart and the benumbing whirl of her thought  but this respite was denied her almost at once she began to fancy that a multitudinous minute creeping and stirring was going on about herin her hair over her neck across her feet for a time she explained this by reference to her disordered nerves but at last some realization of the truth came to her and she sprang out upon the floor in horror and disgust lighting the lamp she turned to scrutinize her couch it swarmed with vermin the ceiling was spattered with them they raced across the walls in platoons thin and voracious as wolves  with a choking angry despairing moan she snatched her clothing from the chair and stood at bay it needed but this touch to complete her disillusionment     ii  the forest ranger   from her makeshift bed in the middle of the floor lee virginia was awakened next morning by the passing of some one down the hall calling at each door six oclock she had not slept at all till after one she was lame heartweary and dismayed but she rose and dressed herself as neatly as before she had decided to return to sulphur i cannot endure this she had repeated to herself a hundred times i will not  hearing the clatter of dishes she ventured with desperate courage into the diningroom which was again filled with cowboys coalminers ranchers and their tousled families and certain nondescript town loafers of tramplike appearance the flies were nearly as bad as everbut not quite for under mrs wetherfords dragooning the waiters had made a nerveless assault upon them with newspaper bludgeons and a few of them had been driven out into the street  slipping into a seat at the end of the table which offered the cleanest cloth lee virginia glanced round upon her neighbors with shrinking eyes all were shovelling their food with knifeblades and guzzling their coffee with bent heads their faces scared her and she dropped her eyes  at her left however sat two men whose greetings were frank and manly and whose tablemanners betrayed a higher form of life one of them was a tall man with a lean red face against which his blond mustache lay like a chalkmark he wore a corduroy jacket cut in norfolk style and in the collar of his yellow shirt a green tie was loosely knotted his hands were long and freckled but were manifestly trained to polite usages  the other man was younger and browner and of a compact athletic figure on the breast of his olivegreen coat hung a silver badge which bore a pinetree in the centre his shirt was tancolored and rough but his head was handsome he looked like a young officer in the undress uniform of the regular army his hands were strong but rather small and the lines of his shoulders graceful most attractive of all were his eyes so brown so quietly humorous and so keen  in the rumble of cheap and vulgar talk the voices of these men appealed to the troubled girl with great charm she felt more akin to them than to any one else in the room and from time to time she raised her eyes to their faces  they were aware of her also and their gaze was frankly admiring as well as wondering and in passing the ham and eggs or the sugar they contrived to show her that they considered her a lady in a rough place and that they would like to know more about her  she accepted their civilities with gratitude and listened to their talk with growing interest it seemed that the young man had come down from the hills to meet his friend and take him back to his cabin  i cant do it today ross said the older man i wish i could but one meal of this kind is all i can stand these days  youre getting finicky laughed the younger man  im getting old time was when my fell of hair would rise at nothing not even flies in the butter but now  that last visit to the ancestral acres is what did it  no its ageage and prosperity i know now what it is to have broiled steak  mrs wetherford seizing the moment came down to do the honors you fellers ought to know my girl virginny this is forest supervisor redfield and this is ross cavanagh his forest ranger in this district you ought to know each other my girls just back from school and she dont think much of the fork its a little too coarse for her  lee flushed under this introduction and her distress was so evident that both men came to her rescue  the older man bowed and said i didnt know you had a daughter mrs wetherford and cavanagh with a glance of admiration added weve been wondering who you might be  lize went on i thought id got rid of her shes been away now for about ten years i dont know but it was a mistakelooks like shes grown a little too finehaired for us doughies out here  so much the worse for us replied redfield  this little dialogue gave the girl time to recover herself but as cavanagh watched the blush fade from her face leaving it cold and white he sympathized with herpitied her from the bottom of his heart he perceived that he was a chance spectator of the first scene in a painful domestic dramaone that might easily become a tragedy he wondered what the forces might be which had brought such a daughter to this sloven this virago to see a maid of this delicate bloom thrust into such a place as lize wetherfords hotel had the reputation of being roused indignation  when did you reach town he asked and into his voice his admiration crept  only last night  you find great changes here  not so great as in my mother its all she stopped abruptly and he understood  lize being drawn back to her cashregister redfield turned to say my dear young lady i dont suppose you remember me but i knew you when you were a tot of five or six i knew your father very well  did you her face lighted up  yes poor fellow he went away from here rather under a cloud you know  i remember a little of it i was here when the shooting took place  so you were well since then much has happened to us all he explained to the ranger there wasnt room for a dashing young blood such as ed wetherford was in those days he turned to lee he was no worse than the men on the other sideit was dog eat dog but some way the people rather settled on him as a scapegoat he was forced out and your mother has borne the brunt of it since those were lawless days  it was a painful subject and redfields voice grew lower and more hesitant as he went on looking at this charming girl through the smoke of fried ham with obscene insects buzzing about her fair head made him feel for the thousandth time and more keenly than ever before the amazing combinations in american society how could she be the issue of edward and eliza wetherford  more and more lee virginias heart went out in trust toward these two men opposed to the malodorous unshaven throng which filled the room they seemed wondrously softened and sympathetic and in the rangers gaze was something elsesomething which made her troubles somehow less intolerable she felt that he understood the difficult situation in which she found herself  redfield went on you find us horribly uncivilized after ten years absence  i find this uncivilised she replied with fierce intensity looking around the room then on the impulse she added i cant stand it i came here to live with my mother but this is tootoo horrible  i understand your repulsion replied redfield a thousand times i repeat apropos of this country where every prospect pleases and only man is vile  do you suppose it was as bad ten years ago she asked was everything as dirtyas mean were the houses then as full of flies and smells  im afraid they were of course the country isnt all like this and there are neat homes and gentle people in sulphur but most cattlemen areas theyve always beena shiftless happygolucky lot at bestand some of them have been worse as you know  i never dreamed of finding my mother in such a place she went on i dont know what to do or say she isnt well i ought to stay and help her and yetoh it is disheartening  lize tapped redfield on the shoulder come over here reddy if youve finished your breakfast i want to talk with you  redfield rose and followed his landlady behind the counter and there sat in earnest conversation while she made change the tone in which her mother addressed the supervisor her action of touching him as one man lays hand upon another was profoundly revealing to lee virginia she revolted from it without realizing exactly what it meant and feeling deeply but vaguely the forest rangers sympathy she asked  how can you endure this kind of life  i cant and i dont he answered cautiously for they were being closely observed i am seldom in town my dominion is more than a mile above this level my cabin is nine thousand feet above the sea it is clean and quiet up there  are all the other restaurants in the village like this  worse i come here because it is the best  she rose i cant stand this air and these flies any longer theyre too disgusting  he followed her into the other house conscious of the dismay and bitterness which burst forth the instant they were alone what am i to do she is my mother but ive lost all sense of relationship to her and these peopleexcept you and mr redfieldare all disgusting to me it isnt because my mother is poor it isnt because shes keeping boarders its something else at this point her voice failed her  the ranger deeply moved stood helplessly silent what could he say he knew a great deal better than she the essential depravity of her mother and he felt keenly the cruelty of fate which had plunged a fine young spirit into this swamp of illsmelling humanity  let us go out into the air he suggested presently the mountain wind will do you good  she followed him trustfully and as she stepped from the squalor of the hotel into the splendor of the morning her head lifted she drank the clear crisp wind as one takes water in the desert  the air is clean anyway she said  cavanagh to divert her pointed away to the mountains there is my dominion up there i am sole ruler no one can litter the earth with corruption or poison the streams  she did not speak but as she studied the ranger her face cleared it is beautiful up there  he went on i hate all this scrapheap quite as heartily as you do but up there is sweetness and sanity the streams are germless and the forest cannot be devastated that is why i am a ranger i could not endure life in a town like this  he turned up the street toward the high hill to the south and she kept step with him as she did not speak he asked what did you expect to do out here  i hoped to teach she replied her voice still choked with her emotion i expected to find the country much improved  and so it is but it is still a long way from an eastern state perhaps you will find the people less savage than they appear at first glance  it isnt the town or the people it is my mother she burst forth again tell me a woman in the car yesterday accused my mother of selling whiskey unlawfully is this so tell me  she faced him resolutely and perceiving that she could not be evaded he made slow answer i dont know that she does but ive heard it charged against her  who made the charge  one of the clergymen and then its common talk among the rough men of the town  is that the worst they say of her be honest with mei want to know the worst  he was quite decisive as he said yes that is the worst  she looked relieved im glad to hear you say so ive been imagining all kinds of terrifying things  then too her bad health is some excuse for her housekeeping he added eager to lessen the daughters humiliation and you must remember her associations are not those which breed scrupulous regard for the proprieties  but shes my mother wailed the girl coming back to the central fact she has sent me moneyshe has been kind to mewhat am i to do she needs me and yet the thought of staying here and facing her life frightens me  the rotten board walks the low rookeries the unshaven bleareyed men sitting on the thresholds of the saloons the slattern squaws wandering abroad like bedraggled hens made the girl stare with wonder and dismay she had remembered the town street as a highway filled with splendid cavaliers a list wherein heroic deeds were done with horse and pistol  she recognized one of those knights of the lariat sitting in the sun flabby grizzled and inert another was trying to mount his horse with a bottle in his hand she recalled him perfectly he had been her girlish ideal of manly beauty now here he was old and mangy with drink at forty in a most vivid and appealing sense he measured the change in her as well as the decay of the oldtime cowboy his incoherent salutation as his eyes fell upon her was like the final blasphemous word from the rearguard of a savage tribe and she watched him ride away reeling limply in his saddle as one watches a carrionladen vulture take its flight  she perceived in the ranger the man of the new order and with this in her mind she said you dont belong here youre not a western man  not in the sense of having been born here he replied i am in fact a native of england though ive lived nearly twenty years of my life in the states  she glanced at his badge how did you come to be a rangerwhat does it mean its all new to me  it is new to the west he answered smilingly glad of a chance to turn her thought from her own personal griefs it has all come about since you went east uncle sam has at last become provident and is now conserving his resources i am one of his representatives with stewardship over some ninety thousand acres of territorymostly forest  she looked at him with eyes of changing light you dont talk like an englishman and yet you are not like the men out here  i shouldnt care to be like some of them he answered my being here is quite logical i went into the cattle business like many another and i went broke i served under colonel roosevelt in the cuban war and after my term was out naturally drifted back i love the wilderness and have some natural taste for forestry and i can ride and pack a horse as well as most cowboys hence my uniform im not the best forest ranger in the service ill admit but i fancy im a fair average  and that is your badgethe pinetree  yes and i am proud of it some of the fellows are not but so far as i am concerned i am glad to be known as a defender of the forest a tree means much to me i never mark one for felling without a sense of responsibility to the future  her questions came slowly like those of a child where do you live  directly up the south fork about twenty miles  what do you do  he smiled not much i ride the trails guard the game put out fires scale lumber burn brush build bridges herd cattle count sheep survey land and a few other odd chores its supposed to be a soft snap but i cant see it that way  do you live alone  yes for the larger part of the time i have an assistant who is with me during part of the summer months mostly i am alone however i am supposed to keep open house and i catch a visitor now and then  they were both more at ease now and her unaffected interest pleased him  she went on steadily dont you get very lonely  in winter sometimes in summer im too busy to get lonely in the fire season im in the saddle every day and sometimes all night  who cooks for you  i do thats part of a rangers job we have no servant problem to contend with  do you expect to do this always  he smiled again there you touch my secret spring i have the hope of being chief forester some timei mean we all have the prospect of promotion to sustain us the service is so new that any one with even a knowledge of forestry is in demand by and by real foresters will arise  she returned abruptly to her own problem i dread to go back to my mother but i must oh how i hate that hotel i loathe the flies the smells the people that eat there the waiterseverything she shuddered  many of the evils you mention could be reformedexcept of course some of the people who come to eat i fear several of them have gone beyond reformation  as they started back down the street she saw the motorstage just leaving the door of the office that settles one question she said i cant get away till tomorrow  where would you go if you broke campback to the east  no my mother thinks there is a place for me in sulphur city  your case interests me deeply i wish i could advise you to stay but this is a rough town for a girl like you why dont you talk the problem over with the supervisor his voice became firmer mrs redfield is the very one to help you  where does she live  their ranch lies just above sulphur at the mouth of the canon may i tell him what youve told me hes a good sort is redfieldmuch better able to advise than i am  cavanagh found himself enjoying the confidence of this girl so strangely thrown into his care and the curious comment of the people in the street did not disturb him except as it bore upon his companions position in the town  at the door of the hotel some halfadozen men were clustered as the young couple approached they gave way but a short powerful man whom lee virginia recognized as gregg the sheepman called to the ranger  i want to see you before you leave town mr ranger  very well i shall be here all the forenoon answered cavanagh in the tone of a man accepting a challenge then turning to the girl he said earnestly i want to help you i shall be here for lunch and meanwhile i wish you would take redfield into your confidence hes a wise old boy and everybody knows him no one doubts his motives besides he has a family and is rich and unhurried would you like me to talk with him  if you will i want to do rightindeed i do  im sure of that he said with eyes upon her flushed and quivering face theres a way out believe me  they parted on the little porch of the hotel and her eyes followed his upright figure till he entered one of the shops he had precisely the look and bearing of a young lieutenant in the regular army and she wondered what greggs demand meant in his voice was both menace and contempt  she returned to her own room strangely heartened by her talk with the ranger if i stay here another night this room must be cleaned she decided and approached the bed as though it harbored venomous reptiles this is one of the things that must be reformed she decided harking back to the rangers quiet remark  she was still pondering ways and means of making the room habitable when her mother came in  howd you sleep last night  lee virginia could not bring herself to lie not very well she admitted  neither did i fact of the matter is your coming fairly upset me ive been kind o used up for three months i dont know what ails me id ought to go up to sulphur to see a doctor but there dont seem to be any free time i pear to have lost my grip food dont give me any strength i saw you talking with ross cavanagh theres a manand reddy reddy is what you may call a fancy ranchergoes in for alfalfy and fruit and all that he isnt in the forest service for the pay or for graft hes got a regular palace up there above sulphurhot and cold water all through the house a furnace in the cellar and two bathrooms so they tell me i never was in the place well i must go backi cant trust them girls a minute she turned with a groan of pain pears like every joint in me is acreakin today  cant i take your place asked lee virginia pity deepening in her heart as she caught the look of suffering on her mothers face  no you better keep out o the caffy it aint a fit place for you fact is i werent expecting anything so fine as you are i laid awake till three oclock last night figurin on what to do i reckon youd better go back and give this outfit up as a bad job i used to tell ed you didnt belong to neither of us and you dont i cant see where you did come fromanyhow i dont want the responsibility of havin you here why youll have half the men in the county hitchin to my corraland the males out here are a fierce lot o brutes she studied the girl again finding her so dainty so far above herself that she added it would be a cruel shame for me to keep you here with all these hewolves roamin around youre too good to be meat for any of them you just plan to pack up and pull out tomorrow  she went out with a dragging step that softened the girls heart it was true there was little of real affection between them her memories of eliza up to this moment had been rather mixed as a child she had seldom been in her arms and she had always been a little afraid of the bold bright handsome creature who rode horses and shot pistols like a man it was hard to relate the eliza wetherford of those days with this flabby limping old woman and yet her daughter came nearer to loving her at this moment than at any time since her fifth year     iii  lee virginia wages war   in truth lize had risen that morning intending to whirl in and clean up the house being suddenly conscious to some degree of the dirt and disorder around her but she found herself physically unequal to the task her brain seemed misted and her food had been a source of keen pain to her hence after a few halfhearted orders she had settled into her broad chair behind the counter and there remained brooding over her maternal responsibilities  she gave sharp answers to all the men who came up to ask after her daughter and to one who remarked on the girls good looks and demanded an introduction she said get along id as soon introduce her to a goat now you fellers want to understand ill kill the man that sets out to fool with my girl i tell you that  while yet lee virginia was wondering how to begin the days work some one knocked on her door and in answer to her invitation a woman stepped ina thin blond hag with a weak smile and watery blue eyes is this little lee virginy she asked  the girl rose yes  well howdy she extended her hand and lee took it my names jacksonmrs orlando jackson i knew yore pa and you before the war  lee virginia dimly recalled such a family and asked where do you live  we hole up down here on a ranch about twenty milesstayed with yore ma last nightthought id jest nacherly look in and say howdy are ye back fer to stay  no i dont think so will you sit down  mrs jackson took a seat come back to see how yore ma was i reckon found her pretty porely didnt ye she lowered her voice i think shes got cancer of the stummicknow thats my guess  virginia started what makes you think so  well i knew a woman who went just that way had that same flabby funny lookand that same distress after eatin i told her this mornin shed better go up to sulphur and see that new doctor you see yore ma has always been a reckless kind of a crittermore like a man than a woman god knowsan how she ever got a girl like you i dont fairly understand i reckon you must be what the breedin men call a throwback for yore pa want much to brag of ceptin for lookshe certainly was goodlookin he used to sober down when he got where you was but mygood godwerent they a pair to draw to ive heard lando tell tales of yore mas doins that would fright ye not that she fooled with men she hastened to say lord no for her the sun rose and set in ed wetherford shed leave you any day and go on the roundup with him it nigh about broke her up in business when ed hit the faraway trail  the girl perceived that in her visitor she had one of these selfoiled human talkingmachines with tongue hung in the middle as the old saying goes and she was dimly conscious of having heard her many times before you dont look very well yourself she said  me oh im like one o these injun dawgscant kill me ive been on the range so long im tough as dried beef its a fierce old place for a womanor it was before the warsince then its kind o softened down a hair  what do you mean by the war  why you remember the rustler war we date everything out here from that year you was here for i saw yea slob of a child  oh exclaimed virginia i understand now yes i was here i saw my father at the head of the cowboys  they werent cowboys they were hired killers from texas thats what let yore pa out o the state he were on the wrong side and if it hadnt a been for the regular soldiers hed a been wiped out right hyer as it was he had to skip the range and haint never been back i dont spose folks will lay it up agin youbein a girlbut they couldnt no son of ed wetherford come back here and settle not for a minute why yore ma has had to bluff the whole county amostnot that i lay anything up agin her i tell folks she was that bewitched with ed she couldnt see things any way but his way she fought to save his ranch and stawk andbut hell she couldnt do nothinand then to have him go back on her the way he didslip out twixt two days and never write that just about shot her to pieces i never could understand that in ed he peared so mortally fond of you and of her too he sure was fond of you she shook her head no cant anybody make me believe ed wetherford is alive  lee virginia started who says hes alive  now dont get excited girl he aint alive but yet folks say we dont know hes dead he jest dropped out so far as yore ma is concerned and so far as the county is concerned but some thought you was with him in the east  the girl was now aware that her visitor was hoping to gain some further information and so curtly answered ive never seen my father since that night the soldiers came and took him away to the fort and my mother told me he died down in texas  mrs jackson seemed a little disappointed but she smoothed the dress over her sharp knees and continued right there the good old days ended for yore maand for us the cattle business has been steadily on the chutethat is the freerange business i saw it comin an i says to jackson camp on some riverbottom and chuck in the alfalfy i says an thats what we did we got a little bunch o cattle up in the parkuncle sams man is lookin after em she grinned jackson kicked at the fee but i says twenty cents a head is cheap pasture were lucky to get any grass at all now that everybodys goin in for sheep pears like the sheepmen air gettin bolder and bolder in this freerange graft and im abettin on trouble she rose well im glad to ve had a word with ye but you hear me yore ma has got to have doctors help or shes agoin to fall down some day soon  every word the woman uttered every tone of her drawling voice put lee virginia back into the past she heard again the swift gallop of hooves saw once more the long line of armed ranchers and felt the hush of fear that lay over the little town on that fateful day the situation became clearer in her mind she recalled vividly the words of astonishment and hate with which the women had greeted her mother on the morning when the news came that edward wetherford was among the invading cattlebaronswas indeed one of the leaders  in philadelphia the rocky mountain states were synonyms of picturesque lawlessness the theatre of reckless romance and virginia wetherford loyal daughter of the west had defended it but in the coarse phrase of this lean rancheress was pictured a land of border warfare as ruthless as that which marked the scotland of rob roy  commonplace as the little town looked at the moment it had been the scene of many a desperate encounter as the girl herself could testify for she had seen more than one man killed therein some way the hideousness of these scenes had never shown itself to herperhaps because she had been a child at the time and had thrilled to the delicious excitement of it but now as she imagined it all happening again before her eyes she shivered with horror how monstrous how impossible those killings now seemed  then her mind came back to her mothers ailment eliza wetherford had never been one to complain and her groans meant real suffering  her mind resolved upon one thing she must see a doctor she decided and with this in mind she reentered the café where lize was again in violent altercation with a waitress  mother called lee i want to see you  with a parting volley of vituperation mrs wetherford followed her daughter back into the lodginghouse  mother the girl began facing her and speaking firmly you must go to sulphur city and see a doctor ill stay here and look after the business  mrs wetherford perceived in her daughters attitude and voice something decisive and powerful she sank into a chair and regarded her with intent gaze hett jacksons been gabblin to you she declared hett knows more fool things that aint so than any old heffer i know she said i was about all in didnt she prophesied id fall down and stay i know her  lee virginia remained firm im not going by what she said ive got eyes of my own you need help and if the doctor here cant help you you must go to sulphur or to kansas city i can run the boardinghouse till you get back  eliza eyed her curiously dont you go to countin on this chivalry of the west which storywriters put into books these men out here will eat you up if you dont watch out i wouldnt dare to leave you here alone no what ill do is sell the place if i can and both of us get out  but you need a doctor this minute  ill be all right in a little while im always the worst for an hour or two after i eat this little squirt of a local doctor gave me some dope to ease that pain but ive got my doubtsi dont want any morphine habit in mine no daughter virginny its mighty white of you to offer but you dont know what youre up against when you contract to step into my shoes  visions of reforming methods about the house passed through the girls mind there must be something i can do why dont you have the doctor come down here  i might do that if i get any worse but i hate to have you stay in the house another night its only fit for these goats of cowboys and women like hett jackson did the bugs eat you last night  virginia flushed yes  elizas face fell i was afraid of that you cant keep em out the cowboys bring em in by the quart  they can be destroyedand the flies too cant they  when youve bucked flies and bugs as long as i have youll be less peart about it i dont care a hoot in hades till somebody like you or reddy or ross comes along most of the men that camp with me are like injuns anywaythey wouldnt feel natural without bugs a ticklin em no child you get ready and pull out on the sulphur stage tomorrow ill pay your way back to philadelphy  i cant leave you now mother now that i know youre ill im going to stay and take care of you  lize rose see here girl dont you go to idealizin me neither im what the boys call an old battleaxe ive been through the whole war im able to feed myself and pay your board besides just you find some decent boardingplace in sulphur and ill see that you have ten dollars a week to live on just because youre a wetherford  but im your daughter  again eliza fixed a musing look upon her i reckon if the truth was known your aunt celia was nigher to being your mother than i ever was they always said you was all wetherford and i reckon they were right i always liked men better than babies so long as i had your father you didnt countnow thats the gods truth and i didnt intend that you should ever come back here i urged you to stayyou know that  lee virginia imagined all this to be a savage selfaccusation which sprang from long selfbereavement and yet there was something terrifying in its brutal frankness she stood in silence till her mother left the room then went to her own chamber with a painful knot in her throat what could she do with elemental savagery of this sort  the knowledge that she must spend another night in the bed led her to active measures of reform with disgustful desperation she emptied the room and swept it as with fire and sword her change of mind from the passive to the active state relieved and stimulated her and she hurried from one needed reform to another she drew others into the vortex she inspired the chambermaid to unwilling yet amazing effort and the lodginghouse endured such a blast from the besom that it stood in openwindowed astonishment uttering dust like the breath of a dragon having swept and garnished the bedchambers virginia moved on the diningroom as the ranger had said this too could be reformed  unheeding her mothers protests she organized the giggling waiters into a warring party and advanced upon the flies by hissing and shooing and the flutter of newspapers they drove the enemy before them and a carpenter was called in to mend screen doors and windows thus preventing their return new shades were hung to darken the room and new tablecloths purchased to replace the old ones and the kitchen had such a cleaning as it had not known before in five years  in this work the time passed swiftly and when redfield and cavanagh came again to lunch they exclaimed in astonishmentas indeed every one did  hows this queried cavanagh humorously has the place changed hands  lize was but grimly responsive seems like it has  i hope the price has not gone up  not yet  redfield asked whos responsible for thisyour new daughter  youve hit it shes started right in to polish us all up to city standards  we need it commented cavanagh in admiration of the girls prompt action this room is almost civilized still well sort o miss the flies  lize apologized well you know a feller gits kind o run down like a clock and has to have some outsider wind him up now and again first i was mad then i was scared but now im cheerin the girl on she can run the whole blame outfit if shes a mind toeven if i go broke for it the work she got out o them slatterheels of girls is a gods wonder  ross looked round for virginia but could not find her she had seen him come in and was out in the kitchen doing what she could to have his food brought in and properly served  redfield reassured the perturbed proprietor of the joint no fear of going broke madamquite the contrary a few little touches like this and youll be obliged to tear down and build bigger i dont believe id like to see your daughter run this eatinghouse as a permanent job but if she starts in im sure shell make a success of it  lee virginia came in flushed and selfconscious but far lighter of spirit than at breakfast and stood beside the table while the waitress laid the dishes before her guests with elaborate assumption of grace and design hitherto she had bumped them down with a slash of slangy comment the change was quite as wonderful as the absence of the flies  do we owe these happy reforms to you asked cavanagh admiring virginias neat dress and glowing cheeks  partly she answered i was desperate i had to do something so i took to ordering people around  i understand he said wont you sit at our table again  please do said redfield i want to talk with you  she took a seata little hesitantly you see i studied domestic science at school and ive never had a chance to apply it before  heres your opportunity redfield assured her my respect for the science of domestics is growingi marvel to think what another week will bring forth i think ill have to come down again just to observe the improvement in the place  it cant last lize interjected shell catch the western habitsshell sag same as we all do  no she wont declared ross with intent to encourage her if you give her a free hand i predict shell make your place the wonder and boast of the countyside  when do you go back to the mountains lee virginia asked a little later  immediately after my luncheon he replied  she experienced a pang of regret and could not help showing it a little your talk helped me she said ive decided to stay and be of use to my mother  redfield overheard this and turned toward her  this is a rough school for you lee virginia and i should dislike seeing you settle down to it for life but it cant hurt you if you are what i think you are nothing can soil or mar the mind that wills for good i want mrs redfield to know you im sure her advice will be helpful i hope youll come up and see us if you decide to settle in sulphuror if you dont  i should like to do so she said touched by the tone as well as by the words of his invitation  redfields house is one of the few completely civilized homes in the state put in cavanagh when i get so weary of cusswords and poaching and graft that i cant live without killing some one i go down to elk lodge and smoke and read the supervisors london and paris weeklies and recover my tone  redfield smiled when i get weakkneed or careless in the service and feel my selfrespect slipping away i go up to rosss cabin and talk with a man who represents the impersonal evenhanded justice of the federal law  cavanagh laughed there having handed each other reciprocal bouquets we can now tell miss wetherford the truth each of us thinks very well of himself and were both believers in the new west  what do you mean by the new west asked the girl  well the work youve been doing here this morning is a part of it answered redfield its a kind of housecleaning the old west was picturesque and in a way manly and finecertain phases of it were heroicand i hate to see it all pass but some of us began to realize that it was not all poetry the plain truth is my companions for over twenty years were lawless ruffians and the cattle business as we practiced it in those days was founded on selfishness and defended at the mouth of the pistol we were all pensioners on uncle sam and fighting to keep the other fellow off from having a share of his bounty it was all wasteful halfsavage we didnt want settlement we didnt want law we didnt want a state we wanted free range we were a line of pirates from beginning to end and were not wholly reformed yet  he was talking to the whole table now for all were listening no other man on the range could say these things with the same authority for hugh redfield was known all over the state as a man who had been one of the best riders and ropers in his outfitone who had started in as a common hand at herding and who had been entirely through the war  lee virginia listened with a stirring of the blood her recollections of the range were all of the heroic she recalled the few times when she was permitted to go on the roundup and to witness the breaking of new horses and the swiftness grace and reckless bravery of the riders the moan and surge of herds the sweep of horsemen came back and filled her mind with large and free and splendid pictures and now it was passingor past  some one at the table accused redfield of being more of a townsite boomer than a cattleman  he was quite unmoved by this charge the townsite boomer at least believes in progress he does not go so far as to shut out settlement if a neat and tidy village or a wellordered farmstead is not considered superior to a cattleranch littered with bones and tin cans or better than even a cowtown whose main industry is whiskeyselling then all civilized progress is a delusion when i was a youngster these considerations didnt trouble me i liked the cowboy life and the careless method of the plains but ive some girls growing up now and i begin to see the whole business in a new light i dont care to have my children live the life ive lived besides what right have we to stand in the way of a communitys growth suppose the new life is less picturesque than the old we dont like to leave behind us the pleasures and sports of boyhood but we grow up nevertheless im far more loyal to the state as forest supervisor than i was when i was riding with the cattlemen to scare up the nester  he uttered all this quite calmly but his ease of manner his absolute disregard of consequences joined with his wealth and culture gave his words great weight and power no one was ready with an answer but lize who called out with mocking accent reddy youre too good for the forest service youd ought o be our next governor  this was a centre shot redfield flushed and cavanagh laughed mr supervisor you are discovered  redfield recovered himself i should like to be governor of this state for about four years but im likelier to be lynched for being in command of twenty cossacks  at this moment sam gregg entered the room followed by a young man in an english ridingsuit seeing that the starboarder table offered a couple of seats they pointed that way sam was plainly in warlike frame of mind and slammed his sombrero on its nail with the action of a man beating an adversary  that is sam gregg and his son joeused to be ranch cattleman now one of our biggest sheepmen cavanagh explained hes bucking the cattlemen now  lee virginia studied young gregg with interest for his dress was that of a man to whom money came easy and his face was handsome though rather fat and sullen in truth he had been brought into the room by his father to see lize wetherfords girl and his eyes at once sought and found her a look of surprise and pleasure at once lit his face  gregg was sullen because of his interview with cavanagh which had been in the nature of a grapple and in the light of what redfield had said lee virginia was able to perceive in these two men a struggle for supremacy gregg was the greedy west checked and restrained by the law  every man in the room knew that gregg was a bitter opponent of the forest service and that he had it in for the ranger and some of them knew that he was throwing more sheep into the forest than his permits allowed and that a clash with redfield was sure to come it was just like the burly old irishman to go straight to the table where his adversary sat  virginias eyes fell before the gaze of these two men for they had none of the shyness or nothing of the indirection of the ruder men she had met they expressed something which angered her though she could not have told precisely why  redfield did not soften his words on greggs account on the contrary he made them still more cutting and to the line  the mere fact that i live near the open range or a national forest does not give me any rights in the range or forest he was saying as gregg took his seat i enjoy the privilege of these government grazing grounds and i ought to be perfectly willing to pay the fee these forests are the property of the whole nation they are public lands and should yield a revenue to the whole nation it is silly to expect the government to go on enriching a few of us stockmen at the expense of others i see this and i accept the change  after youve got rich at it said gregg  well havent you retorted redfield are you so greedy that nothing will stop you  lize threw in a wise word the sportinghouses of kansas city and chicago keep old sam poor  a roar of laughter followed this remark and gregg was stumped for a moment but the son grinned appreciatively now be good  cavanagh turned to virginia in haste to shield her from all that lay behind and beneath this sally of the older and deeply experienced woman the supervisor is willing to yield a pointhe knows what the new west will bring  gregg growled out im not letting any of my rights slip  the girl was troubled by the warlight which she saw in the faces of the men about her and vague memories of the words and stories she had overchanced to hear in her childhood came back to her mindhints of the drunken orgies of the cowboys who went to the city with cattle and the terrifying suggestion of their attitude toward all womankind she set cavanagh and his chief quite apart from all the others in the room and at first felt that in young gregg was another man of education and right livingbut in this she was misled  lize had confidence enough in the ranger to throw in another malicious word ross old bullfrog came down here to chase you up a treeso he said did he do it  gregg looked ugly im not done with this business  she turned to ross dont let him scare youhis beller is a whole lot worse than his bite  this provoked another laugh and gregg was furiousall the more so that his son joined in ill have your head mr supervisor ill carry my fight to the secretary  very well returned redfield carry it to the president if you wish i simply repeat that your sheep must correspond to your permit and if you dont send up and remove the extra number i will do it myself i dont make the rules of the department my job is to carry them out  by this time every person in the room was tense with interest they all knew gregg and his imperious methods he was famous for saying once when in his cup i always thought sheepmen were blankety blank sons of guns and now im one of em i know they are some of the cattlemen in the room had suffered from his greed and while they were not partisans of the supervisor they were glad to see him face his opponent fearlessly  lize delivered a parting blow bullfrog you and me are oldtimers were on the losing side we belong to the good old days when the fork was a mans town and to be shot up once a week kept us in news but them times are past you cant run the range that way any more why man youll have to buy and fence your own pasture in a few years more or else pay rent same as i do you stockmen kick like steers over paying a few old cents a head for five months range youll be mighty glad to pay a dollar one o these days take your medicinethats my advice and she went back to her cashdrawer  redfields voice was cuttingly contemptuous as he said quite calmly youre all kinds of asses you sheepmen you ought to pay the fee for your cattle with secret joy so long as you can get your stock pastured and in effect guarded by the government from june to november for twenty cents or even fifty cents per head youre in luck mrs wetherford is right weve all been educated in a bad school uncle sam has been too bloomin lazy to keep any supervision over his public lands hes permitted us grass pirates to fight and lynch and burn one another on the high range to which neither of us had any right holding back the real user of the landthe farmer weve played the part of selfish and greedy gluttons so long that we fancy our privileges have turned into rights having grown rich on free range youre now fighting the forest service because it is disposed to make you pay for what has been a gratuity im a hog gregg but im not a fool i see the course of empire and im getting into line  gregg was silenced but not convinced its a long lane that has no turn he growled  redfield resumed in impersonal heat the cowman was conceived in anarchy and educated in murder whatever romantic notions i may have had of the plains twentyfive years ago they are lost to me now the freerange stockowner has no country and no god nothing but a range that isnt his and damned bad mannersbegging pardon miss wetherford the sooner he dies the better for the state hes a dirty wasteful sloven content to eat canned beans and drink canned milk in his rotten bad coffee and nobody but an old crank like myself has the grace to stand up and tell the truth about him  cavanagh smiled and you wouldnt if you werent a man of independent means and known to be one of the most experienced cowpunchers in the county ive no fight with men like gregg all is theyve got to conform to the rules of the service  gregg burst out you think youre the whole united states army who gives you all the authority  congress and the president  theres nothing in that bill to warrant these petty tyrannies of yours  what you call tyrannies i call defending the public domain replied redfield if i had my way id give my rangers the power of the canadian mounted police is there any other state in this nation where the roping of sheepherders and the wholesale butchery of sheep would be permitted from the very first the public lands of this state have been a refuge for the criminala lawless nomans land but now thanks to roosevelt and the chief forester we at least have a force of men on the spot to see that some semblance of law and order is maintained you fellows may protest and run to washington and you may send your paid representatives there but youre sure to lose as freerange monopolists you are cumberers of the earth and all you represent must pass before this state can be anything but the byword it now is i didnt feel this so keenly ten years ago but with a bunch of children growing up my vision has grown clearer the picturesque west must give way to the civilized west and the war of sheepmen and cattlemen must stop  the whole diningroom was still as he finished and lee virginia with a girls vague comprehension of the mans world apprehended in redfields speech a large and daring purpose  gregg sneered perhaps you intend to run for congress on that line of talk  redfields voice was placid at any rate i intend to represent the policy that will change this state from the sparsely settled battleground of a lot of mounted hobos to a state with an honorable place among the other commonwealths if this be treason make the most of it  cavanagh was disturbed for while he felt the truth of his chiefs words he was in doubt as to the policy of uttering them  it was evident to virginia that the cowmen as well as gregg were nearly all against the prophet of the future and she was filled with a sense of having arrived on the scene just as the curtain to a stern and purposeful drama was being raised with her recollections of the savage days of old it seemed as if redfield by his bold words had placed his life in danger  cavanagh rose i must be going he said with a smile  again the pang of loss touched her heart when will you come again she asked in a low voice  it is hard to say a rangers place is in the forest i am very seldom in town just now the danger of fires is great and i am very uneasy i may not be down again for a month  the table was empty now and they were standing in comparative isolation looking into each others eyes in silence at last she murmured youve helped me im going to staya little while anyway and do what i can  im sorry i cant be of actual service but i am a soldier with a work to do even if i were here i could not help you as regards the townspeoplethey all hate me quite cordially but redfield and especially mrs redfield can be of greater aid and comfort hes quite often here and when you are lonely and discouraged let him take you up to elk lodge  ive been working all the morning to make this room decent it was rather fun dont you think it helped  i saw the mark of your hand the moment i entered the door he earnestly replied im not one that laughs at the small field of womans work if you make this little hotel clean and homelike youll be doing a very considerable work in bringing about the new west which the supervisor is spouting about he extended his hand and as she took it he thrilled to the soft strength of it till next time he said good luck  she watched him go with a feeling of painas if in his going she were losing her best friend and most valiant protector     iv  virginia takes another motor ride   lee virginias efforts to refine the little hotel produced an amazing change in eliza wetherfords affairs the diningroom swarmed with those seeking food and as the news of the girls beauty went out upon the range the cowboys sought excuse to ride in and get a square meal and a glimpse of the queen whose hand had witched the old shack into a marvel of cleanliness  say what you will beauty is a sovereign appeal these men unspeakably profane cruel and obscene in their saddletalk were awed by the fresh linen the burnished glass and the wellordered tables which they found in place of the flies the dirt and the disorder of aforetime its worth a days ride just to see that girl for a minute declared one enthusiast  they did not all use the napkins but they enjoyed having them there beside their plates and the subdued light the freedom from insects impressed them almost to decorum they entered with awe avid for a word with lize wetherfords girl generally they failed of so much as a glance at her for she kept away from the diningroom at mealtime  lee virginia was fully aware of this male curiosity and vaguely conscious of the merciless light which shone in the eyes of some of them men like gregg who went about their game with the shameless directness of the brute she had begun to understand too that her mothers reputation was a barrier between the better class of folk and herself but as they came now and again to take a meal they permitted themselves a word in her praise which she resented i dont want their friendship now she declared bitterly  as she gained courage to look about her she began to be interested in some of her coatless collarless boarders on account of their extraordinary history there was brady the old government scout retired on a pension who was accustomed to sit for hours on the porch gazing away over the northern plainsnever toward the mountainsas if he watched for bear or bison or for the files of hostile red huntersthough in reality there was nothing to see but the stage coming and going or a bunch of cowboys galloping into town nevertheless every cloud of dust was to him diversion and he appeared to dream like a captive eagle bedraggled spiritless but with an inner spark of memory burning deep in his dim blue eyes  then there was an old miner distressingly filthy who hobbled to his meals on feet that had been frozen into clubs he had a little gold loaned at interest and on this he lived in tragic parsimony he and the old scout sat much together usually without speech each knew to the last word the others stories as if they recognized each others utter loneliness  sifton the old remittance man had been born to a higher culture therefore was his degradation the deeper his poverty was due to his weakness virginia was especially drawn toward him by reason of his inalienable politeness and his wellchosen words he was always the gentlemanno matter how frayed his clothing  so far as the younger men were concerned she saw little to admire and much to hate they were crude and uninteresting rowdies for the most part she was put upon her defence by their glances and she came to dread walking along the street so open and coarse were their words of praise she felt dishonored by the glances which her feet drew after her and she always walked swiftly to and from the store or the postoffice  few of these loafers had the courage to stand on their feet and court her favor but there was one who speedily became her chief persecutor this was neill ballard celebrated and made impudent by two years travel with a wild west show he was tall lean angular and freckled but his horsemanship was marvellous and his skill with the rope magical his special glory consisted in a complicated whirling of the lariat in his hand the limp inert cord took on life grace charm it hung in the air or ran in rhythmic waves about him rising falling expanding diminishing as if controlled by some agency other than a mans hand and its gyrations had won much applause in the eastern cities where such skill is expected of the cowboys  he had lost his engagement by reason of a drunken brawl and he was now living with his sister the wife of a small rancher near by he was vain lazy and unspeakably corrupt full of open boasting of his exploits in the drinkingdens of the east no sooner did he fix eyes upon virginia than he marked her for his special prey he had the depraved heart of the herder and the insolent confidence of the hoodlum and something of this the girl perceived she despised the other men but she feared this one and quite justly for he was capable of assaulting and binding her with his rope as he had once done with a shoshone squaw  the greggs father and son were in open rivalry for lee also but in different ways the older man who had already been married several times was disposed to buy her hand in what he called honorable wedlock but the son at heart a libertine approached her as one who despised the west and who being kept in the beastly country by duty to a parent was ready to amuse himself at any ones expense he had no purpose in life but to feed his body and escape toil  there are women to whom all this warfare would have been diverting but it was not so to lee her sense of responsibility was too keen it was both a torture and a shame the chivalry of the plains of which she had read so muchand which she supposed she rememberedwas gone she doubted if it had ever existed among these centaurs why should it inhere in ignorant brutal plainsmen any more than in ignorant brutal factory hands  there came to her now and again gentle old ranchersgrangers they would be calledand shy boys from the farms but for the most part the men she saw embittered her and she kept out of their sight as much as possible her keenest pleasures almost her only pleasures lay in the occasional brief visits of the ranger as he rode in for his mail  lize perceived all these attacks on her daughter and was infuriated by them she snapped and snarled like a tigress leading her halfgrown kitten through a throng of leopards her brows were knotted with care as well as with pain and she incessantly urged virginia to go back to sulphur ill send you money to pay your board till you strike a job but to this the girl would not agree and the business by reason of her presence went on increasing from day to day  to redfield lize one day confessed her pain i ought to send for that doctor up there but the plain truth is im afraid of him i dont want to know whats the matter of me its his job to tell me im sick and im scared of his verdict  nonsense he replied you cant afford to put off getting him much longer im going back tonight but ill be over again tomorrow why dont you let me bring him down it will save you twelve dollars and by the way suppose you let me take lee virginia home with me she looks a bit depressed an outing will do her good shes taken hold here wonderfully  hasnt she but i should have sent her away the very first night im getting to depend on her im plumb foolish about her nowcant let her out of my sight and yet im off my feed worryin over her gregg is getting dangerousyou cant fool me when it comes to men curse em theyre all alikebeasts every cussed one of them i wont have my girl mistreated i tell you that im not fit to be her mother now thats the gods truth reddy and this rotten little backcountry cowtown is no place for her but what can i do she wont leave me so long as im sick and every day ties her closer to me i dont know what id do without her if im goin to die i want her by me when i take my drop so you see just how im placed  she looked yellow and drawn as she ended and redfield was moved by her unwonted tenderness  now let me advise he began after a moments pause we musnt let the girl get homesick ill take her home with me this afternoon and bring her back along with a doctor tomorrow  all right but before you go i want to have a private talki want to tell you something  he warned her away from what promised to be a confession now now eliza dont tell me anything that requires that tone of voice im a bad person to keep a secret and you might be sorry for it i dont want to know anything more about your business than i can guess  i dont mean the whiskey trade she explained ive cut that all out anyway its something more importantits about ed and me  i dont want to hear that either he declared let bygones be bygones what you did then is outlawed anyway those were fierce times and i want to forget them he looked about let me see this miss virginia and convey to her mrs redfields invitation  shes in the kitchen i reckon go right out  he was rather glad of a chance to see the young reformer in action and smiled as he came upon her surrounded by waiters and cooks busily superintending the preparations for the noon meal which amounted to a tumult each day  she saw redfield nodded and a few moments later came toward him flushed and beaming with welcome im glad to see you again mr supervisor  he bowed profoundly im delighted to find you well miss virginia and doubly pleased to see you in your regimentals which you mightily adorn  she looked down at her apron i made this myself do you know our business is increasing wonderfully im busy every moment of the day till bedtime  indeed i do know it i hear of the wetherford house all up and down the line i was just telling your mother shell be forced to build bigger like the chap in the bible  she works too hard poor mother i try to get her to turn the cashdrawer over to me but she wont do it doesnt she seem paler and weaker to you  she does indeed and this is what i came in to propose mrs redfield sends by me a formal invitation to you to visit elk lodge she is not quite able to take the long ride else shed come to you here he handed her a note i suggest that you go up with me this afternoon and tomorrow well fetch the doctor down to see your mother what do you say to that  her eyes were dewy with grateful appreciation of his kindness as she answered that would be a great pleasure mr redfield if mother feels able to spare me  ive talked with her she is anxious to have you go  virginia was indeed greatly pleased and pleasantly excited by this message for she had heard much of mrs redfields exclusiveness and also of the splendor of her establishment she hurried away to dress with such flutter of joyous anticipation that redfield felt quite repaid for the pressure he had put upon his wife to induce her to write that note you may leave lize wetherford out of the count my dear he had said there is nothing of her discernible in the girl virginia is a lady i dont know where she got it but shes a gentlewoman by nature  lize said dont you figure on me in any way reddy im nothing but the old hen that raised up this lark and all im alivin for now is to make her happy just you cut me out when it comes to any question about your wife and virginia im not in their class  it was hot and still in the town but no sooner was the car in motion than both heat and dust were forgotten redfields machine was not large and as he was content to go at moderate speed conversation was possible  he was of that sunny optimistic everyouthful nature which finds delight in human companionship under any conditions whatsoever he accepted this girl for what she seemeda fresh unspoiled child he saw nothing cheap or commonplace in her and was not disposed to impose any of her fathers wild doings upon her calendar he had his misgivings as to her futurethat was the main reason why he had said to mrs redfield the girl must be helped afterward he had said sustained  it was inevitable that the girl should soon refer to the ranger and redfield was as complimentary of him as she could wish ross hasnt a fault but one and thats a negative one he doesnt care a hang about getting on as they say over in england hes content just to do the duty of the moment he made a good cowpuncher and a good soldier but as for promotion he laughs when i mention it  he told me that he hoped to be chief forester protested virginia  oh yes he says that but do you know hed rather be where he is riding over the hills than live in london you should see his cabin some time its most wonderful really his walls are covered with bookshelves of his own manufacture and chairs of his own design where the boy got the skill i dont see heaven knows his sisters are conventional enough hes capable of being supervisor but he wont live in town and work in an office hes like an indian in his love of the open  all this was quite too absorbingly interesting to permit of any study of the landscape which went by as if dismissed by the chariot wheels of some contemptuous magician redfields eyes were mostly on the road in the manner of the careful driver but when he did look up it was to admire the color and poise of his seatmate who made the landscape of small account  she kept the conversation to the desired point mr cavanaghs work interests me very much it seems very important and it must be new for i never heard of a forest ranger when i was a child  the forester is newat least in america he answered my dear young lady you are returned just in the most momentous period in the history of the west the old dominionthe cattlerangeis passing the supremacy of the cowboy is ended the cowboss is raising oats the cowboy is pitching alfalfa and swearing horribly as he blisters his hands some of the rangers at the moment are men of western training like ross but whose allegiance is now to uncle sam with others that transfer of allegiance is not quite complete hence the insolence of men like gregg who think they can bribe or intimidate these forest guards and so obtain favors the newer men are collegebred real foresters but you cant know what it all means till you see ross or some other ranger on his own heath well make up a little party some day and drop down upon him and have him show us about its a lonely life and so the ranger keeps open house would you like to go  oh yes indeed im eager to get into the mountains every night as i see the sun go down over them i wonder what the world is like up there  then he began very delicately to inquire about her eastern experience there was not much to tell in a lovely old town not far from philadelphia where her aunt lived she had spent ten years of happy exile i was horribly lonely and homesick at first she said mother wrote only short letters and my father never wrote at all i didnt know he was dead then he was always good to me he wasnt a bad man was he  no responded redfield without hesitation he was very like the rest of usonly a little more reckless and a little more partisan thats all he was a dashing horseman and a deadshot and so naturally a leader of these daredevils he was popular with both sides of the controversy up to the very moment when he went south to lead the invaders against the rustlers  what was it all about i never understood it what were they fighting about  in a sense it was all very simple you see uncle sam in his careless donothing way has always left his range to whomever got there first and that was the cattleman at first there was grass enough for us all but as we built sheds and corrals about wateringplaces we came to claim rights on the range we usually secured by fraud homesteads in the sections containing water and so gun in hand stood off the man who came after gradually after much shooting and lawing we parcelled out the range and settled down covering practically the whole state our adjustments were not perfect but our system was working smoothly for us who controlled the range we had convinced ourselves and pretty nearly everybody else that the state was only fit for cattlegrazing and that we were the most competent grazers furthermore we were in possession and no man could come in without our consent  however a very curious law of our own making was our undoing of course the nester or punkin roller as we contemptuously called the small farmer began sifting in here and there in spite of our guns but he was only a mosquito bite in comparison with the trouble which our cowpunchers stirred up perhaps you remember enough about the business to know that an unbranded yearling calf without its mother is called a maverick  yes i remember that it belongs to the man who finds him and brands him  precisely now that law worked very nicely so long as the poor cowboy was willing to catch and brand him for his employer but it proved a joker when he woke up and said to his fellows why brand these mavericks at five dollars per head for this or that outfit when the law says it belongs to the man who finds him  lee virginia looked up brightly that seems right to me  ah yes but wait we cattlemen had large herds and the probabilities were that the calf belonged to some one of us whereas the cowboy having no herd at all knew the maverick belonged to some ones herd true the law said it was his but the law did not mean to reward the freebooter yet that is exactly what it did at first only a few outlaws took advantage of it but hard years came on the cattle business became less and less profitable we were forced to lay off our men and so at last the range swarmed with idle cowpunchers then came the breakdown in our scheme the cowboys took to mavericking on their own account some of them had the grace to go into partnership with some farmer and so claim a small bunch of cows but others suddenly and miraculously acquired herds of their own from keeping within the law they passed to violent methods they slit the tongues of calves for the purpose of separating them from their mothers finding he could not suck bossy would at last wander away from his dam and so become a maverick in short anarchy reigned on the range  but surely my father had nothing to do with this  no your father up to this time had been on good terms with everybody he had a small herd of cattle down the river which he owned in common with a man named hart  i remember him  he was well thought of by all the big outfits and when the situation became intolerable and we got together to weed out the rustlers as these cattlethieves were called your father was approached and converted to a belief in drastic measures he had suffered less than the rest of us because of his small herd and the fact that he was very popular among the cowboys so far as i was concerned the use of violent methods revolted me my training in the east had made me a respecter of the law change the law i said the law is all right they replied the trouble is with these rustlers well hang a few of em and that will break up the business  parts of this story came back to the girls mind producing momentary flashes of perfect recollection she heard again the voices of excited men arguing over and over the question of mavericking and she saw her father as he rode up to the house that last day before he went south  redfield went on the whole plan as developed was silly and i wonder still that ed wetherford who knew the nester and the cowboy so well should have lent his aid to it the cattlemensome from cheyenne some from denver and a few from new york and chicagoagreed to finance a sort of vigilante corps composed of men from the outside on the understanding that this policing body should be commanded by one of their own number your father was chosen second in command and was to guide the party for he knew almost every one of the rustlers and could ride directly to their doors  i wish he hadnt done that murmured the girl  i must be frank with you virginia i cant excuse that in him it was a kind of treachery he must have been warped by his associates they convinced him by some means that it was his duty and one fine day the fork was startled by a messenger who rode in to say that the cattlebarons were coming with a hundred texas bad men to clean out the town and to put their own men into office this last was silly rot to me but the people believed it  the girl was tingling now i remember i remember the men who rode into the town to give the alarm their horses were white with foam their heads hung down and their sides went in and out i pitied the poor things mother jumped on her pony and rode out among the men she wanted to go with them but they wouldnt let her i was scared almost breathless  i was in sulphur city and did not hear of it till it was nearly all over redfield resumed his speech showing a little of the excitement which thrilled through the girls voice well the first act of vengeance was so illconsidered that it practically ended the whole campaign the invaders fell upon and killed two ranchersone of whom was probably not a rustler at all but a peaceable settler and the other one they most barbarously hanged more than this they attacked and vainly tried to kill two settlers whom they met on the roadgerman farmers with no connection so far as known with the thieves these men escaped and gave the alarm in a few hours the whole range was aflame with vengeful fire the forks as you may recall was like a swarm of bumblebees every man and boy was armed and mounted the storekeepers distributed guns and ammunition leaders developed and the embattled punkin rollers rustlers and townsmen rode out to meet the invaders  the girl paled with memory of it it was terrible i went all day without eating and for two nights we were all too excited to sleep it seemed as if the world were coming to an end mother cried because they wouldnt let her go with them she didnt know father was leading the other army  she must have known soon for it was reported that your father was among them she certainly knew when they were driven to earth in that log fort for they were obliged to restrain her by force from going to your father as i run over those furious days it all seems incredible like a sudden reversal to barbarism  how did it all end the soldiers came didnt they  yes the long arm of uncle sam reached out and took hold upon the necks of both parties i guess your father and his band would have died right there had not the regular army interfered it only required a sergeant wearing uncle sams uniform to come among those armed and furious cowboys and remove their prisoners  i saw that it was very strangethat sergeant was so young and so brave  he turned and smiled at her do you know who that was  her eyes flashed she drew her breath with a gasp was it mr cavanagh  yes it was ross he was serving in the regular army at the time he has told me since that he felt no fear whatever uncle sams blue coat was like siegfrieds magic armor he said it was the kind of thing the mounted police of canada had been called upon to do many a time and i went in and got my men that ended the war so far as violent measures went and it really ended the sovereignty of the cattleman the power of the nester has steadily increased from that moment  but my fatherwhat became of him they took him away to the east and that is all i ever knew what do you think became of him  i could never make up my mind all sorts of rumors come to us concerning him as a matter of fact the state authorities sympathized with the cattlebarons and my own opinion is that your father was permitted to escape he was afterward seen in texas and later it was reported that he had been killed there  the girl sat still listening to the tireless whir of the machine and looking out at the purpling range with tearmist eyes at last she said i shall never think of my father as a bad man he was always so gentle to me  you need not condemn him my dear young lady first of all its not fair to bring him as he was in those days forward into these piping times of dairy cows and alfalfa the people of the forkssome of them at leastconsider him a traitor and regard you as the daughter of a renegade but what does it matter each year sees the old west diminish and already in the work of the forest service law and order advance notwithstanding all the shouting of herders and the beating to death of sheep no hostile shot has ever been fired within the bounds of a national forest in the work of the forest rangers lies the hope of ultimate peace and order over all the public lands  the girl fell silent again her mind filled with larger conceptions of life than her judgment had hitherto been called upon to meet she knew that redfield was right and yet that world of the pastthe world of the swift herdsman and his trampling longhorned halfwild kine still appealed to her imagination the west of her girlhood seemed heroic in memory even the quiet account of it to which she had just listened could not conceal its epic largeness of movement the part which troubled her most was her fathers treachery to his neighbors that he should fight that he should kill men in honorable warfare she could understand but not his recreancy his desertion of her mother and herself  she came back to dwell at last on the action of that slim young soldier who had calmly ridden through the infuriated mob she remembered that she had thrilled even then at the vague and impersonal power which he represented to her childish mind he seemed to bear a charm like the heroes of her storybookssomething which made him invulnerable  after a long pause redfield spoke again the memory of your father will make life for a time a bit hard for you in roaring forkperhaps your mothers advice is sound why not come to sulphur city which is almost entirely of the new spirit  if i can get my mother to come too i will be glad to do so for i hate the fork but i will not leave her there sick and alone  much depends upon the doctors examination tomorrow  they had topped the divide now between the fork and sulphur creek basin and the green fields the alfalfa meadows and the painted farmhouses thickened beneath them strange how significant all these signs were now a few days ago they had appeared doubtful improvements now they represented the oncoming dominion of the east they meant cleanliness and decent speech good bread and sweet butter ultimately houses with hot water in their bathrooms and pianos in their parlors would displace the shack the hitchingpole and the dogrun and in those days edward wetherford would be forgotten  redfield swept through the town then turned up the stream directly toward the high wall of the range which was ragged and abrupt at this point they passed several charming farmhouses and the western sky grew ever more glorious with its plumcolor and saffron and the range reasserted its mastery over the girl at last they came to the very jaws of the canon and there in a deep natural grove of lofty cottonwoodtrees redfield passed before a high rustic gate which marked the beginning of his estate the driveway was of gravel and the intermingling of transplanted shrubs and pinetrees showed the care of the professional gardener  the house was far from being a castle indeed it was very like a house in brynmawr except that it was built entirely of halfhewn logs with a wide projecting roof giant hydrangeas and other flowering shrubs bordered the drive and on the rustic terrace a lady in white was waiting  redfield slowed down and scrambled ungracefully out but his voice was charming as he said eleanor this it miss wetherford she was on the point of getting the blues so i brought her away he explained  mrs redfield quite as urban as the house was a slim little woman of delicate habit very far from the ordinary conception of a ranchers wife her manner was politely considerate but not heatedly cordial the visitor was not precisely hers and though she warmed a little after looking into virginias face she could not by any stretch of phrase be called cordial  are you tired would you like to lie down before dinner she asked  oh no indeed nothing ever tires me virginia responded with a smile  you look like one in perfect health continued her hostess in the envious tone of one who knew all too well what illhealth meant let me show you to your room  the house was not precisely the palace the cowboy had reported it to be but it was charmingly decorated and the furnishings were tasteful to the girl it was as if she had been transported with instant magic from the horrible little cowtown back to the home of one of her dearest friends in chester she was at once exalted and humbly grateful  we dine at seven mrs redfield was saying so you can take a cup of tea without spoiling your dinner will you venture it  if you please  very well come down soon and ill have it ready mr redfield im sure will want some  virginias heart was dancing with delight of this home as she came down the stairs a little later she found mr redfield at the farther end of a long sittingroom whose dim light was as restful after the glare of the tawny plains as the voice of her hostess was to her ears which still ached with the noise of profane and vulgar speech  redfield heard her coming and met her halfway and with stately ceremony showed her a seat i fear you will need something stronger than tea after my exhausting conversation  i hope hugh you were not in one of your talking moods  i was eleanor i talked incessantly barring an occasional jolt of the machine  you poor thing this to virginia truly you deserve a two hours rest before dinner for our dinner is always a talkfest and tonight with senator bridges here it will be a convention  he turned to virginia we were talking old times before the war and you know it never tires veterans to run over their ancient campaignsdoes it lee virginia  as they talked mrs redfield studied the girl with increasing interest and favor and soon got at her point of view she even secured a little more of her story which matched fairly well with the account her husband had given her prejudices were swept away and she treated her young guest as one wellborn and welleducated woman treats another  at last she said we dress for dinner but any frock you have will do we are not ironclad in our rules there will be some neighbors in but it isnt in any sense a party  lee virginia went to her room borne high upon a new conception of the possibilities of the west it was glorious to think that one could enjoy the refinement the comfort of the east at the same time that one dwelt within the inspiring shadow of the range she caught some prophetic hint in all this of the future age when each of these foothills would be peopled by those to whom cleanliness of mind and grace of body were habitual standing on the little balcony which filled the front of her windows she looked away at the towering heights smoky purple against a sky of burning gold and her eyes expanded like those of the young eagle when about to launch himself upon the sunset wind  the roar of a waterfall came to her ears and afar on the sagegreen carpet of the lower mesa a horseman was galloping swiftly far to the left of this smoothly sculptured tableland a band of cattle fed while under her eyes formal as a suburban home lay a garden of oldfashioned english flowers it was a singular and moving union of the old and newthe east and the west  on her table and on the pretty bookshelves she found several of the latest volumes of poetry and essays and the bed with its dainty covering and ample spread testified quite as plainly of taste and comfort her hands were atremble as she put on the bright muslin gown which was all she had for evening wear she felt very much like the schoolgirl again and after she had done her best to look nice she took a seat in the little rocker with intent to compose herself for her meeting with strangers i wish we were dining without visitors she said as she heard a carriage drive up a little later a galloping horse entered the yard and stopped at the door  it all sounds like a play she said to herself forgetting for the moment that she was miles away from a town and in a lonely ranchhouse under the very shadows of the mountains  she heard voices in the hall and among them one with a very english accentone that sounded precisely like those she had heard on the stage it was the voice of a man big hearty with that thick throaty gurgle which is so suggestive of london that one is certain to find a tweed suit and ridingbreeches associated with it  at last she dared wait no longer and taking courage from necessity descended the stairsa pleasant picture of vigorous yet somewhat subdued maidenhood     v  two on the veranda   redfield met his young guest in dinnercoat looking extremely urban and presented his friend and neighbor mr enderby  enderby turned out to be the owner of the voice with the english accent which lee virginia had heard in the hall but he was very nice and a moment later mrs redfield entered with mrs enderby a large lady with a smiling face then a voice she knew spoke from behind her i dont need a presentation miss wetherford and i have already met  she turned to meet ross cavanagh the young ranger  how did you get here she asked in wonder  i rode across the hills its not far  he too was in evening dress and as she stared at him in surprise he laughingly protested please dont scrutinize this coat too closely its the only one ive owned for ten years and this is the only house in which id dare to wear it  bridges who turned out to be a state senator was a farmerlike elderly man wearing a badly fitting serge suit he was markedly western so was his wife who looked rather uneasy and hot  it was all delightfully exciting to lee virginia and to be taken in to dinner by the transfigured ranger completed her appreciation of the charming home and its refined hostess  redfield shone as host presenting an admirable mixture of clubman and western rancher his natural sense of humor sharpened by twenty years of plains life was western his manner his habits of dress of dining of taking wine were uncorruptedly manhattan enderby large highcolored was naturally a bit of what we know as the hawhaw type of englishmana thoroughly good fellow kindly tolerant brave and generous who could not possibly change his spots he had failed utterly to acquire the american idiom and his attempts at cowboy slang were often amusingespecially to redfield who prided himself on being quite undistinguishable in a cowcamp  virginia and ross being the only young folk at the table were seated together and enderby remarked privately ross youre in luck  i know i am he replied heartily  he was as redfield had said highly susceptible made so by his solitary life in the mountains and to be seated close beside this maid of the valley stirred his blood to the dangerpoint it was only by an effort of the will that he kept in touch with redfields remarks  enderby never can grow accustomed to his democratic neighbors redfield was saying hes been here six years and yet when one of his cowboy friends tells him to go to hell hes surprised and a bit offended  oh it isnt that explained mrs enderby its to have your maids say all right when you ask them to remove the soup its a bit shocking also to have your cook or housemaid going about the house singing some wretched ditty what was that one charley that irma maud sang till we were nearly wild irma maud was my chambermaid what was it something about tixey ann  oh i know it perfectly exclaimed enderby if you want to make a niggah feel good  no no thats another one  redfield interposed you wouldnt have them go about in sullen stealth would you think how song lightens their drudgery  ah yes but if it drives the family outofdoors  it shouldnt you should take it all as a part of the happy world of democracy wherein even the maidservant sings at her toil  but our democratic neighbors are all the time coming to look round the place weve no privacy whatever on sunday afternoon they drive through the grounds in procession youd think our place a public park and we the keepers  in all this banter virginia was given the english viewpoint as to western manners and conditions she perceived that the enderbys notwithstanding their heavyset prejudices were persons of discernment and right feeling it certainly was impertinent of the neighbors to ride through the grounds as if they were public and mrs enderby was justified in resenting it  ross turned to her enderby is the kind of englishman who wants to adapt himself to new conditions but cant  you dont seem like an englishman at all  well i was caught young and besides im really irishon my fathers side  oh thats different she exclaimed as though that somehow brought him nearer to her own people  it is isnt it he laughingly agreed but enderbyi suppose his pedigree goes back to cedric and his swineherds you cant change that kind  i hadnt the least thought of seeing you here how did you happen to come  redfield telephoned me at the mill and i came at once i havent been here since may and i just thought id take a half a day off luckily my understudy was with me i left him on the job  he did not tell her that she was the principal reason for this sudden descent upon elk lodge and no one but redfield knew the killing ride he had taken in order to be in at the beginning of the dinner the girls face and voice especially her voice had been with him night and day as he went about his solitary duties her life problem had come to fill his mind to a disturbing degree and he was eager to know more of her and of her struggle against the vice and vulgarity of the forks  how is your mother he asked a few minutes later  not at all well mr redfield is to take the doctor back with us tomorrow the ecstasy died out of her face and the flexible lips drooped with troubled musing i am afraid she suffers more than she will admit  she needs a rest and change she should get away from her seat at that cashregister and return to the open air a touch of camplife would help her she sticks too close to her work  i know she does but she wont let me relieve her even for an hour it isnt because she doesnt trust me she says its because she doesnt want me sitting theresopublicly she doesnt oppose my housekeeping any more  you certainly have made the old hotel into a place of miraculous neatness  she flushed with pleasure i have done something but not as id like to do i really think if mother wishes to sell she could do so now to much better advantage  ive no doubt of it really im not being funny miss wetherford when i say youve done something heroic its no easy thing to come into a place like that and make it habitable it shows immense courage and selfreliance on your part its precisely the kind of work this whole country needs  his praise sincere and generous repaid her for all she had gone through it was a great pleasure to hear her small self praised for courage and selfreliance by one whose daily work was heroic all things conspired to make a conquest of her heart for the ranger bore himself with grace and dealt with his silver deftly his face seen from the side was older and sterner than she had thought it but it was very attractive in line  she said mr redfield and i were talking of the war todayi mean our cattlemans invasionand i learned that you were the sergeant who came for the prisoners  he smiled yes i was serving in the regular army at that time  you must have been very young  i wasa kid  that was a brave thing to do  not at all i was a soldier under orders of the commander of the post i dared not disobey  she would not have it so but you knew that you were going into danger  to be honest about it i did but i relied on my blue coat to protect me  it was a terrible time i was only a child but i can remember how wild the men all seemed when you drove up and leaped out of the wagon i didnt realize that my fathers life depended on your coming but we all knew it was brave of you  i think i was born a soldier what i like about my present job is its definiteness i have my written instructions and theres no need to argue anything i carry out my orders but i beg pardon im not going to talk shop to you i want you to tell me about yourself i hope you are not to return to the east for if you do not i shall be able to see you occasionally  here redfield appealed to the ranger ross youre all sorts of a reactionary what do you say to this senator bridges is opposed to all federal interference with state forests and state game  the foresters eyes lit up but are they state forests and state game what makes them so they are lands which the whole people purchased and which the whole people defended  heah heah cheered enderby  bridges bristled with anger and went off into a long harangue on states rights and the dangers of centralization to which enderby replied bosh the whole trouble with your bally government is its lack of cohesion if i had my way id wipe out the senate and put a strong man like roosevelt at the head of the executive youre such blooming asses over here you dont know enough to keep a really big man in your presidential chair this fussing about every four years to put in some oily corporation lawyer is bloody rot heres roosevelt gets in the midst of a lot of the finest kind of reforms y know and directly you go and turn him out then if you get a bad man youve to wait four years till you can fetch him a whack why not arrange it so you can pitch your president out the minute he goes wrong i say your old rag of a constitution is a ballandchain on your national leg england is immeasurably better off so far as that goes  ross turned to virginia leaving the political discussion to go on over his head i was back in the old island a couple of years ago and youve no idea how small it seemed to me it surely is a right little tight little island i couldnt help wondering whether the men in parliament were as important as they seemed to think they were and whether england is not really an empty shell of empire a memory of what it once was i couldnt settle down there someway i was homesick for the mountains in a month but what scared me most was the pauper population of the old placeone in every thirtyseven must be helped i came back to the states gladly i guess im an american i said to my sisters  to lee virginia all this talk of the curse of democracy and the decay of empire was unexciting but when cavanagh told of the sheepmens advance across the deadline on deer creek and of the threats of the cattleowners she was better able to follow the discussion bridges was heartily on the side of law and order for he wished to boom the state being a heavy owner in a townsite but he objected to redfields ideas of bottling up the resources of the state  were not retorted redfield were merely defending them against those who would monopolize them we believe in their fullest use but we see no reason for giving away the resources when the country needs the revenue  mrs redfield rose as soon as the coffee came on you gentlemen seem bent upon discussing matters of no interest to us she said so well leave you to fight it out alone im sure youll all agree with hugh in the end like general grant hes a very obstinate man  no sooner were they seated in the big livingroom than mrs enderby began to relate comical stories of her household her cats had fits and ran up the wall her dogs were forever getting quilled by reason of foolish attacks upon porcupines or else they came home so reminiscent of skunks that they all but smothered the cook invariably they return from encounters of this kind just as we are sitting at dinner she explained furthermore enderbys ditches are habitually getting clogged and overflowing the lawn and filling the cellar and he stands in terror of his cowboys when i think of all these irruptions and distractions englands order and routine seem heavenly but charley finds all this amusing mores the pity and leaves me to set things in order most ludicrous of all to me is his habitual claim that the ranch is paying i tell him theres an error in his bookkeeping somewhere but he assures me that his receipts exceeded his expenditures last yearwhich is quite too incredible youve no idea how high wages are and how little we raise  oh yes i have laughed mrs redfield and my cat had a fit too hugh says its the high altitude i tell him its melancholia  cavanagh showed himself i hear so much laughter im coming in were all so insufferably political out here and besides i came to see the ladies and i can only stay a few minutes longer  youre not going back tonight exclaimed his hostess  i must be on my own precinct by daylight he replied the supervisor has an eye on me  mrs redfield explained to lee virginia he rode fifty miles over the mountains  thirty corrected ross but what does that matter when im in the company of such charming ladies he added gallantly  and now hes going to ride all the way back tonight  think of that gasped mrs enderby and no moon  how can you find your way asked mrs bridges to whom this was a mortally dangersome journey  oh its quite simple if you dont bump against a tree or fall into the creek you may be quite sure youre on the trail laughed ross  mrs redfield knew the true reason for his coming and was not at all pleased for with all lees personal charm she said to her husband she is socially beneath ross cavanagh even in a state where social barriers are few  come out on the veranda suggested cavanagh and ill show you the hills i must climb  lee accepted innocently but as the young people left the room mrs enderby looked at her hostess with significant glance theres the lady ross rode down to meet who is she  her mother is that dreadful old creature that keeps the wetherford hotel in roaring fork  no exclaimed mrs enderby  yes lee virginia is lize wetherfords daughter  but the girl is charming  i cannot understand it hugh came home a week or so ago full of her praise and at this point her voice dropped lower and the other drew closer  outside the young people stood in silence there was no moon and the mountains rose darkly a sheer wall at the end of the garden their tops cutting into the starry sky with a dull edge over which a dim white cone peered  that snowpeak is wolftooth and thirty miles from here and at the head of my beat said the ranger after a pause as they leaned against the railing and looked away to the south i go up that ridge which you see faintly at the left of the main canon and through that deep notch which is above timberline  the girls eyes widened with awe of the big silent dark world he indicated arent you afraid to start out on such a trip alonei mean dont you dread it  ill be sorry to start back yes but not because of the dark ive enjoyed my visit here so much it will be hard to say goodnight  it seems strange to me that you should prefer this wild country to england  do you like the east better than the west  in some ways but then you see i was born out here  so was ii mean to say i was regenerated out here the truth is i was a good deal of a scapegrace when i left england i was always for hunting and horses and naturally i came directly to the wild west country and here ive been ever since ive had my turn at each phase of itcowpuncher soldier roughrider and finally forest ranger i reckon ive found my job at last  do you like it so much  at the present time i am perfectly contented im associated now with a country that will never yield to the ploughyes i like my work i love the forests and the streams i wish i might show them to you you dont know how beautiful they are the most beautiful parks in the world are commonplace to what i can show you my only sorrow is to think of them given over to the sawmill perhaps you and your mother will come up some time and let me show you my lakes and streams there are waters so lovely they make the heart ache hugh is planning to come up soon perhaps you and mrs redfield will come with him  id like it above everything she responded fervently then her voice changed but all depends on my mothers health  it hurt him to hear her call eliza wetherford mother he wanted to forget her origin for the moment he was not in love with herfar from it but she was so alluring and the proprietress of the wetherford house was not nice and that made one doubt the daughter  she broke the silence it seems dreadfully dark and mysterious up there she indicated his path  it isnt as bad as it looks there is a good trail and my pony knows it as well as i do i enjoy riding by night  but there are bears and other wild things are there not  not as many as i wish there were  why do you say that  i hate to see all the wild life killed off some day all these forests will have game refuges like the yellowstone national park they are coming each year to have greater and greater value to the people of the plains they are playgrounds like the alps campers are coming into my valley every day and while they increase the danger of fires i welcome them they are all advocates of the forest as one man said the mountains supplement the plains they give color and charm to the otherwise monotonous west i confess i couldnt live on the prairiesnot even on the plainsif out of sight of the mountains if i should ever settle down to a home it would be in a canon like this with a great peak at my front door  it is beautiful the girl said in the tone of sadness with which we confront the perfect night the perfect flower the flawless landscape it is both grand and peaceful  this tone of sadness pleased him it showed her depth of perception and he reflected that she had not uttered a vacuous or silly phrase since their first meeting she is capable of great development he thought aloud he said you are a strange mingling of east and west do you realize it  in what way she asked feeling something ardent in his tone  you typify to me at this moment this whole state you fill me with enthusiasm for its future here you are derived from the lawless west yet taking on the culture and restraint of the east so readily that you seem not in the least related to  he checked himself at this point and she said my mother is not as rough as she seems mr cavanagh  she must be more of the woman than appears or she could not have borne such a daughter but do you feel your relationship to her tell me honestly for you interest me  i didnt at first but i do now i begin to understand her and besides i feel in myself certain things that are in her though i think i am more like the wetherfords my fathers family home was in maryland  ross could have talked on all night so alluring was the girls dimlyseen yet warmlyfelt figure at his side but a sense of danger and a knowledge that he should be riding led him at last to say it is getting chill we must go in but before we do so let me say how much ive enjoyed seeing you again i hope the doctor will make favorable report on your mothers case youll write me the result of the examination wont you  if you wish me to  i shall be most anxious to know  they were standing very near to each other at the moment and the ranger made very sensitive to womans charm by his lonely life shook with newlycreated love of her a suspicion a hope that beneath her cultivated manner lay the passionate nature of her mother gave an added force to his desire he was sorely tempted to touch her to test her but her sweet voice a little sad and perfectly unconscious of evil calmed him she said  i hope to persuade my mother to leave the forks all the best people there are against us some of them have been very cruel to her and to me and besides i despise and fear the men who come to our table  you must not exchange words with them he all but commanded beware of gregg he is a vile lot do not trust him for an instant do not permit any of those loafers to talk with you for if you do they will go away to defame you i know them they are unspeakably vile it makes me angry to think that gregg and his like have the right to speak to you every day while i can only see you at long intervals  his heat betrayed the sense of proprietorship which he had begun to feel in spite of his resolution but the girl only perceived his solicitation his friendly interest and she answered i keep away from them all i can  you are right to distrust them he replied grimly because old sam has money he thinks he can do as he pleases you must be especially careful of him  the worst is when i go on the street but if mother does not sell the business i shall be obliged to stay in the fork no matter how i hate it  i wish my station were not so far away he mused darkly but ill ride down as often as my duties will permit and you must let me know how things go and if any of those fellows persecute you youll tell me wont you i wish youd look upon me as your big brother will you do that his voice entreated and as she remained silent he continued roaring fork is one of the worst towns in the state and a girl like you needs some one as a protector i dont know just how to put it so that you will not misunderstand me but you see i protect the forest the streams and the game i help the settler in time of trouble i am a kind of allround big brother to everybody who needs help in the forest in fact im paid for protecting things that cant protect themselves and sohere he tried to lend his voice the accent of humorwhy shouldnt i be the protector of a girl like you aloneworse than alonein this little cowtown  she remained dumb at one or two points where he clearly hoped for a word and she was unable to thank him when he had finished in this silence a curious constriction came into his throat it was almost as if he had put his passion into definite words and as the light fell upon her he perceived that her bosom was heaving with deep emotion  i am lonely she faltered out at lasthorribly lonely and i know now how people feel toward my mother and it hurts meit all hurts me but im going to stay and help her she paused to recover her voice and you do seem different iitrust you  im glad you understand me and you will let me know if i can help you wont you  yes she answered simply  goodnight he said extending his hand  she placed her palm to his quite frankly but the touch of it made further speech at the moment impossible  they went in with such telltale faces that even redfield wondered what had passed between them  excusing himself almost at once cavanagh left the room and when he looked in a few moments later he was clothed in the rangers dusty green uniform booted and spurred for his long hard ride mrs redfield followed him into the hall and out on the doorstone to say ross you must be careful this girl is very alluring in herself but her mother you know is impossible  youre needlessly alarmed as usual he smilingly replied she interests methats patent but beyond that whynonsense goodnight  nevertheless despite his protestations he went away up the trail with his mind so filled with lee virginias appealing face and form that he would certainly have ridden over a precipice had it not been for his experienced pony who had fortunately but one aim and that was to cross the range safely and to reach the home pasture at the earliest moment  now that he was looking back upon three hours more of lees society cavanagh was ready to admit that he had left his range and ridden hard and far with that one purpose in mind he had been hungry for the sight of her and now that he had touched her hand and looked upon her again he was a little surprised and deeply disturbed to find himself hungrier than before     vi  the voice from the heights   lee virginia was not entirely without experience as regards respectful courtship her life in the east had brought her to know a number of attractive lads and a few men but none of these had become more than good companions or friends and though she wrote to one or two of these youths letters of the utmost friendliness there was no passion in them and she felt as yet the sting of nothing more intense in her liking for cavanagh but he meant more to her now that she was lonely and beleaguered of those whose eyes were cruel and hot  then too he had come to represent a new world to herthis world of the forest this region toward the sunset which was quite as mysterious to her thinking as it was to the eyes of any plainsdweller her imagination went with the ranger on his solitary march into those vague upbillowing masses of rocks and trees to her there were many dangers and she wondered at his courage his hardihood  that he had ridden all that long rough way merely to see her she was not vain enough to believe but she had nevertheless something of every womans secret belief in her individual charm cavanagh had shown a flattering interest in her and his wish to be her protector filled her with joy and confidence  she heard a good deal more about this particular forest ranger next morning at breakfast he is throwing himself away mrs redfield passionately declared think of a man of rosss refinement living in a mountain shack miles from anybody watching poachers marking trees and cooking his own food its a shameful waste of genius  thats as you look at it my dear responded redfield ross is the guardian of an immense treasurechest which belongs to the nation furthermore he is quite certainas i amthat this forest service is the policy of the future and that it offers fine chances for promotionand then finally he likes it  that is all well enough for a young man but ross is at least thirtyfive and should be thinking of settling down i cant understand his point of view  my dear you have never seen the procession of the seasons from such a point of view as that which he enjoys  no and i do not care to it is quite lonely enough for me right here  redfield looked at lee with comic blankness mrs redfield is hopelessly urban as the wife of a forest supervisor she cares more for pavements and tramcars than for the most splendid mountain park  i most certainly do his wife vigorously agreed and if i had my way we should be living in london  listen to that shes ten times more english than mrs enderby  im not but i long for the civilized instead of the wild i like comfort and society  so do i returned he  yes the comfort of an easychair on the porch and the society of your forest rangers this ranch life is all very well for a summer outing but to be tied down here all the year round is to be denied ones birthright as a modern  all this more or less cheerful complaint expressed the minds of many others who live amid these superb scenes when autumn comes when the sky is gray and the peaks are hid in mist they long for the music the lights the comfort of the city but when the april sun begins to go down in a smother of crimson and flame and the mountains loom with epic dignity or when at dawn the air is like some divine flood descending from the unstained mysterious heights then the dweller in the foothills cries out how fortunate we are here is health and happiness here poverty is unknown one side of the girl was of this strain the other was of the character described by her hostess she began to see that ross cavanagh was fitted for higher duties than those of forest guard  mrs redfield was becoming more and more interested in this child who had not merely the malodorous reputation of her mother to contend with but the memory of a traitorous sire to live down and when lee virginia went to her room to pack her bag the wife turned to her husband and said what are we to think of heredity when we see a thoroughly nice girl like that rise out of the union of a desperado with a vixen  redfield answered it is unaccountable i knew her father well he was a reckless daredevil with less real courage in him than there is in old lize but i cant tell the girl that she is sufficiently humiliated by her mother she takes comfort in the thought that her father at least was brave and heroic  i dont believe in heredity as i did once his wife resumed arent scientific men rather divided about it  yes there are those who deny that there is any inheritance of the spirit of character insisting that the laws of transmission affect the body only lee is certainly like her father in looks he was a handsome rascal  ross is terribly smitten with her  redfield coughed uneasily i hope not of course he admires her as any man must shes physically attractive very attractive and besides ross is as susceptible as a cowpuncher he was deeply impressed the first time he saw her i could see that  i didnt like his going out on the veranda with her last night continued mrs redfield and when they came in her eyes and color indicated that hed been saying something exciting to her hugh ross cavanagh must not get involved with that girl its your duty as his superior to warn him  hes fully grown my dear and a bit dictatorial on his own part im a trifle timid about cutting in on his private affairs  then ill do it marriage with a girl like that is out of the question think what his sisters would say  redfield smiled a bit satirically to the outsider a forest ranger at 900 a year and find himself and horses is not what you may call a brilliant catch  oh well the outsider is no judge ross cavanagh is a gentleman and besides hes sure to be promoted i acknowledge the girls charms and i dont understand it when i think of her objectively as lize wetherfords girl i wonder at her being in my house when i see her i want her to stay with me i want to hug her  perhaps weve been unjust to lize all along suggested redfield she has remained faithful to ed wetherfords memory all these yearsthat is conceded doesnt that argue some unusual quality how many women do we know who are capable of such loyalty come now lize is a rough piece of goods ill admit and her flybit lunchcounter was a public nuisance but she had the courage to send her girl away to be educated denying herself the joy of seeing her develop by her side we mustnt permit our prejudices to run away with us  the girls return put a stop to the discussion which could end in nothing but confusion anyway  lee virginia said goodbye to mrs redfield with grateful appreciation of her kindness and especially of her invitation to come again and the tears in her eyes profoundly affected the older woman who with a friendliness which was something more than politeness invited her to come again whenever roaring fork gets on your nerves well be very glad to rescue you she said in parting  hugh redfield the girl thoroughly understood and loved he was so simplehearted and so loyal his bitter criticisms of the west were not uttered in a destructive moodquite the contrary his work was constructive in the highest degree he was profoundly impatient of americas shortcomings for the reason that he deeply felt her responsibility to the rest of the world his knowledge of other republics and limited monarchies gave his suggestions power and penetration and even bridges besotted in his provincial selfishness had advised his selection as supervisor of his own fitness for the work redfield himself took a dispassionate view i am only filling the place till the right man comes along he said to his friends the man before me was a halfhearted and shifty advocate i am an enthusiast without special training byandby the real forester will come to take my place  on the way to the office he said to lee i will talk to the doctor if you like  i wish you would she responded fervently  she remained in the machine while he went in and as she sat there a train passed on its downward eastward run and a feeling of loneliness of helplessness filled her heart she had written many brave letters to her eastern friends but the vital contests the important factors of her life she had not mentioned she had given no hint of her mothers physical and moral degeneration and she had set down no word of her longing to return but now that she was within sight of the railway the call of the east the temptation to escape all her discomforts was almost great enough to carry her away but into her mind came the thought of the ranger riding his solitary way and she turned her face to her own duties once more comforted by the words of praise he had spoken and by the blaze of admiration in his eyes  redfield came out followed by a small man carrying a neat bag he was of surpassing ugliness and yet she liked him his mouth had a curious twist he had no chin to speak of and his bright eyes protruded like those of a beetle his voice however was surprisingly fine and resonant  youd better sit behind doctor said redfield i shall be very busy on this trip  very well replied the other if miss wetherford remains beside me otherwise i shall rebel he was of those small plain men whose absurd gallantry is never taken seriously by women and yet is something more than pretence  he began by asking a few questions about her mothers way of life but as lee was not very explicit he became impersonal and talked of whatsoever came into his mindmotorcars irrigation hunting flowersanything at all and the girl had nothing to do but to utter an occasional phrase to show that she was listening it was all rather depressing to her for she could not understand how a man so garrulous could be a good physician she was quite sure her mother would not treat him with the slightest respect  after all he talked well his stream of conversation shortened the way for her and she was surprised when they topped the last ridge and the fork could be seen lying before them in the valley soon they were rolling quietly up the street to the door of the wetherford house  springing out unaided lee hurried in hoping to prepare her mother for the shock of the little physicians unimposing appearance while redfield remained behind to arm the physician for his encounter now doctor mrs wetherford is a very singular and plainspoken person shes quite likely to swear like a man but she will perform like a woman dont mind what she says go ahead in your own way will you wait till after dinner or shall i  no i shall make the examination firstwhile im hungry my mind works quicker i cant diagnose properly on a full stomach  very well line up with me and together well beard the old grizzly in her den  they found lize on duty behind the counter as usual her face was dejected her eyes dull but as she caught sight of the strange little man she cried out lord god reddy why didnt you bring me a man  hush mother cautioned lee this is the famous eastern physician  you cant be famous for your beautyyou must be brainy she remarked to herself in the strangers hearing  redfield presented doctor fessenden of omaha  she started again on contemptuous ways but was stopped by the little man get down out o that chair he commanded my time is money  lize flushed with surprise and anger but obeyed and lee virginia secretly delighted with the physicians imperative manner led the way into the lodginghouse ill look after the cash mother she said dont worry  im not worryin she replied but what does that little whelp mean by talking to me like that ill swat him one if he isnt careful  its his way please dont anger him you need his help  the doctor interfered now madam strip and lets see whats the matter with you whereupon he laid off his coat and opened his box of instruments  lee fled and redfield who had remained standing beside the counter could not repress a smile shes caught a tartar this time hes a little tiger isnt he i had prepared him for war but i didnt expect him to fly at her that way  poor mother how dreadfully ill she looks today i hope the doctor will order her to rest  but will she obey ive argued that with her she keeps saying she will but she wont  it was nearly one but the customers were coming in and the girl laying aside her hat and veil took her seat at the cashregister while redfield went out to put his machine in order for the return trip she realized that she was now at closehand grapple with life for the most part she had been able up to this time to keep in the background and to avoid the eyes of the rough men who came and went before her mothers seat but now she was not merely exposed to their bold glances she was in a position where each man could make excuse to stop and demand a word what time his change was being counted  her glowing cheeks her pretty dress made her a shining mark and the men began at once to improve their opportunity by asking wheres lize and this embarrassed her for the reason that she did not care to go into the cause of her mothers temporary absence and perceiving her confusion one of them passed to coarse compliment theres nothing the matter with you he said with a leer others though coarse were kindly in their familiarity and sifton with gentle face remained to help her bear the jests of the more uncouth and indelicate of her admirers  perceiving her nervousness neill ballard raised loud outcry over a mistake she made in returning change and this so confused and angered her that her eyes misted with tears and she blundered sadly with the next customer his delight in her discomfiture his words his grin became unendurable and in a flush of rage and despair she sprang to her feet and left them to make triumphant exit i got her rattled he roared as he went out shell remember me  the diners were all smiling and gregg took a malicious satisfaction in her defeat she had held herself haughtily apart from him and he was glad to see her humbled  leaving her place behind the counter she walked through the room with uplifted head and burning eyes her heart filled with bitterness and fire she hated the whole town the whole state at the moment were these the chivalrous shortgrass knights she had heard so much about these the largesouled western founders of empire at the moment she was in the belief that all the heroes of her childhood had been of the stamp of neill ballardselfish lustful and cruel  in the hall her pride her sense of duty came back to her and she halted her fleeing feet i will not be beaten she declared and her lips straightened i will not let these dreadful creatures make a fool of me in that way  thereupon she turned and went back pale now but resolved to prove herself the mistress of the situation fortunately redfield had returned and his serene presence helped her to recover complete control of herself she remained coldly blank to every compliment and by this means she subdued them why doesnt the doctor return for his dinner she asked after the room had cleared the desire to know her mothers real condition at last quite subordinated her own besetments to some of the older men whom she knew to be neighbors and friends she gladly explained the situation and their sympathy did something to restore her faith in humankind nevertheless this hour of unprotected intercourse with the citizens of the town was disturbing humiliating and embittering                                                    the doctor appearing suddenly in the door beckoned to her and leaving her place she crossed to where he stood your mother needs you he said curtly go to her and keep her quiet for an hour or two if you can  what is the matter doctor  i cant tell you precisely but you must get her on a diet and keep her there i will write out some lists for you after my luncheon  lee found her mother sitting in such dejection as she had never known her to display though she fired up sufficiently to say that cussed little thimblerigger has been throwing a great big scare into me he says ive got to get outdoors live on raw meat and weak tea and walk five miles a day thats what he says she added in renewed astonishment at the mans audacity whos at the cash  mr redfield replied lee ill go right back  no you wont im no dead horse yet she struggled to her feet and started for the cashregister i wont let no little omaha doughgie like that put me out o business  despite all warnings she walked out into the diningroom and took her accustomed seat with set and stern face while her daughter went to the table where the doctor sat and explained her inability to manage her mother  thats your problem he replied coolly then rapidly succinctly and clearly he went over the case and laid out a course of treatment out of it all lee deduced that her mother was very ill indeed though not in danger of sudden death  shes on the chute said fessenden and everything depends upon her own action whether she takes the plunge this winter or twenty years from now shes a strong womanor has beenbut she has presumed upon her strength she used to live outofdoors she tells me during all her early life and now shut in by these walls working sixteen hours a day she is killing herself get her out if you can and cut out stimulants  as he rose and approached the counter lize shoved a couple of gold pieces across the board that wipes you off my map she grimly declared i hope you enjoyed your ride  its up to you madam he replied pocketing the gold goodday  lee followed him out to the car eager to secure all she could of his wisdom he repeated his instructions medicine cant help her much he said but diet can do a great deal get her out of that rut shes in goodbye  ill be down again in a day or two called redfield  the machine began to purr and spit and the wheels to spin and lee virginia was left to face her mothers obstinate resistance alone she felt suddenly very desolate very weak and very poor what if mother should die she asked herself  gregg was standing before the counter talking with lize as lee returned and he said with a broad smile ive just been saying id take this hotel off your mothers hands provided you went with it  in the mouths of some men these words would have been harmless enough but coming from the tongue of one whose life could only be obscurely hinted at the jest was an insult the girl shuddered with repulsion and lize spoke out  now see here bullfrog im dead on the hoof and all that but neither you nor any other citizen like you can be funny with my girl shes not for you now thats final she aint your kind  greggs smile died into a gray set smirk and his eyes took on a steely glint he knew when the naked unadorned truth was spoken to him words came slowly to his lips but he said youll be glad to come to me for help some dayboth of you  oh get along you dont hold no mortgage on me retorted lize contemptuously and turned to lee im hungry wheres that grub chart o mine  lee brought the doctors page of notes and read it through while her mother snorted at intervals hah dry toast weak tea no coffee no alcohol huh i might as well starve eggsfishmilk why didnt he say boiled live lobsters and champagne i tell you right now im not going to go into that kind of a game if i die im going to die eating what i blame please  the struggle had begun with desperate courage lee fought standing squarely in the rut of her mothers daily habit you must not hive up here any longer she insisted you must get out and walk and ride i can take care of the houseat least till we can sell it  it was like breaking the pride of an athlete but little by little she forced upon her mother a realization of her true condition and at last lize consented to offer the business for sale then she wept for the first time in years and the sight moved her daughter much as the sobs of a strong man would have done  she longed for the presence of ross cavanagh at this moment when all her little world seemed tumbling into ruin and almost in answer to her wordless prayer came a messenger from the little telephone office some one wants to talk to you  she answered this call hurriedly thinking at first that it must be mrs redfield the booth was in the little sittingroom of a private cottage and the mistress of the place a shrewd little woman with inquisitive eyes said sounds to me like ross cavanaghs voice  lee was thankful for the booths privacy for her cheeks flamed up at this remark and when she took up the receiver her heart was beating so loud it seemed as if the person at the other end of the wire must hear it who is it please she asked with breathless intensity  a mans voice came back over the wire so clear so distinct so intimate it seemed as if he were speaking into her ear it is i ross cavanagh i want to ask how your mother is  she is terribly disheartened by what the doctor has said but she is in no immediate danger  he perceived her agitation and was instantly sympathetic can i be of usedo you need me if you do ill come down  where are you  i am at the sawmillthe nearest telephone station  how far away are you  about thirty miles  oh she expressed in this little sound her disappointment and as it trembled over the wire he spoke quickly please tell me do you want me to come down never mind the distancei can ride it in a few hours  she was tempted but bravely said no id like to see you of course but the doctor said mother was in no danger you must not come on our account  he felt the wonder of the moments intercourse over the wilderness steeps and said so you cant imagine how strangely sweet and civilized your voice sounds to me here in this savage place it makes me hope that some day you and mrs redfield will come up and visit me in person  i should like to come  perhaps it would do your mother good to camp for a while cant you persuade her to do so  im trying to do thati mean to stop work but she says what can we do to earn a living  if nothing happens i hope to spend an hour or two at the forks next sunday i hope to find your mother better  their words were of this unemotional sort but in their voices something subtler than the electrical current vibrated he called to her in wordless fashion and she answered in the same mysterious code and when she said goodbye and hung up the receiver her world went suddenly gray and commonplace as if a ray of special sunlight had been withdrawn  the attendant asked with village bluntness it was ross wasnt it  lee virginia resented this almost as much as if it were the question of an eavesdropper but she answered yes he wanted to know how my mother was  she turned as she reached the street and looked up toward the glorious purpling deeps from which the rangers voice had come and the thought that he was the sole guardian of those dark forests and shining streamsthat his way led among those towering peaks and lone canonsmade of him something altogether admirable  that night her loneliness her sense of weakness carried her to bed with tears of despair in her eyes lize had insisted on going back to her work looking like one stricken with death yet so rebellious that her daughter could do nothing with her and in the nature of fate the days business had been greater than ever so that they had all been forced to work like slaves to feed the flood of custom and lize herself still kept her vigil in her chair above her gold  closing her mind to the town and all it meant to her the girl tried to follow in imagination the ranger treading his far high trails she recalled his voice so cultivated so rich of inflection with dangerous tenderness it had come down to her from those lofty parapets like that of a friend laden with something sweeter than sympathy more alluring than song  the thought of some time going up to the high country where he dwelt came to her most insistently and she permitted herself to dream of long days of companionship with him of riding through sunlit aisles of forest with him of cooking for him at the cabinwhat time her mother grew strong once moreand these dreams bred in her heart a wistful ache a hungry need which made her pillow a place of mingled ecstasy and pain     vii  the poachers   one morning as he topped the rise between the sawmill and his own station cavanagh heard two rifleshots in quick succession snapping across the high peak on his left bringing his horse to a stand he unslung his fieldglasses and slowly and minutely swept the tawny slopes of sheep mountain from which the forbidden sounds seemed to come  a herder shooting coyotes was his first thought then remembering that there were no camps in that direction and that a flock of mountainsheep which he had been guarding carefully habitually fed round that grassy peak his mind changed i wonder if those fellows are after those sheep he mused as he angled down the slope i reckon its up to me to see  he was tired and hungry a huge moraine lay between and the trail was long and rough to catch them in the act is impossible however he reflected they have but two trails along which to descend one of these passes my door and the other a very difficult trail leads down the south fork ill have time to get breakfast and change horses theyll probably wait till night before attempting to go out anyway  in less than three hours he was over on the trail in the canon quite certain that the hunters were still above him he rode quietly up the valley pausing often to listen and to scrutinize the landscape but no sign of campfire and no further rifleshots came and at last he went into camp upon the trail resolved to wait till the poachers appeared a ward which his experience as a soldier helped him to maintain without nodding  in these long hours his thought played about the remembrance of his last visit to the fork and his hour with lee he wondered what she was doing at the moment how charming she had looked there at redfieldsso girlish in form so serious and womanly of face  he felt as never before the ineludible loneliness of the rangers life here he sat in the midst of a mighty forest with many hostile minds all about him and it must be confessed he began to wonder whether his services to the nation were worth so much hardship such complete isolation the stream sang of the eternities and his own short span of life half gone already without any permanent accomplishment seemed pitifully ephemeral the guardians of these high places must forever be solitary no ranger could rightfully be husband and father for to bring women and children into these solitudes would be cruel  he put all this asidefor the timeby remembering that he was a soldier under orders and that marriage was a long way off and so smoked his pipe and waited for the dawn persistent as a sioux and as silent as a fox  at daylight there being still no sign of his quarry he saddled his horse and was about to ride up the trail when he caught the sound of voices and the sharp click of iron hoofs on the rocks above him with his horses bridle on his arm he awaited the approaching horseman resolute and ready to act  as the marauders rounded the elbow in the trail he was surprised to recognize in the leader young gregg the other man was a stranger an older man with a grizzled beard and tall and stooping figure  hello joe called the ranger youre astir early  the youths fat face remained imperturbable but his eyes betrayed uneasiness yes its a long pull into town  been hunting queried the ranger still with cheery polite interest  oh no just visiting one of my sheepcamps  cavanaghs voice was a little less suave not on this creek he declared i moved your herder last week he walked forward thats a heavy load for a short trip to a sheepcamp he put his hand on the pack i guess youll have to open this for i heard two shots yesterday morning up where that flock of mountainsheep is running and furthermore i can see bloodstains on this saddleblanket  neither of the men made answer but the old man turned an inquiring look at his young leader  the ranger flung his next sentence out like the lash of a whip open this sack or i cut the ropes  gregg threw out a hand in command open it up edwards he said sullenly  with mechanical readiness the guide alighted from his horse loosened the cinch on the packhorse and disclosed the usual campbed  put off that bedding insisted the ranger  off came the outfit and under the tent lay the noble head of a wild rama look of reproach still in his splendid yellow eyes  cavanaghs face hardened i thought so now heave it back and cinch up its you to the nearest magistrate which happens to be higley of roaring fork ill make an example of you fellows  there was nothing for gregg to say and nothing for edwards to do but obey for a resolute ranger with an excellent weapon of the latest and most approved angular pattern stood ready to enforce his command and when the pack was recinched cavanagh waved an imperative hand i guess ill have to take charge of your guns he said and they yielded without a word of protest now march take the lefthand trail ill be close behind  a couple of hours of silent travel brought them to the rangers cabin and there he ordered a dismount  as the coffee was boiling he lectured them briefly you fellows are not entirely to blame he remarked philosophically youve been educated to think a game warden a joke and uncle sam a long way off but things have changed a bit the law of the state has made me game warden and im going to show you how it works its my duty to see that you go down the roadand down you go  edwards the guide was plainly very uneasy and made several attempts to reach cavanaghs private ear and at last succeeded ive been fooled into this he urged i was hard up and a stranger in the country and this young fellow hired me to guide him across the range i didnt shoot a thing i swear i didnt if youll let me off ill hit the trail to the west and never look back for gods sake dont take me down the road let me off  i cant do that replied cavanagh but his tone was kindlier for he perceived that the old fellow was thin hollowchested and poorly clad you knew you were breaking the laws didnt you  this the culprit admitted but i was working for sam gregg and when joe asked me to go show him the trail i didnt expect to get cinched for killing game i didnt fire a shotnow thats the gods truth  nevertheless retorted ross you were packing the head and i must count you in the game  edwards fell silent then but something in his look deepened the rangers pity his eyes were large and dark and his face so emaciated that he seemed fit only for a sanitarium  the trip to the fork timed to the gait of a lazy packhorse was a tedious eight hours march and it was nearly seven oclock when they arrived at the outskirts of the village there had been very few words spoken by cavanagh and those which the prisoners uttered were not calculated to cheer the way joe blamed his guide for their mishap you should have known how far the sound of our guns would carry he said  as they were nearing the village he called out see here cavanagh theres no use taking me through town under arrest ill cough up all we got right now how much is the damage  i cant receive your fine replied ross and besides you took your chances when you shot that sheep you lost out and im not going to let you off this poaching must stop you go right along with your guide  again edwards drew near and pled in a low voice see here mr ranger i have special reasons why i dont want to go into this town under arrest i wish youd let me explain  there was deep emotion in his voice but ross was firm im sorry for you he said but my duty requires me to take you before a magistrate  but you dont know my case he replied with bitter intensity im out on parole i cant afford to be arrested in this way dont you see  ross looked at him closely are you telling me the truth  would you have mercy on me if i were  i should be sorry for you but i couldnt let you go  you wont believe me but its the god almightys truth i didnt know joe intended to kill that sheep he asked me to show him over the pass i had no intention of killing anything i wish to god you would let me go his voice was tense with pleading  how about this gregg called ross your guide insists he had no hand in killing the ram  he fired first and i fired and finished him retorted gregg  twas the other way declared edwards the beast was crippled and escapingi killed him with my revolver i didnt want to see him go off and die  i guess that settles it said cavanagh decisively you take your medicine with joe if the justice wants to let you off easy i cant help it but to turn you loose now would mean disloyalty to the service climb back into your saddle  edwards turned away with shaking hands and unsteady step all right he said ill meet it he came back to say theres no need of your saying anything about what ive told you  no you are a stranger to me i know nothing of your life except that i found you with joe with this pack on your horse  much obliged said he with a touch of bitter humor  to the casual observer in a town of this character there was nothing specially noticeable in three horsemen driving a packhorse but to those whose eyes were keen the true relationship of the ranger to his captives was instantly apparent and when they alighted at judge higleys office a bunch of eager observers quickly collected  hello joe what luck called ballard  our luck was a little too goodwe caught a game warden replied the young scapegrace  the ranger was chagrined to find the office of the justice closed for the day and turning to his captives said im hungry and ive no doubt you are im going to take you into mike halseys saloon for supper but remember you are my prisoners and to the little old remittance man sifton who caught his eye he explained his need of a justice and the town marshal  ill try to find the judge replied sifton with ready goodwill and at a sign from the ranger gregg and his herder entered the saloon  in fifteen minutes the town was rumbling with the news under ballards devilry all the latent hatred of the ranger and all the concealed opposition to the forest service came to the surface like the scum on a pot of broth the saloons and eatinghouses boiled with indignant protest what business is it of ross cavanaghs they demanded what call has he to interfere hes not a game warden  yes he is all these rangers are game wardens corrected another  no theyre not they have to be commissioned by the governor  well hes been commissioned hes warden all right  i dont believe it anyhow hes too fresh he needs to have a halt lets do him lets bluff him out  lee virginia was in the kitchen superintending the service when one of the waiters came in breathless with excitement ross cavanagh has shot joe gregg for killing sheep  lee faced her with blanched face who told you so  theyre all talking about it out there gee but theyre hot some of em want to lynch him  lee hurried out into the diningroom which was crowded with men and voicing deep excitement anger was in the aira stormy rage perceptible as a hot blast and as she passed one table after another she heard ugly phrases applied to cavanagh  a halfdozen men were standing before the counter talking with lize but lee pushed in to inquire with white inquiring face what is it all about what has happened  nothing much lize replied contemptuously but youd think a horse had been stole ross has nipped joe gregg and one of his herders for killing mountainsheep  do you mean he shot them  yes he took their heads  lee stood aghast what do you mean whose heads  lize laughed the sheeps heads oh dont be scared no one is hurt yet  the girl flushed with confusion as the men roared over her blunder one of the girls told me mr cavanagh had killed a man she explained where is he  lize betrayed annoyance they say hes taking supper at mike halseys though why he didnt come here i dont see whats he going to do she asked wont the marshal take the men off his hands  not without warrant from higley and higley is out of town rossll have to hold em till higley gets back or else take em over to chauvenet lize snorted old higley yes hes been known to disappear before when there was some real work to be done  the girl looked about her with a sharpening realization of the fact that all these men were squarely opposed to the ranger and rather glad to know that his guardianship of the poachers was to be rendered troublesome she could hear on all sides bitter curses openly directed against him how little of real manliness could be detected in these grinning or malignant faces illformed halfdeveloped bestial most of them while others though weakly goodhumored were ready to go with whatever current of strong passion blew upon them over against such creatures ross cavanagh stood off in heroic contrasta man with work to do and doing it like a patriot  she went back to her own task with a vague sense of alarm certainly they will not dare to interfere with an officer in the discharge of his duties she thought she was eager to see him and the thought that he might be obliged to ride away to chauvenet without a word to her gave her a deeper feeling of annoyance and unrest that he was in any real danger she could not believe  it was disheartening to cavanagh to see how some of the most influential citizens contrived to give encouragement to the riotous element of the town a wink a gesture a careless word to the proper messenger conveyed to the saloon rounders an assurance of sympathy which inflamed their resentment to the murderous point  the truth is this little village sixty miles from the railway still retained in its dives and shanties the lingering miasma of the oldtime freerange barbarism it trailed a dark history on its legal side as well as on its openly violent side for it had been one of the centres of the rustlers war and one of the chief points of attack on the part of the cattlebarons it was still a rendezvous for desperate and shameless charactersa place of derelicts survivals of the days of deep drinking furious riding and ready gunplay  true its famous desperadoes were now either dead or distantly occupied but the mantle of violence the tradition of lawlessness had fallen to the seedy old cowpunchers and to the raw and vulgar youths from the illconditioned homes of the middle west the air of the reckless oldtime range still clung rancidly in the low groggeries as a deadly gas hangs about the lower levels of a mine it was confessedly one of the worst communities in the state  lets run the sonovagun was the suggestion of several of greggs friends  the fact that the ranger was a commissioned officer of the law and that the rams head had been found on the poachers pack made very little difference to these irresponsible instigators to assault it was wonderful how highly that loafing young rascal joe gregg was prized at the moment its an outrage that the son of a leading citizen should be held up in this way by one of the forestry cossacks declared one of the merchants  the discussion which took place over the bars of the town was at the riotheat by nine oclock and soon after ten a crowd of howling whooping bad boys and disreputable ranchhands was parading the walks breathing out vile threats against the ranger  accustomed to men of this type cavanagh watched them come and go at halseys bar with calculating eyes there will be no trouble for an hour or two but meanwhile what is to be done higley is not to be found and the town marshal is also out of town to halsey he said i am acting as you know under both federal and state authority and i call upon you as a lawabiding citizen to aid me in holding these men prisoners i shall camp right here till morning or until the magistrate or the marshal relieves me of my culprits  halsey was himself a sportsmana genuine lover of hunting and a fairly consistent upholder of the game laws but perceiving that the whole town had apparently lined up in opposition to the ranger he lost courage his consent was halfhearted and he edged away toward the front window of his barroom nervously seeking to be neutralto carry water on both shoulders as the phrase goes  the talk grew less jocular as the drinks took effect and neill ballard separating himself from the crowd came forward calling loudly come out o there joe youse a hell of a sport come out and have a drink  his words conveyed less of battle than his tone he was in fact urging a revolt and cavanagh knew it  gregg rose as if to comply the ranger stopped him keep your seat said he and to ballard he warningly remarked and you keep away from my prisoners  do you own this saloon retorted the fellow truculently i reckon halseys customers have some rights what are you doing here anyway this is no jail  halsey has given me the privilege of holding my prisoners here till the justice is found it isnt my fault that the town is without judge or jail he was weakened by the knowledge that halsey had only halfconsented to aid justice but his pride was roused and he was determined upon carrying his arrest to its legitimate end im going to see that these men are punished if i have to carry them to sulphur city he added  smash the lights shouted some one at the back  here was the first real note of war and ross cried out sharply if a man lifts a hand toward the light ill cut it off  there was a stealthy movement in the crowd and leaping upon the counter a reckless cub reached for the lamp  cavanaghs revolver shattered the globe in the fellows very palm get down from there he commanded  the crowd surged back against the front door several drawn weapons shining in their hands some of the faces were agrin others were thrust forward like the heads of snakes their eyes glittering with hate  it is an appalling moment to a man of discernment when he looks into the faces of his fellows and hears only the laugh of the wolf the hiss of the snake the snarl of the tiger at the moment cavanagh despised with a measureless contempt the entire commonwealth and its longestablished school of violence but fixing his thought on his faraway chief he lost all fear his voice was perfectly calm as he said i am wearing the uniform of the federal service and the man that interferes with me will feel the vengeance of the federal arm you can get me but ill get some of you at the same time and the department will get the rest  the mob had not found its leader it hesitated and blustered but did not strike and eventually edged out of the door and disappeared but the silence which followed its retreat was more alarming to the ranger than its presence some slyer mischief was in these minds he feared that they were about to cut the electriclight wires and so plunge him into darkness and to prepare for that emergency he called upon the bartender halsey having vanished for a lamp or a lantern  the fellow sullenly set about this task and ross turning to gregg said if youve any influence with this mob youd better use it to keep them out of mischief for im on this job to the bitter end and somebodys going to be hurt  gregg who seemed quite detached from the action and rather delighted with it replied i have no influence they dont care a hang about me they have it in for you thats all  edwards remained silent with his hat drawn low over his eyes it was evident that he was anxious to avoid being seen and quite willing to keep out of the conflict but with no handcuffs and the back door of the saloon unguarded ross was aware that his guard must be incessant and alertly vigilant where are the lawabiding citizens of the town he asked of sifton who remained in the saloon  the dry little whisp of manhood had some spark of life in him for he said in their beds the cowardly hounds  they must know that this gang of hobos is threatening me  certainly they do but they dont intend to endanger their precious hides they would be well pleased to have you disabled  it was incredible low as his estimate of the fork had been cavanagh could not believe that it would sit quietly by and see an officer of the state defeated in his duty such a thing could not happen under the english flag he said and at the moment his adopted country seemed a miserable makeshift only the thought of redfield and the chief nerved him for the long vigil the chief will understand if it comes up to him he said  lize wetherford came hurrying in looking as though she had just risen from her bed she was clothed in a long red robe her grizzled hair was loose her feet were bare and she carried a huge oldfashioned revolver in her hand her mouth was stern  stopping abruptly as she caught sight of ross standing in the middle of the floor unhurt she exclaimed there you are are you all right  as a trivet he replied  she let her gunhand relax what was the shooting  a little bluff on my part  anybody hurt  no  she was much relieved i was afraid theyd got you i came as quick as i could i was abed that fool doctor threw a chill into me and ive been going to roost early according to orders i didnt hear your gun but lee did and she came to tell me theyre hellroaring down the street yet dont let em get behind you if i was any good id stay and help wheres mike she addressed the tender at the bar  i dont know gone home i guess  sneaked has he  so far as i know the only lawupholding citizen in the place barring yourself is sifton said ross indicating the englishman who stood as if cold pressing his hands together to hide their trembling  lize perceived the irony of this two britishers and two women well by god this is a fine old town what you going to dohold your men here all night  i dont see any other way halsey turned the place over to mebut he looked about him suspiciously  bring em into my place lee has had new locks put on our doors theyll help some  i dont like to do that mrs wetherford he replied with greater respect than he had ever shown her before they may attack me there  all the better ill be on hand to helpbut theyre less likely to boil in on you through a locked door  but your daughter it will alarm her  shell be in the other house and besides shed feel easier if you are in my place shes all wrought up by the attack on you  ross turned to his prisoners follow mrs wetherford andeyes front  you neednt worry about me said joe i wont run  i dont intend to give you a chance replied ross  edwards seemed to have lost in both courage and physical stature he slouched along with shuffling step his head bent and his face pale ross was now profoundly sorry for him so utterly craven and broken was his look     viii  the second attack   lee was waiting on the porch of the hotel tense with excitement straining her ears and eyes to see what was taking place  the night had started with a small sickle of moon but this had dropped below the range leaving the street dark save where the lights from the windows of the allnight eatinghouses and saloons lay out upon the walk and while she stood peering out the sound of rancorous howling and shrill whooping came to her ears with such suggestion of ferocity that she shivered  every good and honorable trait seemed lost out of her neighbors she saw the whole country but as a refuge for criminals ungovernable youths and unsexed womena wilderness of those who had no regard for any code of morals which interfered with their own desires her memories of the past freshened as she listened in such wise she had shuddered as a child while troops of celebrating cowboys rode up and down the streets in such wise too the better and more timid element of the town had put out their lights and retired leaving their drunken helots and the marshal to fight it out in vague tumult  a few of the hotel guests had gone to bed but the women were up excited and nervous starting at every fresh outburst of whooping knowing that their sons or husbands were out in the street to see the fun and that they might meet trouble  at last lee discerned her mother returning from halseys followed by three men withdrawing from the little porch whereon she had been standing she reentered the house to meet her mother in the hall where is mr cavanagh she asked  out in the diningroom you see mike halsey is no kind o use he vamoosed and left ross down there alone with his two prisoners and the lights likely to be turned out on him so i offered the caffy as a calaboose they are sure in for a long and tedious night  lee was alarmed at her mothers appearance you must go to bed you look ghastly  i reckon id better lie down for a little while but i cant sleep ross may need me there isnt a man to help him but me and that loafer ballard is full of gall hes got it in for ross and will make trouble if he can  what can we do  shoot replied lize with dry brevity i wouldnt mind a chance to plug some of the sweet citizens of this town i owe them one or two  with this sentence in her ears lee virginia went to her bed but not to slumber her utter inability either to control her mothers action or to influence that of the mob added to her uneasiness  the singing shouting trampling of the crowd went on and once a group of men halted just outside her window and she heard neill ballard noisily drunkenly arguing as to the most effective method of taking the prisoners his utterances so profane and foul came to her like echoes from out an inferno the voices were all at the moment like the hissing of serpents the snarling of tigers how dared creatures of this vile type use words of contempt against ross cavanagh  come on boys urged ballard his voice filled with reckless determination lets run him  as they passed the girl sprang up and went to her mothers room to warn her of the threatened attack  lize was already awake and calmly loading a second revolver by the light of the electric bulb  what are you doing the girl asked her blood chilling at sight of the weapon  hells to pay out there and im going to help pay it a jarring blow was heard hear that theyre breaking in she started to leave the room  lee stopped her where are you going  to help ross here she thrust the handle of a smaller weapon into lees hand ed wetherfords girl ought to be able to take care of herself come on  with a most unheroic horror benumbing her limbs lee followed her mother through the hall the sound of shouts and the trampling of feet could be heard and she came out into the restaurant just in time to photograph upon her brain a scene whose significance was at once apparent on a chair between his two prisoners and confronting ballard at the head of a crowd of frenzied villains stood the ranger a gleaming weapon in his hand a look of resolution on his face  what he had said or what he intended to do she did not learn for her mother rushed at the invaders with the mad bravery of a shebear get out of here she snarled thrusting her revolver into the very mouth of the leader  they all fell back in astonishment and fear  ross leaped to her side leave them to me he said ill clear the room  not on your life this is my house i have the right to smash the fools and she beat them over the heads with her pistolbarrel  recognizing that she was minded to kill they retreated over the threshold and ross drawing the door close behind them turned to find lee virginia confronting edwards who had attempted to escape into the kitchen the girls face was white but the eye of her revolver stared straight and true into her prisoners face  with a bound ross seized him and flung him against the wall get back there he shouted you must take your medicine with your boss  the old fellow hurriedly replaced his ragged hat and folding his arms sank back into his chair with bowed head while lize turned upon joe gregg what the devil did you go into this kind of deal for you knew what the game laws was didnt you your old dad is all for state regulation and here you are breaking a state law why dont you stand up for the code like a sport  joe who had been boasting of the smiles he had drawn from lee did not relish this tonguelashing from her mother but assuming a careless air he said im all out of smokes get me a box thats a good old soul  lize regarded him with the expression of one nonplussed you impudent little cub she exclaimed what you need is a booting  the ranger addressed himself to lee i want to thank you for a very opportune intervention i didnt know you could handle a gun so neatly  she flushed with pleasure oh yes i can shoot my father taught me when i was only six years old  as she spoke ross caught the man edwards studying them with furtive glance but upon being observed he resumed his crouching attitude which concealed his face beneath the rim of his weatherworn hat it was evident that he was afraid of being recognized he had the slinking air of the convict and his form so despairing in its lax lines appealed to lee with even greater poignancy than his face im sorry she said to him but it was my duty to help mr cavanagh  he glanced up with a quick sidewise slant thats all right miss i should have had sense enough to keep out of this business he spoke with difficulty and his voice was hoarse with emotion  lize turned to lee the doc said no liquor but i guess heres where i draw onei feel faint  ross hurried to her side while young gregg tendered a handsome flask heres something  lize put it away not from you just reach under my desk ross youll find some brandy there thats it she called as he produced a bottle clutching it eagerly she added they say its poison but its my meat tonight  she was in truth very pale and her hands were trembling in a weakness that went to her daughters heart lee admired her bravery her manlike readiness of action but her words her manner now that the stress of the battle was over hurt and shamed her little remained of the woman in lize and the old sheepherder eyed her with furtive curiosity  i was afraid youd shoot lize explained to ross and i didnt want you to muss up your hands on the dirty loafers i had the right to kill they were trespassers and id a done it too  i dont think they intended to actually assault me he said but its a bit discouraging to find the town so indifferent over both the breaking of the laws and the doings of a drunken mob im afraid the most of them are a long way from lawabiding people yet  joe who did not like the position in which he stood as respecting lee here made an offer of aid i dont suppose my word is any good now but if youll let me do it ill go out and round up judge higley i think i know where he is  to this lize objected you cant do that ross you better hold the fort right here till morning  lee was rather sorry too for young gregg who bore his buffeting with the imperturbable face of the heroes of his class he had gone into this enterprise with much the same spirit in which he had stolen gates and misplaced signs during his brief college career and he was now disposed in the presence of a pretty girl to carry it out with undiminished impudence it only means a fine anyway he assured himself  cavanagh did not trust gregg either and as this was the first time he had been called upon to arrest men for killing game out of season he could not afford to fail of any precaution tired and sleepy as he was he must remain on guard but you and your daughter must go to bed at once he urged  lize under the spur of her dram talked on with bitter boldness im going to get out o this town as soon as i can sell i wont live in it a minute longer than i have to it used to have men into it now theyre only hobos its neither the old time nor the new its just a betwixt and between with a lot o young cubs like joe gregg pretendin to be tough i never thought id be sighin for horsecars but these rowdy chumps like neill ballard give me a pain not one of em has sand enough to pull a gun in the open but theyd plug you from a dark alley or fire out of a crowd it was different in the old days ive seen men walk out into that street face each other and open fire quiet as molasses but now its all talk and blow the men have all grown old or got out  to this gregg listened with expressionless visage his eyes dreamily fixed on lees face but his companion the old herder seemed to palpitate with shame and fear and ross had the feeling at the moment that in this ragged unkempt old hobo was the skeleton of one of the oldtime heroes he was wasted with drink and worn by wind and rain but he was very far from being commonplace here they come again called lize as the hurry of feet along the walk threatened another attack ross cavanagh again drew his revolver and stood at guard and lize recovering her own weapon took a place by his side  with the strength of a bear the new assailant shook the bolted door let me in he roared  go to hell replied lize calmly  its dad called young gregg go away you chump  let me in or ill smash this door retorted gregg  you smash that door old bullfrog announced lize and ill carry one of your lungs away i know your howlit dont scare me ive stood off one whole mob tonight and i reckon im good for you if you want to get in here you hunt up the judge of this town and the constable  after a pause sam called are you there son  you bet he is responded lize and here hell stay  joe added and youd better take the ladys advice pop she has the drop on you  the old rancher muttered a fierce curse while ross explained the situation im as eager to get rid of these culprits as any one can be but they must be taken by proper authority bring a writ from the magistrate and you may have them and welcome  gregg went away without further word and lize said hell find higley if hes in town and he is in town for i saw him this afternoon hes hiding out to save himself trouble  lee virginia with an understanding of what the ranger had endured asked cant i get you something to eat would you like some coffee  i would indeed he answered and his tone pleased her  she hurried away to get it while cavanagh disposed his prisoners behind a couple of tables in the corner i guess youre in for a night of it he remarked grimly so make yourselves as comfortable as you can perhaps your experience may be a discouragement to others of your kind  lee returned soon with a pot of fresh coffee and some sandwiches the sight of which roused young gregg to impudent remark well notice that and were left out but edwards shrank into the shadow as if the light hurt him  ross thanked lee formally but there was more than gratitude in his glance and she turned away to hide her face from other eyes strange place it was for the blooming of loves roses but they were in her cheeks as she faced her mother and lize with fresh acknowledgment of her beauty broke out again well this settles it im going to get out of this town dearie im done this ends the cattle country for me i dont know how ive put up with these yapps all these years ive been robbed and insulted and spit upon just long enough i wont have you dragged into this mess i ought to have turned you back the day you landed here  the old man in the corner was listening straining his attention in order to catch every word she uttered and ross again caught a gleam in his eyes which puzzled him before he had time to turn his wonder over in his mind they all caught the sound of feet along the walk but this time the sound was sedate and regular like the movement of police  both prisoners rose to their feet as cavanagh again stood alert the feet halted a sharp rap sounded on the door  whos there demanded lize  the law replied a wheezy voice open in the name of the law  its old higley announced lize open the door ross  come in law she called ironically as the justice appeared you look kind of miceeaten but youre all the law this blame town can sport come in and do your duty  higley a tall man with a rusty brown beard very much on his dignity entered the room followed by a short bulletheaded citizen in a rumpled blue suit with a big star on his breast behind on the sidewalk ballard and a dozen of his gang could be seen sam gregg the moving cause of this resurrection of law and order followed the constable bursting out big curses upon his son you fool he began i warned you not to monkey with them sheep you  higley had the grace to stop that let up on the cusswords sam there are ladies present said he nodding toward lee then he opened upon cavanagh well sir whats all this row whats your charge against these men  killing mountain sheep i caught them with the head of a big ram upon their pack  make him show his commission shouted gregg hes never been commissioned hes no game warden  higley hemmed iahoh his authority is all right sam ive seen it if he can prove that these men killed the sheep well have to act  cavanagh briefly related how he had captured the men on the trail the head of the ram is at the livery barn with my horse  how about that asked higley turning to joe  i guess thats right replied the insolent youth we killed the sheep all right  higley was in a corner he didnt like to offend gregg and yet the case was plain he met the issue blandly marshal take these men into custody then to ross well relieve you of their care mr cavanagh you may appear tomorrow at nine  it was a farcical ending to a very arduous thirtysixhour campaign and ross feeling like a man who having rolled a huge stone to the top of a hill has been ordered to drop it said i insist on the maximum penalty of the law justice higley especially for this man he indicated joe gregg  no more sneaking higley added lize uttering her distrust in blunt phrase you put these men through or ill make you trouble  higley turned and with unsteady solemnity saluted fear not my government madam said he and so made exit  after the door had closed behind them cavanagh bitterly complained ive delivered my prisoners over into the hands of their friends i feel like a fool what assurance have i that they will ever be punished  you have higleys word retorted lize with ironic inflection hell fine em as much as ten dollars apiece and confiscate the head which is worth fifty  no matter what happens now youve done your duty added lee virginia with intent to comfort him  lize now that the stress of the battle was over fell atremble i reckon ill have to go to bed she admitted im all in this night service is wearing  ross was alarmed at the sudden droop of her head lean on me he said its my turn to be useful  she apologized i cant stand what i could once she confessed as he aided her into the hotel part of the building its my nerveseems like its all gone i go to pieces like a sick girl  she did indeed resemble the wreck of a woman as she lay out upon her bed her hands twitching her eyes closed and ross was profoundly alarmed you need the doctor he urged let me bring him  no she said huskily but with decision im only tiredill be all right soon send the people away tell em to go to bed  for half an hour cavanagh remained in the room waiting to see if the doctors services would be required but at the end of that time as she had apparently fallen asleep he rose and tiptoed out into the hall  lee followed and they faced each other in such intimacy as the shipwrecked feel after the rescue the house was still astir with the feet of those to whom the noises of the night had been a terror or a lure and their presence so far from being a comfort a protection filled the girls heart with fear and disgust the ranger explained the outcome of the turmoil and sent the excited folk to their beds with the assurance that all was quiet and that their landlady was asleep  when they were quite alone lee said you must not go out into the streets tonight  theres no danger these hoodlums would not dare to attack me  nevertheless you shall not go she declared wait a moment she commanded and reentered her mothers room  as he stood there at lize wetherfords door and his mind went back over her brave deed which had gone far to atone for her vulgarity his respect for her deepened her resolute insistence upon law showed a complete change of front there is more good in her than i thought he admitted and it gave him pleasure for it made lee virginias character just that much more dependable he thrilled with a new and wistful tenderness as the girl opened the door and stepped out close beside him  her breathing is quieter she whispered i think shes going to sleep its been a terrible night you must be horribly tired i will find you some place to sleep  it has been a strenuous campaign he admitted ive been practically without sleep for three nights but thats all in my job i wont mind if higley will soak those fellows properly  she looked troubled i dont know what to do about a bed for you everything is takenexcept the couch in the front room  dont trouble i beg of you i can pitch down anywhere im used to hard beds i must be up early tomorrow anyway  please dont go till after breakfast she smiled wanly i may need you  he understood what did the doctor say  he said mother was in a very low state of vitality and that she must be very careful which was easy enough to say but how can i get her to rest and to diet you have seen how little she cares for the doctors orders he told her not to touch alcohol  she is more like a man than a woman he answered  she led the way into the small sittingroom which lay at the front of the house and directly opposite the door of her own room it was filled with shabby parlor furniture and in one corner stood a worn couch im sorry but i can offer nothing better she said every bed is taken but i have plenty of blankets  there was something delightfully suggestive in being thus waited upon by a young and handsome woman and the ranger submitted to it with the awkward grace of one unaccustomed to feminine care the knowledge that the girl was beneath him in birth and that she was considered to be in a sense the lovely flower of a corrupt stock made the manifest innocency of her voice and eyes the more appealing he watched her moving about the room with eyes in which a furtive flame glowed  this seems a long way from that dinner at redfields doesnt it he remarked as she turned from spreading the blankets on the couch  it is another world she responded and her face took on a musing gravity  then they faced each other in silence each filled with the same delicious sense of weakness of danger reluctant to say goodnight longing for the closer touch which dawning love demanded and yetsomething in the girl defended her defeated him  you must call me if i can be of any help he repeated and his voice was tremulous with feeling  i will do so she answered  still they did not part his voice was very tender as he said i dont like to see you exposed to such experiences  i was not afraidonly for you a little she answered  the redfields like you eleanor told me she would gladly help you why do you stay here  i cannot leave my mother  im not so sure of your duty in that regard she got on without you for ten years you have a right to consider yourself you dont belong here  neither do you she retorted  oh yes i doat least the case is different with me my work is here it hurts me to think of going back to the hills leaving you here in the midst of these wolves  he was talking now in the low throbbing utterance of a man carried out of himself it angers me to think that the worst of these loafers these drunken beasts can glare at youcan speak to you they have no right to breathe the same air with one like you  she did not smile at this his voice his eyes were filled with the gravity of the lover whose passion is not humorous against his training his judgment he was being drawn into closer and closer union with this daughter of violence and he added you may not see me in the morning  you must not go without seeing my mother you must have your breakfast with us it hurt us to think you didnt come to us for supper  her words meant little but the look in her eyes the music in her voice made him shiver he stammered ii must return to my duties tomorrow i should go back tonight  you mustnt do that you cant do that you are to appear before the judge  he smiled that is true id forgotten that  radiant with relief she extended her hand goodnight then you must sleep  he took her hand and drew her toward him then perceiving both wonder and fear in her eyes he conquered himself goodnight he repeated dropping her hand but his voice was husky with its passion  tired as he was the ranger could not compose himself to sleep the memory of the girls sweet face the look of halfsurrender in her eyes the knowledge that she loved him and that she was lying but a few yards from him made slumber impossible at the moment she seemed altogether admirable entirely worthy to be won     ix  the old sheepherder   the ranger was awakened in the first faint dawn by the passing of the girls light feet as she went across the hall to her mothers room and a moment later he heard the low murmur of her voice throwing off his blankets and making such scant toilet as he needed he stepped into the hall and waited for her to return  soon she came toward him a smile of confidence and pleasure on her lips  how is she he asked  quite comfortable  and you his voice was very tender  i am a little tired she acknowledged i didnt sleep very well  you didnt sleep at all he declared regretfully  oh yes i did she replied brightly  she appeared a little pale but by no means worn indeed her face had taken on new charm with its confession of feminine weakness its expression of trust in him  these two ardent souls confronted each other in absorbed silence with keener perception with new daring with new intimacy till he recalled himself with effort you must let me help you if theres anything i can do remember im your big brother  i remember she answered smilingly and im going out to see what my big brother is to have for breakfast  cavanagh found the street empty silent and utterly commonplace and as he walked past halseys saloon the tumult of the night seemed born of a vision in disordered sleepand yet it had happened from these reeking little dens a score of foul tatterdemalions had issued charged with malicious fury each of these shacks seemed the lurkingplace of a species of malevolent insect whose sting was out for every comer  the rotting sidewalks the tiny shops with their dusty flyspecked windows the groggeries from whose open doors a noisome vapor streamed poisoning the morning airall these typed the oldtime west as redfield and his farmstead typed the new  once i would have laughed at this town he said but now it is disgustingsomething to be wiped out as one expunges an obscene mark upon a public wall  as for the attack upon himself terrifying as it had seemed to lee virginia it was in reality only another lively episode in the history of the town another disagreeable duty in the life of a ranger it was all a part of his job  he went forth to his duties with a deepened conviction of the essential lawlessness of the state and of america in general for this spirit of mob law was to be found in some form throughout the land he was disgusted but not beaten his resolution to carry out the terms of his contract with the government remained unshaken  he carried with him also a final disturbing glimpse of eliza wetherfords girl that did indeed threaten his peace of mind there was an involuntary appeal a wistful depth to her glance which awakened in him an indignant pity and also blew into flame something not so creditablesomething which smoldered beneath his conscious will he perceived in her a spirit of yielding which was difficult to resist he understood much more clearly than at his first meeting with her how impossible it was for her to remain in this country where law was a joke and women a ribald jest without being corrupted she had not escaped her heritage of passion and her glances innocent as they were roused even in him something lawless  as he climbed the long hill he grappled deeply with this new and inexplicable weakness he had always been a decent fellow as respects women and had maintained the same regard for the moral code that he instinctively bore toward the laws of his adopted country he could not therefore regard this girl low as her parentage seemed in the light of license for he thought whatever of evil may have been planted deep in her nature by her illassorted father and mother she is at the moment sweet and fine and the man who would awaken her other self should be accursed  in this mood too he acknowledged the loneliness of his life for the first time and rode his silent way up the trail like one in a dream he went over his life story in detail wondering if he had not made a mistake in leaving england in taking out his american citizenship he considered again very seriously the question of going back to live on the estate of his mother and once more decided that its revenue was too small to return to it meant an acceptance of the restricted life of an english farmer and worst of all an acquiescence in the social despotism which he had come to feel and to hate  the english empire to him was falling apart its supremacy was already threatened by germany whereas the future of the states appealed to his imagination here the problems of popular government and of industry were to be worked out on the grandest scale the west inspired him some day each of these great ranges will be a national forest and each of these canons will contain its lake its reservoir there was something fine in this vision of mans conquest of nature surely in this development there is a place for me he said  start at any place he pleased his mind circled and came back to lee virginia he reproached himself for not having remained one more day to help her she was in the midst of a most bleak and difficult pass and whether she came through or not depended on something not derived from either her father or her mother the test of her character was being made  happily the father is dead and his exploits fading to a dim legend but the mother may live for years to dishearten and corrupt it is foolish of the girl to stay and yet to have her go would leave me and the whole valley poorer  he perceived in her a symbol she is the new west just as the mother represents the old and the law of inheritance holds in her as it holds in the state she is a mixture of good and evil of liberty and license she must still draw forward for a time the dead weight of her past just as the west must bear with and gradually slough off its violent moods  his pony plodded slowly and the afternoon was halfspent before he came in sight of the long low logcabin which was the only home he possessed in all america for the first time since he built it the station seemed lonely and disheartening would any woman for love of me come to such a hearthstone he asked himself and if she consented to do so could i be so selfish as to exact such sacrifice no the forest ranger in these attitudes must be young and heartfree otherwise his life would be miserably solitary  he unsaddled his horse and went about his duties with a leaden pall over his spirit a fierce turmoil in his brain he was no longer singlehearted in his allegiance to the forest he could not banish that appealing girlish face that trusting gaze lee virginia needed him as he needed her and yetand yetthe peoples lands demanded his care his social prejudices forbade his marriage  he was just dishing out his rude supper when the feet of a horse on the log bridge announced a visitor  with a feeling of pleasure as well as relief he rose to greet the stranger any visitor is welcome this night he said  the horseman proved to be his former prisoner the old man edwards who slipped from his saddle with the neverfailing grace of the cowman and came slowly toward the cabin he smiled wearily as he said im on your trail mr ranger but i bear no malice you were doing your duty can you tell me how far it is to ambros camp  there was something forlorn in the mans attitude and cavanaghs heart softened turn your horse into the corral and come to supper he commanded with western bluntness well talk about all that later  edwards accepted his hospitality without hesitation and when he had disposed of his mount and made himself ready for the meal he came in and took a seat at the table in silence while the ranger served him and waited for his explanation  im going up to take ambros place he began after a few minutes of silent eating know where his camp is  i do replied ross to whom the stranger now appeared in pathetic guise any man of his age consenting to herd sheep is surely hard hit by the rough hand of the world he reasoned and the closer he studied his visitor the plainlier he felt his ungoverned past his chest was hollow his eyes unnaturally large and his hands thin but he still displayed faint lines of the beauty and power he had once gloried in his clothing was worn and poor and ross said youll need plenty of bedding up there  is it high  about eleven thousand feet  jehosaphat how will i stand that kind of air still it may be its what i need ive been living down in the low country for ten years and im a little bit hidebound  lung trouble  oh no old age i reckon  youre not oldnot more than fiftyfive  im no colt he admitted and besides ive lived pretty swift  in this was the hint of a confession but cavanagh did not care to have him proceed further in that line i suppose gregg paid your fine  yes  in any other town in the state youd have gone down the line  he roused himself see here mr ranger youve no warrant to believe me but i told you the gods truth young gregg got me to ride into the range and show him the trail i didnt intend to get mixed up with a game warden ive had all the confinement i need  well its a closed incident now interposed ross we wont reopen it make yourself at home  the stranger hungry as he was ate with unexpected gentility and as the hot coffee sent its cheerful glow through his body he asked with livening interest a good many questions about the ranger and the forest service you fellers have to be allround men the cowboys think you have a snap but i guess you earn your money  a man that builds trail lays bridges burns brush fights fire rides the roundup and covers seventyfive miles of trail every week on eighty dollars per month and feeds himself and his horses isnt what i would call enjoying a soft snap  what do you do it for  god knows ive been asking myself that question all day today  this playin game warden has some outs too that was a wild crowd last night the town is the same old hellhole it was when i knew it years ago fine girl of lize wetherfords she blocked me all right he smiled wanly i certainly was on my way to the green timber when she put the bars up  ross made no comment and the other went on in a tone of reminiscent sadness lize has changed terribly i used to know her when she was a girl judas priest but she could ride and shoot in those days his eyes kindled with the memory of her she could back a horse to beat any woman that ever crossed the range but i didnt expect to see her have such a skein of silk as that girl she sure looks the queen to me  cavanagh did not greatly relish this line of conversation but the pause enabled him to say miss wetherford is not much western she got her training in the east shes been with an aunt ever since her fathers death  hes dead is he  so far as anybody knows he is  well hes no loss i knew him too he was all kinds of a fool let a few slick ones seduce him with fizzwater and oysters on the halfshellthats the kind of a weak sister he was he got on the wrong side of the rustler lineupyou know all about that i reckon fierce old days those we didnt know anything about forest rangers or game wardens in them days  the strangers tone was now that of a man quite certain of himself he had become less furtive under the influence of the food and fire  ross defended wetherford for virginias sake he wasnt altogether to blame as i see it he was the western type in full flower thats all he had to go like the indian and the buffalo and these hobos like ballard and gregg will go next  edwards sank back into his chair i reckon thats right he agreed and made offer to help clear away the supper dishes  no youre tired replied ross rest and smoke ill soon be done  the poacher each moment seemed less of the hardened criminal and more and more of the man prematurely aged by sickness and dissipation and gradually the ranger lost all feeling of resentment  as he sat down beside the fire edwards said them wetherford women think a whole lot of you pears like theyd both fight for you are you sweet on the girl  now see here old man ross retorted sharply you want to do a lot of thinking before you comment on miss wetherford i wont stand for any nasty clack  edwards meekly answered i wasnt going to say anything out of the way i was fixin for to praise her  all the same i dont intend to discuss her with you was cavanaghs curt answer  the herder fell back into silence while the ranger prepared his bunk for the night the fact that he transferred some of the blankets from his own bed to that of his visitor did not escape edwardss keen eyes and with grateful intent he said  i can give you a tip mr ranger said he breaking out of a silence the triangle outfit is holding more cattle on the forest than their permits call for  how do you know  i heard one of the boys braggin about it  much obliged responded ross ill look into it  edwards went on furthermore theyre fixing for another sheepkill over there too all the sheepmen are armed thats why i left the country i dont want to run any more chances of being shot up ive had enough of trouble i cant afford to be hobnobbing with judges and juries  when does your parole end asked ross  edwards forced a grin i was handing you one when i said that he declared weakly i was workin up sympathy im not out on parole im just a brokendown old cowpuncher herdin sheep in order to keep clear of the liquor belt  this seemed reasonable and the ranger remarked by way of dropping the subject ive nothing to say further than thisobey the rules of the forest and you wont get into any further trouble with me and as for being shot up by the cowmen youll not be disturbed on any national forest there never has been a single herder shot nor a sheep destroyed on this forest  im mighty glad to hear that replied edwards with sincere relief ive had my share of shooting up and shooting down all i ask now is quiet and the society of sheep i take a kind of pleasure in protecting the fool brutes its about all im good for  he did indeed look like a man in the final year of life as he spoke better turn in he said in kindlier tone im an early riser  the old fellow rose stiffly and laying aside his boots and trousers rolled into his bunk and was asleep in three minutes  cavanagh himself was very tired and went to bed soon after to sleep dreamlessly till daylight he sprang from his bed and after a plunge in the stream set about breakfast while edwards rose from his bunk groaning and sighing and went forth to wrangle the horses rubbing his hands and shivering as he met the keen edge of the mountain wind when he returned breakfast was ready and again he expressed his gratitude  havent you any slicker asked cavanagh it looks like rain  no im run down pretty low he replied the truth is mr ranger i blew in all my wages at roulette last week  ross brought out a canvas coat well worn but serviceable take this along with you its likely to storm before we reach the sheepcamp and you dont look very strong you must take care of yourself  edwards was visibly moved by this kindness sure you can spare it  certain sure ive another returned the ranger curtly  it was hardly more than sunrise as they mounted their ponies and started on their trail which led sharply upward after they left the canon the wind was strong and stinging cold over the high peaks the grayblack vapor was rushing and farther away a huge dome of cloud was advancing like an army in action it was all in the days work of the ranger but the plainsman behind him turned timorous eyes toward the sky it looks owly he repeated i didnt know i was going so highgregg didnt say the camp was so near timberline  youve cut out a lonesome job for yourself ross assured him and if you can find anything else to do youd better give this up and go back  im used to being lonesome the stranger said but i cant stand the cold and the wet as i used to i never was a mountaineer  taking pity on the shivering man cavanagh turned off the trail into a sheltered nook behind some twisted pinetrees how do you expect to take care of your sheep a thousand feet higher than this he demanded as they entered the still place where the sun shone warm  thats what im asking myself replied edwards he slipped from his horse and crouched close to the rock my blood is mostly ditchwater seems like the wind blows right through me  how do you happen to be reduced to herding sheep you look like a man who has seen better days  edwards chafing his thin fingers to warm them made reluctant answer its a long story mr ranger and it concerns a whole lot of other peoplesome of them decent folksso id rather not go into it  john barleycorn was involved i reckon  sure thinghes generally always in it  youd better take my glovesits likely to snow in half an hour go aheadim a younger man than you are  the other made a decent show of resistance but finally accepted the offer saying you certainly are white to me i want to apologize for making that attempt to sneak away that nighti had a powerful good reason for not staying any longer  ross smiled a little you showed bad judgmentas it turned out  i sure did that girl can shoot her gun was steady as a doorknob she filled the door where did she learn to hold a gun like that  her father taught her so she said  she wouldnt remember mean old cuss like mebut ive seen her with wetherford when she was a kidlet i never thought shed grow up into such a queen shes a wonder  strange to say ross no longer objected to the old mans words of admiration on the contrary he encouraged him to talk on  her courage is greater than you know when she came to that hotel it was a place of dirt and vermin she has transformed it shes now engaged on the reformation of her mother  lize was straight when i knew her remarked the other in the tone of one who wishes to defend a memory straight as a die  in certain ways shes straight now but shes been hard pushed at times and has traded in liquor to help outthen shes naturally a slattern  she didnt used to be asserted edwards she was a mighty handsome woman when i used to see her riding around with ed  shes down at the heel now quite like the town  she looked sick to me you shouldnt be too hard on a sick woman but she ought to send her girl away or get out as you say the fork is no kind of a place for such a girl if i had a son a fine young feller like that girl is do you suppose id let him load himself up with an old soak like me no sir lize has no right to spoil that girls life im nothing but a hamstrung old cowpuncher but ive too much pride to saddle my pack on the shoulders of my son the way lize seems to be doin with that girl  he spoke with a good deal of feeling and the ranger studied him with deepening interest he had taken on dignity in the heat of his protest and in his eyes blazed something that was both manly and admirable  cavanagh took his turn at defending lize as a matter of fact she tried to send her daughter away but lee refuses to go insisting that it is her duty to remain in spite of her bad blood the girl is surprisingly true and sweet she makes me wonder whether there is as much in heredity as we think  her blood aint so bad wetherford was a fool and a daredevil but he came of good virginia stockso ive heard  well whatever was good in both sire and dame this girl seems to have mysteriously gathered to herself  the old man looked at him with a bright sidelong glance you are a little sweet on the girl eh  ross began to regret his confidence shes making a good fight and i feel like helping her  and she rather likes being helped by you i could see that when she brought the coffee to you she likes to stand close  ross cut him short well not discuss her any further  i dont mean any harm mr ranger we hobos have a whole lot of time to gossip and im old enough to like a nice girl in a fatherly way i reckon the whole valley rides in to see her just the way you do  cavanagh winced you cant very well hide a handsome woman in a cattle country  edwards smiled again sadly not in my day you couldnt why a girl like that would a been worth a thousand head o steers ive seen a man come in with a span of mules and three ordinary female daughters and without cinching a saddle to a pony accumulate five thousand cattle then he grew grave again dont happen to have a picture of the girl do you  if i did would i show it to you  you might you might even give it to me  cavanagh looked at the man as if he were dreaming you must be crazy  oh no im not sheepherders do go twisted but im not in the business long enough for that im just a bit nutty about that girl  he paused a moment so if you have a picture i wish youd show it to me  i havent any  is that right  thats right ive only seen her two or three times and she isnt the kind that distributes her favors  so it seems and yet youre just the kind of figure to catch a girls eye she likes youi could see that but youve got a good opinion of yourself youre an educated mando you intend to marry her  see here mr sheepherder you better ride on up to your camp and ross turned to mount his horse  wait a minute called the other man and his voice surprised the ranger with a note of authority i was terribly taken with that girl and i owe you a whole lot but ive got to know one thing i can see youre full of her and jealous as a bear of any other suitor now i want to know whether you intend to marry her or whether youre just playing with her  ross was angry now what i intend to do is none of your business  the other man was suddenly ablaze with passion his form had lost its stoop his voice was firm i merely want to say that if you play the goat with that girl ill kill you  ross stared at him quite convinced that he had gone entirely mad thats mighty chivalrous of you mr sheepherder he replied cuttingly but im at a loss to understand this sudden indignation on your part  you neednt beim her father  cavanagh fairly reeled before this retort his head rang as if he had been struck with a club he perceived the truth of the mans words instantly he gasped good god man are you ed wetherford  the answer was quick thats who i am then his voice changed but i dont want the women to know im alivei didnt intend to let anybody know it my fool temper has played hell with me againthen his voice grew firmerall the same i mean it if you or any man tries to abuse her ill kill him ive loaded her up with trouble as you say but im going to do what i can to protect hernow that im in the county again  ross confused by this new complication in the life of the girl he was beginning to love stared at his companion in dismay was it not enough that virginias mother should be a slattern and a termagant at last he spoke where have you been all these years  in the texas pen i served nine years there  what for  shooting a man it was a case of selfdefence but his family had more money and influence than i did so i went down the road as soon as i was out i started northjust the way a dog will point toward home i didnt intend to come here but some way i couldnt keep away i shied round the outskirts of the fork picking up jobs of sheepherding just to have time to turn things over i know what youre thinking aboutyoure saying to yourself well heres a nice fatherinlaw well now i dont know anything about your people but the wetherfords are as good as anybody if i hadnt come out into this cursed country where even the women go shootin wild i would have been in congress but being hotheaded i must mix in im not excusing myself you understand im not a desirable addition to any mans collection of friends but i can promise you thisno one but yourself shall ever know who i am at the same time you cant deceive my girl without my being named in the funeral that will follow  it was a singular place for such an exchange of confidences wetherford stood with his back against his pony his face flushed his eyes bright as though part of his youth had returned to him while the ranger slender erect and powerful faced him with sombre glance overhead the detached clouds swept swift as eagles casting shadows cold as winter and in the dwarfed centuryold trees the wind breathed a sad monody occasionally the sun shone warm and golden upon the group and then it seemed spring and the faroff plain a misty sea  at last cavanagh said you are only a distant and romantic figure to leea part of the dead past she remembers you as a bold rider and a wondrously brave and chivalrous father  does she he asked eagerly  yes and she loves to talk of you she knows the towns folk despise your memory but that she lays to prejudice  she must never know you must promise never to tell her  i promise that cavanagh said and edwards went on  if i could bring something to herprove to her im still a manit might do to tell her but im a branded man now and an old man and theres no hope for me i worked in one of the machineshops down there and it took the life out of me then too i left a bad name here in the forki know that those big cattlemen fooled me into taking their side of the war i staked everything i had on them and then they railroaded me out of the county so you see im doublecrossed no matter where i turn  every word he uttered made more apparent to cavanagh that lee virginia would derive nothing but pain and disheartenment from a knowledge that her father lived she must be spared this added burden of shameful inheritance he decided  the other man seemed to understand something of the rangers indignant pity for he repeated i want you to swear not to let lee know im alive no matter what comes she must not be saddled with my record let her go on thinking well of me give me your word he held out an insistent palm  ross yielded his hand and in spite of himself his tenderness for the broken man deepened the sky was darkening to the west and with a glance upward he said i reckon wed better make your camp soon or youll be chilled to the bone  they mounted hastily and rode away each feeling that his relationship to the other had completely changed wetherford marvelled over the evident culture and refinement of the ranger hes none too good for her no matter who he is he said  upon leaving timberline they entered upon a wide and sterile slope high on the rocky breast of the great peak whose splintered crest lorded the range snowfields lay all about and a few hundred feet higher up the canons were filled with ice it was a savage and tempestswept spot in which to pitch a tent but there among the rocks shivered the minute canvas home of the shepherd and close beside it guarded by a lone dog and lying like a thickspread flock of rimy bowlders almost unnoticeable in their silent immobility huddled the sheep  theres your house shouted ross to wetherford  the older man with white face of dismay looked about him unable to make reply  the walls of the frail teepee flapping in the breeze appeared hardly larger than a kerchief caught upon a bush and the disheartened collie seemed nervously apprehensive of its being utterly swept away the great peaks were now hid by the rain and little could be seen but wet rocks twisted junipers and the trickling gray streams of icy water the eastern landscape was naked alpine splendid yet appalling and the voices of the sheep added to the dreary message of the scene  hello there shouted ross wondering at the absence of human life about the camp hello the house  receiving no answer to his hail he turned to wetherford looks like joe has pulled out and left the collie to tend the flock hes been kind o seedy for some days  dismounting he approached the tent the collie who knew him seemed to understand his errand for he leaped upon him as if to kiss his cheek ross put him down gently youre almost too glad to see me old fellow i wonder how long youve been left here alone  thereupon he opened the tied flap but started back with instant perception of something wrong for there on his pile of ragged quilts lay the basque herder with flushed face and rolling eyes crazed with fever and entirely helpless youd better not come in here wetherford ross warned joe is here horribly sick and im afraid its something contagious it may be smallpox  wetherford recoiled a step smallpox what makes you think that  well these basques have been having it over in their settlement and besides it smells like it he listened a moment im afraid joes in for it hes crazy with it but hes a human being and we cant let him die here alone you rustle some wood for the stove and ill see what i can do for him  wetherford was old and wasted and thinblooded but he had never been a coward and in his heart there still burned a small flame of his youthful reckless generous daring pushing cavanagh one side he said with firm decision you keep out o there im the one to play nurse this is my job  nonsense i am younger and stronger than you  get away shouted the older man gregg hired me to do this work and it dont matter whether i live or die but youve got something to do in the world my girl needs you and she dont need me so get out o here and stay out go bring me that wood and ill go in and see whats the matter  cavanagh looked him in the face an instant very well said he ill do as you say theres no use of our both taking chances  it was beginning to rain and the tent was dark and desolate but as the fire in the little stove commenced to snarl and the smoke to pour out of the pipe the small domicile took on cheer wetherford knew how to care for the sick and in the shelter of the canvas wall developed unforeseen vigor and decision it was amazing to cavanagh to witness his change of manner  soon a pan of water was steaming and some hot stones were at the sufferers feet and when wetherford appeared at the door of the tent his face was almost happy kill a sheep there isnt a thing but a heel of bacon and a little flour in the place  as the ranger went about his outside duties he had time to take into full account the tragic significance of the situation he was not afraid of death but the menace of sickness under such surroundings made his blood run cold it is such moments as these that the wilderness appalls twenty miles of most difficult trail lay between his own cabin and this spot to carry the sick man on his horse would not only be painful to the sufferer but dangerous to the rescuer for if the basque were really ill of smallpox contagion would surely follow on the other hand to leave him to die here unaided seemed inhuman impossible  there is only one thing to do he called to wetherford and that is for me to ride back to the station and bring up some extra bedding and my own tent and so camp down beside you  all right but remember ive established a quarantine ill crack your head if you break over the line an inch  there was no longer any feeling of reaching up or reaching down between the two menthey were equals wetherford altogether admirable seemed to have regained his manhood as he stood in the door of the tent confronting the ranger this basque aint much of a find but as you say hes human and we cant let him lie here and die ill stay with him till you can find a doctor or till he dies  i take off my hat to you responded cavanagh you are a man     x  the smoke of the burning   the reader will observe that the forest rangers job is that of a man and a patriot and such a ranger was cavanagh notwithstanding his foreign birth he could ride all day in the saddle and fight fire all night while not a trained forester he was naturally a reader and thoroughly understood the theories of the department as a practical ranger he stood halfway between the cowboy who was at first the only available material and the trained expert who is being educated to follow him  he was loyal with the loyalty of a soldier and his hero was the colonel of the roughriders under whom he had campaigned the second of his admirations was the chief forester of the department  the most of us are getting so thinskinned so dependent upon steamheat and goloshes that the actions of a man like this riding forth upon his trail at all hours of the day and night selfsufficing and serene seem like the doings of an epic and so indeed they are  on the physical side the plainsman the cowboy the poacher are all admirable but cavanagh went far beyond their physical hardihood he dreamed as he rode of his responsibilities the care of the poor basque shepherd he had accepted as a matter of routine without wetherfords revelation of himself which complicated an exceedingly pitiful case he could not forget that it was lee virginias father who stood in danger of contracting the deadly disease and as he imagined him dying far up there on that bleak slope his heart pinched with the tragedy of the old mans life in such wise the days of the ranger were smouldering to this end  on the backward trail he turned aside to stamp out a smoking log beside a deserted campfire and again he made a detour into a lovely little park to visit a fisherman and to warn him of the danger of fire he was the forest guardian alert to every sign and yet all the time he was being drawn on toward his temptation why not resign and go east taking the girl with him after all the life up here is a lonely and hard one in no sense a vocation for an ambitious man suppose i am promoted to forest supervisor that only means a little more salary and life in a small city rather than here district supervisor would be better but can i hope to secure such a position  up to this month he had taken the matter of his promotion easily it was something to come along in the natural course of things there is no haste i can wait now haste seemed imperative i am no longer so young as i was he admitted  once back at his cabin he laid aside his less tangible problems and set himself to cooking some food to take back with him to the peak he brought in his packhorse and burdened him with camp outfit and utensils and extra clothing he filled his pockets with such medicines as he possessed and so at last just as night was falling he started back over his difficult trail  the sky was black as the roof of a cavern for the stars were hid by a roof of cloud which hung just above his head and the ranger was obliged to feel his way through the first quarter of his journey the world grew lighter after he left the canon and entered the dead timber of the glacial valley but even in the open the going was wearisome and the horses proceeded with sullen caution  the basque is a poor worthless little peasant but he is a human being and to leave him to die up there would be monstrous he insisted as the horses stumbled upward over the rocks of a vast lateral moraine toward the summit blinded by the clouds through which they were forced to pass he was dismounted now and picking his way with a small lantern whose feeble ray like that of a firefly illuminated for a small space the dripping rocks all else was tangible yellow mist which possessed a sulphurous odor and clung to everything it touched the wind had died out entirely and the mountainside was as silent as the moon  foot by foot he struggled up the slope hoping each moment to break through this blanket of vapor into the clear air he knew from many previous experiences that the open sky existed a little way above that this was but a roof  at last he parted the layer of mist and burst into the moonlit heights above he drew a deep breath of awe as he turned and looked about him overhead the sky was sparkling with innumerable stars and the crescent moon was shining like burnished silver while level with his breast rolled a limitless silent and mystical ocean of cloud which broke against the dark peaks in soundless surf and spread away to the east in everwidening shimmer all the lesser hills were covered only the lords of the range towered above the flood in sullen and unmoved majesty  for a long time cavanagh stood beside his weary horses filling his soul with the beauty of this world so familiar yet so transformed he wished for his love she would feel and know and rejoice with him it was such experiences as these that made him content with his work for the ranger nature plays her profoundest dramassometimes with the rush of winds the crash of thunder sometimes like this in silence so deep that the act of breathing seems a harsh discordant note  slowly the mystic waters fell away sinking with slightly rolling action into the valleys and out of the woolwhite waves sudden sharp dark forms upthrust like strange masters of the deep towers took shape and islands upheaved crowned with dark fortresses to the west a vast and inkyblack gibraltar magically appeared soon the sea was but a prodigious river flowing within the high walls of an ancient glacier a ghost of the icy stream that once ground its slow way between these iron cliffs  with a shudder of awe the ranger turned from the intolerable beauty of this combination of night cloud and mountaincrest and resumed his climb such scenes by their majesty their swift impermanency their colossal and heedless haste made his heart ache with indefinable regret again and again he looked back longing for some power which would enable him to record and reproduce for the eyes of his love some part of this stupendous and noiseless epic he was no longer content to enjoy natures splendors alone  on the cold and silent side of the great divide the faint light of the shepherds teepee shone and with a returning sense of his duty to his fellows on the roof of the continent cavanagh pushed onward  wetherford met him at the door no longer the poor old tramp but a priest one who has devoted himself to christs service  how is he asked the ranger  delirious replied the herder ive had to hold him to his bed im glad youve come its lonesome up here dont come too near set your tent down there by the trees i cant have you infected keep clear of me and this camp  ive got some food and some extra clothing for you  put em down here and in the morning drive these sheep away that noise disturbs the dago and i dont like it myself they sound lonesome and helpless that dog took em away for a while but brought em back again poor devil he dont know what to think of it all  ross did as wetherford commanded him to do and withdrew a little way down the slope and without putting up his tent rolled himself in his blankets and went to sleep  the sun rose gloriously with mountain fickleness the wind blew gently from the east the air was precisely like late march and the short and tender grass the small flowers in the sheltered corners of the rocks and the multitudinous bleatings of the lambs were all in keeping it was spring in the world and it was spring in the heart of the ranger in spite of all his perplexities the basque would recover the heroic exconvict would not be stricken and all would be well of such resiliency is the heart of youth  his first duty was to feed the faithful collie and to send him forth with the flock his next was to build a fire and cook some breakfast for wetherford and as he put it down beside the tent door he heard the wild pleading of the basque who was struggling with his nursedoubtless in the belief that he was being kept a prisoner only a few words like go home and sheep were intelligible to either the nurse or the ranger  keep quiet nowquiet boy its all right im here to take care of you wetherford repeated endlessly  cavanagh waited till a silence came then called softly heres your breakfast wetherford  move away retorted the man within keep your distance  ross walked away a little space and wetherford came to the door the dago is sure sick theres no two ways about that how far is it to the nearest doctor  i could reach one by phone from the kettle ranch about twenty miles below here  if he dont get better today i reckon well have to have a doctor he looked so white and old that cavanagh said  you need rest now i think ive had the smallpoxi know ive been vaccinated and if you go to bed  if youre saying all that preliminary to offering to come in here youre wasting your breath i dont intend to let you come any nearer than you are there is work for you to do besides theres my girl youre detailed to look after her  would a doctor come asked ross huskily moved by wetherfords words its a hard climb would they think the dago worth it  wetherfords face darkened with a look of doubt it is a hard trip for a city man but maybe he would come for youfor the government  i doubt it even if i were to offer my next months salary as a fee these hills are very remote to the townsfolk and one dago more or less of no importance but ill see what i can do  ross was really more concerned for wetherford himself than for the basque if the fever is something malignant we must have medical aid he said and went slowly back to his own camp to ponder his puzzling problem  one thing could certainly be done and that was to inform gregg and murphy of their herders illness surely they would come to the rescue of the collie and his flock to reach a telephone involved either a ride over into deer creek or a return to the fork he was tempted to ride all the way to the fork for to do so would permit another meeting with lee but to do this would require many hours longer and half a days delay might prove fatal to the basque and besides each hour of loneliness and toil rendered wetherford just so much more open to the deadly attack of the disease  here was the tragic side of the wilderness at such moments even the fork seemed a haven the mountains offer a splendid campingplace for the young and the vigorous but they are implacable foes to the disabled man or the aged they do not give loathsome diseases like pox but they do not aid in defence of the sick coldly aloof its clouds sail by the night winds bite its rains fall remorselessly sheltering rocks there are to be sure but their comfort is small to the man smitten with the scourge of the crowded city in such heights man is of no more value than the wolf or the cony  it was hard to leave an old and broken man in such a drear and windcontested spot and yet it had to be done so fastening his tent securely behind a clump of junipers cavanagh mounted his horse and rode away across the boundary of the forest into the deer creek basin which had been the bone of much contention for nearly four years  it was a high parklike expanse sparsely wooded beautiful in summer but cold and bleak in winter the summers were short and frost fell almost every week even in july and august it had once been a part of the forest but under pressure the president had permitted it to be restored to the public lands open for entry it was not agricultural grounds as certain ranchers claimed but it was excellent summer pasture and the sheepmen and cattlemen had leaped at once into warfare to possess it sheep were beaten to death with clubs by hundreds herders were hustled out of the park with ropes about their necks and their outfits destroyedand all this within a few miles of the forest boundary where one small sentinel kept effective watch and ward  cavanagh had never been over this trail but once and he was trying to locate the cliff from which a flock of sheep had been hurled by cattlemen some years before when he perceived a thin column of smoke rising from a rocky hillside with habitual watchfulness as to fire he raised his glass to his eyes and studied the spot it was evidently a campfire and smouldering dangerously and turning his horses head he rode toward it to stamp it out it was not upon his patrol but that did not matter his duty was clear  as he drew near he began to perceive signs of a broken camp the ground was littered with utensils it was not an ordinary campfire and the rangers heart quickened another sheepherder has been driven out and his tent and provisions burned he exclaimed wrathfully  his horse snorted and shied as he rode nearer and then a shudder passed through the rangers heart as he perceived in the edge of the smouldering embers a boot heel and thena charred hand in the smoke of that fire was the reek of human flesh  for a long time the ranger sat on his horse peering down into those ashes until at last it became evident to his eyes that at least two sheepherders had been sacrificed on the cattlemans altar of hate and greed  all about on the sod the story was written all too plain two men possibly three had been murderedcut to pieces and burnednot many hours before there stood the bloody spade with which the bodies had been dismembered and there lay an empty can whose oil had been poured upon the mingled camp utensils tent and wagon of the herders in the attempt to incinerate the hacked and dismembered limbs of the victims the lawlessness of the range had culminated the ferocity of the herder had gone beyond the savage here in the sweet autumn air the reek of the cattlemans vengeance rose like some hideous vapor poisonous and obscene  the ranger sickened as the bloody tale unfolded itself before him then a fierce hate of such warfare flamed in his heart could this enormity be committed under any other civilized flag would any other government intermingle so foolishly so childishly its state and federal authority as to permit such diabolism  here lay the legitimate fruit of the states essential hoodlumism here was the answer to local selfgovernmentto democracy such a thing could not happen in australia or canada only in america could lynch law become a dramatic pastime a jest an instrument of private vengeance the south and the west were alike stained with the blood of the lynched and the whole nation was covered with shame  in his horror his sense of revolt he cursed the state of which he was a citizen he would have resigned his commission at the moment so intense was his resentment of the supine careless jovial slattern government under which he was serving  by the lord he breathed with solemn intensity if this does not shame the people of this state into revolt if these fiends are not hounded and hung i will myself harry them i cannot live and do my duty here unless this crime is avenged by law  it did not matter to him that these herders were poor basques it was the utter horrifying destructive disregard of law which raised such tumult in his blood his english education his soldiers training his native refinementall were outraged then too he loved the west he had surrendered his citizenship under the british flagfor this  chilled shaking and numb he set spurs to his horse and rode furiously down the trail toward the nearest town so eager to spread the alarm that he could scarcely breathe a deep breath on the steep slopes he was forced to walk and his horse led so badly that his agony of impatience was deepened he had a vision of the murderers riding fast into far countries each hour made their apprehension progressively the more difficult  who were they he asked himself again and again what kind of man did this thing was the leader a man like ballard even so he was hired by whom by ranchers covetous of the range that was absolutely certain  it was long after noon before he came to the end of the telephoneline in a little store and postoffice at the upper falls of deer creek the telephone had a booth fortunately and he soon had redfields ear but his voice was so strained and unnatural that his chief did not recognize it  is that you ross whats the matter your voice sounds hoarse  ross composed himself and told his story briefly im at kettle ranch postoffice now listen the limit of the cattlemans ferocity has been reached as i rode down here to get into communication with a doctor for a sick herder i came upon the scene of another murder and burning the fire is still smouldering at least two bodies are in the embers  at last bit by bit from hurried speech the supervisor derived the fact the location the hour and directed the herder to ride back and guard the remains till the sheriff arrived  keep it all quiet warned ross and get the sheriff and a doctor to come up here as quick as you can what in the name of god is this country coming to he cried in despair will this deed go unpunished like the rest  redfields voice had lost its optimistic ring i dont know i am stunned by it all dont do anything rash ross wait till i come perhaps this is the turningpoint out here ill be up at the earliest moment  the embittered and disheartened ranger then called up lee virginia and the sound of her sweet voice turned his thoughts to other and in a sense more important matters for when she heard his name she cried out with such eager longing and appeal that his heart leaped oh i wish you were here mother has been worse today she is asking for you cant you come down and see us she wants to tell you something  i canti cant he stammered iiim a long way off and i have important work to do tell her i will come tomorrow  her voice was filled with disappointment and fear as she said oh i need you so cant you come  yes i will come as soon as i can i will try to reach you by daylight tomorrow my heart is with you call up the redfields they will help you  mother wants you she says she must see you come as soon as you can i dont know what she wants to tell youbut i do know we need you  her meaning was as clear as if she said i need you for i love you come to me and her prayer filled him with pain as well as pleasure he was a soldier and under orders from his chief therefore he said dear girl there is a sick man far up on the mountainside with no one to care for him but a poor old herder who is in danger of falling sick himself i must go back to them but believe me i will come just as soon as my duties will let me you understand me dont you  her voice was fainter as she said yes but iit seems hard to wait  i know your voice has helped me i was in a black mood when i came here im going back now to do my work and then i will come to you goodbye  strangely beautiful and very subtle was the vibrant stir of that wire as it conveyed back to his ear the little sigh with which she made answer to his plea he took his way upward in a mood which was meditative but no longer bitter     xi  shadows on the mist   the decision which cavanagh made between love and duty distinguished the officer from the man the soldier from the civilian he did not hesitate to act and yet he suffered a mental conflict as he rode back toward the scene of that inhuman sacrifice on the altar of greed his heart went out to lee virginia in longing her appealing voice still lay in his ear with an effect like the touch of her soft lips and his flagging horse suffered from the unconscious pressure of his haste  it will be hours before any part of the sheriffs posse can reach the falls even though they take to the swiftest motors and then other long hours must intervene before i can ride down to her yes at least a day and a night must drag their slow course before i can hope to be of service to her and the thought drew a groan of anxiety from him at such moments of mental stress the trail is a torture and the mountainside an inexorable barrier  halfway to the hills he was intercepted by an old man who was at work on an irrigating ditch beside the road he seemed very nervous and very inquisitive and as he questioned the ranger his eyes were like those of a dog that fears his masters hand ross wondered about this afterward but at the moment his mind was busy with the significance of this patient toiler with a spade he was a prophetic figure in the most picturesque and sterile land of the stockman here within twenty miles of this peaceful fruitgrower he said is the crowning infamy of the freebooting cowboy my god what a nation we are  he wondered as he rode on whether the papers of the state would make a jest of this deed will this be made the theme for caustic comment in the eastern press for a day and then be forgotten  as his hot blood cooled he lost faith in even this sacrifice could anything change the leopard west into the tameness and serenity of the ox no he decided nothing but death will do that this generation these fierce and bloody hearts must die only in that way can the tradition of violence be overcome and a new state reared  at the foot of the toilsome upwardwinding trail he dismounted and led his weary horse over his head and about halfway to the first hilltop lay a roof of fleecy vapor faint purple in color and seamless in texture through this he must pass and it symbolized to him the line of demarkation between the plain and the mountain between order and violence  again he rose above it to find it a fantastic sea lit by the sun and glowing with pink and gold and violet celestial in its ethereal beauty it threw into still more appalling shadow the smoking altar of passion toward which he spurred from moment to moment the surface rose and shifted in swift tumultuous yet soundless waves breaking round pineclad promontories in shimmering breakers faint and far and serene  down through a deep canon to the south a prodigious river of mist was rushing a silent cataract of ashy vapor plunging to a soundless beach above and beyond it the high peaks shone in radiance so pure that the heart of the lover ached with the pain of its evanescent beauty it was as if he were looking across a foaming flood upon the stupendous and shining park of some imperial potentate whose ornate and splendid country home lay just beyond rocky spires rose like cathedral towers and fortresses abutted upon the stream and yet in the midst of that glorified plain the smoke of the burning rose  slowly he led his horse along the mountainside grasping with eager desire at every changing aspect of this marvellous scene it was infinitely more gorgeous more compelling than his moonlight experience the night before for here reality definite and powerful was interfused with mystery these foothills hitherto pleasantly precipitous had suddenly become grandiose all was made over upon a mightier scale each rock and tree being distorted by the passing translucent clouds into a kind of monstrous yet epic proportion  ghostly white ledges broke from the darker mist like fields of distant crusted snow castellated crags loomed from the mystic river like fortified islands cattle silent enormously aggrandized emerged like fabled beasts of the eld and stared upon him their jaws dripping with dew bulls roared from the obscure deeps dead trees with stark and sinister arms menaced warningly all was as unreal as the world of pains delirium and yet was as beautiful as the poets vision and the ranger feeling that he was looking upon one of natures rarest displays removed his hat in worship of it thrilling with pride and satisfaction over the thought that this was his domain his to guard and preserve  the crowning glow of mystery and grace came as he led his horse out upon a projecting point of rocky ledge to rest here the cliff descended abruptly to an enormous depth and upon the vaporous rolling flood beneath him a dome of darker shadow rested at the summit of this shadow an aureole of rainbow light a complete and glorious circle rested in the midst of which his own image was flung grotesque and gigantic  the shadows of the brocken he exclaimed in ecstasy all his bitterness his care forgotten now i understand goethes lines in all his life in the hills he had never before witnessed such a combination of peak and sun and cloud and shadow  his love for the range came back upon him with such power that tears misted his eyes and his throat ached where else will i find such scenes as this he asked himself where in all the lowlands could such splendors shine how can i leave this high world in which these wonders come and go i will not here will i bring my bride and build my home this is my world  but the mist grew gray the aureole of fire faded the sun went down behind the hills and the chill of evening deepened on the trail and as he reapproached the scene of mans inhumanity to man the thought of camping there beside those charred limbs called for heroic resolution he was hungry too and as the air pinched he shivered  at the best the sheriff cannot reach here before midnight he said and settled down to his unsought revolting vigil  his one relief lay in the mental composition of a long letter to lee virginia whose life at that moment was a comfort to him if such purity such sweetness can come from violence and vulgarity then surely a new and splendid state can rise even out of the ashes of these murdered men perhaps this is the end of the old he mused perhaps this is the beginning of the new and as he pondered the last faint crimson died out of the west so must the hate and violence die out of america he said leaving the clear sweet air of liberty behind  he was near to the poet at the moment for he was also the lover his allegiance to the great republic stood the test his faith in democracy was shaken but not destroyed i will wait he decided this shall be the sign if this deed goes unavenged then will i put off my badge and my uniform and go back to the land where for a hundred years at least such deeds as these have been impossible  he built a fire as night fell to serve both as beacon and as a defence against the cold he felt himself weirdly remote in this vigil from his far height he looked abroad upon the tumbled plain as if upon an ocean dimly perceptible yet august at this moment he said curious and perhaps guilty eyes are wondering what my spark of firelight may mean  his mind went again and again to that tall old man in the ditch what was the meaning of his scared and sorrowful glance why should one so peacefully employed at such a time and in such a place wear the look of a hunted deer what meant the tremor in his voice  was it possible that one so gentle should have taken part in this deed preposterous suspicion and yet he had a guilty look  he was not a believer in ghosts but he came nearer to a fear of the dark that night than ever before in his life he brought his horse close to the fire for company and was careful not to turn his back upon the dead a corpse lying peacefully would not have produced this overpowering horror he had seen battlefields but this pile of mangled limbs conquered even the hardened campaigner he shivered each time his memory went back to what he had first looked uponthe charred hand the helpless heel  from his high hill of meditation he reviewed the history of the west based in bloody wars between the primitive races and between the trappers and their allies the land had passed through a thin adumbration of civilization as the stockmen drove out the buffalo and their hunters vigilantes sheriffs posses and now and again the regular army had swept over these grassy swells on errands of retributory violence and so the territory had been divided at last into populous states then politics the great national game had made of them a power with senators to represent a mere handful of miners and herdsmen in the congress of the united states these commonwealths had played their unscrupulous games trading for this and for that local appropriation happily in some instances these senators had been higher than their state but in other cases they represented only too loyally the violent and conscienceless cowman or lumber king and now as redfield had said the landboomer was to have his term the man who valued residents not wild west performers was about to govern and despoil this promoter almost as selfish as the cattle king was about to advance the state along the lines of his conception of civilization and so perhaps this monstrous deed this final inexcusable inhuman offence against law and humanity was to stand as a monument dividing the old from the new such at least was the rangers hope  at last far in the night he heard the snort of a horse and the sound of voices the law such as it was was creeping up the mountainside in the person of the sheriff of chauvenet county and was about to relieve the ranger from his painful responsibility as guardian of the dead  at last he came this officer of the law attended like a cheyenne chief by a dozen lesser warriors of various conditions and kinds but among themindeed second only to the sheriffwas hugh redfield the forest supervisor hot and eager with haste  as they rode up to the fire the officer called out howdy ranger how about it  ross stated briefly succinctly what he had discovered and as he talked other riders came up the hill and gathered closely around to listen in wordless silencein guilty silence the ranger could not help believing  the sheriff himself a cattleman heard cavanagh without comment till he had ended with a gesture and there they are i turn them over to you with vast relief i am anxious to go back to my own peaceful world where such things do not happen  the sheriff removed his hat and wiped his brow then swore with a mutter of awe well by god this is the limit you say there were three bodies  i lacked the courage to sort them out ive been in battle mr sheriff and ive seen dead men tumbled in all shapes but someway this took the stiffening out of my knees i rode away and left them i dont care to see them again my part of this work is done  redfield spoke sheriff van horne you and i have been running cattle in this country for nearly thirty years and weve witnessed all kinds of shooting and several kinds of hanging but when it comes to chopping and burning men i get off i shall personally offer a reward of a thousand dollars for the apprehension of these miscreants and i hope youll make it your solemn duty to hunt them to earth  you wont have far to go remarked ross significantly  what do you mean asked the sheriff  i mean this slaughter like the others that have taken place was the work of cattlemen who claim this range their names are known to us all  can it be possible exclaimed redfield looking round at the silent throng and in the wavering light certain eyes seemed to shift and fall  in what essential does it differ from the affair over on the red desert demanded cavanagh who would kill these poor sheepherders but cattlemen warring for the grass on which we stand  but they would not dare to do such work themselves  no one else would do it hired assassins would not chop and burn hate and greed were both involved in this butcheryhate and greed made mad by drink i tell you the men who did this are less than a days ride of where we stand  a silence followedso deep a silence that the ranger was convinced of the fact that in the circle of his listeners stood those who if they had not shared in the slaughter at least knew the names of the guilty men  at last the sheriff spoke this time with a sigh i hope youre all wrong cavanagh id hate to think any constituent of mine had sanctioned this job give me that lantern curtis  the group of ranchers dismounted and followed the sheriff over to the grewsome spot but redfield stayed with the ranger  have you any suspicion ross  no hardly a suspicion however you know as well as i that this was not a sudden outbreak this deed was planned it represents the feeling of many cattlemenin everything but the extra horror of its execution that was the work of drunken infuriated men but i am more deeply concerned over miss wetherfords distress did she reach you by telephone tonight  no whats the trouble  her mother is down again i telephoned her and she asked me to come to her but i cannot go for i have a case of smallpox up on the hill ambro the basque herder is down with it and another herder is up there alone with him i must go back to them but meanwhile i wish you would go to the fork and see what you can do for her  his voice filled with emotion touched redfield and he said cant i go to the relief of the herder  no you must not think of it you are a man of a family but if you can find any one who has had the smallpox send him up the old herder who is nursing the patient is not strong and may drop any moment then its up to me  the men came back to the campfire conversing in low voices some of them cursing in tones of awe one or two of them were small farmers from deer creek recent comers to the state or men with bunches of milkcows and to them this deed was awesome  the sheriff followed saying well theres nothing to do but wait till morning the rest of you men better go home you cant be of any use here  for more than three hours the sheriff and redfield sat with the ranger waiting for daylight and during this time the name of every man in the region was brought up and discussed among others ross mentioned the old man in the ditch  he wouldnt hurt a bumblebee declared the sheriff hes got a bunch of cattle but hes the mildest old man in the state hes the last rancher in the country to even stand for such work what made you mention him  i passed him as i was riding back replied cavanagh and he had a scared look in his eyes  the sheriff grunted you imagined all that the old chap always has a kind of meek look  cavanagh tired hungry and rebellious waited until the first faint light in the east announced the dawn then he rose and stretching his hand out toward it said here comes the new day will it be a new day to the state or is it to be the same old round of savagery  redfield expressed a word of hope and in that spirit the ranger mounted and rode away back toward the small teepee wherein wetherford was doing his best to expiate his pasta past that left him old and friendless at fiftyfive the sheriff and his men took up the work of vengeance which fell to them as officers of the law  it was nearly noon of a glorious day as cavanagh very tired and very hungry rode up to the sheepherders tent wetherford was sitting in the sun calmly smoking his pipe the sheep were feeding not far away attended by the dog and an air of peace covered his sunlit rocky world  how is the basque asked the ranger  wetherford pointed upward all over  then it wasnt smallpox  i reckon thats what it was it sure was fierce i judge its a case of injun burialno ceremonyright here in the rocks ill let you dig the hole im just about all in but mind you keep to the windward all the time i dont want you spotted  cavanagh understood the necessity for these precautions but first of all came his own need of food and rest turning his tired horse to grass he stretched himself along a grassy sunny cranny between the rocks and there ate and afterward slept while all about him the lambs called and the conies whined  he was awakened by a pebble tossed upon him and when he arose stiff and sore but feeling stronger and in better temper the sun was wearing low setting to work at his task he threw the loose rock out of a hollow in the ledge near by and to this rude sepulchre wetherford dragged the dead man refusing all aid and there piled a cairn of rocks above his grave  the ranger was deeply moved by the pitiless contrast of the scene and the drama the sun was still shining warmly aslant the heavens the wind crisp and sweet wandered by on laggard wings the conies cried from the ledges the lambs were callingand in the midst of it one tattered fragment of humanity was heaping the iron earth upon another stricken perhaps by the same dread disease  wetherford himself paused to moralize i suppose that chap has a mother somewhere who is wondering where her boy is this isnt exactly christian burial but its all hell get i reckon for whether it was smallpox or plain fever nobodys going to uselessly resurrect him even the coyotes will fight shy of his meat  nevertheless the ranger took a hand at the end and rolled some huge bowlders upon the grave to insure the wolves defeat  now burn the bedding he commandedthe whole camp has got to goand your clothing too after we get down the hill  what will we do with the sheep  drive them over the divide and leave them  all these things wetherford did and leaving the camp in ashes behind him cavanagh drove the sheep before him on his homeward way as night fell the dog at his command rounded them up and put them to bed and the men went on down the valley leaving the brave brute on guard pathetic figure of faithful guardianship  it hurts me to desert you old fellow called the ranger looking back but theres no help for it ill come up in the morning and bring you some biscuit  the collie seemed to understand he waggled his tail and whined as though struggling to express his wonder and pain and ross moved to pity called come on boy never mind the sheep come along with us  but the dog leaping from side to side uttered a short howl and a sharp bark as if to say i cant i cant  hes onto his job remarked wetherford it beats all how human they do seem sometimes ive no manner of doubt that dagos booted him all over the place many a time and yet he seemed horrible sorry about his masters trouble every few minutes all night long hed come pattering and whining round the door of the tentdidnt come in seemed just trying to ask how things were coming he was like a child lonesome and grieving  it was long after dark when they entered the canon just above the cabin and wetherford was shivering from cold and weakness  now you pull up just outside the gate and wait there till i bring out some blankets then youve got to strip to the skin and start the world all over again said cavanagh ill build a fire here and well cremate your past how about it  im willing responded wetherford you can burn everything that belongs to me but my wife and my girl  all through the ceremony which followed ran this selfbanter ill be all ranger barring a commission he said with a grin as he put on the oliveyellow shirt and a pair of dustygreen trousers and here goes my past he added as he tossed his contaminated rags upon the fire  what a corking opportunity to make a fresh start commented cavanagh i hope you see it  i see it but its hard to live up to your mark  when every precaution had been taken the ranger led the freshly scrubbed scoured and transformed fugitive to his cabin  why man youre fit for the state legislature he exclaimed as they came into the full light my clothes dont precisely meet every demand you make upon them but they give you an air of command i wish your wife could see you now  wetherford was quite serious as he answered this uniform means more to me than you think i wish i was entitled to wear it the wildwood is just about populous enough for me  good for you responded cavanagh to convert a man of your record to a belief in conservation is to demonstrate once again the regenerative power of an idea then seeing that wetherford was really in earnest he added you can stay with me as long as you wish perhaps in time you might be able to work into the service as a guard although the chief is getting more and more insistent on real foresters  there were tears in wetherfords eyes as he said you cannot realize what this clean warm uniform means to me for nine years i wore the prison stripes then i was turned loose with a shoddy suit and a hat a size too big for mean outfit that gave me away everywhere i went till my hair and beard sprouted i had a hard rustle of it but my clothes grew old faster than my beard at last i put every cent i had earned into a poor old horse and a faded saddle and once mounted i kept amoving north he smoothed the sleeve of his coat it is ten years since i was dressed like a man  you need not worry about food or shelter for the present replied cavanagh gently grub is not costly here and houserent is less than nominal so make yourself at home and get strong  wetherford lifted his head but i want to do something i want to redeem myself in some way i dont want my girl to know who i am but id like to win her respect i cant be what you say she thinks i was but if i had a chance i might show myself a man again i wouldnt mind lize knowing that i am aliveit might be a comfort to her but i dont want even her to be told till i can go to her in my own duds  shes pretty sick said cavanagh i telephoned lee virginia last night and if you wish you may ride down with me tomorrow and see her  the old man fell atremble i darent do that i cant bear to tell her where ive been  she neednt know i will tell her youve been out of your mind ill say anything you wish you can go to her in the clothes you have on if you likeshe will not recognize you as the prisoner i held the other night you can have your beard trimmed and not even the justice will know you  all reserve had vanished out of the convicts heart and with choking voice he thanked his young host ill never be a burden to you he declared in firmer voice and if my lung holds out ill show you im not the total locoe that i pear to be  no further reference was made to lee virginia but ross felt himself to be more deeply involved than ever by these promises his fortunes seemed to be inextricably bound up with this singular and unhappy family lying in his bunk after the lights were out he fancied himself back in his ancestral home replying to the questions of his aunts and uncles who were still expecting him to bring home a rich and beautiful american heiress some of the cavanaghs were drunkards and some were vixens but they were on the whole rather decent rather decorous and very dull and to them this broken exconvict and this slattern old barmaid would seem very far from the ideal they had formed of the family into which ross was certain to marry  but as he recalled the spot in which he lay and the uniform which hung upon the wall he was frank to admit that the beautiful and rich heiress of whom his family dreamed was a very unsubstantial vision indeed and that to be honest with himself he had nothing to offer for such shining goodfortune  at breakfast next morning he said i must ride back and take some bread to the dog i cant go away and leave him there without saying hello  let me do that suggested wetherford im afraid to go down to the fork i reckon id better go back and tend the sheep till gregg sends some one up to take my place  that might be too late to see lize lees voice showed great anxiety she may be on her deathbed no youd better go down with me today he urged and at last the old man consented  putting some bread in his pockets ross rode off up the trail to see how the dog and his flock were faring he had not gone far when he heard the tinkle of the bells and the murmur of the lambs and a few moments later the collie came toward him with the air of a boy who having assumed to disregard the orders of his master expects a scolding he plainly said ive brought my sheep to you because i was lonesome please forgive me  cavanagh called to him cheerily and tossed him a piece of bread which he caught in his teeth but did not swallow on the contrary he held it while leaping for joy of the praise he heard in his newfound masters voice  turning the flock upward again toward the higher peaks the ranger commanded the collie to their heels and so having redeemed his promise rode back to the cabin where he found wetherford saddled and ready for his momentous trip to the valley he had shaved away his gray beard and had ross been unprepared for these changes he would have been puzzled to account for this decidedly military figure sitting statuesquely on his pony before the door  you can prove an alibi he called as he drew near gregg himself would never recognize you now  wetherford was in no mood for joking lize will i wore a mustache in the old days and theres a scar on my chin  as he rode he confided this strange thing to cavanagh i know said he that lize is old and wrinkled for ive seen her but all the same i cant realize it that heavyset woman down there is not lize my lize is slim and straight this woman whom you know has stolen her name and face thats all i cant explain exactly what i feel but lee virginia means more to me now than lize  i think i understand you said cavanagh with sympathy in his voice  the nearer wetherford came to the actual meeting with his wife the more he shook at last he stopped in the road i dont believe i can do it he declared ill be like a ghost to her whats the use of it shell only be worried by my story i reckon id better keep dark to everybody let me go back im plum scared cold  while still he argued two men on horseback rounded a sharp turn in the trail and came face to face with the ranger wetherfords face went suddenly gray my god theres the deputy  keep quiet ill do the talking commanded cavanagh who was instant in his determination to shield the man goodmorning gentlemen he called cheerily youre abroad early  the man in front was the deputy sheriff of the county his companion was a stranger  that was a horrible mess you stumbled on over on deer creek the deputy remarked  it certainly was have any arrests been made  not yet but were on a clew this is marshal haines of dallas mr cavanagh pursued the deputy the two men nodded in token of the introduction and the deputy went on you remember that old cuss that used to work for gregg  again cavanagh nodded  well that chap is wanted by the texas authorities mr haines here wants to see him mighty bad hes an escaped convict with a bad record  is that so exclaimed cavanagh i thought he seemed a bit gunshy  the last seen of him was when sam gregg sent him up to herd sheep i think he was mixed up in that killing myselfhim and ballardand were going up to get some track of him didnt turn up at your station did he  yes he came by some days ago on his way so he said to relieve that sick basque ambro i went up a couple of days ago and found the basque dead and the old man gone i buried the herder the best i could and im on my way down to report the case  the deputy mused he may be hanging round some of the lumbercamps i reckon we had better go up and look the ground over anyhow we might just chance to overhaul him  he may have pulled out over the range suggested the ranger anyhow its a long way up there and youll probably have to camp at my place tonight youll find the key hanging up over the door go in and make yourself comfortable  the deputy thanked him and was about to ride on when cavanagh added i burned that basques tent and bedding for fear of contagion his outfit was worthless anyhow youll find the sheep just above my cabin and the horse in my corral  the old man didnt take the horse eh well that settles it hes sure at one of the camps much obliged goodday  as the two officers rode away wetherford leaned heavily on his pommel and stared at the ranger with wide eyes his face was drawn and his lips dry theyll get me my god theyll get me he said  oh no they wont rejoined cavanagh youre all right yet they suspected nothing how could they with you in uniform and in my company  all the same im scared that man haines had his eyes on me every minute he saw right through me theyll get me and theyll charge me up with that killing  no they wont i tell you insisted the ranger haines suspected nothing i had his eye he never saw you before and has nothing but a description to go by so cheer up your uniform and your position with me will make you safeperfectly safe theyll find the basques camp burned and the sheep in charge of the dog and theyll fancy that you have skipped across the range but see here old man and he turned on him sharply you didnt tell me the whole truth you said you were out on parole  i couldnt tell you the whole truth replied the fugitive but i will now i was in for a life sentence i was desperate for the open air and homesick for the mountains and i struck down one of the guards i was willing to do anything to get out i thought if i could get back to this country and my wife and child id be safe i said id be willing to go back to the pen if necessary but im not i cant do it id die there in that hell you must save me for my girls sake  his voice and eyes were wild with a kind of desperate fury of fear and cavanagh moved to pity assured him of his aid now listen he said im going to shield you on account of your work for that poor shepherd and for your daughters sake its my duty to apprehend you of course but im going to protect you the safest thing for you to do is to go back to my cabin ride slow so as not to get there till theyre gone theyll ride over to the sawmill without doubt if they come back this way remember that the deputy saw you only as a ragged old man with a long beard and that haines has nothing but a printed description to go by theres no use trying to flee you are a marked man in that uniform and you are safer right here with me than anywhere else this side of chicago haines is likely to cross the divide in the belief that you have gone that way and if he does you have no one but the deputy to deal with  he succeeded at last in completely rousing the older mans courage  wetherford rose to meet his opportunity ill do it he said firmly  thats the talk exclaimed cavanagh to encourage him you can throw them off the track this time and when i come back tomorrow ill bring some other clothing for you and then well plan some kind of a scheme that will get you out of the country ill not let them make a scapegoat of you  the ranger watched the fugitive as he started back over the trail in this desperate defiance of his pursuers with far less confidence in the outcome than he had put into words  all depends on wetherford himself if his nerve does not fail him if they take the uniform for granted and do not carry the matter to the supervisor we will pull the plan through and in this hope he rode away down the trail with bent head for all this bore heavily upon his relationship to the girl waiting for him in the valley he had thought lize a burden a social disability but a convict father now made the mothers faults of small account  the nearer he drew to the meeting with lee virginia the more important that meeting became after all woman is more important than war the love of home and the child persists through incredible vicissitudes the conqueror returns from foreign lands the lover still and in the deep of flooded mines and on the icy slopes of arctic promontories dead men have been found holding in their rigid hands the pictured face of some fair girl in the presence of such irrefutable testimony who shall deny the persistence and the reality of love  cavanagh had seen virginia hardly more than a score of times and yet she filled his thought confused his plans making of his brain a place of doubt and hesitation for her sake he had entered upon a plan to shield a criminal to harbor an escaped convict it was of no avail to argue that he was moved to shield wetherford because of his heroic action on the peak he knew perfectly well that it was because he could not see that fair brave girl further disgraced by the discovery of her fathers identity for in the searching inquiry which would surely follow his secret would develop  to marry her knowing the character of her father and her mother was madness and the voice within him warned him of his folly pure water cannot be drawn from corrupt sources it is said nevertheless the thought of having the girl with him in the wilderness filled him with divine recklessness he was bewitched by the satin smoothness of her skin the liquid light of her eye the curve of her cheek the swell of her bosom and most of all by the involuntary movement of yielding which betrayed her trust and her love while still he debated alternately flushed with resolve to be happy and chilled by some strange dejection he met swenson the young guard who guarded the forest on the south fork  as he rode up cavanagh perceived in the other mans face something profoundly serious he did not smile in greeting as was usual with him and taking some letters from his pocket passed them over in ominous silence  cavanagh upon looking them over selected a letter evidently from mrs redfield and stuffed the others into his coatpocket it was a closely written letter and contained in its first sentence something which deeply affected him slipping from his saddle he took a seat upon a stone that he might the better read and slowly digest what was contained therein he read on slowly without any other movement than that which was required to turn the leaves it was a passionate plea from eleanor redfield against his further entanglement with lize wetherfords girl  you cannot afford to marry her you simply cannot the old mother is too dreadful and may live on for years the girl is attractive i grant you but shes tainted if there is anything in the law of heredity she will develop the traits of her mother or her father sooner or later you must not marry her ross and if you cannot what will you do theres only one thing to do keep away i enclose a letter from your sister pleading with me to urge you to visit them this winter she is not very strong as you can see by her writing and her request will give you an excuse for breaking off all connection with this girl i am sorry for her ross but you cant marry her you must notyou must not ride over and see us soon and we will talk it all out together  he opened another letter but did not read it he was too profoundly shaken by the first he felt the pure friendship the fine faith and the guardianship of the writer and he acknowledged the good sense of all she said and yetand yet  when he looked up swenson was staring down at him with a face of such bitterness that it broke through even the absorbed and selfish meditation into which he had been thrown  whats the matter swenson you look as if you had lost a friend  i have answered the guard shortly and so have you the chief is out  what  theyve got him he exclaimed hes out  cavanagh sprang up i dont believe it for what reason why  dont that letter tell you the whole town is chuckling every criminal and plugugly in the country is spitting in our faces this morning yes sir the president has fired the chiefthe man that built up this forestry service the whole works is goin to hell thats what it is well have all the coal thieves waterpower thieves poachers and freegrass pirates piling in on us in mobs theyll eat up the forest i see the finish of the whole business theyll put some western man in somebody they can work then where will we be  cavanaghs young heart burned with indignation but he tried to check the other mans torrent of protest  i cant believe it theres some mistake maybe theyve made him the secretary of the department or something  no they havent theyve thrown him out theyve downed him because he tried to head off some thievery of coalmines in alaska the man was ready to weep with chagrin and indignant sorrow his voice choked and he turned away to conceal his emotion  cavanagh put the letter back into his pocket and mounted his horse well go on back to your work swenson im going to town to get the supervisor on the wire and find out what it all means  he was almost as badly stunned by the significance of swensons news as swenson himself could it be possible that the man who had built up the field service of the bureauthe man whose cleanhanded patriotism had held the boys together making them every year more clearly a unit a little army of enthusiastscould it be possible that the originator the organizer of this great plan had been stricken down just when his influence was of most account he refused to believe it of an administration pledged to the cause of conservation  as he entered the town he was struck instantly by the change in the faces turned toward him in the jocular greetings hurled at him hello mr cossack what do you think of your chief now  this will put an end to your infernal nonsense said another well have a man in there now who knows the western ways and whos willing to boom things along the cork is out of your forest bottle  gregg was most offensive of all this means throwing open the forest to anybody that wants to use it means an entire reversal of this fool policy  wait and see replied cavanagh but his face was rigid with the repression of the fear and anger he felt with hands that trembled he opened the door to the telephonebooth closed it carefully behind him and called for the supervisors office as soon as redfield replied he burst forth in question is it true that the chief is out  redfields voice was husky as he replied yes lad theyve got him  good lord what a blow to the service exclaimed cavanagh with a groan of sorrow and rage what is the president thinking ofto throw out the only man who stood for the future the man who had built up this corps who was its inspiration then after a pause he added with bitter resolution this ends it for me heres where i get off  dont say that boy we need you now more than ever  im through im done with americawith the states i shall write my resignation at once send down another man to take my place  redfields pleadings were of no avail cavanagh went directly from the booth to the postoffice and there surrounded by jeering and exultant citizens he penned his resignation and mailed it then with stern and contemptuous face he left the place making no reply to the jeers of his enemies and mounting his horse mechanically rode away out upon the plains seeking the quiet open places in order to regain calmness and decision he did not deliberately ride away from lee virginia but as he entered upon the open country he knew that he was leaving her as he was leaving the forests he had cut himself off from her as he had cut himself off from the work he loved his heart was swollen big within his breast he longed for the return of the colonel to the white house what manner of ruler is this who is ready to strike down the man whose very name means conservation and who in a few years would have made this body of forest rangers the most effective corps of its size in the world he groaned again and his throat ached with the fury of his indignation  dismissed for insubordination the report said in what way only in making war on greed in checking graft in preserving the heritage of the people  the lash that cut deepest was the open exultation of the very men whose persistent attempt to appropriate public property the chief had helped to thwart redfield will go next the influence that got the chief will get hugh hes too good a man to escape then as swenson says the thieves will roll in upon us to slash and burn and corrupt what a country what a country  as he reached the end of this line of despairing thought he came back to the question of his remaining personal obligations wetherford must be cared for and thenand then there was virginia waiting for him at this moment in his weakness he confessed that he had never intended to marry her and yet he had never deliberately intended to do her wrong he had always stopped short of the hideous treachery involved in despoiling her young love and for her sake to save her from humiliation i will help her father to freedom  this brought him back to the hideous tragedy of the heights and with that thought the last shred of faith in the sense of justice in the state vanished  they will never discover those murderers they will permit this outrage to pass unpunished like the others it will be merely another dramatic incident in the history of the range  his pony of its own accord turned and by a circuitous route headed at last for the home canon as if it knew its masters wavering mind cavanagh observed what he was doing but his lax hand did not intervene helpless to make the decision himself he welcomed the intervention of the homing instinct of his horse with bent head and brooding face he returned to the silence of the trail and the loneliness of the hills     xii  cavanaghs last vigil begins   on his solitary ride upward and homeward the ranger searched his heart and found it bitter and disloyal love had interfered with duty and pride had checked and defeated love his path no longer clear and definite looped away aimlessly lost in vague obscure meanderings his world had suddenly grown gray  the magnificent plan of the chief forester to which he had pledged such buoyant allegiance was now a thing apart a campaign in which he was to be merely an onlooker it had once offered something congenial helpful inspiring now it seemed fantastic and futile without the man who shaped it i am nearing forty he said eleanor is right i am wasting my time here in these hills but what else can i do  he had no trade no business no special skill save in the ways of the mountaineer and to return to his ancestral home at the moment seemed a woful confession of failure  but the cause of his deepest dismay and doubt was the revelation to himself of the essential lawlessness of his love a force within him which now made his duties as a lawenforcer sadly ironic after all was not the man who presumed upon a maidens passion and weakness a greater malefactor than he who steals a pearl or strangles a man for his gold to betray a soul to poison a young life is this not the unforgivable crime  here am i a son of the law complaining of the lawlessness of the westfighting it conquering itand yet at the same time i permit myself to descend to the level of neill ballard to think as the barbaric man thinks  he burned hot with contempt of himself and his teeth set hard in the resolution to put himself beyond the reach of temptation furthermore i am concealing a criminal cloaking a convict when i should be arresting him he pursued referring back to wetherford and why because of a girls romantic notion of her father a notion which can be preserved only by keeping his secret by aiding him to escape and even this motive he was obliged to confess had not all been on the highest plane it was all a part of his almost involuntary campaign to win virginias love the impulse had been lawless lawless as the oldtime west and the admission cut deep into his selfrespect  it was again dusk as he rode up to his own hitchingpole and slipped from the saddle  wetherford came out indicating by his manner that he had recovered his confidence once more how did you find things in the valley he inquired as they walked away toward the corral  bad responded the ranger  in what way  the chief has been dismissed and all the rascals are chuckling with glee ive resigned from the service  wetherford was aghast what for  i will not serve under any other chief the best thing for you to do is to go out when i do i think by keeping on that uniform you can get to the train with me  did you see lize and my girl  no i only remained in town a minute it was too hot for me im done with it wetherford im going back to civilization no more wild west for me the bitterness of his voice touched the older mans heart but he considered it merely a mood  dont lose your nerve mebbe this ends the reign of terror  nothing will end the moral shiftlessness of this country but the death of the freebooter you cant put new wine into old bottles these cattlemen deep in their hearts sympathize with the wipingout of those sheepherders the cry for justice comes from the man whose ear is not being chewedthe man far offand from the townbuilder who knows the state is being hurt by such atrocities but the ranchers over on deer creek will conceal the assassinsyou know that youve had experience with these freegrass warriors you know what they are capable of that job was done by men who hated the dagoeshated em because they were rival claimants for the range its nonsense to attempt to fasten it on men like neill ballard the men who did that piece of work are wellknown stockowners  i reckon thats so  well now whos going to convict them i cant do it im going to pull out as soon as i can put my books in shape and youd better go too  they were standing at the gate of the corral and the roar of the mountain stream enveloped them in a cloud of sound  wetherford spoke slowly i hate to lose my girl now that ive seen her but i guess youre right and lize poor old critter its hells shame the way ive queered her life and id give my right arm to be where i was twelve years ago but with a price on my head and old age comin on i dont see myself ever again getting up to par its a losing game for me now  there was resignation as well as despair in his voice and cavanagh felt it but he said theres one other question that may come up for decisionif that basque died of smallpox you may possibly take it  ive figured on that but it will take a day or two to show on me i dont feel any ache in my bones yet if i do come down you keep away from me youve got to live and take care of virginia  she should never have returned to this accursed country cavanagh harshly replied starting back toward the cabin  the constable smoking his pipe beside the fireplace did not present an anxious face on the contrary he seemed plumply content as he replied to the rangers greeting he represented very well the type of officer which these disorderly communities produce brave and tireless when working along the line of his prejudices he could be most laxly inefficient when his duties cut across his own or his neighbors interests being a cattleman by training he was glad of the red herring which the texas officer had trailed across the line of his pursuit  this attitude still further inflamed cavanaghs indignant hate of the country the theory which the deputy developed was transparent folly it was just a case of plain robbery he argued one of them dagoes had money and neill ballard and that man edwards just naturally follered him and killed the whole bunch and scootedthats my guess  cavanaghs outburst was prevented by the scratching and whining of a dog at his door for a moment he wondered at this his perturbed mind had dropped the memory of the loyal collie  as he opened the door the brute more than half human in his gaze looked beseechingly at his new master as if to say i couldnt help iti was so lonely and i love you  you poor beastie the ranger called pityingly and the dog leaped up in a frenzy of joyous relief putting his paws on his breast then dropped to the ground and crouching low on his front paws quivered and yawned with ecstasy of worship it seemed that he could not express his passionate adoration his relief except by these grotesque contortions  come in laddie ross urged but this the dog refused to do i am a creature of the open air he seemed to say my duties are of the outer world i have no wish for a firesideall i need is a masters praise and a bit of bread  cavanagh brought some food and putting it down outside the door spoke to him gently good boy eat that and go back to your flock ill come to see you in the morning  when cavanagh a few minutes later went to the door the dog was gone and listening the ranger could hear the faint diminishing bleating of the sheep on the hillside above the corral the fourfooted warden was with his flock  an hour later the sound of a horses hoofs on the bridge gave warning of a visitor and as cavanagh went to the door gregg rode up seeking particulars as to the death of the herder and the whereabouts of the sheep  the ranger was not in a mood to invite the sheepman in and besides he perceived the danger to which wetherford was exposed therefore his answers were short gregg on his part did not appear anxious to enter  what happened to that old hobo i sent up he asked  cavanagh briefly retold his story and at the end of it gregg grunted you say you burned the tent and all the bedding  every thread of it it wasnt safe to leave it  what ailed the man  i dont know but it looked and smelled like smallpox  the deputy rose with a spring smallpox you didnt handle the cuss  cavanagh did not spare him somebody had to lend a hand i couldnt see him die there alone and he had to be buried so i did the job  gregg recoiled a step or two but the deputy stood staring the implication of all this sinking deep were you wearing the same clothes youve got on  yes but i used a slicker while working around the body  good king the sweat broke out on the mans face you ought to be arrested  ross took a step toward him im at your service  keep off shouted the sheriff  ross smiled then became very serious i took every precaution mr deputy i destroyed everything that could possibly carry the disease i burned every utensil including the saddle everything but the mans horse and his dog  the dog exclaimed the deputy seized with another idea not that dog you fed just now  the very same replied cavanagh  dont you know a dogs sure to carry the poison in his hair why he jumped on you why didnt you shoot him he demanded fiercely  because hes a faithful guardian and besides he was with the sheep and never so much as entered the tent  do you know that  not absolutely but he seemed to be on shy terms with the herder and im sure  the officer caught up his hat and coat and started for the door its me for the open air said he  as the men withdrew ross followed them and standing in his door delivered his final volley if this state does not punish those fiends every decent man should emigrate out of it turning the land over to the wolves the wildcats and other beasts of prey  gregg as he retreated called back thats all right mr ranger but youd better keep to the hills for a few weeks the settlers down below wont enjoy having a man with smallpox chassayin around town they might rope and tie you  wetherford came out of his hidingplace with a grave face i wonder i didnt think of that collie they say a cats fur will carry disease germs like a sponge must be the same with a dog  well its too late now replied cavanagh but theyre right about our staying clear of town theyll quarantine us sure all the same i dont believe the dog carried any germs of the disease  wetherford now that the danger of arrest was over was disposed to be grimly humorous theres no great loss without some small gain i dont think well be troubled by any more visitorsnot even by sheriffs or doctors i reckon you and i are in for a couple of months of the quiet lifethe kind we read about                                                    cavanagh now that he was definitely out of the forest service perceived the weight of every objection which his friends and relatives had made against his going into it it was a lonely life and must ever be so it was all very well for a young unmarried man who loved the woods and hills beyond all things else and who could wait for advancement but it was a sad place for one who desired a wife the rangers place was on the trail and in the hills and to bring a woman into these high silences into these lone reaches of forest and fell would be cruel to bring children into them would be criminal  all the next day while wetherford pottered about the cabin or the yard cavanagh toiled at his papers resolved to leave everything in the perfect order which he loved whenever he looked round upon his belongings each and all so redolent of the wildernesshe found them very dear his chairs which he had rived out of slabs his guns his robes his saddles and their accoutrementsall meant much to him some of them must go with me he said and when i am settled down in the old home ill have one room to myself which shall be so completely of the mountain america that when i am within it i can fancy myself back in the camp  he thought of south africa as a possibility and put it aside knowing well that no other place could have the same indefinable charm that the rocky mountains possessed for the reason that he had come to them at his most impressionable age then too the united states for all their faults seemed merely an extension of the english form of government  wetherford was also moving in deep thought and at last put his perplexity into a question what am i to do im beginning to feel queer i reckon the chances for my having smallpox are purty fair maybe id better drop down to sulphur and report to the authorities ive got a day or two before the blossoms will begin to show on me  cavanagh studied him closely now dont get to thinking youve got it i dont see how you could attach a germ the high altitude and the winds up there ought to prevent infection im not afraid for myself but if youre able perhaps wed better pull out tomorrow  later in the day wetherford expressed deeper dejection i dont see anything ahead of me anyhow he confessed if i go back to the pen ill die of lung trouble and i dont know how im going to earn a living in the city mebbe the best thing i could do would be to take the pox and go under im afraid of big towns he continued i always waseven when i had money now that i am old and broke i darent go no city for me  cavanaghs patience gave way but man you cant stay here im packing up to leave your only chance of getting out of the country is to go when i go and in my company his voice was harsh and keen and the old man felt its edge but he made no reply and this sad silence moved cavanagh to repentance his irritability warned him of something deeply changing in his own nature  approaching the brooding felon he spoke gently and sadly im sorry for you wetherford i sure am but its up to you to get clear away so that lee will never by any possible chance find out that you are alive she has a romantic notion of you as a representative of the oldtime west and it would be a dreadful shock to her if she knew you as you are its hard to leave her i know now that youve seen her but thats the manly thing to dothe only thing to do  oh youre rightof course youre right but i wish i could be of some use to her i wish i could chore round for the rest of my life where i could kind o keep watch over her id be glad enough to play the scullion in her kitchen but if youre going to take her  but im not protested ross im going to leave her right here i cant take her  wetherford looked at him with steady eyes into which a keen light leaped dont you intend to marry her  ross turned away no i donti mean it is impossible  why not dont tell me youre already married he said this with menacing tone  no im not married but he stopped without making his meaning plain im going to leave the country and  wetherford caught him up i reckon i understand what you mean you consider lize and me undersirable parentsnot just the kind youd cut out of the herd of your own free will well thats all right i dont blame you so far as im concerned but you can forget me consider me a dead one ill never bother her nor you  cavanagh threw out an impatient hand it is impossible he protested its better for her and better for me that i should do so ive made up my mind im going back to my own people  wetherford was thoroughly roused now some part of his oldtime fire seemed to return to him he rose from his chair and approached the ranger firmly ive seen you act like a man ross cavanagh youve been a good partner these last few daysa son couldnt have treated me betterand i hate like hell to think ill of you but my girl loves youi could see that i could see her lean to you and ive got to know something else right now youre going to leave hereyoure going to throw her off what i want to know is this do you leave her as good as you found her come now i want an answer as one man to another  cavanaghs eyes met his with firm but sorrowful gaze in the sense in which you mean i leave her as i found her  the old mans open hand shot out toward his rescuer forgive me my lad he said humbly for a minute idoubted you  ross took his hand but slowly replied it will be hard for you to understand when i tell you that i care a great deal for your daughter but a man like mean englishmancannot marryor he ought not to marryto himself alone there are so many others to considerhis friends his sisters  wetherford dropped his hand i see his tone was despairing when i was young we married the girls we loved in defiance of man god or the cupboard but you are not that kind you may be right im nothing but a debilitated old cowpuncher branded by the statea man who threw away his chancebut i can tell you straight ive learned that nothing but the love of a woman counts furthermore and here his fire flashed again id have killed you had you taken advantage of my girl  which would have been your duty declared cavanagh wearily  and in the face of this baffling mood which he felt but could not understand the old man fell silent     xiii  cavanagh asks for help   lee virginia waited with increasing impatience for ross cavanaghs return expecting each noon to see him appear at the door but when three days passed without word or sign from him her uneasiness deepened into alarm the whole town was profoundly excited over the murder that she knew and she began to fear that some of the rangers enemies had worked their evil will upon him  with this vague fear in her heart she went forth into the street to inquire one of the first men she met was sifton who was sitting as usual outside the liverybarn door smiling inefficient content of him she asked have you seen mr cavanagh  yes he answered i saw him yesterday just after dinner down at the postoffice he was writing a letter at the desk almost immediately afterward he mounted and rode away he was much cut up over his chiefs dismissal  why has he not written to me she asked herself and why should he have gone away without a word of greeting explanation or goodbye it would have taken but a moments time to call at the door  the more she dwelt upon this neglect the more significant it became after the tender look in his eyes after the ardent clasp of his hand the thought that he could be so indifferent was at once a source of pain and selfreproach  with childish frankness she went to lize and told her what she had learned her eyes dim with hot tears ross came to town and went away back to his cabin without coming to see me  are you sure hes been here  yes mr sifton saw him go he came in got some letters at the postoffice and then rode away her voice broke as her disappointment and grief overcame her  lize struggled to a sitting position theres some mistake about this ross cavanagh never was the whifflin kind of man youve got to remember hes on duty probably the letter was some order that carried him right back to his work  but if he had really cared he could have ridden by to say just a word but he didnt he went away without a sign after promising to come she buried her face in the coverlet of her mothers bed and wept in childish grief and despair  lize was forced to acknowledge that the rangers action was inexplicable but she did her best to make light of it he may have hurried to town on some errand and hadnt a moment to spare these are exciting days for him remember hell be in tomorrow sure  with a faint hope of this the girl rose and went about her daily tasks but the day passed and another without word or sign of the recreant lover and each day brought a deeper sense of loss but her pride would not permit her to show her grief  young gregg without knowing in the least the cause of her troubled face took this occasion to offer comfort his manner toward her had changed since she no longer had a part in the management of the eatinghouse and for that reason she did not repulse him as sharply as she had been wont to do he really bore cavanagh no illwill and was indeed shrewd enough to understand that lee admired the ranger and that his own courtship was rather hopeless nevertheless he persisted his respect for her growing as he found her steadfast in her refusal to permit any familiarity  see here miss virginia he cried as she was passing him in the hall i can see youre worried about lize i mean your mother and if i can be of any use i hope youll call on me as she thanked him without enthusiasm he added how is she tonight  i think shes better  can i see her  his tone was so earnest that the girl was moved to say ill ask her  i wish you would i want to say something to her  lizes voice reached where they stood come in joe the doors open  he accepted her invitation rather awkwardly but his face was impassive as he looked down upon her  well how about it she asked whats doing in the town  not much of anythingexcept talk the whole country is buzzing over this dismissal of the chief forester  theyd better be doing something about that murder  they are theyre going up there in streams to see where the work was done the coroners inquest was held yesterday he grinned parties came to their death by persons unknown  lize scowled its a wonder they dont charge it up to ross cavanagh or some other ranger  that would be a little too raw even for this country theyre all feeling gay over this change in the forestry head but see here dont you want to get out for a ride ive got my new machine out here it rides like silk  i reckon a hearse is about my kind she replied darkly if you could take me up to cavanaghs cabin id go she added i want to see him  i can take you part way he instantly declared but youd have to ride a horse the last ten miles  couldnt do it joe she sighed these last few days ive been about as boneless as an eel funny the way a fellow keeps going when hes got something to do that has to be done ill tell you what if you want to take me and lee up to sulphur ill go ye  sure thing what day  not for a day or two im not quite up to it just now but by saturday ill be saddlewise again  joe turned joyously to lee that will be great wont you come out for a spin this minute  for a moment lee was tempted anything to get away from this horrible little den and the people who infested it was her feeling but she distrusted gregg and she knew that every eye in the town would be upon her if she went and besides ross might return while she was away no not today she replied finally but her voice was gentler than it had ever been to him  the young fellow was moved to explain his position to lize you dont think much of me and i dont blame you i havent been much use so far but im going to reform if i had a girl like lee virginia to live up to id make a great citizen i dont lay my arrest up against cavanagh im ready to pass that by and as for this other businessthis freerange war in which the old man is mixed upi want you to know that im against it dad knows his day is short thats what makes him so hot but hes a bluffjust a fussy old bluff he knows he has no more right to the government grass than anybody else but hes going to get ahead of the cattlemen if he can  does he know who burned them sheepherders  of course he knows but aint going to say so you see that old basque who was killed was a monopolist too he went after that grass without asking anybodys leave moreover he belonged to that mexicandago outfit that everybody hates the old man isnt crying over that job its money in his pocket all the same its too good a chance to put the hooks into the cattlemen hence his offering a reward and it looks as if something would really be done this time they say neill ballard was mixed up in it and that old guy that showed me the sheep but i dont take much stock in that whoever did it was paid by the cattlemen sure thing the young fellows tone and bearing made a favorable impression upon lize she had never seen this side of him for the reason that he had hitherto treated her as a bartender she was acute enough to understand that her social status had changed along with her release from the cashregister and she was slightly more reconciled although she could not see her way to providing a living for herself and lee for all these reasons she was unwontedly civil to joe and sent him away highly elated with the success of his interview  im going to let him take us up to sulphur she said to lee i want to go to town  lee was silent but a keen pang ran through her heart for she perceived in this remark by her mother a tacit acknowledgment of ross cavanaghs desertion of them both his invitation to them to come and camp with him was only a polite momentary impulse im ready to go she announced at last im tired of this place let us go tomorrow  on the following morning while they were busy packing for this journey redfield rolled up to the door in company with a young man in the uniform of a forester  go ask reddy to come in commanded lize i want to see him  redfield met the girl at the door and presented his companion as mr dalton district forester dalton was a tall young fellow with a marked southern accent is cavanagh the ranger in town he asked  no lee replied with effort he was here a few days ago but hes gone back to the forest  redfield studied the girl with keen gaze perceiving a passionate restraint in her face  how is your mother he asked politely  lee smiled faintly shes able to sit up wont you come in and see her  with pleasure assented redfield but i want to see you alone i have something to say to you he turned to his superior just go into the café dalton ill see you in a moment  lee virginia hitherto ashamed of the house the furniture the bedeverythingled the way without a word of apology it was all detached now something about to be left behind like a bad garment borrowed in a time of stress nothing mattered since ross did not return  lize looking unwontedly refined and gentle was sitting in a big rockingchair with her feet on a stool her eyes fixed on the mountains which showed through the open window all the morning a sense of profound change of something passing had oppressed her now that she was about to leave the valley its charm appealed to her she was tearing up a multitude of tiny roots of whose existence she had hitherto remained unaware i belong here she acknowledged silently id be homesick anywhere else on gods earth its rough and flybit and all that but so am i i wouldnt fit in anywhere that lee belonged  she acknowledged an especial liking for redfield and she had penetration enough worldly wisdom enough to know that lee belonged more to his world than to her own and that his guidance and friendship were worth more much more than that of all the rest of the country her own included therefore she said im mighty glad to see you reddy sit down youve got to hear my little spiel this time  redfield perched on the edge of a tawdry chair looked about like the charity visitor in a slum kitchen without intending to express disgust but it was a dismal room in which to be sick and he pitied the woman the more profoundly as he remembered her in the days when all outdoors was none too wide for her  lize began abruptly im down but not out in fact i was coming up to see you this afternoon lee and i are just about pulling out for good  indeed why not go back with me  you can take the girl back if you want to but now that im getting my chance at you i may not go  redfields tone was entirely cordial as he turned to lee i came hoping to carry you away will you come  im afraid i cant unless mother goes she replied sadly  lize waved an imperative hand fade away child i want to talk with mr redfield alone go see  thus dismissed lee went back to the restaurant where she found the forester just sitting down to his luncheon mr redfield will be out in a few minutes she explained  wont you join me he asked in the frank accent of one to whom women are comrades the supervisor has been telling me about you  she took a seat facing him feeling something refined in his long smoothly shaven boyish face he seemed very young to be district forester and his eyes were a soft brown with small wrinkles of laughter playing round their corners  he began at once on the subject of his visit redfield tells me you are a friend of mr cavanaghs did you know that he had resigned  she faced him with startled eyes no indeed has he done so  yes the supervisor got a letter yesterday enclosing his resignation and asking to be relieved at once and when i heard of it i asked the supervisor to bring me down to see him hes too good a man to lose  why did he resign  he seemed very bitter over the chiefs dismissal but i hope to persuade him to stay in the service hes too valuable a man to lose just now when the war is so hot i realize that his salary is too small but there are other places for him perhaps when he knows that i have a special note to him from the chief he will reconsider hes quite capable of the supervisors position and mr redfield is willing to resign in his favor im telling you all this because mr redfield has told me of your interest in mr cavanaghor rather his interest in you  sam gregg entering the door at this moment came directly to the foresters table he was followed by the sheriff a bearded old man with a soiled collar and a dim eye  gregg growled out youd better keep your man cavanagh in the hills mr forester or somebody will take a potshot at him  why whats new  his assistant is down with smallpox  smallpox exclaimed dalton  every jaw was fixed and every eye turned upon the speaker  smallpox gasped lee  gregg resumed enjoying the sensation he was creating yes that basque herder of minethe one up near black toothsent word he was sick so i hunted up an old tramp by the name of edwards to take his place edwards found the dago dying of pox and skipped out over the range leaving him to die alone cavanagh went up and found the dago dead and took care of himresult is hes full of germs and has brought his apprentice down with it and both of em must be quarantined right where they are  good heavens man exclaimed dalton this is serious business are you sure its smallpox  one of my men came from there last night i was there myself on monday so was the deputy the sheriff missed tom this morning but i reached him by phone and cavanagh admitted to us that the basque died of smallpox and that he buried him with his own hands  the sheriff spoke up the criminal part of it is this mr dalton cavanagh didnt report the case when he came down here just went about leaving a trail of poison why didnt he report it he should be arrested  wait a moment said dalton perhaps it wasnt pox perhaps it was only mountainfever cavanagh is not the kind of man to involve others in a pestilence i reckon he knew it was nothing but a fever and not wishing to alarm his friends he just slid into town and out again  a flash of light of heat of joy went through lees heart as she listened to daltons defence of cavanagh that was the reason why he rode away she thought he was afraid of bringing harm to us and this conviction lighted her face with a smile even while the forester continued his supposition by saying of course proper precautions should be taken and as we are going up there the supervisor and i will see that a quarantine is established if we find it necessary  gregg was not satisfied cavanagh admitted to the deputy and to me that he believed the case to be smallpox and said that he had destroyed the camp and everything connected with it except the horse and the dog and yet he comes down here infectin everybody he meets he turned to lee youd better burn the bed he slept on hes left a trail of germs wherever he went i say the man is criminally liable and should be jailed if he lives to get back to town  lees mind was off now on another tangent suppose it is true she asked herself suppose he has fallen sick away up there miles and miles from any nurse or doctor  theres something queer about the whole business pursued gregg for instance who is this assistant hes got johnson said there was an old man in ranger uniform potterin round why didnt he send word by him why did he let me come to the door he might have involved me in the disease i tell you if you dont take care of him the people of the county will  the forester looked grave if he knew it was pox and failed to report it he certainly did wrong but you say he took care of this poor shepherdnursed him till he died and buried him taking all precautionsyou cant complain of that can you thats the act of a good ranger and a brave man you wouldnt have done it he ended addressing gregg sickness up there two full miles above sealevel is quite a different proposition from sickness in sulphur city or the fork i shall not condemn mr cavanagh till i hear his side of the story  lee turned a grateful glance upon him you must be right i dont believe mr cavanagh would deceive any one  well well soon know the truth said dalton for im going up there if the ranger has been exposed he must not be left alone  he aint alone declared the sheriff tom phoned me that he had an assistant  swenson i suppose said redfield who entered at this moment swenson is his assistant  i didnt see him myself gregg continued but i understood the deputy to say that he was an old man  swenson is a young man corrected redfield  the sheriff insisted tom said it was an old mana stranger to himtall smoothshaven not very strong he saidpeared to be a cook he had helped nurse the dago so tom said  thats very curious mused redfield there isnt an old man in the service of this forest theres a mistake somewhere  well concluded gregg thats what he said i thought at first it might be that old hobo edwards but this feller being in uniform and smoothshaven his face changed his voice deepened say by the lord i believe it was edwards and furthermore edwards is the convict that texas marshal was after the other day and this man cavanaghyour prize rangeris harborin him  what nonsense exclaimed redfield  the sheriff banged his hand upon the table thats the whole mystery i see it all now hes up there concealing this man hes given out this smallpox scare just to keep the officers away from him now youve got it  the thunder in his voice drew toward him all those who remained in the diningroom and lee found herself ringed about by a dozen excited men but she did not flinch she was too deeply concerned over cavanaghs fate to be afraid and besides redfield and the forester were beside her  the supervisor was staggered by greggs accusation and by certain confirmatory facts in his own possession but he defended cavanagh bravely youre crazy he replied why should ross do such a foolish thing what is his motive what interest would he have in this man edwards whom you call a tramp he cant be a relative and certainly not a friend of cavanaghs for you say he is a convict come now your hatred of cavanagh has gone too far  gregg was somewhat cooled by this dash of reason but replied i dont know what relation he is but these are facts hes concealing an escaped convict and he knows it  dalton put in a quiet word what is the use of shouting a judgment against a man like cavanagh before you know the facts hes one of the best and ablest rangers on this forest i dont know why he has resigned but im sure  has he resigned asked gregg eagerly  he has  a damn good job for him i was about to circulate a petition to have him removed  if all the stockmen in the valley had signed a petition against him it wouldnt have done any good replied dalton we know a good man when we see him im here to offer him promotion not to punish him  lee looking about at the faces of these men and seeing disappointment in their faces lost the keen sting of her own humiliation in the midst of such a fight as this how can he give time or thought to me painful as the admission was she was forced to admit that she was a very humble factor in a very large campaign but suppose he falls ill her face grew white and set and her lips bitter that would be the final tragic touch she thought to have him come down of a plague from nursing one of sam greggs sheepherders aloud she said his resignation comes just in time doesnt it he can now be sick without loss to the service  dalton answered her the supervisor has not accepted his resignation on the contrary i shall offer him a higher position his career as a forester is only beginning he would be foolish to give up the work now when the avenues of promotion are just opening i can offer him very soon the supervision of a forest  as they talked lee felt herself sinking the while her lover rose it was all true the forester was right ross was capable of any work they might demand of him he was too skilled too intelligent too manly to remain in the forest heroic as its duties seemed  upon this discussion lize hobbling painfully appeared with a cry of surprise lee rose to meet her  mother you must not do this  she waved her away im all right she said barring the big marbles in my slippers then she turned to dalton now whats it all about is it true that ross is down  no so far as we know he is well  well im going to find out i dont intend to set here and have him up there without a cook or a nurse  at this moment a tall fair young fellow dressed in a rangers uniform entered the room and made his way directly to the spot where lee her mother and redfield were standing mr supervisor cavanagh has sent me to tell you that he needs a doctor hes got a sick man up at the station and hes afraid its a case of smallpox he turned to lee he told me to tell you that he would have written only he was afraid to even send a letter out  what does he need asked redfield  he needs medicine and food a doctor and he ought to have a nurse  thats my job said lize  nonsense said redfield youre not fit to ride a mile i wont hear of your going  you wait and see im goin and you cant stop me  who is the man with him asked the forester  i dont know an old herder he said he said he could take care of him all right for the present but that if he were taken down himself  lees mounting emotion broke from her in a little cry oh mr redfield please let me go too i want to helpi must help  redfield said ill telephone to sulphur city and ask brooks to get a nurse and come down as soon as possible meanwhile ill go out to see what the conditions are  im going too i tell you announced lize ive had the cussed disease and im not afraid of it we had three sieges of it in my family you get me up there and ill do the rest  but you are ill  i was but im not now her voice was firmer than it had been for days all i needed was something to do ross cavanagh has been like a son to me for two years hes the one man in this country id turn my hand over forbarrin yourself reddyand its my job to see him through this pinch  in spite of all opposition she had her way returning to her room to get such clothing as she needed for her stay in the hills she waited for redfield to send a carriage to her i cant ride a horse no more she sorrowfully admitted  lees secret was no secret to any one there her wide eyes and heaving breast testified to the profound stir in her heart she was in an anguish of fear lest ross should already be in the grip of his loathsome enemy that it had come to him by way of a brave and noble act only made the situation the more tragic     xiv  the pesthouse   cavanagh had kept a keen watch over wetherford and when one night the old man began to complain of the ache in his bones his decision was instant  youve got it he said its up to us to move down the valley tomorrow  wetherford protested that he would as soon die in the hills as in the valley i dont want lee virginia to know but if i seem liable to fade out id like lize to be told that i didnt forget her and that i came back to find out how she was i hate to be a nuisance to you and so ill go down the valley if you say so  as he was about to turn in that night ross heard a horse cross the bridge and with intent to warn the rider of his danger went to the door and called out halt whos there  a friend replied the stranger in a weak voice  ross permitted his visitor to ride up to the pole i cant ask you in he explained ive a sick man inside who are you and what can i do for you  notwithstanding this warning the rider dropped from his saddle and came into the light which streamed from the door  my name is dunn he began im from deer creek  i know you responded the ranger youre that rancher i saw working in the ditch the day i went to telephone and youve come to tell me something about that murder  the other man broke into a whimper im a lawabiding man mr cavanagh he began tremulously ive always kept the law and never intended to have anything to do with that business i was dragged into it against my will ive come to you because youre an officer of the federal law you dont belong here i trust you you represent the president and i want to tell you what i knowonly i want you to promise not to bring me into it im a man of a family and i cant bear to have them know the truth  there was deep agitation and complete sincerity in the ranchers choked and hesitant utterance and cavanagh turned cold with a premonition of what he was about to disclose i am not an officer of the law mr dunn not in the sense you mean but i will respect your wishes  i know that you are not an officer of the county law but youre not a cattleman it is your business to keep the peace in the wild country and you do it everybody knows that but i cant trust the officers of this country theyre all afraid of the cowboys youre not afraid and you represent the united states and ill tell you i cant bear it any longer he wailed i must tell somebody i cant sleep and i cant eat ive been like a man in a nightmare ever since i had no hand in the killingi didnt even see it done but i knew it was going to happen i saw the committee appointed the meeting that decided it was held in my barn but i didnt know what they intended to do you believe me dont you he peered up at cavanagh with white face and wild eyes  go on replied the ranger ill protect youif i can go on its your dutytell all you know  the troubled man after a little silence resumed sometimes i feel that id be happier in jail than i am walking about in the sunshine i never dreamed civilized men could do such deeds i thought they were only going to scare the herders and drive them out as theyve done so many times before i can see now that they used my barn for a meetingplace because everybody believed me to be a man of peace and i am im over seventy years of age mr cavanagh and ive been a lawabiding citizen all my life  his mind shattered by the weight of his ghastly secret was in confusion and perceiving this cavanagh began to question him gently one by one he procured the names of those who voted to deal with the herders one by one he obtained also the list of those named on the committee of reprisal and as the broken man delivered himself of these accusing facts he grew calmer i didnt knowi couldnt believethat the men on that committee could chop and burn his utterance failed him again and he fell silent abruptly  they must have been drunkmad drunk retorted cavanagh and yet who would believe that even drink could inflame white men to such devils work when did you first know what had been done  that night after it was done one of the men my neighbor who was drawn on the committee came to my house and asked me to give him a bed he was afraid to go home i cant face my wife and children he said he told me what hed seen and then when i remembered that it had all been decided in my stable and the committee appointed there i began to tremble you believe im telling the truth dont you he again asked with piteous accent  yes i believe you you must tell this story to the judge it will end the reign of the cattlemen  oh no i cant do that  you must do that it is your duty as a christian man and citizen  no no ill stay and help youill do anything but that im afraid to tell what i know they would burn me alive im not a western man ive never been in a criminal court i dont belong to this wild country i came out here because my daughter is not strong and now he broke down altogether and leaning against his horses side sobbed pitifully  cavanagh convinced that the old mans mind was too deeply affected to enable him to find his way back over the rough trail that night spoke to him gently ill get you something to eat he said sit down here and rest and compose yourself  wetherford turned a wild eye on the ranger as he reentered whos out there he asked is it the marshal  no its only one of the ranchers from below hes tired and hungry and im going to feed him ross replied filled with a vivid sense of the diverse characters of the two men he was serving  dunn received the food with an eager hand and after he had finished his refreshment cavanagh remarked the whole country should be obliged to you for your visit to me i shall send your information to supervisor redfield  dont use my name he begged they will kill me if they find out that i have told we were all sworn to secrecy and if i had not seen that firethat pile of bodies  i know i know it horrified me it made me doubt humanity responded cavanagh we of the north cry out against the south for lynching black rapers but here under our eyes goes on an equally horrible display of rage over the mere question of temporary advantage over the appropriation of free grass which is a federal resourcesomething which belongs neither to one claimant nor to the other but to the people and should be of value to the people there is some excuse for shooting and burning a man who violates a woman but what shall we say of those who kill and dismember men over the possession of a plot of grass you must bring these men to punishment  dunn could only shiver in his horror and repeat his fear theyll kill me if i do  cavanagh at last said you must not attempt to ride back tonight i cant give you lodging in the cabin because my patient is sick of smallpox but you can camp in the barn till morning then ride straight back to my friend redfield and tell him what youve told me he will see that you are protected make your deposition and leave the country if you are afraid to remain  in the end the rancher promised to do this but his tone was that of a broken and distraught dotard all the landmarks of his life seemed suddenly shifted all the standards of his life hitherto orderly and fixed were now confused and whirling and cavanagh understanding something of his plight pitied him profoundly it was of a piece with this ironic story that the innocent man should suffer madness and the guilty go calmly about their business of grazing their cattle on the stolen grass  meanwhile the sufferings of his other patient were increasing and he was forced to give up all hope of getting him down the trail next morning and when swenson the forest guard from the south fork knocked at the door to say that he had been to the valley and that the doctor was coming up with redfield and the district forester ross thanked him but ordered him to go into camp across the river and to warn everybody to keep clear of the cabin put your packages down outside the door he added and take charge of the situation on the outside ill take care of the business inside  wetherford was in great pain but the poison of the disease had misted his brain and he no longer worried over the possible disclosure of his identity at times he lost the sense of his surroundings and talked of his prison life or of the long ride northward once he rose in his bed to beat off the wolves which he said were attacking his pony  he was a piteous figure as he struggled thus and it needed neither his relationship to lee nor his bravery in caring for the basque herder to fill the rangers heart with a desire to relieve his suffering perhaps i should have sent for lize at once he mused as the light brought out the red signatures of the plague  once the old man looked up with wide dark unseeing eyes and murmured i dont seem to know you  im a friendmy name is cavanagh  i cant place you he sadly admitted i feel pretty bad if i ever get out of this place im going back to the fork ill get a goldmine then ill go back and make up for what lize has gone through im afraid to go back now  all right ross soothingly agreed but youll have to keep quiet till you get over this fever youre suffering from  if lize werent so far away shed come and nurse meim pretty sick this stonecuttingthis inside work is hell on an old cowpuncher like me  swenson came back to say that probably redfield and the doctor would reach the station by noon and thereafter for the reason that cavanagh expected their coming the hours dragged wofully it was after one oclock before swenson announced that two teams were coming with three men and two women in them theyll be here in half an hour  the rangers heart leaped two women could one of them be lee virginia what follywhat sweet desperate folly and the othershe could not be lizefor lize was too feeble to ride so far stop them on the other side of the bridge he commanded dont let them cross the creek on any pretext  as he stood in the door the flutter of a handkerchief the waving of a hand made his pulses glow and his eyes grow dim it was virginia  lize did not flutter a kerchief or wave a hand but when swenson stopped the carriage at the bridge she said no you dont im going across im going to see ross and if he needs help im going to roll up my sleeves and take hold  cavanagh saw her advancing and as she came near enough for his voice to reach her he called out dont come any closer stop i tell you his voice was stern you must not come a step nearer go back across the deadline and stay there no one but the doctor shall enter this door now thats final  i want to help she protested  i know you do but i wont have it this quarantine is real and it goes  but suppose you yourself get sick  well cross that bridge when we get to it im all right so far and ill call for help when i need it  his tone was imperative and she obeyed grumbling about his youth and the value of his life to the service  thats all very nice he replied but im in it and i dont intend to expose you or any one else to the contagion  ive had it once she asserted  he looked at her and smiled in recognition of her subterfuge  no matter youre ailing and might take it again so toddle back its mighty good of you and of lee to comebut there isnt a thing you can do and heres the doctor he added as he recognized the young student who passed for a physician in the fork he was a beardless youth of small experience and no great courage and as he approached with hesitant feet he asked  are you sure its smallpox  cavanagh smiled the indications are all that way that last importation of basques brought it probably from the steerage of the ship im told theyve had several cases over in the basin  have you been vaccinated  yes when i was in the army  then youre all right  i hope so  there was a certain comic relief in this longdistance diagnosing of a case by a boy and yet the tragic fact beneath it all was that wetherford was dying a broken and dishonored husband and father and that his identity must be concealed from his wife and daughter who were much more deeply concerned over the ranger than over the desperate condition of his patient and this must continue to be so cavanagh decided and as he stood there looking toward the girls fair figure on the bridge he came to the final fixed determination never to speak one word or make a sign that might lead to the dying mans identification of what use is it he asked himself why should even lize be made to suffer wetherfords poor misspent life is already over for her and for lee he is only a dim memory  redfield came near enough to see that the rangers face though tired showed no sign of illness and was relieved who is this old herder he asked hasnt he any relatives in the country  he came from texas so he said youre not coming in he broke off to say to the young physician whom lize had shamed into returning to the cabin  i suppose ill have to he protested weakly  i dont see the need of it the whole place reeks of the poison and you might carry it away with you unless you insist on coming in and are sure you can prevent further contagion i shall oppose your entrance you are in the company of othersi must consider their welfare  the young fellow was relieved well so long as we know what it is i can prescribe just as well right here he said and gave directions for the treatment which the ranger agreed to carry out  i tried to bring a nurse explained redfield but i couldnt find anybody but old lize who would come  i dont blame them replied ross it isnt a nice job even when youve got all the conveniences  his eyes as he spoke were on the figure of lee who still stood on the bridge awed and worshipful barred of approach by lize she shall not know he silently vowed why put her through useless suffering and shame edward wetherfords disordered life is near its end to betray him to his wife and daughter would be but the reopening of an old wound  he was stirred to the centre of his heart by the coming of lee virginia so sweet and brave and trustful his stern mood melted as he watched her there waiting with her face turned toward him longing to help she would have come alone if necessary he declared with a fuller revelation of the selfsacrificing depth of her love and she would come to my side this moment if i called her  to the district forester he said no more than to redfield edwards is evidently an old soldier he declared he was sent up here by gregg to take the place of a sick herder he took care of that poor herder till he died and then helped me to bury him now here he lies a victim to his own sense of duty and i shall not desert him and to himself he added nor betray him  he went back to his repulsive service sustained and soothed by the little camp of faithful friends on the other side of the stream the tender grace of the girls attitude her air of waiting of anxiety of readiness to serve made him question the basis of his family pride he recognized in her the spirit of her sire tempered sweetened made more stable by something drawn from unknown sources at the moment he felt that lee was not merely his equal but his superior in purity of character and in purpose what nonsense we talk of heredity of family he thought  standing over the wasted body of his patient he asked again why let even lize know to her ed wetherford is dead she remembers him now as a young dashing powerful horseman a splendid animal a picturesque lover why wring her heart by permitting her to see this wreck of what was once her pride  as for wetherford himself nothing mattered very much he spoke of the past now and then but not in the phrase of one who longs for the return of happy daysrather in the voice of one who murmurs a halfforgotten song he called no more for his wife and child and if he had done so cavanagh would have reasoned that the call arose out of weakness and that his better self his real self would still desire to shield his secret from his daughter  and this was true for during one of his clearest moments wetherford repeated his wish to die a stranger im goin out like the oldtime west a rag of what i once was dont let them knowput no name over mejust say an old cowpuncher lies here  cavanaghs attempt to change his hopeless tone proved unavailing enfeebled by his hardships and his prison life he had little reserve force upon which to draw in fighting such an enemy he sank soon after this little speech into a coma which continued to hold him in its unbroken grasp as night fell  meantime seeing no chance of aiding the ranger redfield and the forester prepared to return but lee reinforced by her mother refused to accompany them i shall stay here she said till he is safely out of ittill i know that he is beyond all danger  redfield did not urge her to return as vigorously as dalton expected him to do but when he understood the girls desire to be near her lover he took off his hat and bowed to her you are entirely in the right he said here is where you belong  redfield honored lize for her sympathetic support of her daughters resolution and expressed his belief that ross would escape the plague i feel that his splendid vigor combined with the mountain air will carry him througheven if he should prove not to be immune i shall run up again day after tomorrow i shall be very anxious what a nuisance that the telephoneline is not extended to this point ross has been insisting on its value for months  lee saw the doctor go with some dismay young as he was he was at least a reed to cling to in case the grisly terror seized upon the ranger mr redfield cant you send a real doctor it seems so horrible to be left here without instructions  the forester before going again besought cavanagh not to abandon his work in the forestry service and intimated that at the proper time advancement would be offered him the whole policy is but beginning said he and a practical ranger with your experience and education will prove of greatest value  to this ross made reply at the moment i feel that no promise of advancement could keep me in this country of grafters poachers and assassins im weary of it and all it stands for however if i could aid in extending the supervision of the public ranges and in stopping forever this murder and burning that goes on outside the forestry domain i might remain in the west  would you accept the supervisorship of the washakie forest demanded dalton  taken by surprise he stammered i might but am i the man  you are your experience fits you for a position where the fight is hot the washakie forest is even more a bone of contention than this we have laid out the lines of division between the sheep and the cows and it will take a man to enforce our regulations you will have the support of the best citizens they will all rally with you as leader and so end the warfare there  it can never end till uncle sam puts rangers over every section of public lands and lays out the grazing lines as we have done in this forest retorted cavanagh  i know but to get that requires a revolution in the whole order of things then his fine young face lighted up but well get it public sentiment is coming our way the old order is already so eaten away that only its shell remains  it may be if these assassins are punished i shall feel hopeful of the change  i shall recommend you for the supervisorship of the washakie forest concluded dalton decisively and so goodbye and goodluck  england his blood relatives even the redfields seemed very remote to the ranger as he stood in his door that night and watched the sparkle of swensons campfire through the trees with the realization that there waited a brave girl of the type that loves singleheartedly ready to sacrifice everything to the welfare of her idealized subject he felt unworthy selfish vain  if i should fall sick she would insist on nursing me for her sake i must give swenson the most rigid orders not to allow herno matter what happensto approach i will not have her touched by this thing  beside the blaze lee and her mother sat for the most part in silence with nothing to do but to wait the issue of the struggle going on in the cabin so near and yet so inaccessible to their will it was as if a magic wall crystalclear yet impenetrable shut them away from the man whose quiet heroism was the subject of their constant thought  to the girl this ride up into her lovers world had been both exalting and awesomenot merely because the rough and precipitous road took her closer to her lover while placing her farther from medical aid but also because it was so vast a world so unpeopled and so beautiful  it was marvellous as the dusk fell and the air nipped keen to see how lize wetherford renewed her youth the excitement seemed to have given her a fresh hold on life she was wearied but by no means weakened by her ride and ate heartily of the rude fare which swenson set before her this is what i needed she exultantly said the open air and these trout i feel ten years younger already manys the night ive camped on the range with your father with nothing but a purptent to cover us both and the wolves howling round us id feel pretty fairly gay if it werent for ross over there in that cabin playin nurse and cook all by his lonesomeness  lee expressed a deep satisfaction from the fact of their nearness if he is ill we can help him she reiterated  she had put behind her all the doubt and fear which his abrupt desertion of her had caused and though he had not been able to speak a word to her his selfsacrifice had made amends she excused it all as part of his anxious care whatever the mood of that other day had been it had given way to one that was lofty and deeply altruistic her one anxiety now was born of a deepening sense of his danger but against this she bent the full strength of her will he shall not die she declared beneath her breath god will not permit it  there was a touch of frost in the air as they went to their beds and though she shivered lize was undismayed theres nothing the matter with my heart she exulted i dont believe there was anything really serious the matter with me anyway i reckon i was just naturally grouchy and worried over you and ross  lee virginia was now living a romance stranger and more startling than any she had ever read in imagination she was able to look back and down upon the fork as if she had been carried into another worlda world that was at once primeval yet peaceful a world of dreaming trees singing streams and silent peaks a realm in which law and order reigned maintained by one determined young man whose power was derived from the president himself she felt safeentirely safefor just across the roaring mountain torrent the two intrepid guardians of the forest were encamped one of them it is true came of swedish parentage and the other was a native of england but they were both american in the high sense of being loyal to the federal will and she trusted them more unquestioningly than any other men in all that west save only redfield she had no doubt there were others equally loyal equally to be trusted but she did not know them  she rose to a complete understanding of cavanaghs love for the high country and his enthusiasm for the cause a cause which was able to bring together the student from yale and the graduates of bergen and of oxford and make them comrades in preserving the trees and streams of the mountain states against the encroachments of some of their own citizens who were openly shortsightedly and cynically bent upon destruction spoliation and misuse  she had listened to the talk of the forester and the supervisor and she had learned from them that cavanagh was sure of swift advancement now that he had shown his courage and his skill and the thought that he might leave the state to take charge of another forest brought her some uneasiness for she and lize had planned to go to sulphur city she had consented to this because it still left to her the possibility of occasionally seeing or hearing from cavanagh but the thought that he might go away altogether took some of the music out of the sound of the stream and made the future vaguely sad     xv  wetherford passes on   for the next two days cavanagh slept but little for his patient grew steadily worse as the flame of his fever mounted wetherford pleaded for air the ranger threw open the doors admitting freely the cool sweet mountain wind he might as well die of a draught as smother was his thought and by the use of cold cloths he tried to allay the itching and the pain  what i am doing may be all wrong he admitted to swenson who came often to lean upon the hitchingpole and offer aid i have had no training as a nurse but i must be doing something the man is burning up and hasnt much vitality to spare i knew a ranger had to be all kinds of things cowboy horsedoctor axeman carpenter surveyor and all the rest of it but i didnt know that he had to be a trained nurse in addition  how do you feel yourself asked his subordinate anxiously  just tired nothing more i reckon i am going to escape i should be immune but you never can tell the effect of vaccination wears off after a few years  the women folks over there are terribly worried and the old lady has made me promise to call her in if you show the slightest signs of coming down  tell her to rest easy i am keeping mighty close watch over myself and another night will tell the story so far as the old man is concerned i wish i had a real doctor but i dont expect any it is a long hard climb up here for one of those tenderfeet  he returned to his charge and swenson walked slowly away back to the camp oppressed with the sense of his utter helplessness  again and again during the day lee virginia went to the middle of the bridge which was the deadline and there stood to catch some sign some wave of the hand from her lover strange courtship and yet hour by hour the tie which bound these young souls together was strengthened she cooked for him in the intervals of her watch and sent small pencilled notes to him together with the fish and potatoes but no scrap of paper came back to herso scrupulous was cavanagh to spare her from the faintest shadow of danger  swenson brought verbal messages it was true but they were by no means tender for cavanagh knew better than to intrust any fragile vessel of sentiment to this stalwart young woodsman now that lee knew the mysterious old man was dying she longed for his releasefor his release would mean her lovers release she did not stop to think that it would be long very long before she could touch cavanaghs hand or even speak with him face to face at times under swensons plain speaking she grew faint with the horror of the struggle which was going on in that silent cabin  this leprous plague this offspring of crowded and dirty tenements and of foul shipsteerages seemed doubly unholy here in the clean sanity of the hills it was a profanation a hideous curse if it should seize upon ross words failed to express her horror her hate of it oh god save him she prayed a hundred times each day  twice in the night she rose from her bed to listen to make sure that cavanagh was not calling for help the last time she looked out a white veil of frost lay on the grass and the faint light of morning was in the east and in the exquisite clarity of the air in the serene hush of the dawn the pestilence appeared but as the ugly emanation of disordered sleep the door of the rangers cabin stood open but all was silent he is snatching a halfhours sleep she decided  if the guard had carried in his mind the faintest intention of permitting lize to go to cavanaghs aid that intention came to no issue for with the coming of the third night wetherford was unconscious and unrecognizable to any one who had known him in the days of the free range lithe daredevil in those days expert with rope and gun he was as far from this scarred and swollen body as the soaring eagle is from the carrion which he sees and scorns  he was going as the wild west was going discredited ulcerated poisoned incapable of rebirth yet carrying something fine to his grave he had acted the part of a brave man that shall be said of him he had gone to the rescue of the poor basque instinctively with the same reckless disregard of consequences to himself which marked his character when as a cowboss on the range he had set aside the most difficult tasks for his own rope or gun his regard for the ranger into whose care he was now about to commit his wife and daughter persisted in spite of his suffering in him was his hope his stay once again in a lucid moment he reverted to the promise which he had drawn from cavanagh  if i go you must take careof my girltake care of lize too promise me that do you promise he insisted  i promiseon honor ross repeated and with a faint pressure of his hand so slender and weak wetherford sank away into the drowse which deepened hour by hour broken now and then by convulsions which wrung the stern heart of the ranger till his hands trembled for pity  all day while the clouds sailed by white as snow and dazzlingly pure while the stream roared with joy of exploration and the sunshine fell in dazzling floods upon the world the ranger bent above his ward or walked the floor of his cabin marvelling that the air and light of this high place should be so powerless to check the march of that relentless plague it seemed that to open the doors to fill the room with radiance must surely kill the mutinous motes which warred upon the tortured body but in the midst of natures sovereign charm the reek of the conflict went up and he wondered whether even the vigor which his outdoor life had built up could withstand the strain another day  once lee virginia approached close enough to hear his voice as he warned her to go back you can do nothing he called to her please go away his face was haggard with weariness and her heart filled with bitter resentment to think that this repulsive warfare this painful duty should be thrust upon one so fine  he himself felt as though his youth were vanishing and that in these few days he had entered upon the sober carefilled years of middle life the one sustaining thought his one allurement lay in the near presence of the girl to whom he could call but could not utter one tender word she was there where he could see her watching waiting at the bridge the sound of the water helps me bear the suspense she said to swenson and the occasional sight of her lover the knowledge that he was still unbroken kept her from despair  the day was well advanced when the sound of rattling pebbles on the hill back of his cabin drew his attention and a few moments later a man on a weary horse rode up to his door and dropped heavily from the saddle he was a small dark individual with spectacles plainly of the city  beware smallpox called ross as his visitor drew near the door  the newcomer waved his hand contemptuously ive had it are you ross cavanagh  i am  my name is hartley i represent the denver roundup im interested in this sheepherder killingmerely as a reporter he added with a fleeting smile did you know old man dunn of deer creek had committed suicide  cavanagh started and his face set no  they found him shot through the neck and dyingthis morning as he was gasping his last breath he said the ranger knows and when they asked what ranger he said cavanagh when i heard that i jumped a horse and beat em all over here is this true did he tell you who the murderers are  cavanagh did not answer at once he was like a man caught on a swaying bridge and his first instinct was to catch the swing to get his balance wait a minute what is it all to you  again that peculiar grin lighted the small mans dark unwholesome face its a fine detective stunt and besides it means twenty dollars per column and mebbe a boost i cant wait you cant wait its up to us to strike now if these men knew you have their names theyd hike for texas or the high seas come now everybody tells me youre one of these idealistic highbrow rangers who care more for the future of the west than most naturalborn westerners whats your plan if youll yoke up with me well run these devils into the earth and win great fame and youll be doing the whole country a service  the ranger studied the small figure before him with penetrating gaze there was deliberative fearlessness in the strangers face and eyes and notwithstanding his calm almost languid movement restless energy could be detected in his voice  what is your plan the ranger asked  get ourselves deputized by the court and jump these men before they realize that theres anything doing they count the whole country on their side but theyre mistaken theyve outdone themselves this time and a tremendous reaction has set in everybody knows youve held an even hand over these warring picts and scots and the court will be glad to deputize you to bring them to justice the old sheriff is paralyzed everybody knows that the assassins are prominent cattleranchers and yet no one dares move its up to you fellows who represent law and order to act quick  cavanagh followed him with complete comprehension and a desire to carry out the plan seized upon him  id do it if i could he said but it happens i am nursing a sick man i am perhaps already exposed to the same disease i cant leave here for a week or more it would not be right for me to expose others  dont worry about that take a hot bath fumigate your clothing shave your head ill fix you up and ill get some one to take your place catching sight of swenson and lize on the bridge he asked who are those people cant they take your nursing job  no answered cavanagh bluntly its no use i cant join you in thisat least not now  but youll give me the names which dunn gave you  no i cant do that i shall tell the supervisor and he can act as he sees fitfor the present im locked up here  the other man looked the disappointment he felt im sorry you dont feel like opening up you know perfectly well that nothing will ever be done about this thing unless the press insists upon it its up to you and me me representing the conscience of the easthere he winked an eyeand you federal authority to do what we can to bring these men to their punishment better reconsider im speaking now as a citizen as well as a reporter  there was much truth in what he said but cavanagh refused to go further in the matter until he had consulted with redfield  very well replied hartley thats settled bytheway who is your patient  eloquently concisely ross told the story just a poor old mounted hobo a survival of the cowboy west he said but he had the heart of a hero in him and im doing my best to save him  keep him in the dark thats the latest theoryor under a red light white light brings out the ulcers  he hates darkness thats one reason why ive opened the doors and windows  all wrong according to finsen he wouldnt pit in the dark however it doesnt matter on a cowboy youve a great story yourself theres a fine situation here which ill play up if you dont object  cavanagh smiled would my objection have any weight  the reporter laughed not much ive got to carry back some sort of game well so long i must hit the trail over the hill  cavanagh made civil answer and returned to his patient more than half convinced that hartley was right the power of the press might prove to be a very real force in this pursuit  as the journalist was about to mount his horse he discovered lee virginia on the other side of the creek hello said he i wonder what this pretty maiden means and dropping his bridlerein again he walked down to the bridge  swenson interposed his tall figure what do you want he asked bluntly you dont want to get too close youve been talking to the ranger  hartley studied him coolly are you a ranger too  no only a guard  why are you leaving cavanagh to play it alone in there  lee explained he wont let any of us come near him  quite right retorted hartley promptly they say smallpox has lost its terrors but when youre eight hours hard trail from a doctor or a hospital its still what id call a formidable enemy however cavanaghs immune so he says  we dont know that lee said and her hands came together in a spasm of fear are you a doctor  no im only a newspaper man but ive had a lot of experience with plagues of all sortshad the yellow fever in porto rico and the typhoid in south africa thats why im out here richochetting over the hills but who are you may i ask you look like the rose of sharon  my name is lee wetherford she answered with childish directness for there was something compelling in the mans voice and eyes and this is my mother she indicated lize who was approaching  you are not out here for your health he stated rather thoughtfully how happens it youre here  i was born herein the fork  his face remained expressionless i dont believe it can such maidens come out of roaring forknit but i dont mean that what are you doing up here in this wilderness  lize took a part in the conversation another inspector she asked as she lumbered up  thats me he replied sherlock holmes vidocque all rolled into one  my mother again volunteered lee  hartleys eyes expressed incredulity but he did not put his feelings into words for he perceived in lize a type with which he was entirely familiarone to be handled with care what are you two women doing here are you related to one of these rangers  lize resented this youre asking a good many questions mr man  thats my trade was the unabashed reply and im not so old but that i can rise to a romantic situation thereupon he dropped all direct interrogation and with an air of candor told the story of his mission lize entirely sympathetic invited him to lunch and he was soon in possession of their story even to the tender relationship between lee virginia and the plaguebesieged forest ranger  were not so mighty disinterested he said referring to his paper the roundup represents the new west in part but to us the new west means opportunity to loot watersites and pile up unearned increment oh yes were on the side of the fruit and alfalfa grower because it pays if the boss of my paper happened to be in the sheep business as senator blank white is we would sing a different tune or if i were a congressman representing a district of cattlemen id be very slow about helping to build up any system that would make me pay for my grass as it is im commissioned to make it hot for the ranchers that killed those dagoes and im going to do it if this country had a man like cavanagh for sheriff wed have the murderers in two days he knows who the butchers are and id like his help but hes nailed down here and theres no hope of his getting away a few men like him could civilize this cursed country  thereupon he drew from three pairs of lips a statement of the kind of man ross cavanagh was but most significant of all were the few words of the girl to whom this man of the pad and pencil was a magician capable of exalting her hero and of advancing light and civilization by the mere motion of his hand she liked him and grew more and more willing to communicate and he perceiving in her something unusual lingered on questioning then he rose i must be going he said to lee youve given me a lovely afternoon  lee virginia was all too ignorant of the ways of reporters to resent his notetaking and she accepted his hand believing him to be the sincere admirer of her ranger what are you going to do she asked  im going back to sulphur to spread the report of cavanaghs quarantine again that meaning smile i dont want any other newspaper men mixed up in my game im lonesome ned in stunts like this and i hope if they do come up youll be judiciously silent goodbye  soon after the reporter left cavanagh called to swenson the old man cant last through another such a night as last night was and i wish you would persuade mrs wetherford and her daughter to return to the valley they can do nothing hereabsolutely nothing please say that  swenson repeated his commands with all the emphasis he could give them but neither lize nor lee would consent to go it would be heathenish to leave him alone in this lonesome hole protested lize  i shall stay till he is free added lee and with uneasy heart she crossed the bridge and walked on and on toward the cabin till she was close enough to detect the lines of care on her lovers haggard face  stop he called sharply keep away why dont you obey me why dont you go back to the valley  because i will not leave you alonei cant please let me stay  i beg of you go back  the roar of the stream made it necessary to speak loudly and he could not put into his voice the tenderness he felt at the moment but his face was knotted with pain as he asked dont you see you add to my uneasinessmy pain  were so anxious about you she answered it seems as though we should be doing something to help you  he understood and was grateful for the tenderness which brought her so near to him but he was forced to be stern  there is nothing you can donothing more than you are doing it helps me to know that you are there but you must not cross the bridge please go back there was pleading as well as command in his voice and with a realization of the passion his voice conveyed she retraced her steps her heart beating quickly with the joy which his words conveyed  at sunset redfield returned bringing with him medicines but no nurse nobody will come up here he said i reckon ross is doomed to fight it out alone the solitude the long trail scares the bravest of them away i tried and triedno use eleanor would have come of coursedemanded to come but i would not permit that she commissioned me to bring you both down to the ranch  lee virginia thanked him but reiterated her wish to stay until all possible danger to cavanagh was over  redfield crossed the bridge and laid the medicines down outside the door  the nurse from sulphur refused to come when she found that her patient was in a mountain cabin im sorry old man i did the best i could  never mind replied cavanagh im still free from any touch of fever im tired of course but good for another night of it my main anxiety concerns leeget her to go home with you if you can  ill do the best i can responded redfield but meanwhile you must not think of getting out of the forest service i have some cheering news for you the president has put a good man into the chiefs place  cavanaghs face lighted up thatll help some he exclaimed but whos the man  redfield named him he was a student under the chief and the chief says hes all right which satisfies me furthermore hes a real forester and not a political jobber or a corporation attorney  thats good repeated cavanagh and yet he said sadly it leaves the chief out just the same  no the chief is not out hes where he can fight for the idea to better advantage than when he was a subordinate under another man anyhow he asks us all to line up for the work and not to mind him the work he says is bigger than any man heres that resignation of yours he said taking cavanaghs letter from his pocket i didnt put it on file what shall i do with it  throw it to me said cavanagh curtly  redfield tossed it over the hitchingpole and ross took it up looked at it for a moment in silence then tore it into bits and threw it on the ground  what are your orders mr supervisor he asked with a faint quizzical smile around his eyes  theres nothing you can do but take care of this man but as soon as you are able to ride again ive got some special work for you i want you to join with young bingham the ranger on rock creek and line up the triangle cattle murphy is reported to have thrown on the forest nearly a thousand head more than his permit calls for i want you to see about that then complete your maps so that i can turn them in on the first of november and about the middle of december you are to take charge of this forest in my stead eleanor has decided to take the children abroad for a couple of years and as i am to be over there part of the time i dont feel justified in holding down the supervisors position i shall resign in your favor wait now he called warningly the district forester and i framed all this up as we rode down the hill yesterday and it goes oh yes theres one thing more old man dunn  i know  how did you learn it  a reporter came boiling over the ridge about noon today wanting me to give him the names which dunn had given me i was strongly tempted to do as he asked me toyou know these newspaper men are sometimes the best kind of detectives for running down criminals but on second thought i concluded to wait until i had discussed the matter with you i havent much faith in the county authorities  ordinarily i would have my doubts myself replied redfield but the whole country is roused and were going to round up these men this time sure the best men and the big papers all over the west are demanding an exercise of the law and the reward we have offered he paused suddenly bytheway that reward will come to you if you can bring about the arrest of the criminals  the reward should go to dunns family replied the ranger soberly poor chap hes sacrificed himself for the good of the state  thats true his family is left in bad shape  cavanagh broke off the conversation suddenly i must go back to he had almost said back to wetherford my patient needs me he exclaimed  how does he seem  hes surely dying in my judgment he cant last the night but so long as hes conscious its up to me to be on the spot  redfield walked slowly back across the river thinking on the patient courage of the ranger  it isnt the obvious kind of thing but its courage all the same he said to himself  meanwhile lize and virginia left alone beside the fire had drawn closer together  the girls face so sweet and so pensive wrought strongly upon the older womans sympathy something of her own girlhood came back to her being freed from the town and all its associations she became more considerate more thoughtful she wished to speak and yet she found it very hard to begin at last she said with a touch of mockery in her tone you like ross cavanagh almost as well as i do myself dont you  the girl flushed a little but her eyes remained steady i would not be here if i did not she replied  neither would i well now i have got something to tell yousomething i ought to have told you long agosomething that ross ought to know i intended to tell you that first day you came back but i couldnt somehow get to it and i kept putting it off and putting it off tillwell then i got fond of you and every day made it harder here she made her supreme effort child im an old bluff im not your mother at all  lee stared at her in amazement what do you mean she asked  i mean your real mother died when you was a tiny little babe you see i was your fathers second wife in fact you werent a year old when we married ed made me promise never to let you know we were to bring you up just the same as if you was a child to both of us nobody knows but reddy i told him the day we started up here  the girls mind ran swiftly over the past as she listened the truth of the revelation reached her instantly explaining a hundred strange things which had puzzled her all her life the absence of deep affection between herself and lize was explained their difference in habit temperament thoughtall became plain but my mother she said at last who was my mother  i never saw her you see ed came into the country bringing you a little motherless babe he always said your mother was a fine woman but i never so much as saw a picture of her she was an educated woman he saida southern womanand her name was virginia but thats about all i can tell you of her now i am going to let ross know all of this as soon as i can it will make a whole lot of difference in what he thinks of you  she uttered all this much as a man would have done with steady voice and with bright eyes but lee virginia could feel beneath her harsh inflections the deep emotion which vibrated there and her heart went out toward the lonely woman in a new rush of tenderness now that she was released from the necessity of excusing her mothers faultsfaults she could now ignore now that she could look upon her as a loyal friend she was moved to pity and to love and rising she went to her and put her arm about her neck and said this wont make any difference i am going to stay with you and help you just the same  the tears came to the old womans eyes and her voice broke as she replied i knew you would say that lee virginia but all the same i dont intend to have you do any such thing youve got to cut loose from me altogether because some fine chap is going to come along one of these days and he wont want me even as a stepmotherinlaw no i have decided that you and me had better live apart ill get you a place to live up in sulphur where i can visit you now and again but i guess i am elected to stay right here in the fork they dont like me and i dont like them but i have kind o got used to their ways of looking at me sidewise they dont matter as much as it would up there in the city  lee turned back wistfully toward the story of her mother where did my mother meet my father do you know that  no i dont it was a runaway match ed said i never did know who her folks wereonly i know they thought she was marrying the wrong man  the girl sighed as her mind took in the significance of her mothers coming to this wild country leaving all that she knew and loved behind poor little mother it must have been very hard for her  i am afraid she did have a hard time for ed admitted to me that he hadnt so much as a saddle when he landed in the state he hadnt much when i met him first but everybody liked him he was one of the handsomest men that ever jumped a saddle but he was closemouthed you never could get anything out of him that he didnt want to tell and i was never able to discover what he had been doing in the southern part of the state  as she pondered on her changed relationship to lize lees heart lightened it would make a difference to ross it would make a difference to the redfields traitorous as it seemed it was a great reliefa joyto know that her own mother her real mother had been nice she must have been nice or lize would not have said so she reasoned recalling that her stepmother had admitted her feeling of jealousy  at last lize rose well now dearie i reckon we had better turn in it is getting chilly and late  as they were about to part at the door of the tent virginia took lizes face between her hands goodnight mother she said and kissed her to show her that what she had said would not make any difference  but lize was not deceived this unwonted caress made perfectly plain to her the relief which filled the girls heart                                                    lee virginia was awakened some hours later by a roaring crackling sound and by the flare of a yellow light upon her tent peering out she saw flames shooting up through the roof of the rangers cabin while beside it wrapped in a blanket calmly contemplating it stood cavanagh with folded arms a little nearer to the bridge redfield was sitting upon an upturned box  with a cry of alarm she aroused her mother and lize heavyeyed laggard with sleep rose slowly and peered out at the scene with eyes of dull amazement why dont they try to put it out she demanded as she took in the import of the passive figures  dressing with tremulous haste lee stepped from the tent just in time to see swenson come from behind the burning building and join the others in silent contemplation of the scene there was something uncanny in the calm inaction of the three strong men  a dense fog hung low enveloping the whole canon in a moist heavy sulphurous veil through which the tongues of flame shot with a grandiose effect but the three foresters whose shadows expanded contracted and wavered grotesquely remained motionless as carven figures of ebony it was as if they were contemplating an absorbing drama in whose enactment they had only the spectators curious interest  slowly wonderingly the girl drew near and called to cavanagh who turned quickly crying out dont come too close and dont be frightened i set the place on fire myself the poor old herder died last night and is decently buried in the earth and now we are burning the cabin and every thread it contains to prevent the spread of the plague hugh and swenson have divided their garments with me and this blanket which i wear is my only coat all that i have is in that cabin now going up in smokemy guns pictures everything  how could you do it she cried out understanding what his sacrifice had been  i couldnt he replied the supervisor did it they had to go the cabin was saturated with poison it had become to me a plague spot and there was no other way to stamp it out i should never have felt safe if i had carried out even so much as a letter  dumb and shivering with the chill of the morning lee virginia drew nearer ever nearer i am so sorry she said and yearned toward him eager to comfort him but he warningly motioned her away  please dont come any nearer for i dare not touch you  but you are not ill she cried out with a note of apprehension in her voice  he smiled in response to her question no i feel nothing but weariness and a little depression i cant help feeling somehow as if i were burning up a part of myself in that firethe saddle i have ridden for years my guns ropes spurs everything relating to the forest are gone and with them my youth i have been something of a careless freebooter myself i fear but that is all over with now he looked her in the face with a sad and resolute glance the forest service made a man of me taught me to regard the future i never accepted responsibility till i became a ranger and in thinking it all over i have decided to stay with it as the boys say till the spring rains  i am very glad of that she said  yes dalton thinks i can qualify for the position of supervisor and redfield may offer me the supervision of this forest if he does i will accept itif you will go with me and share the small home which the supervisors pay provides will you go  in the light of his burning cabin and in the shadow of the great peaks lee virginia could not fail of a certain largeness and dignity of mood she neither blushed nor stammered as she responded i will go anywhere in the world with you  he could not touch so much as the hem of her garment but his eyes embraced her as he said god bless you for the faith you seem to have in me                                                    redfields voice interrupted with hearty clamor and now miss virginia you go back and rustle some breakfast for us all swenson bring the horses in and harness my team im going to take these women down the canon and ross youd better saddle up as soon as you feel rested and ride across the divide and go into camp in that little old cabin by the dam above my house youll have to be sequestered for a few days i reckon till we see how youre coming out ill telephone over to the fork and have the place made ready for you and ill have the doctor go up there to meet you and put you straight if youre going to be sick well want you where we can look after you isnt that so lee virginia  indeed it is replied the girl earnestly  but im not going to be sick retorted cavanagh i refuse to be sick  quite right replied redfield but all the same we want you where we can get at you and where medical aid of the right sort is accessible im going to fetch my bed over here and put you into it you need rest  lee still lingered after redfield left them please do as mr redfield tells you she pleaded for i shall be very anxious till you get safely down the mountains if that poor old man has any relatives they ought to be told how kind you have been you could not have been kinder to one of your own people  these words from her had a poignancy of meaning which made his reply difficult his tone was designedly light as he retorted i would be a fraud if i stood here listening to your praise without sayingwithout confessinghow deadly weary i got of the whole business it was simply that there was nothing else to do i had to go on  her mind still dwelt on the tragic event i wish he could have had some kind of a service it seems sort of barbarous to bury him without any one to say a prayer over him but i suppose that was impossible surely some one ought to mark his grave for some of his people may come and want to know where he lies  he led her thoughts to pleasanter paths i am glad you are going with the supervisor you are going are you not  yes for a few days till im sure youre safe  i shall be tempted to pretend being sick just to keep you near me he was saying when redfield returned bringing his sleepingcouch unrolling this under a tree beside the creek the supervisor said now get into that  cavanagh resigned lee with a smile goodnight he said oh but its good to remember that i shall see you tomorrow  with a happy glance and a low goodbye she turned away  laying aside his blanket and his shoes cavanagh crept into the snug little campbed ah he breathed with a delicious sense of relief i feel as if i could sleep a week and in an instant his eyes closed in slumber so profound that it was barren even of dreams  when he awoke it was noon and swenson the guard was standing over him im sorry but its time to be moving he said its a long ride over there  what time is it inquired cavanagh with some bewilderment  nearly noon ive got some coffee ready want some  do i just watch me and he scrambled out of his bed with vigor and stretched himself like a cat exclaiming wow but it does feel good to know that i am out of jail  going down to the stream he splashed his face and neck in the clear cold water and the brisk rubbing which followed seemed to clear his thought as well as sharpen his appetite  you seem all right so far hazarded the guide  i am all right and ill be all right tomorrow if thats what you mean replied cavanagh well now pack up and well pull out  for a few moments after he mounted his horse cavanagh looked about the place as if for the last timenow up at the hill now down at the meadow and last of all at the stream i hope youll enjoy this station as much as i have swenson its one of the prettiest on the whole forest  together they zigzagged up the side of the hill to the north and then with cavanagh in the lead followed by his packhorse they set up the long lateral moraine which led by a wide circle through the wooded park toward the pass the weather was clear and cold the wind bit and cavanagh scantily clothed as he was drew his robe close about his neck saying i know now how it feels to be a blanket indian i must say i prefer an overcoat  a little later the keen eyes of the guard sweeping the mountainside were suddenly arrested theres a bunch of cowboys coming over the pass he called  i see them responded cavanagh get out your glasses and tell me who they are  swenson unslung his fieldglasses and studied the party attentively looks like van hornes sorrel in the lead and that baldface bay just behind looks like the one gregg rides the other two i dont seem to know  perhaps its the sheriff after me for harboring edwards suggested cavanagh  but swenson remained sober he did not see the humor of the remark what are they doing on the forest anyhow he asked  half an hour later the two parties came face to face on a little stretch of prairie in the midst of the wooded valley there were four in the sheriffs party gregg the deputy and a big man who was a stranger to cavanagh their horses were all tired and the big civilian looked saddleweary  good evenin gentlemen called the sheriff in southern fashion as he drew near  good evenin mr sheriff cavanagh civilly answered whats the meaning of this invasion of my forest  the sheriff for answer presented the big stranger mr cavanagh this is mr simpson the county attorney  cavanagh nodded to the attorney ive heard of mr simpson he said  simpson answered the question ross had asked we were on our way to your station mr cavanagh because we understand that this old man dunn who shot himself had visited you before his death giving you information concerning the killing of the mexican sheepherders is that true  it is  when did he visit you  two days ago or maybe three i am a little mixed about it you see i have been pretty closely confined to my shack for a few days  gregg threw in a query how is the old man  hes all right that is to say hes dead died last night  the sheriff looked at simpson meaningly well i reckon that settles his score judge even if he was implicated hes out of it now  he couldnt have been implicated declared the ranger for he was with me at the time the murder was committed i left him high on the mountain in the basque herders camp i can prove an alibi for him furthermore he had no motive for such work  what did dunn tell you demanded the sheriff what names did he give you  wait a moment replied cavanagh who felt himself to be on his own territory and not to be hurried theres a reward offered for the arrest of these men is there not  there is replied the attorney  well before i make my statement id like to request that my share of the reward if there is any coming to me shall be paid over to the widow of the man who gave me the information poor chap he sacrificed himself for the good of the state and his family should be spared all the suffering possible  quite right mr cavanagh you may consider that request granted now for the facts  before going into that mr attorney id like to speak to you alone  very well sir replied the attorney then waving his hand toward the others he said boys just ride off a little piece will you  when they were alone cavanagh remarked i dont think it wise to give these names to the wind for if we do there will be more fugitives  i see your point simpson agreed  thereupon rapidly and concisely the ranger reported what dunn had said and the attorney listened thoughtfully without speaking to the end then he added that tallies with what we have got from ballard  was ballard in it asked cavanagh  yes we forced a confession from him  if he was in it it was merely for the pay he represented some one else  what makes you think that  because he was crazy to return to the show with which he used to perform and desperately in need of money have you thought that gregg might have had a hand in this affair dunn said he had although he was not present at any of the meetings  this seemed to surprise the attorney very much but hes a sheepman he exclaimed  i know he is but hes also a silent partner in the triangle cattle outfit and is making us a lot of trouble and besides he had it in for these dagoes as he calls them because they were sheeping territory which he wanted himself  i dont think hes any too good for it responded simpson but i doubt if he had any hand in the killing hes too cunning and too cowardly but ill keep in mind what you have said and if he is involved in any degree hell have to go down the road with the othershis money cant save him  as they came back to the party cavanagh thought he detected in greggs eyes a shifting light that was not there before but he made no further attempt to impress his opinion upon the attorney or the sheriff he only said well now gentlemen i must go on over the divide i have an appointment with the doctor over there also with a bed and a warmer suit of clothes than i have on if i can be of any service to you when i am out of quarantine i hope you will call upon me  it is possible that we may need you in order to locate some of the men whose names you have given me  very good replied cavanagh if they come upon the forest anywhere the supervisor and i will find them for you  so they parted and cavanagh and his guard resumed their slow journey across the range     conclusion   in her career as the wife of a western rancher eleanor redfield had been called upon to entertain many strange guests and she made no very determined objection when her husband telephoned that he was bringing lize as well as lee virginia to stay at elk lodge for a few days the revelation of the true relation between the two women had as lize put it made a whole lot of difference to mrs redfield it naturally cleared the daughter of some part of her handicap and it had also made the mothers attitude less objectionable  furthermore the loyalty of eliza to ross her bravery in defending him from attack and the love and courage which enabled her to rise from a sickbed and go to the mountains ready and insistent on taking his place as nurseall these were not the traits of a commonplace personality i begin to think ive been unjust to mrs wetherford she admitted to her husband  she had seen lize but once and that was in the distorting atmosphere of the restaurant and she remembered her only as a lumpy scowling loudvoiced creature with blowsy hair and a watchful eye she was profoundly surprised therefore when lee virginia introduced a quietspoken rather sadfaced elderly woman as her mother  im glad to see you mrs wetherford eleanor said with the courtesy which was instinctive with her  im mightily obliged for the chance to come replied lize i told reddyi mean the supervisorthat you didnt want no oldtimer like me but he said come along and lee she fixed me out and here i am she uttered this with a touch of her wellknown selfdepreciation but she was by no interpretation sordid or common  she did indeed show lees care and her manner while manifestly formed upon lees instructions was never ludicrous she was frankly curious about the house and its pretty things and swore softly in her surprise and pleasure think of an old cowboss like me living up to these jimmycracks as they went to their room together she made a confession the thing that scares me worst is eating ive et at the alma times enough but to handle a fork here with elnor redfield lookin on great peter aint there some way of takin my meals out in the barn i wouldnt mind you and ross and reddyits the missis  ross had not yet arrived at the cabin but redfield had warned lee not to expect him till after dark he probably slept late and besides there are always delays on the trail but dont worry swenson will ride to the top of the divide with him and if it seems necessary will come all the way  this feeling of anxiety helped to steady lize and she got through the meal very well she was unwontedly silent and a little sad as well as constrained she could see that lee fitted in with these surroundings that she was at home with shining silver and dainty dishes and she said to herself i could have been something like her if id had any sort o raisin but its too late now but oh lord wouldnt ed like to see her now  it was not yet dark when they came out on the veranda to meet the doctor who had come to meet ross and lees anxiety led her to say cant we go up to the cabin and wait for him there  i was about to propose that replied redfield shall we walk  lee was instant in her desire to be off but lize said i never was much on foot and now im hoofbound you go along and ill sit on the porch here and watch  so lee the doctor and redfield went off together across the meadow toward the little cabin which had been built for the workmen while putting in the dam it was hardly a mile away and yet it stood at the mouth of a mighty gorge out of which the water sprang white with speed  but lee had no mind for the scenery though her eyes were lifted to the meadows wall down which the ranger was expected to ride it looked frightfully steep and whenever she thought of him descending that trail worn and perhaps ill her heart ached with anxiety but redfield rambled on comfortably explaining the situation to the doctor who being a most unimaginative person appeared to take it all as a matter of course  at the cabin itself lee transferred her interest to the supper which had been prepared for the ranger and she went about the room trying to make it a little more comfortable for him it was a bare little place hardly more than a camp as was proper and she devoutly prayed that he was not to be sick therein for it stood in a cold and gloomy place close under the shadow of a great wall of rock  as it grew dark she lighted a lamp and placed it outside the window in order that its light might catch the rangers eye and this indeed it did for almost instantly a pistolshot echoed from the hillside far above signalling his approach  there he is she exclaimed in swift rebound to ecstasy hear him shout  his voice could indeed be heard though faintly and so they waited while the darkness deepened and the voice of the stream rose like an exhalation increasing in violence as the night fell  at last they could hear the sound of his horses feet upon the rocks and with girlish impulse lee raised a musical cryan invitation as well as a joyous signal  to this the ranger made vocal answer and they could soon see him moving athwart the hillsides zigzagging in the trailers fashion dropping down with incredible swiftness he was alone and leading his horse but his celerity of movement and the tones of his voice denoted confidence and health  the doctor laughed as he said i dont think a very sick man could come down a mountain like that  oh he isnt sick yet said redfield what we are afraid of is a possible development  the ranger as he came rushing down the final slope found his knees weakened as much by excitement as by weariness to hear lees clear voice down there to know that she was waiting for him was to feel himself the luckiest of men escaping contagion and being on his way to a larger position were as nothing compared to the lure of that girlish halloo he saw the lamp shine afar but he could not distinguish the girls form till he emerged from the clump of pinetrees which hid the bottom of the trail then they all shouted together and redfield turning to lee warningly said  now my dear girl you and i must not interfere with the doctor we will start back to the house at once  not yetnot till weve seen him and talked with him she pleaded  i dont think theres a particle of danger said the doctor but perhaps youd better not wait  cavanagh came up with shining eyes and heavy breath i made itbut oh im tired i never was tired like this before in my life he looked at her as he spoke but im feeling fine  this is doctor french ross  how are you doctor im not shaking hands these days  well see about that replied the physician  i met the sheriff on the way mr supervisor and i gave him the story dunn told me and i made a request that the reward for the information be paid to dunns widow  ill see to that responded redfield and now well leave you to the tender mercies of the doctor  i made some coffee for you and youll find some supper under a napkin on the table explained lee  thank you  im sorry it isnt better its only cold chicken and sandwiches  only cold chicken he laughed my chief anxiety is lest it should not prove a whole chicken im hungry as a coyote  well now goodnight said redfield doctor youll report as you go by  yes expect me in half an hour or so  and so lee walked away with redfield almost entirely relieved of her care he cant be ill can he she asked  i dont see how he can his life has made him as clean and strong as an oaktree on a windy slope he is all right and very happy your being there to meet him was very sweet to him i could see that if it should turn out that you should be the one to keep him here and in the forest service i shall be very grateful to you  she did not reply to this but walked along in silence by his side feeling very small very humble but very content  lize was on the veranda did he get through  hes all right so far returned redfield cheerily we left the doctor about to fly at him well have a report soon  they had hardly finished telling of how the ranger had descended the hill when the doctor arrived he hasnt a trace of it was his report all he needs is sleep i cut him off from his entire overtherange outfit and theres no reason why he should not come down to breakfast with you in the morning  mrs redfield thanked the doctor as fervently as if he had conferred a personal favor upon her and the girl echoed her grateful words  oh thats all right the doctor replied in true western fashion ill do as much more for you any time and he rode away leaving at least one person too happy to sleep                                                    the same person was on the veranda next morning when cavanagh dressed in the supervisors best suit of gray cassimere came striding across the lawntoo impatient of the winding drive to follow it as he came his
