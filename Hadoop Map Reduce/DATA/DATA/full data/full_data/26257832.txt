26257832	castle richmond  by  anthony trollope  with an introduction by algar thorold        london  new york mcmvi     introduction   castle richmond was written in 1861 long after trollope had left ireland the characterization is weak and the plot although the author himself thought well of it mechanical  the value of the story is rather documentary than literary it contains several graphic scenes descriptive of the great irish famine trollope observed carefully and on the whole impartially though his powers of discrimination were not quite fine enough to make him an ideal annalist  still such as they were he has used them here with no inconsiderable effect his desire to be fair has led him to lay stress in an inverse ratio to his prepossessions and his priest is a better man than his parson  the best indeed the only piece of real characterization in the book is the delineation of abe mollett this unscrupulous blackmailer is put before us with real art with something of the loving preoccupation of the hunter for his quarry trollope loved a rogue and in his long portrait gallery there are several really charming ones he did not indeed perceive the aesthetic value of sinhe did not perceive the esthetic value of anythingand his analysis of human nature was not profound enough to reach the conception of sin crime being to him the nadir of downward possibilitybut he had a professional a sort of half scotland yard half master of hounds interest in a criminal see he would muse how cunningly the creature works now back to his earth anon stealing an unsuspected run across country the clever rascal and his ethical disapproval ever as usual with english critics of life in the foreground clearly enhanced a primitive predatory instinct not obscurely akin a cynic might say to those dark impulses he holds up to our reprobation this selfrealization in his fiction is one of trollopes principal charms never was there a more subjective writer unlike flaubert who laid down the canon that the author should exist in his work as god in creation to be here or there dimly divined but never recognized though everywhere latent trollope was never weary of writing himself large in every man woman or child he described  the illusion of objectivity which he so successfully achieves is due to the fact that his mind was so perfectly contented with its hereditary and circumstantial conditions was itself so perfectly the mental equivalent of those conditions thus the perfection of his egotism tight as a drum saved him had it been a little less complete he would have faltered and bungled as it was he had the naive certainty of a child to whose innocent apprehension the world and self are one and who therefore cannot err  algar thorold     contents           i

the barony of desmond   i wonder whether the novelreading worldthat part of it at least which may honour my pageswill be offended if i lay the plot of this story in ireland that there is a strong feeling against things irish it is impossible to deny irish servants need not apply irish acquaintances are treated with limited confidence irish cousins are regarded as being decidedly dangerous and irish stories are not popular with the booksellers  for myself i may say that if i ought to know anything about any place i ought to know something about ireland and i do strongly protest against the injustice of the above conclusions irish cousins i have none irish acquaintances i have by dozens and irish friends also by twos and threes whom i can love and cherishalmost as well perhaps as though they had been born in middlesex irish servants i have had some in my house for years and never had one that was faithless dishonest or intemperate i have travelled all over ireland closely as few other men can have done and have never had my portmanteau robbed or my pocket picked at hotels i have seldom locked up my belongings and my carelessness has never been punished i doubt whether as much can be said for english inns  irish novels were once popular enough but there is a fashion in novels as there is in colours and petticoats and now i fear they are drugs in the market it is hard to say why a good story should not have a fair chance of success whatever may be its bent why it should not be reckoned to be good by its own intrinsic merits alone but such is by no means the case i was waiting once when i was young at the work in the back parlour of an eminent publisher hoping to see his eminence on a small matter of business touching a threevolumed manuscript which i held in my hand the eminent publisher having probably larger fish to fry could not see me but sent his clerk or foreman to arrange the business  a novel is it sir said the foreman  yes i answered a novel  it depends very much on the subject said the foreman with a thoughtful and judicious frownupon the name sir and the subjectdaily life sir thats what suits us daily english life now your historical novel sir is not worth the paper its written on  i fear that irish character is in these days considered almost as unattractive as historical incident but nevertheless i will make the attempt i am now leaving the green isle and my old friends and would fain say a word of them as i do so if i do not say that word now it will never be said  the readability of a story should depend one would say on its intrinsic merit rather than on the site of its adventures no one will think that hampshire is better for such a purpose than cumberland or essex than leicestershire what abstract objection can there then be to the county cork  perhaps the most interesting and certainly the most beautiful part of ireland is that which lies down in the extreme southwest with fingers stretching far out into the atlantic ocean this consists of the counties cork and kerry or a portion rather of those counties it contains killarney glengarriffe bantry and inchigeela and is watered by the lee the blackwater and the flesk i know not where is to be found a land more rich in all that constitutes the loveliness of scenery  within this district but hardly within that portion of it which is most attractive to tourists is situated the house and domain of castle richmond the river blackwater rises in the county kerry and running from west to east through the northern part of the county cork enters the county waterford beyond fermoy in its course it passes near the little town of kanturk and through the town of mallow castle richmond stands close upon its banks within the barony of desmond and in that kanturk region through which the mallow and killarney railway now passes but which some thirteen years since knew nothing of the navvys spade or even of the engineers theodolite  castle richmond was at this period the abode of sir thomas fitzgerald who resided there ever and always with his wife lady fitzgerald his two daughters mary and emmeline fitzgerald and as often as purposes of education and pleasure suited with his son herbert fitzgerald neither sir thomas nor sir thomass house had about them any of those interesting picturesque faults which are so generally attributed to irish landlords and irish castles he was not out of elbows nor was he an absentee castle richmond had no appearance of having been thrown out of its own windows it was a good substantial modern family residence built not more than thirty years since by the late baronet with a lawn sloping down to the river with kitchen gardens and walls for fruit with ample stables and a clock over the entrance to the stable yard it stood in a welltimbered park duly stocked with deerand with foxes also which are agricultural animals much more valuable in an irish county than deer so that as regards its appearance castle richmond might have been in hampshire or essex and as regards his property sir thomas fitzgerald might have been a leicestershire baronet  here at castle richmond lived sir thomas with his wife and daughters and here taking the period of our story as being exactly thirteen years since his son herbert was staying also in those hard winter months his oxford degree having been taken and his english pursuits admitting of a temporary sojourn in ireland  but sir thomas fitzgerald was not the great man of that part of the countryat least not the greatest man nor was lady fitzgerald by any means the greatest lady as this greatest lady and the greatest man also will with their belongings be among the most prominent of our dramatis person√¶ it may be well that i should not even say a word of them  all the world must have heard of desmond court it is the largest inhabited residence known in that part of the world where rumours are afloat of how it covers ten acres of ground how in hewing the stones for it a whole mountain was cut away how it should have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds only that the money was never paid by the rapacious wicked bloodthirsty old earl who caused it to be erectedand how the cement was thickened with human blood so goes rumour with the more romantic of the celtic talebearers  it is a huge placehuge ungainly and uselessly extensive built at a time when at any rate in ireland men considered neither beauty aptitude nor economy it is three stories high and stands round a quadrangle in which there are two entrances opposite to each other nothing can be well uglier than that great paved court in which there is not a spot of anything green except where the damp has produced an unwholesome growth upon the stones nothing can well be more desolate and on the outside of the building matters are not much better there are no gardens close up to the house no flowerbeds in the nooks and corners no sweet shrubs peeping in at the square windows gardens there are but they are away half a mile off and the great hall door opens out upon a flat bleak park with hardly a scrap around it which courtesy can call a lawn  here at this period of ours lived clara countess of desmond widow of patrick once earl of desmond and father of patrick now earl of desmond these desmonds had once been mighty men in their country ruling the people around them as serfs and ruling them with hot iron rods but those days were now long gone and tradition told little of them that was true how it had truly fared either with the earl or with their serfs men did not well know but stories were ever being told of walls built with human blood and of the devil bearing off upon his shoulder a certain earl who was in any other way quite unbearable and depositing some small unburnt portion of his remains fathoms deep below the soil in an old buryingground near kanturk and there had been a good earl as is always the case with such families but even his virtues according to tradition had been of a useless nambypamby sort he had walked to the shrine of st finbar up in the little island of the gougane barra with unboiled peas in his shoes had forgiven his tenants five years rent all round and never drank wine or washed himself after the death of his lady wife  at the present moment the desmonds were not so potent either for good or ill the late earl had chosen to live in london all his life and had sunk down to be the toadying friend or perhaps i should more properly say the bullied flunky of a sensual winebibbing gluttonousking late in life when he was broken in means and character he had married the lady of his choice had been chosen as an heiress but there had been some slip between that cup of fortune and his lip and she proud and beautiful for such she had beenhad neither relieved nor softened the poverty of her profligate old lord  she was left at his death with two children of whom the eldest lady clara desmond will be the heroine of this story the youngest patrick now earl of desmond was two years younger than his sister and will make our acquaintance as a lad fresh from eton  in these days money was not plentiful with the desmonds not but that their estates were as wide almost as their renown and that the desmonds were still great people in the countrys estimation desmond court stood in a bleak unadorned region almost among the mountains half way between kanturk and maccoom and the family had some claim to possession of the land for miles around the earl of the day was still the head landlord of a huge district extending over the whole barony of desmond and half the adjacent baronies of muskerry and duhallow but the head landlords rent in many cases hardly amounted to sixpence an acre and even those sixpences did not always find their way into the earls pocket when the late earl had attained his sceptre he might probably have been entitled to spend some ten thousand a year but when he died and during the years just previous to that he had hardly been entitled to spend anything  but nevertheless the desmonds were great people and owned a great name they had been kings once over those wild mountains and would be still some said if every one had his own their grandeur was shown by the prevalence of their name the barony in which they lived was the barony of desmond the river which gave water to their cattle was the river desmond the wretched ragged povertystricken village near their own dismantled gate was the town of desmond the earl was earl of desmondnot earl desmond mark you and the family name was desmond the grandfather of the present earl who had repaired his fortune by selling himself at the time of the union had been desmond desmond earl of desmond  the late earl the friend of the most illustrious person in the kingdom had not been utterly able to rob his heir of everything or he would undoubtedly have done so at the age of twentyone the young earl would come into possession of the property damaged certainly as far as an actively evil father could damage it by long leases bad management lack of outlay and rackrentingbut still into the possession of a considerable property in the mean time it did not fare very well in a pecuniary way with clara the widowed countess or with the lady clara her daughter the means at the widows disposal were only those which the family trustees would allow her as the earls mother on his coming of age she would have almost no means of her own and for her daughter no provision whatever had been made  as this first chapter is devoted wholly to the locale of my story i will not stop to say a word as to the persons or characters of either of these two ladies leaving them as i did the castle richmond family to come forth upon the canvas as opportunity may offer but there is another homestead in this same barony of desmond of which and of its owneras being its owneri will say a word  hap house was also the property of a fitzgerald it had originally been built by an old sir simon fitzgerald for the use and behoof of a second son and the present owner of it was the grandson of that man for whom it had been built and old sir simon had given his offspring not only a househe had endowed the house with a comfortable little slice of land either cut from the large patrimonial loaf or else as was more probable collected together and separately baked for this younger branch of the family be that as it may hap house had of late years been always regarded as conferring some seven or eight hundred a year upon its possessor and when young owen fitzgerald succeeded to this property on the death of an uncle in the year 1843 he was regarded as a rich man to that extent  at that time he was some twentytwo years of age and he came down from dublin where his friends had intended that he should practise as a barrister to set up for himself as a country gentleman hap house was distant from castle richmond about four miles standing also on the river blackwater but nearer to mallow it was a pleasant comfortable residence too large no doubt for such a property as is so often the case in ireland surrounded by pleasant grounds and pleasant gardens with a gorse fox covert belonging to the place within a mile of it with a slated lodge and a pretty drive along the river at the age of twentytwo owen fitzgerald came into all this and as he at once resided upon the place he came in also for the good graces of all the mothers with unmarried daughters in the county and for the smiles also of many of the daughters themselves  sir thomas and lady fitzgerald were not his uncle and aunt but nevertheless they took kindly to himvery kindly at first though that kindness after a while became less warm he was the nearest relation of the name and should anything happenas the fatal deathforetelling phrase goesto young herbert fitzgerald he would become the heir of the family title and of the family place  when i hear of a young man sitting down by himself as the master of a household without a wife or even without a mother or sister to guide him i always anticipate danger if he does not go astray in any other way he will probably mismanage his money matters and then there are so many other ways a house if it be not made pleasant by domestic pleasant things must be made pleasant by pleasure and a bachelors pleasures in his own house are always dangerous there is too much wine drunk at his dinner parties his guests sit too long over their cards the servants know that they want a mistress and in the absence of that mistress the language of the household becomes loud and harshand sometimes improper young men among us seldom go quite straight in their course unless they are at any rate occasionally brought under the influence of tea and small talk  there was no tea and small talk at hap house but there were huntingdinners owen fitzgerald was soon known for his horses and his riding he lived in the very centre of the duhallow hunt and before he had been six months owner of his property had built additional stables with half a dozen loose boxes for his friends nags he had an eye too for a pretty girlnot always in the way that is approved of by mothers with marriageable daughters but in the way of which they so decidedly disapprove  and thus old ladies began to say bad things those pleasant huntingdinners were spoken of as the hap house orgies it was declared that men slept there half the day having played cards all the night and dreadful tales were told of these tales onehalf was doubtless false but alas alas what if onehalf were also true  it is undoubtedly a very dangerous thing for a young man of twentytwo to keep house by himself either in town or country     chapter ii  owen fitzgerald   i have tied myself down to thirteen years ago as the time of my story but i must go back a little beyond this for its first scenes and work my way up as quickly as may be to the period indicated i have spoken of a winter in which herbert fitzgerald was at home at castle richmond having then completed his oxford doings but i must say something of two years previous to that of a time when herbert was not so well known in the county as was his cousin of hap house  it was a thousand pities that a bad word should ever have been spoken of owen fitzgerald ten thousand pities that he should ever have given occasion for such bad word he was a fine highspirited handsome fellow with a loving heart within his breast and bright thoughts within his brain it was utterly wrong that a man constituted as he was should commence life by living alone in a large countryhouse but those who spoke ill of him should have remembered that this was his misfortune rather than his fault some greater endeavour might perhaps have been made to rescue him from evil ways very little such endeavour was made at all sir thomas once or twice spoke to him but sir thomas was not an energetic man and as for lady fitzgerald though she was in many things all that was excellent she was far too diffident to attempt the reformation of a headstrong young man who after all was only distantly connected with her  and thus there was no such attempt and poor owen became the subject of ill report without any substantial effort having been made to save him he was a very handsome mantall being somewhat over six feet in heightathletic almost more than in proportionwith short light chestnuttinted hair blue eyes and a mouth perfect as that of phoebus he was clever too though perhaps not educated as carefully as might have been his speech was usually rapid hearty and short and not seldom caustic and pointed had he fallen among good hands he might have done very well in the worlds fight but with such a character and lacking such advantages it was quite as open to him to do ill alas the latter chance seemed to have fallen to him  for the first year of his residence at hap house he was popular enough among his neighbours the hap house orgies were not commenced at once nor when commenced did they immediately become a subject of scandal and even during the second year he was toleratedtolerated by all and still flattered by some  among the different houses in the country at which he had become intimate was that of the countess of desmond the countess of desmond did not receive much company at desmond court she had not the means nor perhaps the will to fill the huge old house with parties of her irish neighboursfor she herself was english to the backbone ladies of course made morning calls and gentlemen too occasionally but society at desmond court was for some years pretty much confined to this cold formal mode of visiting owen fitzgerald however did obtain admittance into the precincts of the desmond barracks  he went there first with the young earl who then quite a boy had had an ugly tumble from his pony in the huntingfield the countess had expressed herself as very grateful for young fitzgeralds care and thus an intimacy had sprung up owen had gone there once or twice to see the lad and on those occasions had dined there and on one occasion at the young earls urgent request had stayed and slept  and then the goodnatured people of muskerry duhallow and desmond began of course to say that the widow was going to marry the young man and why not she was still a beautiful woman not yet forty by a good deal said the few who took her part or at any rate not much over as was admitted by the many who condemned her we who have been admitted to her secrets know that she was then in truth only thirtyeight she was beautiful proud and clever and if it would suit her to marry a handsome young fellow with a good house and an unembarrassed income of eight hundred a year why should she not do so as for him would it not be a great thing for him to have a countess for his wife and an earl for his stepson  what ideas the countess had on this subject we will not just now trouble ourselves to inquire but as to young owen fitzgerald we may declare at once that no thought of such a wretched alliance ever entered his head he was sinful in many things and foolish in many things but he had not that vile sin that unmanly folly which would have made a marriage with a widowed countess eligible in his eyes merely because she was a countess and not more than fifteen years his senior in a matter of love he would as soon have thought of paying his devotions to his faraway cousin old miss barbara beamish of ballyclahassan of whom it was said that she had set her cap at every unmarried man that had come into the west riding of the county for the last forty years no it may at any rate be said of owen fitzgerald that he was not the man to make up to a widowed countess for the sake of the reflected glitter which might fall on him from her coronet  but the countess of desmond was not the only lady at desmond court i have before said that she had a daughter the lady clara the heroine of this coming story and it may be now right that i should attempt some short description of her her virtues and faults her merits and defects it shall be very short for let an author describe as he will he cannot by such course paint the characters of his personages on the minds of his readers it is by gradual earnest efforts that this must be doneif it be done ten nay twenty pages of the finest descriptive writing that ever fell from the pen of a novelist will not do it  clara desmond when young fitzgerald first saw her had hardly attained that incipient stage of womanhood which justifies a mother in taking her out into the gaieties of the world she was then only sixteen and had not in her manner and appearance so much of the woman as is the case with many girls of that age she was shy and diffident in manner thin and tall in person if i were to say that she was angular and bony i should disgust my readers who disliking the term would not stop to consider how many sweetest girls are at that age truly subject to those epithets their undeveloped but active limbs are long and fleshless the contour of their face is the same their elbows and shoulders are pointed their feet and hands seem to possess length without breadth birth and breeding have given them the frame of beauty to which coming years will add the soft roundness of form and the rich glory of colour the plump rosy girl of fourteen though she also is very sweet never rises to such celestial power of feminine grace as she who is angular and bony whose limbs are long and whose joints are sharp  such was clara desmond at sixteen but still even then to those who were gifted with the power of seeing she gave promise of great loveliness her eyes were long and large and wonderfully clear there was a liquid depth in them which enabled the gazer to look down into them as he would into the green pellucid transparency of still ocean water and then they said so muchthose young eyes of hers from her mouth in those early years words came but scantily but from her eyes questions rained quicker than any other eyes could answer them questions of wonder at what the world containedof wonder as to what men thought and did questions as to the inmost heart and truth and purpose of the person questioned and all this was asked by a glance now and again by a glance of those long shy liquid eyes which were ever falling on the face of him she questioned and then ever as quickly falling from it  her face as i have said was long and thin but it was the longness and thinness of growing youth the natural lines of it were full of beauty of pale silent beauty too proud in itself to boast itself much before the world to make itself common among many her hair was already long and rich but was light in colour much lighter than it grew to be when some four or five more years had passed over her head at the time of which i speak she wore it in simple braids brushed back from her forehead not having as yet learned that majestic mode of sweeping it from her face which has in subsequent years so generally prevailed  and what then of her virtues and her faultsof her merits and defects will it not be better to leave them all to time and the coming pages that she was proud of her birth proud of being an irish desmond proud even of her poverty so much i may say of her even at that early age in that she was careless of the worlds esteem fond to a fault of romance poetic in her temperament and tender in her heart she shared the ordinaryshall i say foibles or virtuesof so many of her sex she was passionately fond of her brother but not nearly equally so of her mother of whom the brother was too evidently the favoured child  she had lived much alone alone that is with her governess and with servants at desmond court not that she had been neglected by her mother but she had hardly found herself to be her mothers companion and other companions there she had had none when she was sixteen her governess was still with her but a year later than that she was left quite alone except inasmuch as she was with her mother  she was sixteen when she first began to ask questions of owen fitzgeralds face with those large eyes of hers and she saw much of him and he of her for the twelve months immediately after that much of him that is as much goes in this country of ours where four or five interviews in as many months between friends is supposed to signify that they are often together but this muchseeing occurred chiefly during the young earls holidays now and again he did ride over in the long intervals and when he did do so was not frowned upon by the countess and so at the end of the winter holidays subsequent to that former winter in which the earl had had his tumble people through the county began to say that he and the countess were about to become man and wife  it was just then that people in the county were also beginning to talk of the hap house orgies and the double scandal reached owens ears one shortly after the other that orgies scandal did not hurt him much it is alas too true that consciousness of such a reputation does not often hurt a young mans feelings but the other rumour did wound him what he sell himself to a widowed countess almost old enough to be his mother or bestow himself ratherfor what was there in return that could be reckoned as a price at any rate he had given no one cause to utter such falsehood such calumny as that no it certainly was not probable that he should marry the countess  but this set him to ask himself whether it might or might not be possible that he should marry some one else might it not be well for him if he could find a younger bride at desmond court not for nothing had he ridden over there through those bleak mountains not for nothing nor yet solely with the view of tying flies for the young earls summer fishing or preparing the new nag for his winters hunting those large bright eyes had asked him many questions would it not be well that he should answer them  for many months of that year clara desmond had hardly spoken to him then in the summer evening as he and her brother would lie sprawling together on the banks of the little desmond river while the lad was talking of his fish and his school and his cricket club she would stand by and listen and so gradually she learned to speak  and the mother also would sometimes be there or else she would welcome fitzgerald in to tea and let him stay there talking as though they were all at home till he would have to make a midnight ride of it before he reached hap house it seemed that no fear as to her daughter had ever crossed the mothers mind that no idea had ever come upon her that her favoured visitor might learn to love the young girl with whom he was allowed to associate on so intimate a footing once or twice he had caught himself calling her clara and had done so even before her mother but no notice had been taken of it in truth lady desmond did not know her daughter for the mother took her absolutely to be a child when in fact she was a child no longer  you take clara round by the bridge said the earl to his friend one august evening as they were standing together on the banks of the river about a quarter of a mile distant from the sombre old pile in which the family lived you take clara round by the bridge and i will get over the steppingstones and so the lad with his rod in his hand began to descend the steep bank  i can get over the steppingstones too patrick said she  can you though my gay young woman youll be over your ankles if you do that rain didnt come down yesterday for nothing  clara as she spoke had come up to the bank and now looked wistfully down at the steppingstones she had crossed them scores of times sometimes with her brother and often by herself why was it that she was so anxious to cross them now  its no use your trying said her brother who was now half across and who spoke from the middle of the river dont you let her owen shell slip in and then there will be no end of a row up at the house  you had better come round by the bridge said fitzgerald it is not only that the stones are nearly under water but they are wet and you would slip  so cautioned lady clara allowed herself to be persuaded and turned upwards along the river by a little path that led to a foot bridge it was some quarter of a mile thither and it would be the same distance down the river again before she regained her brother  i neednt bring you with me you know she said to fitzgerald you can get over the stones easily and i can go very well by myself  but it was not probable that he would let her do so why should i not go with you he said when i get there i have nothing to do but see him fish only if we were to leave him by himself he would not be happy  oh mr fitzgerald how very kind you are to him i do so often think of it how dull his holidays would be in this place if it were not for you  and what a godsend his holidays are to me said owen when they come round i can ride over here and see him and youand your mother do you think that i am not dull also living alone at hap house and that this is not an infinite blessing to me  he had named them allson daughter and mother but there had been a something in his voice an almost inappreciable something in his tone which had seemed to mark to claras hearing that she herself was not the least prized of the three attractions she had felt this rather than realized it and the feeling was not unpleasant  i only know that you are very goodnatured she continued and that patrick is very fond of you sometimes i think he almost takes you for a brother and then a sudden thought flashed across her mind and she said hardly a word more to him that evening  this had been at the close of the summer holidays after that he had been once or twice at desmond court before the return of the boy from eton but on these occasions he had been more with the countess than with her daughter on the last of these visits just before the holidays commenced he had gone over respecting a hunter he had bought for lord desmond and on this occasion he did not even see clara  the countess when she had thanked him for his trouble in the matter of the purchase hesitated a moment and then went on to speak of other matters  i understand mr fitzgerald said she that you have been very gay at hap house since the hunting commenced  oh i dont know said owen half laughing and half blushing its a convenient place for some of the men and one must be sociable  sociable yes one ought to be sociable certainly but i am always afraid of the sociability of young men without ladies do not be angry with me if i venture as a friend to ask you not to be too sociable  i know what you mean lady desmond people have been accusing us ofof being rakes isnt that it  yes mr fitzgerald that is it but then i know that i have no right to speak to you on such asuch a subject  yes yes you have every right said he warmly more right than any one else  oh no sir thomas you know  well yes sir thomas sir thomas is very well and so also is lady fitzgerald but i do not feel the same interest about them that i do about you and they are such humdrum quietgoing people as for herbert im afraid hell turn out a prig  well mr fitzgerald if you give me the right i shall use it and getting up from her chair and coming to him where he stood she looked kindly into his face it was a bonny handsome face for a woman to gaze on and there was much kindness in hers as she smiled on him nay there was almost more than kindness he thought as he caught her eye it was likealmost like the sweetness of motherly love and i shall scold you she continued people say that for two or three nights running men have been playing cards at hap house till morning  yes i had some men there for a week i could not take their candles away and put them to bed could i lady desmond  and there were late suppers and drinking of toasts and headaches in the morning and breakfast at three oclock and gentlemen with very pale faces when they appeared rather late at the meeteh mr fitzgerald and she held up one finger at him as she upbraided him with a smile the smile was so sweet so unlike her usual look that to tell the truth was often too sad and careworn for her age  such things do happen lady desmond  ah yes they do happen and with such a one as you heaven knows i do not begrudge the pleasure if it were but now and thenonce again and then done with but you are too bright and too good for such things to continue and she took his hand and pressed it as a mother or a mothers dearest friend might have done it would so grieve me to think that you should be even in danger of shipwreck  you will not be angry with me for taking this liberty she continued  angry how could any man be angry for such kindness  and you will think of what i say i would not have you unsociable or morose or inhospitable but  i understand lady desmond but when young men are together one cannot always control them  but you will try say that you will try because i have asked you  he promised that he would and then went his way proud in his heart at this solicitude and how could he not be proud was she not high in rank proud in character beautiful withal and the mother of clara desmond what sweeter friend could a man have what counsellor more potent to avert those dangers which now hovered round his head  and as he rode home he was half in love with the countess where is the young man who has not in his early years been half in love with some woman older much older than himself who has half conquered his heart by her solicitude for his welfarewith some woman who has whispered to him while others were talking who has told him in such gentle loving tones of his boyish follies whose tenderness and experience together have educated him and made him manly young men are so proud proud in their inmost hearts of such tenderness and solicitude as long as it remains secret and wrapt as it were in a certain mystery such liaisons have the interests of intrigue withouti was going to say without its dangers alas it may be that it is not always so  owen fitzgerald as he rode home was half in love with the countess not that his love was of a kind which made him in any way desirous of marrying her or of kneeling at her feet and devoting himself to her for ever not that it in any way interfered with the other love which he was beginning to feel for her daughter but he thought with pleasure of the tone of her voice of the pressure of her hand of the tenderness which he had found in her eye  it was after that time as will be understood that some goodnatured friend had told him that he was regarded in the county as the future husband of lady desmond at first he laughed at this as beingas he himself said to himselftoo good a joke when the report first reached him it seemed to be a joke which he could share so pleasantly with the countess for men of three and twenty though they are so fond of the society of women older than themselves understand so little the hearts and feelings of such women in his ideas there was an interval as of another generation between him and the countess in her thoughts the interval was probably much less striking  but the accusation was made to him again and again till it wounded him and he gave up that notion of a mutual joke with his kind friend at desmond court it did not occur to him that she could ever think of loving him as her lord and master but it was brought home to him that other people thought so  a year had now passed by since those winter holidays in which clara desmond had been sixteen and during which she was described by epithets which will not i fear have pleased my readers those epithets were now somewhat less deserved but still the necessity of them had not entirely passed away her limbs were still thin and long and her shoulders pointed but the growth of beauty had commenced and in owens eyes she was already very lovely  at christmastime during that winter a ball was given at castle richmond to celebrate the coming of age of the young heir it was not a very gay affair for the castle richmond folk even in those days were not very gay people sir thomas though only fifty was an old man for his age and lady fitzgerald though known intimately by the poor all round her was not known intimately by any but the poor mary and emmeline fitzgerald with whom we shall become better acquainted as we advance in our story were nice good girls and handsome withal but they had not that special gift which enables some girls to make a party in their own house bright in spite of all obstacles  we should have but little to do with this ball were it not that clara desmond was here first brought out as the term goes it was the first large party to which she had been taken and it was to her a matter of much wonder and inquiry with those wondering speaking eyes  and owen fitzgerald was thereas a matter of course the reader will say by no means so previous to that ball owens sins had been commented upon at castle richmond and sir thomas had expostulated with him these expostulations had not been received quite so graciously as those of the handsome countess and there had been anger at castle richmond  now there was living in the house of castle richmond one miss letty fitzgerald a maiden sister of the baronets older than her brother by full ten years in her character there was more of energy and also much more of harsh judgment and of consequent illnature than in that of her brother when the letters of invitation were being sent out by the two girls she had given a decided opinion that the reprobate should not be asked but the reprobates cousins with that partiality for a rake which is so common to young ladies would not abide by their aunts command and referred the matter both to mamma and papa mamma thought it very hard that their own cousin should be refused admittance to their house and very dreadful that his sins should be considered to be of so deep a dye as to require so severe a sentence and then papa much balancing the matter gave final orders that the prodigal cousin should be admitted  he was admitted and dangerously he used the privilege the countess who was there stood up to dance twice and twice only she opened the ball with young herbert fitzgerald the heir and in about an hour afterwards she danced again with owen he did not ask her twice but he asked her daughter three or four times and three or four times he asked her successfully  clara whispered the mother to her child after the last of these occasions giving some little pull or twist to her girls frock as she did so you had better not dance with owen fitzgerald again tonight people will remark about it  will they said clara and immediately sat down checked in her young happiness  not many minutes afterwards owen came up to her again may we have another waltz together i wonder he said  not tonight i think i am rather tired already and so she did not waltz again all the evening for fear she should offend him  but the countess though she had thus interdicted her daughters dancing with the master of hap house had not done so through any absolute fear to her her girl was still a child a child without a womans thoughts or any of a womans charms and then it was so natural that clara should like to dance with almost the only gentleman who was not absolutely a stranger to her lady desmond had been actuated rather by a feeling that it would be well that clara should begin to know other persons  by that feelingand perhaps unconsciously by another that it would be well that owen fitzgerald should be relieved from his attendance on the child and enabled to give it to the mother whether lady desmond had at that time realized any ideas as to her own interest in this young man it was at any rate true that she loved to have him near her she had refused to dance a second time with herbert fitzgerald she had refused to stand up with any other person who had asked her but with owen she would either have danced again or have kept him by her side while she explained to him with flattering frankness that she could not do so lest others should be offended  and owen was with her frequently through the evening she was taken to and from supper by sir thomas but any other takings that were incurred were done by him he led her from one drawingroom to another he took her empty coffeecup he stood behind her chair and talked to her and he brought her the scarf which she had left elsewhere and finally he put a shawl round her neck while old sir thomas was waiting to hand her to her carriage reader goodnatured middleaged reader remember that she was only thirtyeight and that hitherto she had known nothing of the delights of love by the young any such hallucination on her part at her years will be regarded as lunacy or at least frenzy  owen fitzgerald drove home from that ball in a state of mind that was hardly satisfactory in the first place miss letty had made a direct attack upon his morals which he had not answered in the most courteous manner  i have heard a great deal of your doings master owen she said to him a fine house youre keeping  why dont you come and join us aunt letty he replied it would be just the thing for you  god forbid said the old maid turning up her eyes to heaven  oh you might do worse you know with us youd only drink and play cards and perhaps hear a little strong language now and again but whats that to slander and calumny and bearing false witness against ones neighbour and so saying he ended that interviewnot in a manner to ingratiate himself with his relative miss letty fitzgerald  after that in the supperroom more than one wag of a fellow had congratulated him on his success with the widow shes got some sort of a jointure i suppose said one shes very younglooking certainly to be the mother of that girl declared another upon my word shes a handsome woman still said a third and what title will you get when you marry her fitz asked a fourth who was rather ignorant as to the phases under which the british peerage develops itself  fitzgerald pshawed and pished and poohed and then breaking away from them rode home he felt that he must at any rate put an end to this annoyance about the countess and that he must put an end also to his state of doubt about the countesss daughter clara had been kind and gracious to him in the first part of the evening nay almost more than gracious why had she been so cold when he went up to her on that last occasion why had she gathered herself like a snail into its shell for the rest of the evening  the young earl had also been at the party and had exacted a promise from owen that he would be over at desmond court on the next day it had almost been on owens lips to tell his friend not only that he would be there but what would be his intention when he got there he knew that the lad loved him well and almost fancied that earl as he was he would favour his friends suit but a feeling that lord desmond was only a boy restrained him it would not be well to induce one so young to agree to an arrangement of which in after and more mature years he would so probably disapprove  but not the less did fitzgerald as he drove home determine that on the next day he would know something of his fate and with this resolve he endeavoured to comfort himself as he drove up into his own avenue and betook himself to his own solitary home     chapter iii  clara desmond   it had been clara desmonds first ball and on the following morning she had much to occupy her thoughts in the first place had she been pleased or had she not had she been most gratified or most pained  girls when they ask themselves such questions seldom give themselves fair answers she had liked dancing with owen fitzgerald oh so much she had liked dancing with others too though she had not known them and had hardly spoken to them the mere act of dancing with the loud music in the room and the gay dresses and bright lights around her had been delightful but then it had pained hershe knew not why but it had pained herwhen her mother told her that people would make remarks about her had she done anything improper on this her first entry into the world was her conduct to be scanned and judged and condemned while she was flattering herself that no one had noticed her but him who was speaking to her  their breakfast was late and the countess sat as was her wont with her book beside her teacup speaking a word every now and again to her son  owen will be over here today said he we are going to have a schooling match down on the callows now in ireland a schooling match means the amusement of teaching your horses to jump  will he said lady desmond looking up from her book for a moment mind you bring him in to lunch i want to speak to him  he doesnt care much about lunch i fancy said he and maybe we shall be half way to millstreet by that time  never mind but do as i tell you you expect everybody to be as wild and wayward as yourself and the countess smiled on her son in a manner which showed that she was proud even of his wildness and his waywardness  clara had felt that she blushed when she heard that mr fitzgerald was to be there that morning she felt that her own manner became constrained and was afraid that her mother should look at her owen had said nothing to her about love and she child as she was had thought nothing about love but she was conscious of something she knew not what he had touched her hand during those dances as it had never been touched before he had looked into her eyes and her eyes had fallen before his glance he had pressed her waist and she had felt that there was tenderness in the pressure so she blushed and almost trembled when she heard that he was coming and was glad in her heart when she found that there was neither anger nor sunshine in her mothers face  not long after breakfast the earl went out on his horse and met owen at some gate or back entrance in his opinion the old house was stupid and the women in it were stupid companions in the morning his heart for the moment was engaged on the thought of making his animal take the most impracticable leaps which he could find and it did not occur to him at first to give his mothers message to his companion as for lunch they would get a biscuit and glass of cherrybrandy at wat mcarthys of drumban and as for his mother having anything to say that of course went for nothing  owen would have been glad to have gone up to the house but in that he was frustrated by the earls sharpness in catching him his next hope was to get through the promised lesson in horseleaping as quickly as possible so that he might return to desmond court and take his chance of meeting clara but in this he found the earl very difficult to manage  oh owen we wont go there he said when fitzgerald proposed a canter through some meadows down by the riverside there are only a few gripesirish for small ditchesand i have ridden fireball over them a score of times i want you to come away towards drumban  drumban why drumbans seven miles from here  what matter besides its not six the way ill take you i want to see wat mcarthy especially he has a litter of puppies there out of that black bitch of his and i mean to make him give me one of them  but on that morning owen fitzgerald would not allow himself to be taken so far afield as drumban even on a mission so important as this the young lord fought the matter stoutly but it ended by his being forced to content himself with picking out all the most dangerous parts of the fences in the river meadows  why youve hardly tried your own mare at all said the lad reproachfully  im going to hunt her on saturday said owen and shell have quite enough to do then  well youre very slow today youre done up with the dancing i think and what do you mean to do now  ill go home with you i think and pay my respects to the countess  bytheby i was to bring you in to lunch she said she wanted to see you by jingo i forgot all about it but youve all become very stupid among you i know that and so they rode back to desmond court entering the demesne by one of the straight dull level roads which led up to the house  but it did not suit the earl to ride on the road while the grass was so near him so they turned off with a curve across what was called the park thus prolonging their return by about double the necessary distance  as they were cantering on owen saw her of whom he was in quest walking in the road which they had left his best chance of seeing her alone had been that of finding her outside the house he knew that the countess rarely or never walked with her daughter and that as the governess was gone clara was driven to walk by herself  desmond he said pulling up his horse do you go on and tell your mother that i will be with her almost immediately  why where are you off to now  there is your sister and i must ask her how she is after the ball and so saying he trotted back in the direction of the road  lady clara had seen them and though she had hardly turned her head she had seen also how suddenly mr fitzgerald had stopped his horse and turned his course when he perceived her at the first moment she had been almost angry with him for riding away from her and now she felt almost angry with him because he did not do so  he slackened his pace as he came near her and approached her at a walk there was very little of the faint heart about owen fitzgerald at any time or in anything that he attempted he had now made up his mind fairly to tell clara desmond that he loved her and to ask for her love in return he had resolved to do so and there was very little doubt but that he would carry out his resolution but he had in nowise made up his mind how he should do it or what his words should be and now that he saw her so near him he wanted a moment to collect his thoughts  he took off his hat as he rode up and asked her whether she was tired after the ball and then dismounting he left his mare to follow as she pleased  oh mr fitzgerald wont she run away said clara as she gave him her hand  oh no she has been taught better than that but you dont tell me how you are i thought you were tired last night when i saw that you had altogether given over dancing and then he walked on beside her and the docile mare followed them like a dog  no i was not tired at least not exactly said clara blushing again and again being conscious that she blushed butbutyou know it was the first ball i was ever at  that is just the reason why you should have enjoyed it the more instead of sitting down as you did and being dull and unhappy for i know you were unhappy i could see it  was i said clara not knowing what else to say  yes and ill tell you what i could see more than that it was i that made you unhappy  you mr fitzgerald  yes i you will not deny it because you are so true i asked you to dance with me too often and because you refused me you did not like to dance with any one else i saw it all will you deny that it was so  oh mr fitzgerald poor girl she did not know what to say how to shape her speech into indifference how to assure him that he made himself out to be of too much consequence by far how to make it plain that she had not danced because there was no one there worth dancing with had she been out for a year or two instead of being such a novice she would have accomplished all this in half a dozen words as it was her telltale face confessed it all and she was only able to ejaculate oh mr fitzgerald  when i went there last night he continued i had only one wishone hope that was to see you pleased and happy i knew it was your first ball and i did so long to see you enjoy it  and so i did till  till what will you not let me ask  mamma said something to me and that stopped me from dancing  she told you not to dance with me was that it  how was it possible that she should have had a chance with him innocent young and ignorant as she was she did not tell him in words that so it had been but she looked into his face with a glance of doubt and pain that answered his question as plainly as any words could have done  of course she did and it was i that destroyed it all i that should have been satisfied to stand still and see you happy how you must have hated me  oh no indeed i did not i was not at all angry with you indeed why should i have been it was so kind of you wishing to dance with me  no it was selfishselfish in the extreme nothing but one thing could excuse me and that excuse  im sure you dont want any excuse mr fitzgerald  and that excuse clara was this that i love you with all my heart i had not strength to see you there and not long to have you near menot begrudge that you should dance with another i love you with all my heart and soul there lady clara now you know it all  the manner in which he made his declaration to her was almost fierce in its energy he had stopped in the pathway and she unconscious of what she was doing almost unconscious of what she was hearing had stopped also the mare taking advantage of the occasion was cropping the grass close to them and so for a few seconds they stood in silence  am i so bold lady clara said he when those few seconds had gone byam i so bold that i may hope for no answer but still she said nothing in lieu of speaking she uttered a long sigh and then fitzgerald could hear that she was sobbing  oh clara i love you so fondly so dearly so truly said he in an altered voice and with sweet tenderness i know my own presumption in thus speaking i know and feel bitterly the difference in our rank  icarenothingfor rank said the poor girl sobbing through her tears he was generous and she at any rate would not be less so no at that moment with her scanty seventeen years of experience with her ignorance of all that the world had in it of grand and great of high and rich she did care nothing for rank that owen fitzgerald was a gentleman of good lineage fit to mate with a lady that she did know for her mother who was a proud woman delighted to have him in her presence beyond this she cared for none of the conventionalities of life rank if she waited for rank where was she to look for friends who would love her earls and countesses barons and their baronesses were scarce there where fate had placed her under the shadow of the bleak mountains of muskerry her want her undefined want was that some one should love her of all men and women whom she had hitherto known this owen fitzgerald was the brightest the kindest the gentlest in his manner the most pleasant to look on and now he was there at her feet swearing that he loved herand then drawing back as it were in dread of her rank what did she care for rank  clara clara my clara can you learn to love me  she had made her one little effort at speaking when she attempted to repudiate the pedestal on which he affected to place her but after that she could for a while say no more but she still sobbed and still kept her eyes fixed upon the ground  clara say one word to me say that you do not hate me but just at that moment she had not one word to say  if you will bid me do so i will leave this country altogether i will go away and i shall not much care whither i can only stay now on condition of your loving me i have thought of this day for the last year past and now it has come  every word that he now spoke was gospel to her is it not always soshould it not be so always when love first speaks to loving ears what he had loved her for that whole twelvemonth that she had known him loved her in those days when she had been wont to look up into his face wondering why he was so nice so much nicer than any one else that came near her a year was a great deal to her and had he loved her through all those days and after that should she banish him from her house turn him away from his home and drive him forth unhappy and wretched ah no she could not be so unkind to himshe could not be so unkind to her own heart but still she sobbed and still she said nothing  in the mean time they had turned and were now walking back towards the house the gentlenatured mare still following at their heels they were walking slowlyvery slowly backjust creeping along the path when they saw lady desmond and her son coming to meet them on the road  there is your mother clara say one word to me before we meet them  oh mr fitzgerald i am so frightened what will mamma say  say about what as yet i do not know what she may have to say but before we meet her may i not hope to know what her daughter will say answer me this clara can you will you love me  there was still a pause a moments pause and then some sound did fall from her lips but yet it was so soft so gentle so slight that it could hardly be said to reach even a lovers ear fitzgerald however made the most of it whether it were yes or whether it were no he took it as being favourable and lady clara desmond gave him no sign to show that he was mistaken  my own own only loved one he said embracing her as it were with his words since the presence of her approaching mother forbade him even to take her hand in his i am happy now whatever may occur whatever others may say for i know that you will be true to me and remember thiswhatever others may say i also will be true to you you will think of that will you not love  this time she did answer him almost audibly yes she said and then she devoted herself to a vain endeavour to remove the traces of her tears before her mother should be close to them  fitzgerald at once saw that such endeavour must be vain at one time he had thought of turning away and pretending that they had not seen the countess but he knew that clara would not be able to carry out any such pretence and he reflected also that it might be just as well that lady desmond should know the whole at once that she would know it and know it soon he was quite sure she could learn it not only from clara but from himself he could not now be there at the house without showing that he both loved and knew that he was beloved and then why should lady desmond not know it why should he think that she would set herself against the match he had certainly spoken to clara of the difference in their rank but after all it was no uncommon thing for an earls daughter to marry a commoner and in this case the earls daughter was portionless and the lover desired no portion owen fitzgerald at any rate might boast that he was true and generous in his love  so he plucked up his courage and walked on with a smiling face to meet lady desmond and her son while poor clara crept beside him with eyes downcast and in an agony of terror  lady desmond had not left the house with any apprehension that there was aught amiss her son had told her that owen had gone off to do the civil to clara and as he did not come to the house within some twenty minutes after this she had proposed that they would go and meet him  did you tell him that i wanted him said the countess  oh yes i did and he is coming only he would go away to clara  then i shall scold him for his want of gallantry said lady desmond laughing as they walked out together from beneath the huge portal  but as soon as she was near enough to see the manner of their gait as they slowly came on towards her her womans tact told her that something was wrongand whispered to her also what might too probably be the nature of that something could it be possible she asked herself that such a man as owen fitzgerald should fall in love with such a girl as her daughter clara  what shall i say to mamma whispered clara to him as they all drew near together  tell her everything  but patrick  i will take him off with me if i can and then they were all together standing in the road  i was coming to obey your behests lady desmond said fitzgerald trying to look and speak as though he were at his ease  coming rather tardily i think said her ladyship not altogether playfully  i told him you wanted him as we were crossing to the house said the earl didnt i owen  is anything the matter with clara said lady desmond looking at her daughter  no mamma said clara and she instantly began to sob and cry  what is it sir and as she asked she turned to fitzgerald and her manner now at least had in it nothing playful  lady clara is nervous and hysterical the excitement of the ball has perhaps been too much for her i think lady desmond if you were to take her in with you it would be well  lady desmond looked up at him and he then saw for the first time that she could if she pleased look very stern hitherto her face had always worn smiles had at any rate always been pleasing when he had seen it he had never been intimate with her never intimate enough to care what her face was like till that day when he had carried her son up from the hall door to his room then her countenance had been all anxiety for her darling and afterwards it had been all sweetness for her darlings friend from that day to this present one lady desmond had ever given him her sweetest smiles  but fitzgerald was not a man to be cowed by any womans looks he met hers by a full front face in return he did not allow his eye for a moment to fall before hers and yet he did not look at her haughtily or with defiance but with an aspect which showed that he was ashamed of nothing that he had donewhether he had done anything that he ought to be ashamed of or no  clara said the countess in a voice which fell with awful severity on the poor girls ears you had better return to the house with me  yes mamma  and shall i wait on you tomorrow lady desmond said fitzgerald in a tone which seemed to the countess to be in the present state of affairs almost impertinent the man had certainly been misbehaving himself and yet there was not about him the slightest symptom of shame  yes no said the countess that is i will write a note to you if it be necessary good morning  goodbye lady desmond said owen and as he took off his hat with his left hand he put out his right to shake hands with her as was customary with him lady desmond was at first inclined to refuse the courtesy but she either thought better of such intention or else she had not courage to maintain it for at parting she did give him her hand  goodbye lady clara and he also shook hands with her and it need hardly be said that there was a lovers pressure in the grasp  goodbye said clara through her tears in the saddest soberest tone he was going away happy light hearted with nothing to trouble him but she had to encounter that fearful task of telling her own crime she had to depart with her motherher mother who though never absolutely unkind had so rarely been tender with her and then her brother  desmond said fitzgerald walk as far as the lodge with me like a good fellow i have something that i want to say to you  the mother thought for a moment that she would call her son back but then she bethought herself that she also might as well be without him so the young earl showing plainly by his eyes that he knew that much was the matter went back with fitzgerald towards the lodge  what is it you have done now said the earl the boy had some sort of an idea that the offence committed was with reference to his sister and his tone was hardly as gracious as was usual with him  this want of kindliness at the present moment grated on owens ears but he resolved at once to tell the whole story out and then leave it to the earl to take it in dudgeon or in brotherly friendship as he might please  desmond said he can you not guess what has passed between me and your sister  i am not good at guessing he answered brusquely  i have told her that i loved her and would have her for my wife and i have asked her to love me in return  there was an open manliness about this which almost disarmed the earls anger he had felt a strong attachment to fitzgerald and was very unwilling to give up his friendship but nevertheless he had an idea that it was presumption on the part of mr fitzgerald of hap house to look up to his sister between himself and owen the earls coronet never weighed a feather he could not have abandoned his boys heart to the mans fellowship more thoroughly had that man been an earl as well as himself but he could not get over the feeling that fitzgeralds worldly position was beneath that of his sisterthat such a marriage on his sisters part would be a mesalliance doubting therefore and in some sort dismayedand in some sort also angryhe did not at once give any reply  well desmond what have you to say to it you are the head of her family and young as you are it is right that i should tell you  tell me of course you ought to tell me i dont see what youngness has to do with it what did she say  well she said but little and a man should never boast that a lady has favoured him but she did not reject me he paused a moment and then added after all honesty and truth are the best i have reason to think that she loves me  the poor young lord felt that he had a double duty and hardly knew how to perform it he owed a duty to his sister which was paramount to all others but then he owed a duty also to the friend who had been so kind to him he did not know how to turn round upon him and tell him that he was not fit to marry his sister  and what do you say to it desmond  i hardly know what to say it would be a very bad match for her you you know are a capital fellow the best fellow going there is nobody about anywhere that i like so much  in thinking of your sister you should put that out of the question  yes thats just it i like you for a friend better than any one else but clara oughtoughtought  ought to look higher you would say  yes thats just what i mean i dont want to offend you you know  desmond my boy i like you the better for it you are a fine fellow and i thoroughly respect you but let us talk sensibly about this though your sisters rank is high  oh i dont want to talk about rank thats all bosh and i dont care about it but hap house is a small place and clara wouldnt be doing well and whats more i am quite sure the countess will not hear of it  you wont approve then  no i cant say i will  well that is honest of you i am very glad that i have told you at once clara will tell her mother and at any rate there will be no secrets goodbye old fellow  goodbye said the earl then they shook hands and fitzgerald rode off towards hap house lord desmond pondered over the matter some time standing alone near the lodge and then walked slowly back towards the mansion he had said that rank was all bosh and in so saying had at the moment spoken out generously the feelings of his heart but that feeling regarded himself rather than his sister and if properly analyzed would merely have signified that though proud enough of his own rank he did not require that his friends should be of the same standing but as regarded his sister he certainly would not be well pleased to see her marry a small squire with a small income     chapter iv  the countess   the countess as she walked back with her daughter towards the house had to bethink herself for a minute or two as to how she should act and what she would say she knew she felt that she knew what had occurred if her daughters manner had not told her the downcast eyes the repressed sobs the mingled look of shame and fearif she had not read the truth from these she would have learned it from the tone of fitzgeralds voice and the look of triumph which sat upon his countenance  and then she wondered that this should be so seeing that she had still regarded clara as being in all things a child and as she thought further she wondered at her own fatuity in that she had allowed herself to be so grossly deceived  clara said she what is all this  oh mamma  you had better come on to the house my dear and speak to me there in the mean time collect your thoughts and remember this clara that you have the honour of a great family to maintain  poor clara what had the great family done for her or how had she been taught to maintain its honour she knew that she was an earls daughter and that people called her lady clara whereas other young ladies were only called miss soandso but she had not been taught to separate herself from the ordinary throng of young ladies by any other distinction her great family had done nothing special for her nor placed before her for example any grandly noble deeds at that old house at desmond court company was scarce money was scarce servants were scarce she had been confided to the care of a very ordinary governess and if there was about her anything that was great or good it was intrinsically her own and by no means due to intrinsic advantages derived from her grand family why should she not give what was so entirely her own to one whom she loved to one by whom it so pleased her to be loved  and then they entered the house and clara followed her mother to the countesss own small upstairs sittingroom the daughter did not ordinarily share this room with her mother and when she entered it she seldom did so with pleasurable emotion at the present moment she had hardly strength to close the door after her  and now clara what is all this said the countess sitting down in her accustomed chair  all which mamma can any one blame her in that she so far equivocated  clara you know very well what i mean what has there been between you and mr fitzgerald  the guiltstricken wretch sat silent for a while sustaining the scrutiny of her mothers gaze and then falling from her chair on to her knees she hid her face in her mothers lap exclaiming oh mamma mamma do not look at me like that  lady desmonds heart was somewhat softened by this appeal nor would i have it thought that she was a cruel woman or an unnatural mother it had not been her lot to make an absolute dearest heartiest friend of her daughter as some mothers do a friend between whom and herself there should be nay could be no secrets she could not become young again in sharing the romance of her daughters love in enjoying the gaieties of her daughters balls in planning dresses amusements and triumphs with her child some mothers can do this and they i think are the mothers who enjoy most fully the delights of maternity this was not the case with lady desmond but yet she loved her child and would have made any reasonable sacrifice for what she regarded as that childs welfare  but my dear she said in a softened tone you must tell me what has occurred do you not know that it is my duty to ask and yours to tell me it cannot be right that there should be any secret understanding between yourself and mr fitzgerald you know that clara do you not  yes mamma said clara remembering that her lover had bade her tell her mother everything  well my love  claras story was very simple and did not in fact want any telling it was merely the old wellworn tale so common through all the world he had laughed on the lass with his bonny black eye and sheshe was ready to go to the mountain to hear a lovetale one may say that an occurrence so very common could not want much telling  mamma he says  well my dear  he says oh mamma i could not help it  no clara you certainly could not help what he might say to you you could not refuse to listen to him a lady in such a case when she is on terms of intimacy with a gentleman as you were with mr fitzgerald is bound to listen to him and to give him an answer you could not help what he might say clara the question now is what answer did you give to what he said  clara who was still kneeling looked up piteously into her mothers face sighed bitterly but said nothing  he told you that he loved you i suppose  yes mamma  and i suppose you gave him some answer eh my dear  the answer to this was another long sigh  but clara you must tell me it is absolutely necessary that i should know whether you have given him any hope and if so how much of course the whole thing must be stopped at once young as you are you cannot think that a marriage with mr owen fitzgerald would be a proper match for you to make of course the whole thing must cease at onceat once here there was another piteous sigh but before i take any steps i must know what you have said to him surely you have not told him that you have any feeling for him warmer than ordinary regard  lady desmond knew what she was doing very well she was perfectly sure that her daughter had pledged her troth to owen fitzgerald indeed if she made any mistake in the matter it was in thinking that clara had given a more absolute assurance of love than had in truth been extracted from her but she calculated and calculated wisely that the surest way of talking her daughter out of all hope was to express herself as unable to believe that a child of hers would own to love for one so much beneath her and to speak of such a marriage as a thing absolutely impossible her method of acting in this manner had the effect which she desired the poor girl was utterly frightened and began to fear that she had disgraced herself though she knew that she dearly loved the man of whom her mother spoke so slightingly  have you given him any promise clara  not a promise mamma  not a promise what then have you professed any regard for him but upon this clara was again silent  then i suppose i must believe that you have professed a regard for himthat you have promised to love him  no mamma i have not promised anything but when he asked me ii didnti didnt refuse him  it will be observed that lady desmond never once asked her daughter what were her feelings it never occurred to her to inquire even within her own heart as to what might be most conducive to her childs happiness she meant to do her duty by clara and therefore resolved at once to put a stop to the whole affair she now desisted from her interrogatories and sitting silent for a while looked out into the extent of flat ground before the house poor clara the while sat silent also awaiting her doom  clara said the mother at last all this must of course be made to cease you are very young very young indeed and therefore i do not blame you the fault is with himwith him entirely  no mamma  but i say it is he has behaved very badly and has betrayed the trust which was placed in him when he was admitted here so intimately as patricks friend  i am sure he has not intended to betray any trust said clara through her sobs the conviction was beginning to come upon her that she would be forced to give up her lover but she could not bring herself to hear so much evil spoken of him  he has not behaved like a gentleman continued the countess looking very stern and his visits here must of course be altogether discontinued i am sorry on your brothers account for patrick was very fond of him  not half so fond as i am thought clara to herself but she did not dare to speak her thoughts out loud  but i am quite sure that your brother young as he is will not continue to associate with a friend who has thought so slightly of his sisters honour of course i shall let mr fitzgerald know that he can come here no more and all i want from you is a promise that you will on no account see him again or hold any correspondence with him  that was all she wanted but clara timid as she was hesitated before she could give a promise so totally at variance with the pledge which she felt that she had given hardly an hour since to fitzgerald she knew and acknowledged to herself that she had given him a pledge although she had given it in silence how then was she to give this other pledge to her mother  you do not mean to say that you hesitate said lady desmond looking as though she were thunderstruck at the existence of such hesitation you do not wish me to suppose that you intend to persevere in such insanity clara i must have from you a distinct promiseor  what might be the dreadful alternative the countess did not at that minute say she perhaps thought that her countenance might be more effective than her speech and in thinking so she was probably right  it must be remembered that clara desmond was as yet only seventeen and that she was young even for that age it must be remembered also that she knew nothing of the worlds ways of her own privileges as a creature with a soul and heart of her own or of what might be the true extent of her mothers rights over her she had not in her enough of matured thought to teach her to say that she would make no promise that should bind her for ever but that for the present in her present state she would obey her mothers orders and thus the promise was exacted and given  if i find you deceiving me clara said the countess i will never forgive you  hitherto lady desmond may probably have played her part wellwell considering her object but she played it very badly in showing that she thought it possible that her daughter should play her false it was now claras turn to be proud and indignant  mamma she said holding her head high and looking at her mother boldly through her tears i have never deceived you yet  very well my dear i will take steps to prevent his intruding on you any further there may be an end of the matter now i have no doubt that he has endeavoured to use his influence with patrick but i will tell your brother not to speak of the matter further and so saying she dismissed her daughter  shortly afterwards the earl came in and there was a conference between him and his mother though they were both agreed on the subject though both were decided that it would not do for clara to throw herself away on a county cork squire with eight hundred a year a cadet in his family and a man likely to rise to nothing still the earl would not hear him abused  but patrick he must not come here any more said the countess  well i suppose not but it will be very dull i know that i wish clara hadnt made herself such an ass and then the boy went away and talked kindly over the matter to his poor sister  but the countess had another task still before her she must make known the family resolution to owen fitzgerald when her children had left her one after the other she sat at the window for an hour looking at nothing but turning over her own thoughts in her mind hitherto she had expressed herself as being very angry with her daughters lover so angry that she had said that he was faithless a traitor and no gentleman she had called him a dissipated spendthrift and had threatened his future wife if ever he should have one with every kind of misery that could fall to a womans lot but now she began to think of him perhaps more kindly  she had been very angry with himand the more so because she had such cause to be angry with herselfwith her own lack of judgment her own ignorance of the mans character her own folly with reference to her daughter she had never asked herself whether she loved fitzgeraldhad never done so till now but now she knew that the sharpest blow she had received that day was the assurance that he was indifferent to herself  she had never thought herself too old to be on an equality with himon such an equality in point of age as men and women feel when they learn to love each other and therefore it had not occurred to her that he could regard her daughter as other than a child to lady desmond clara was a child how then could she be more to him and yet now it was too plain that he had looked on clara as a woman in what light then must he have thought of that womans mother and so with saddened heart but subdued anger she continued to gaze through the window till all without was dusk and dark  there can be to a woman no remembrance of age so strong as that of seeing a daughter go forth to the world a married woman if that does not tell the mother that the time of her own youth has passed away nothing will ever bring the tale home it had not quite come to this with lady desmondclara was not going forth to the world as a married woman but here was one now who had judged her as fit to be so taken and this one was the very man of all others in whose estimation lady desmond would have wished to drop a few of the years that encumbered her  she was not however a weak woman and so she performed her task she had candles brought to her and sitting down she wrote a note to owen fitzgerald saying that she herself would call at hap house at an hour named on the following day  she had written three or four letters before she had made up her mind exactly as to the one she would send at first she had desired him to come to her there at desmond court but then she thought of the danger there might be of clara seeing himof the danger also of her own feelings towards him when he should be there with her in her own house in the accustomed way and she tried to say by letter all that it behoved her to say so that there need be no meeting but in this she failed one letter was stern and arrogant and the next was softhearted so that it might teach him to think that his love for clara might yet be successful at last she resolved to go herself to hap house and accordingly she wrote her letter and despatched it  fitzgerald was of course aware of the subject of the threatened visit when he determined to make his proposal to clara the matter did not seem to him to be one in which all chances of success were desperate if he thought he could induce the girl to love him other smaller difficulties might be made to vanish from his path he had now induced the girl to own that she did love him but not the less did he begin to see that the difficulties were far from vanishing lady desmond would never have taken upon herself to make a journey to hap house had not a sentence of absolute banishment from desmond court been passed against him  mr fitzgerald she began as soon as she found herself alone with him you will understand what has induced me to seek you here after your imprudence with lady clara desmond i could not of course ask you to come to desmond court  i may have been presumptuous lady desmond but i do not think that i have been imprudent i love your daughter dearly and i told her so immediately afterwards i told the same to her brother and she no doubt has told the same to you  yes she has mr fitzgerald clara as you are well aware is a child absolutely a child much more so than is usual with girls of her age the knowledge of this should i think have protected her from your advances  but i absolutely deny any such knowledge and more than that i think that you are greatly mistaken as to her character  mistaken sir as to my own daughter  yes lady desmond i think you are i think  on such a matter mr fitzgerald i need not trouble you for an expression of your thoughts nor need we argue that subject any further you must of course be aware that all ideas of any such marriage as this must be laid aside  on what grounds lady desmond  now this appeared to the countess to be rather impudent on the part of the young squire the reasons why he owen fitzgerald of hap house should not marry a daughter of an earl of desmond seemed to her to be so conspicuous and conclusive that it could hardly be necessary to enumerate them and such as they were it might not be pleasant to announce them in his hearing but though owen fitzgerald was so evidently an unfit suitor for an earls daughter it might still be possible that he should be acceptable to an earls widow ah if it might be possible to teach him the two lessons at the same time  on what grounds mr fitzgerald she said repeating his question surely i need hardly tell you did not my son say the same thing to you yesterday as he walked with you down the avenue  yes he told me candidly that he looked higher for his sister and i liked him for his candour but that is no reason that i should agree with him or which is much more important that his sister should do so if she thinks that she can be happy in such a home as i can give her i do not know why he or why you should object  you think then that i might give her to a blacksmith if she herself were mad enough to wish it  i thank you for the compliment lady desmond  you have driven me to it sir  i believe it is considered in the world said hethat is in our country that the one great difference is between gentlemen and ladies and those who are not gentlemen or ladies a lady does not degrade herself if she marry a gentleman even though that gentlemans rank be less high than her own  it is not a question of degradation but of prudenceof the ordinary caution which i as a mother am bound to use as regards my daughter oh mr fitzgerald and she now altered her tone as she spoke to him we have all been so pleased to know you so happy to have you there why have you destroyed all this by one halfhours folly  the folly as you call it lady desmond has been premeditated for the last twelve months  for twelve months said she taken absolutely by surprise and in her surprise believing him  yes for twelve months ever since i began to know your daughter i have loved her you say that your daughter is a child i also thought so this time last year in our last winter holidays i thought so then and though i loved her as a child i kept it to myself now she is a woman and so thinking i have spoken to her as one i have told her that i loved her as i now tell you that come what may i must continue to do so had she made me believe that i was indifferent to her absence perhaps and distance might have taught me to forget her but such i think is not the case  and you must forget her now  never lady desmond  nonsense sir a child that does not know her own mind that thinks of a lover as she does of some new toy whose first appearance in the world was only made the other night at your cousins house you ought to feel ashamed of such a passion mr fitzgerald  i am very far from being ashamed of it lady desmond  at any rate let me tell you this my daughter has promised me most solemnly that she will neither see you again nor have any correspondence with you and this i know of her that her word is sacred i can excuse her on account of her youth and young as she is she already sees her own folly in having allowed you so to address her but for you mr fitzgerald under all the circumstances i can make no excuse for you is yours do you think the sort of house to which a young girl should be brought as a bride is your life are your companions of that kind which could most profit her i am sorry that you drive me to remind you of these things  his face became very dark and his brow stern as his sins were thus cast into his teeth  and from what you know of me lady desmond he saidand as he spoke he assumed a dignity of demeanour which made her more inclined to love him than ever she had been beforedo you think that i should be the man to introduce a young wife to such companions as those to whom you allude do you not know are you not sure in your own heart that my marriage with your daughter would instantly put an end to all that  whatever may be my own thoughts and they are not likely to be unfavourable to youfor patricks sake i mean but whatever may be my own thoughts i will not subject my daughter to such a risk and mr fitzgerald you must allow me to say that your income is altogether insufficient for her wants and your own she has no fortune  i want none with her  andbut i will not argue the matter with you i did not come to argue it but to tell you with as little offence as may be possible that such a marriage is absolutely impossible my daughter herself has already abandoned all thoughts of it  her thoughts then must be wonderfully under her own control much more so than mine are  lord desmond you may be sure will not hear of it  lord desmond cannot at present be less of a child than his sister  i dont know that mr fitzgerald  at any rate lady desmond i will not put my happiness nor as far as i am concerned in it his sisters happiness at his disposal when i told her that i loved her i did not speak as you seem to think from an impulse of the moment i spoke because i loved her and as i love her i shall of course try to win her nothing can absolve me from my engagement to her but her marriage with another person  the countess had once or twice made small efforts to come to terms of peace with him or rather to a truce under which there might still be some friendship between themaccompanied however by a positive condition that clara should be omitted from any participation in it she would have been willing to say let all this be forgotten only for some time to come you and clara cannot meet each other but fitzgerald would by no means agree to such terms and the countess was obliged to leave his house having in effect only thrown down a gauntlet of battle having in vain attempted to extend over it an olivebranch of peace  he helped her however into her little pony carriage and at parting she gave him her hand he just touched it and then taking off his hat bowed courteously to her as she drove from his door     chapter v  the fitzgeralds of castle richmond   what idea of carrying out his plans may have been prevalent in fitzgeralds mind when he was so defiant of the countess it may be difficult to say probably he had no idea but felt at the spur of the moment that it would be weak to yield the consequence was that when lady desmond left hap house he was obliged to consider himself as being at feud with the family  the young lord he did see once again during the holidays and even entertained him at hap house but the earls pride would not give way an inch  much as i like you owen i cannot do anything but oppose it it would be a bad match for my sister and so youd feel if you were in my place and then lord desmond went back to eton  after that they none of them met for many months during this time life went on in a very triste manner at desmond court lady desmond felt that she had done her duty by her daughter but her tenderness to clara was not increased by the fact that her foolish attachment had driven fitzgerald from the place as for clara herself she not only kept her word but rigidly resolved to keep it twice she returned unopened and without a word of notice letters which owen had caused to be conveyed to her hand it was not that she had ceased to love him but she had high ideas of truth and honour and would not break her word perhaps she was sustained in her misery by the remembrance that heroines are always miserable  and then the orgies at hap house became hotter and faster hitherto there had perhaps been more smoke than fire more calumny than sin and fitzgerald when he had intimated that the presence of a young wife would save him from it all had not boasted falsely but now that his friends had turned their backs upon him that he was banished from desmond court and twitted with his iniquities at castle richmond he threw off all restraint and endeavoured to enjoy himself in his own way so the orgies became fast and furious all which of course reached the ears of poor clara desmond  during the summer holidays lord desmond was not at home but owen fitzgerald was also away he had gone abroad perhaps with the conviction that it would be well that he and the desmonds should not meet and he remained abroad till the hunting season again commenced then the winter came again and he and lord desmond used to meet in the field there they would exchange courtesies and to a certain degree show that they were intimate but all the world knew that the old friendship was over and indeed all the worldall the county cork worldsoon knew the reason and so we are brought down to the period at which our story was to begin  we have hitherto said little or nothing of castle richmond and its inhabitants but it is now time that we should do so and we will begin with the heir of the family at the period of which we are speaking herbert fitzgerald had just returned from oxford having completed his affairs there in a manner very much to the satisfaction of his father mother and sisters and to the unqualified admiration of his aunt miss letty i am not aware that the heads of colleges and supreme synod of dons had signified by any general expression of sentiment that herbert fitzgerald had so conducted himself as to be a standing honour and perpetual glory to the university but at castle richmond it was all the same as though they had done so there are some kindlyhearted softminded parents in whose estimation not to have fallen into disgrace shows the highest merit on the part of their children herbert had not been rusticated had not got into debt at least not to an extent that had been offensive to his fathers pocket he had not been plucked indeed he had taken honours in some low unnoticed degreeunnoticed that is at oxford but noticed at castle richmond by an ovationalmost by a triumph  but herbert fitzgerald was a son to gladden a fathers heart and a mothers eye he was not handsome as was his cousin owen not tall and stalwart and godlike in his proportions as was the reveller of hap house but nevertheless and perhaps not the less was he pleasant to look on he was smaller and darker than his cousin but his eyes were bright and full of good humour he was clean looking and clean made pleasant and courteous in all his habits attached to books in a moderate easy way but no bookworm he had a gentle affection for bindings and titlepages was fond of pictures of which it might be probable that he would some day know more than he did at present addicted to gothic architecture and already proprietor of the germ of what was to be a collection of coins  owen fitzgerald had called him a prig but herbert was no prig nor yet was he a pedant which word might perhaps more nearly have expressed his cousins meaning he liked little bits of learning the easy outsides and tags of classical acquirements which come so easily within the scope of the memory when a man has passed some ten years between a public school and a university but though he did love to chew the cud of these morsels of attic grass which he had cropped certainly without any great or sustained effort he had no desire to be ostentatious in doing so or to show off more than he knew indeed now that he was away from his college friends he was rather ashamed of himself than otherwise when scraps of quotations would break forth from him in his own despite looking at his true character it was certainly unjust to call him either a prig or a pedant  he was fond of the society of ladies and was a great favourite with his sisters who thought that every girl who saw him must instantly fall in love with him he was goodnatured and as the only son of a rich man was generally well provided with money such a brother is usually a favourite with his sisters he was a great favourite too with his aunt whose heart however was daily sinking into her shoes through the effect of one great terror which harassed her respecting him she feared that he had become a puseyite now that means much with some ladies in england but with most ladies of the protestant religion in ireland it means one may almost say the very father of mischief himself in their minds the pope with his lady of babylon his college of cardinals and all his community of pinchbeck saints holds a sort of second headquarters of his own at oxford and there his high priest is supposed to be one wicked infamous pusey and his worshippers are wicked infamous puseyites now miss letty fitzgerald was strong on this subject and little inklings had fallen from her nephew which robbed her of much of her peace of mind  it is impossible that these volumes should be graced by any hero for the story does not admit of one but if there were to be a hero herbert fitzgerald would be the man  sir thomas fitzgerald at this period was an old man in appearance though by no means an old man in years being hardly more than fifty why he should have withered away as it were into premature grayness and loss of the muscle and energy of life none knew unless indeed his wife did know but so it was he had one may say all that a kind fortune could give him he had a wife who was devoted to him he had a son on whom he doted and of whom all men said all good things he had two sweet happy daughters he had a pleasant house a fine estate position and rank in the world had it so pleased him he might have sat in parliament without any of the trouble and with very little of the expense which usually attends aspirants for that honour and as it was he might hope to see his son in parliament within a year or two for among other possessions of the fitzgerald family was the land on which stands the borough of kilcommon a borough to which the old reform bill was merciful as it was to so many others in the south of ireland  why then should sir thomas fitzgerald be a silent melancholy man confining himself for the last year or two almost entirely to his own study giving up to his steward the care even of his own demesne and farm never going to the houses of his friends and rarely welcoming them to his rarely as it was and never as it would have been had he been always allowed to have his own way  people in the surrounding neighbourhood had begun to say that sir thomass sorrow had sprung from shortness of cash and that money was not so easily to be had at castle richmond nowadays as was the case some ten years since if this were so the dearth of that very useful article could not have in any degree arisen from extravagance it was well known that sir thomass estate was large being of a value according to that public and wellauthenticated rentroll which the neighbours of a rich man always carry in their heads amounting to twelve or fourteen thousand a year now sir thomas had come into the unencumbered possession of this at an early age and had never been extravagant himself or in his family his estates were strictly entailed and therefore as he had only a life interest in them it of course was necessary that he should save money and insure his life to make provision for his daughters but by a man of his habits and his property such a burden as this could hardly have been accounted any burden at all that he did however in this mental privacy of his carry some heavy burden was made plain enough to all who knew him  and lady fitzgerald was in many things a counterpart of her husband not in health so much as in spirits she also was old for her age and woebegone not only in appearance but also in the inner workings of her heart but then it was known of her that she had undergone deep sorrows in her early youth which had left their mark upon her brow and their trace upon her inmost thoughts sir thomas had not been her first husband when very young she had been married or rather given in marriage to a man who in a very few weeks after that illfated union had shown himself to be perfectly unworthy of her  her story or so much of it as was known to her friends was this her father had been a clergyman in dorsetshire burdened with a small income and blessed with a large family she who afterwards became lady fitzgerald was his eldest child and as miss wainwrightmary wainwrighthad grown up to be the possessor of almost perfect female loveliness while she was yet very young a widower with an only boy a man who at that time was considerably less than thirty had come into her fathers parish having rented there a small huntingbox this gentlemanwe will so call him in lack of some other termimmediately became possessed of an establishment at any rate eminently respectable he had three hunters two grooms and a gig and on sundays went to church with a prayerbook in his hand and a black coat on his back what more could be desired to prove his respectability  he had not been there a month before he was intimate in the parsons house before two months had passed he was engaged to the parsons daughter before the full quarter had flown by he and the parsons daughter were man and wife and in five months from the time of his first appearance in the dorsetshire parish he had flown from his creditors leaving behind him his three horses his two grooms his gig his wife and his little boy  the dorsetshire neighbours and especially the dorsetshire ladies had at first been loud in their envious exclamations as to miss wainwrights luck the parson and the parsons wife and poor mary wainwright herself had according to the sayings of that moment prevalent in the county used most unjustifiable wiles in trapping this poor rich stranger miss wainwright as they all declared had not clothes to her back when she went to him the matter had been got up and managed in most indecent hurry so as to rob the poor fellow of any chance of escape and thus all manner of evil things were said in which envy of the bride and pity of the bridegroom were equally commingled  but when the sudden news came that mr talbot had bolted and when after a weeks inquiry no one could tell whither mr talbot had gone the objurgations of the neighbours were expressed in a different tone then it was declared that mr wainwright had sacrificed his beautiful child without making any inquiry as to the character of the stranger to whom he had so recklessly given her the pity of the county fell to the share of the poor beautiful girl whose welfare and happiness were absolutely ruined and the parson was pulled to pieces for his sordid parsimony in having endeavoured to rid himself in so disgraceful a manner of the charge of one of his children  it would be beyond the scope of my story to tell here of the anxious family councils which were held in that parsonage parlour during the time of that daughters courtship there had been misgivings as to the stability of the wooer there had been an anxious wish not to lose for the penniless daughter the advantage of a wealthy match the poor girl herself had been much crossquestioned as to her own feelings but let them have been right or let them have been wrong at that parsonage the matter was settled very speedily as we have seen and mary wainwright became mrs talbot when she was still almost a child  and then mr talbot bolted and it became known to the dorsetshire world that he had not paid a shilling for rent or for butchers meat for his human family or for oats for his equine family during the whole period of his sojourn at chevychase lodge grand references had been made to a london banker which had been answered by assurances that mr talbot was as good as the bank of england but it turned out that the assurances were forged and that the letter of inquiry addressed to the london banker had been intercepted in short it was all ruin roguery and wretchedness  and very wretched they all were the old father the young bride and all that parsonage household after much inquiry something at last was discovered the man had a sister whose whereabouts was made out and she consented to receive the childon condition that the bairn should not come to her emptyhanded in order to get rid of this burden mr wainwright with great difficulty made up thirty pounds  and then it was discovered that the mans name was not talbot what it was did not become known in dorsetshire for the poor wife resumed her maiden namewith very little right to do so as her kind neighbours observedtill fortune so kindly gave her the privilege of bearing another honourably before the world  and then other inquiries and almost endless search was made with reference to that miscreantnot quite immediatelyfor at the moment of the blow such search seemed to be but of little use but after some months when the first stupor arising from their grief had passed away and when they once more began to find that the fields were still green and the sun warm and that gods goodness was not at an end  and the search was made not so much with reference to him as to his fate for tidings had reached the parsonage that he was no more the period was that in which paris was occupied by the allied forces when our general the duke of wellington was paramount in the french capital and the tuileries and champs elys√©es were swarming with englishmen  report at the time was brought home that the soidisant talbot fighting his battles under the name of chichester had been seen and noted in the gamblinghouses of paris that he had been forcibly extruded from some such chamber for nonpayment of a gambling debt that he had made one in a violent fracas which had subsequently taken place in the french streets and that his body had afterwards been identified in the morgue  such was the story which bit by bit reached mr wainwrights ears and at last induced him to go over to paris so that the absolute and proofsustained truth of the matter might be ascertained and made known to all men the poor mans search was difficult and weary the ways of paris were not then so easy to an englishman as they have since become and mr wainwright could not himself speak a word of french but nevertheless he did learn much so much as to justify him as he thought in instructing his daughter to wear a widows cap that talbot had been kicked out of a gamblinghouse in the rue richelieu was absolutely proved an acquaintance who had been with him in dorsetshire on his first arrival there had seen this done and bore testimony of the fact that the man so treated was the man who had taken the huntinglodge in england this same acquaintance had been one of the party adverse to talbot in the row which had followed and he could not therefore be got to say that he had seen him dead but other evidence had gone to show that the man who had been so extruded was the man who had perished and the french lawyer whom mr wainwright had employed at last assured the poor brokenhearted clergyman that he might look upon it as proved had he not been dead said the lawyer the inquiry which has been made would have traced him out alive and thus his daughter was instructed to put on her widows cap and her mother again called her mrs talbot  indeed at that time they hardly knew what to call her or how to act in the wisest and most befitting manner among those who had truly felt for them in their misfortunes who had really pitied them and encountered them with loving sympathy the kindest and most valued friend had been the vicar of a neighbouring parish he himself was a widower without children but living with him at that time and reading with him was a young gentleman whose father was just dead a baronet of large property and an irishman this was sir thomas fitzgerald  it need not now be told how this young mans sympathies were also excited or how sympathy had grown into love in telling our tale we fain would not dwell much on the cradledom of our meleager the young widow in her widows cap grew to be more lovely than she had ever been before her miscreant husband had seen her they who remembered her in those days told wondrous tales of her surprising lovelinesshow men from london would come down to see her in the parish church how she was talked of as the dorsetshire venus only that unlike venus she would give a hearing to no man how sad she was as well as lovely and how impossible it was found to win a smile from her  but though she could not smile she could love and at last she accepted the love of the young baronet and then the father who had so grossly neglected his duty when he gave her in marriage to an unknown rascally adventurer endeavoured to atone for such neglect by the severest caution with reference to this new suitor further inquiries were made sir thomas went over to paris himself with that other clergyman lawyers were employed in england to sift out the truth and at last by the united agreement of some dozen men all of whom were known to be worthy it was decided that talbot was dead and that his widow was free to choose another mate another mate she had already chosen and immediately after this she was married to sir thomas fitzgerald  such was the early lifestory of lady fitzgerald and as this was widely known to those who lived around herfor how could such a lifestory as that remain untoldno one wondered why she should be gentle and silent in her lifes course that she had been an excellent wife a kind and careful mother a loving neighbour to the poor and courteous neighbour to the rich all the county cork admitted she had lived down envy by her gentleness and soft humility and every one spoke of her and her retiring habits with sympathy and reverence  but why should her husband also be so sadnay so much sadder for lady fitzgerald though she was gentle and silent was not a sorrowful womanotherwise than she was made so by seeing her husbands sorrow she had been to him a loving partner and no man could more tenderly have returned a wifes love than he had done one would say that all had run smoothly at castle richmond since the house had been made happy after some years of waiting by the birth of an eldest child and heir but nevertheless those who knew most of sir thomas saw that there was a peacock on the wall  it is only necessary to say further a word or two as to the other ladies of the family and hardly necessary to say that mary and emmeline fitzgerald were both cheerful girls i do not mean that they were boisterous laughers that in waltzing they would tear round a room like human steamengines that they rode well to hounds as some young ladies nowadays doand some young ladies do ride very well to hounds nor that they affected slang and decked their persons with odds and ends of masculine costume in saying that they were cheerful i by no means wish it to be understood that they were loud  they were pretty too but neither of them lovely as their mother had beenhardly indeed so lovely as that pale mother was now even in these latter days ah how very lovely that pale mother was as she sat still and silent in her own place on the small sofa by the slight small table which she used her hair was gray and her eyes sunken and her lips thin and bloodless but yet never shall i see her equal for pure feminine beauty for form and outline for passionless grace and sweet gentle womanly softness all her sad tale was written upon her brow all its sadness and all its poetry one could read there the fearful all but fatal danger to which her childhood had been exposed and the daily thanks with which she praised her god for having spared and saved her  but i am running back to the mother in attempting to say a word about her children of the two emmeline the younger was the more like her but no one who was a judge of outline could imagine that emmeline at her mothers age would ever have her mothers beauty nevertheless they were fine handsome girls more popular in the neighbourhood than any of their neighbours well educated sensible feminine and useful fitted to be the wives of good men  and what shall i say of miss letty she was ten years older than her brother and as strong as a horse she was great at walking and recommended that exercise strongly to all young ladies as an antidote to every ill from love to chilblains she was short and dapper in person not ugly excepting that her nose was long and had a little bump or excrescence at the end of it she always wore a bonnet even at meal times and was supposed by those who were not intimately acquainted with the mysteries of her toilet to sleep in it often indeed she did sleep in it and gave unmusical evidence of her doing so she was not illnatured but so strongly prejudiced on many points as to be equally disagreeable as though she were so with her as with the world in general religion was the point on which those prejudices were the strongest and the peculiar bent they took was horror and hatred of popery as she lived in a country in which the roman catholic was the religion of all the poorer classes and of very many persons who were not poor there was ample scope in which her horror and hatred could work she was charitable to a fault and would exercise that charity for the good of papists as willingly as for the good of protestants but in doing so she always remembered the good cause she always clogged the flannel petticoat with some protestant teaching or burdened the little coat and trousers with the pains and penalties of idolatry  when her brother had married the widow talbot her anger with him and her hatred towards her sisterinlaw had been extreme but time and conviction had worked in her so thorough a change that she now almost worshipped the very spot in which lady fitzgerald habitually sat she had the faculty to know and recognize goodness when she saw it and she had known and recognized it in her brothers wife  him also her brother himself she warmly loved and greatly reverenced she deeply grieved over his state of body and mind and would have given all she ever had even her very self to restore him to health and happiness  the three children of course she loved and petted and scolded and as children bothered them out of all their peace and quietness to the girls she was still almost as great a torment as in their childish days nevertheless they still loved and sometimes obeyed her of herbert she stood somewhat more in awe he was the future head of the family and already a bachelor of arts in a very few years he would probably assume the higher title of a married man of arts she thought and perhaps the less formidable one of a member of parliament also him therefore she treated with deference but alas what if he should become a puseyite     chapter vi  the kanturk hotel south main street cork   all the world no doubt knows south main street in the city of cork in the ould ancient days south and north main streets formed the chief thoroughfare through the city and hence of course they derived their names but now since patrick street and grand parade and the south mall have grown up main street has but little honour it is crowded with secondrate tobacconists and thirdrate grocers the houses are dirty and the street is narrow fashionable ladies never visit it for their shopping nor would any respectable commercial gent stop at an inn within its purlieus  but here in south main street at the time of which i am writing there was an inn or publichouse called the kanturk hotel in dear old ireland they have some foibles and one of them is a passion for high nomenclature those who are accustomed to the sort of establishments which are met with in england and much more in germany and switzerland under the name of hotels might be surprised to see the place in south main street which had been dignified with the same appellation it was a small dingy house of three stories the front door of which was always open and the passage strewed with damp dirty straw on the lefthand side as you entered was a sittingroom or coffeeroom as it was announced to be by an appellation painted on the door there was but one window to the room which looked into the street and was always clouded by a dingyred curtain the floor was uncarpeted nearly black with dirt and usually half covered with fragments of damp straw brought into it by the feet of customers a strong smell of hot whisky and water always prevailed and the straggling mahogany table in the centre of the room whose rickety legs gave way and came off whenever an attempt was made to move it was covered by small greasy circles the impressions of the bottoms of tumblers which had been made by the overflowing tipple over the chimney there was a round mirror the framework of which was bedizened with all manner of wouldbe gilt ornaments which had been cracked and twisted and mended till it was impossible to know what they had been intended to represent and the whole affair had become a huge receptacle of dust which fell in flakes upon the chimneypiece when it was invaded there was a second table opposite the window more rickety than that in the centre and against the wall opposite to the fireplace there was an old sideboard in the drawers of which tom the oneeyed waiter kept knives and forks and candleends and bits of bread and dusters there was a sour smell as of old rancid butter about the place to which the guests sometimes objected little inclined as they generally were to be fastidious but this was a tender subject and not often alluded to by those who wished to stand well in the good graces of tom many things much annoyed tom but nothing annoyed him so fearfully as any assertion that the air of the kanturk hotel was not perfectly sweet and wholesome  behind the coffeeroom was the bar from which fanny odwyer dispensed dandies of punch and goes of brandy to her fathers customers from kanturk for at this as at other similar publichouses in irish towns the greater part of the custom on which the publican depends came to him from the inhabitants of one particular country district a large fourwheeled vehicle called a long car which was drawn by three horses and travelled over a mountain road at the rate of four irish miles an hour came daily from kanturk to cork and daily returned this public conveyance stopped in cork at the kanturk hotel and was owned by the owner of that house in partnership with a brother in the same trade located in kanturk it was mr odwyers business to look after this concern to see to the passengers and the booking the oats and hay and stabling while his wellknown daughter the charming fanny odwyer took care of the house and dispensed brandy and whisky to the customers from kanturk  to tell the truth the bar was a much more alluring place than the coffeeroom and fanny odwyer a more alluring personage than tom the oneeyed waiter this elysium however was not open to all comersnot even to all comers from kanturk those who had the right of entry well knew their privilege and so also did they who had not this sanctum was screened off from the passage by a window which opened upwards conveniently as is customary with barwindows but the window was blinded inside by a red curtain so that fannys stool near the counter her fathers wooden armchair and the old horsehair sofa on which favoured guests were wont to sit were not visible to the public at large  of the upstair portion of this establishment it is not necessary to say much it professed to be an hotel and accommodation for sleeping was to be obtained there but the wellbeing of the house depended but little on custom of this class  nor need i say much of the kitchen a graphic description of which would not be pleasing here lived a cook who together with tom the waiter did all that servants had to do at the kanturk hotel from this kitchen lumps of beef mutton chops and potatoes did occasionally emanate all perfumed with plenteous onions as also did fried eggs with bacon an inch thick and other culinary messes too horrible to be thought of but drinking rather than eating was the staple of this establishment such was the kanturk hotel in south main street cork  it was on a disagreeable cold sloppy raw winter eveningan evening drizzling sometimes with rain and sometimes with sleetthat an elderly man was driven up to the door of the hotel on a onehorse caror jingle as such conveniences were then called in the south of ireland he seemed to know the house for with his outside coat all dripping as it was he went direct to the barwindow and as fanny odwyer opened the door he walked into that warm precinct there he encountered a gentleman dressed one would say rather beyond the merits of the establishment who was taking his ease at full length on fannys sofa and drinking some hot compound which was to be seen in a tumbler on the chimneyshelf just above his head it was now six oclock in the evening and the gentleman no doubt had dined  well aby here i am as large as life but as cold as death ugh what an affair that coach is fanny my best of darlings give me a drop of something thats best for warming the cockles of an old mans heart  a young wife then is the best thing in life to do that mr mollett said fanny sharply preparing however at the same time some mixture which might be taken more instantaneously  the governors had enough of that receipt already said the man on the sofa or rather the man now off the sofa for he had slowly arisen to shake hands with the new comer  this latter person proceeded to divest himself of his dripping greatcoat here tom said he bring your old cyclops eye to bear this way will you go and hang that up in the kitchen not too near the fire now and get me something to eat none of your mutton chops but a beefsteak if there is such a thing in this benighted place well aby how goes on the war  it was clear that the elderly gentleman was quite at home in his present quarters for tom far from resenting such impertinence as he would immediately have done had it proceeded from an ordinary kanturk customer declared that he would do his honours bidding av there was such a thing as a beefsteak to be had anywheres in the city of cork  and indeed the elderly gentleman was a person of whom one might premise judging by his voice and appearance that he would probably make himself at home anywhere he was a hale hearty man of perhaps sixty years of age who had certainly been handsome and was even now not the reverse or rather one may say that he would have been so were it not that there was a low restless cunning legible in his mouth and eyes which robbed his countenance of all manliness he was a hale man and well preserved for his time of life but nevertheless the extra rubicundity of his face and certain incipient pimply excrescences about his nose gave tokens that he lived too freely he had lived freely and were it not that his constitution had been more than ordinarily strong and that constant exercise and exposure to air had much befriended him those pimply excrescences would have shown themselves in a more advanced stage such was mr mollett seniormr matthew mollett with whom it will be soon our fate to be better acquainted  the gentleman who had slowly risen from the sofa was his son mr mollett juniormr abraham mollett with whom also we shall become better acquainted the father has been represented as not being exactly prepossessing but the son according to my ideas was much less so he also would be considered handsome by some personsby women chiefly of the fanny odwyer class whose eyes are capable of recognizing what is good in shape and form but cannot recognize what is good in tone and character mr abraham mollett was perhaps some thirty years of age or rather more he was a very smart man with a profusion of dark muchoiled hair with dark copious mustachoesand mustachoes being then not common as they are now added to his otherwise rakish vulgar appearancewith various rings on his not wellwashed hands with a frilled front to his not lately washed shirt with a velvet collar to his coat and patentleather boots upon his feet  free living had told more upon him young as he was than upon his father his face was not yet pimply but it was red and bloated his eyes were bloodshot and protruding his hand on a morning was unsteady and his passion for brandy was stronger than that for beefsteaks whereas his fathers appetite for solid food had never flagged those who were intimate with the family and were observant of men were wont to remark that the son would never fill the fathers shoes these family friends i may perhaps add were generally markers at billiardtables head grooms at racecourses or other men of that sharp discerning class seeing that i introduce these gentlemen to my readers at the kanturk hotel in south main street cork it may be perhaps as well to add that they were both englishmen so that mistakes on that matter may be avoided  the father as soon as he had rid himself of his upper coat his dripping hat and his goloshes stood up with his back to the barroom fire with his hands in his trouserspockets and the tails of his coat stuck inside his arms  i tell you aby it was cold enough outside that infernal coach im blessed if ive a morsel of feeling in my toes yet why the d dont they continue the railway on to cork its as much as a mans life is worth to travel in that sort of way at this time of the year  youll have more of it then if you intend going out of town tomorrow said the son  well i dont know that i shall i shall take a day to consider of it i think  consideration be bothered said mollett junior strike when the irons hot thats my motto  the father here turned half round to his son and winked at him nodding his head slightly towards the girl thereby giving token that according to his ideas the conversation could not be discreetly carried on before a third person  all right said the son lifting his joram of brandy and water to his mouth an action in which he was immediately imitated by his father who had now received the means of doing so from the hands of the fair fanny  and how about a bed my dear said mollett senior thats a matter of importance too or will be when we are getting on to the little hours  oh we wont turn you out mr mollett said fanny well find a bed for you never fear  thats all right then my little venus and now if i had some dinner id sit down and make myself comfortable for the evening  as he said this fanny slipped out of the room and ran down into the kitchen to see what tom and the cook were doing the molletts father and son were rather more than ordinary good customers at the kanturk hotel and it was politic therefore to treat them well mr mollett junior moreover was almost more than a customer and for the sake of the son fanny was anxious that the father should be well treated  well governor and what have you done said the younger man in a low voice jumping up from his seat as soon as the girl had left them alone  well ive got the usual remittance from the man in bucklersbury that was all as right as a trivet  and no more than that then i tell you what it is we must be down on him at once  but you forget that i got as much more last month out of the usual course come aby dont you be unreasonable  botheri tell you governor if he dont and then miss odwyer returned to her sanctum and the rest of the conversation was necessarily postponed  hes managed to get you a lovely steak mr mollett said fanny pronouncing the word as though it were written steek and weve beautiful pickled walnuts havent we mr aby and therell be kidneys biled meaning potatoes by the time the steeks ready you like it with the gravy in dont you mr mollett and as she spoke she drew a quartern of whisky for two of beamish and crawfords draymen who stood outside in the passage and drank it at the bar  the lovely steek with the gravy in itthat is to say nearly rawwas now ready and father and son adjourned to the next room well tom my lad of wax and hows the world using you said mr mollett senior  there aint much difference then said tom i aint no younger nor yet no richer than when yer honour left usand what ist to be sira pint of stout sir  as soon as mr mollett senior had finished his dinner and tom had brought the father and son materials for making whiskypunch they both got their knees together over the fire and commenced the confidential conversation which miss odwyer had interrupted on her return to the barroom they spoke now almost in a whisper with their heads together over the fender knowing from experience that what tom wanted in eyes he made up in ears  and what did prendergast say when he paid you the rhino asked the son  not a word said the other after all i dont think he knows any more than a ghost what he pays it for i think he gets fresh instructions every time but any ways there it was all right  hall right indeed i do believe youd be satisfied to go on getting a few dribblets now and then like that and then if anything appened to you why i might go fish  how aby look here  its hall very well governor but ill tell you what since you started off ive been thinking a good deal about it and ive made up my mind that this shillyshallying wont do any good we must strike a blow thatll do something for us  well i dont think weve done so bad already taking it allinall  ah thats because you havent the pluck to strike a good blow now ill just let you know what i proposeand i tell you fairly governor if youll not hear reason ill take the game into my own hands  the father looked up from his drink and scowled at his son but said nothing in answer to this threat  by g i will continued aby its no use umbugging and i mean to make myself understood while youve been gone ive been down to that place  you avent seen the old man  no i avent taken that step yet but i think its very likely i may before long if you wont hear reason  i was a d fool aby ever to let you into the affair at all its been going on quiet enough for the last ten years till i let you into the secret  well never mind about that that mischiefs done but i think youll find ill pull you through a deal better than hever youd have pulled through yourself youre already making twice more out of it than you did before i knew it as i was saying i went down there and in my quiet way i did just venture on a few hinquiries  ill be bound you did youll blow it all in about another month and then itll be up with the lot of us  its a beautiful place a lovely spot and hall in prime horder they say its fifteen thousand a year and that theres not a shilling howing on the whole property even in these times the tenants are paying the rent when no one else far and near is getting a penny out of them i went by another place on the roadcastle desmond they call it and i wish youd seen the difference the old boy must be rolling in money  i dont believe it theres one as i can trust has told me hes hard up enough sometimes why weve had twelve hundred in the last eight months  twelve hundred and whats that but dickens governor where has the twelve hundred gone ive only seen three of it and part of that well what do you want there you longeared shark you these last words were addressed to tom who had crept into the room certainly without much preparatory noise  i was only wanting the thingumbob yer honour said tom pretending to search diligently in the drawer for some required article  then take your thingumbob quickly out of that and be d to you and look here if you dont knock at the door when next you come in by heavens ill throw this tumbler at your yead  sure and i will yer honour said tom withdrawing  and where on hearth has the twelve hundred pounds gone asked the son looking severely at the father  old mr mollett made no immediate answer in words but putting his left hand to his right elbow began to shake it  i do wonder that you keep hon at that work said mollett junior reproachfully you never by any chance have a stroke of luck  well i have been unfortunate lately but who knows whats coming and i was deucedly sold by those fellows at the october meeting if any chap ever was safe i ought to have been safe then but hang me if i didnt drop four hundred of sir thomass shiners coolly on the spot that was the only big haul ive had out of him all at once and the most of it went like water through a sieve within fortyeight hours after i touched it and then having finished this pathetical little story of his misfortune mr mollett senior finished his glass of toddy  its the way of the world governor and its no use sighing after spilt milk but ill tell you what i propose and if you dont like the task yourself i have no hobjection in life to take it into my own hands you see the games so much our own that theres nothing on hearth for us to fear  i dont know that if we were all blown where should we be  why shes your own  hhsh aby theres that confounded longeared fellow at the keyhole as sure as my names matthew and if he hears you the games all up with a vengeance  lord bless you what could he hear besides talking as we are now he wouldnt catch a word even if he were in the room itself and now ill tell you what it is do you go down yourself and make your way into the hold gentlemans room just send your own name in boldly nobody will know what that means except himself  i did that once before and i never shall forget it  yes you did it once before and you have had a steady income to live on ever since not such an income as you might have had not such an income as will do for you and me now that we both know so well what a fine property we have under our thumbs but nevertheless that little visit has been worth something to you  upon my word aby i never suffered so much as i did that day i didnt know till then that i had a soft heart  soft heart oh bother such stuff as that always makes me sick if i ate anything its maudlin your former visit down there did very well and now you must make another or else by the holy poker ill make it for you  and what would you have me say to him if i did manage to see him  perhaps id better go  thats out of the question he wouldnt see you or understand who you were and then youd make a row and it would all come out and the fat would be in the fire  well i guess i should not take it quite quiet if they didnt treat me as a gentleman should be treated i aint always overquiet if im put upon  if you go near that house at all ill have done with it ill give up the game  well do you go at any rate first perhaps it may be well that i should follow after with a reminder do you go down and just tell him this quite coolly remember  oh i shall be cool enough  that considering hall things you think he and you ought to  well  just divide it between you share and share alike say its fourteen thousandand its more than thatthat would be seven for him and seven for you tell him youll agree to that but you wont take one farthing less  aby said the father almost overcome by the grandeur of his sons ideas  well and what of haby whats the matter now  expect him to shell out seven thousand pounds a year  and why not hell do a deal more than that i expect if he were quite sure that it would make all things serene but it wont and therefore you must make him another hoffer  another offer  yes hell know well enough that youll be thinking of his death and for all they do say he might pop off any day  hes a younger man than me aby by full ten years  what of that you may pop off any day too maynt you i believe you old fellows dont think of dying nigh as hoften as we young ones  you young ones are always looking for us old ones to go we all know that well enough  thats when youve got anything to leave behind you which haint the case with you governor just at present but what i was saying is this hell know well enough that you can split upon his son hafter hes gone every bit as well as you can split on him now  oh i always looked to make the young gentleman pay up handsome if so be the old gentleman went off the hooks and if so be he and i should go off together like why youd carry on of course youll have the proofs you know  oh i should should i well well look to them byandby but ill tell you what governor the best way is to make all that safe well make him another hofferfor a regular substantial family harrangement  a family arrangement eh  yes thats the way they always manage things when great family hinterests is at stake let him give us a cool seven thousand a year between us while hes alive let him put you down for twenty thousand when hes deadthatd come out of the young gentlemans share of the property of courseand then let him give me his daughter hemmeline with another twenty thousand tacked on to her skirttail i should be mum then for hever for the honour of the family  the father for a moment or two was struck dumb by the magnitude of his sons proposition thats what i call playing the game firm continued the son do you lay down your terms before him substantial and then stick to em thems my terms sir thomas youll say if you dont like em as i cant halter why in course ill go elsewhere do you be firm to that and youll see how the gamell go  and you think hell give you his daughter in marriage  why not im honest born haint i and shes a bastard  but aby you dont know what sort of people these are you dont know what her breeding has been  d her breeding i know this shed get a deuced pretty fellow for her husband and one that girls as good as her has hankered hafter long enough it wont do governor to let people as is in their position pick and choose like weve the hupper hand and we must do the picking and choosing  shed never have you aby not if her father went down on his knees to her to ask her  oh wouldnt she by heaven then she shall and that without any kneeling at all she shall have me and be deuced glad to take me what shed refuse a fellow like me when she knows that she and all belonging to herd be turned into the streets if she dont have me im clear of another way of thinking then my opinion is shed come to me jumping ill tell you what governor you dont know the sex  mr mollett senior upon this merely shook his head perhaps the fact was that he knew the sex somewhat better than his son it had been his fate during a portion of his life to live among people who were or ought to have been gentlemen he might have been such himself had he not gone wrong in life from the very startingpost but his son had had no such opportunities he did know and could know nothing about ladies and gentlemen  youre mistaken aby said the old man theyd never suffer you to come among them on such a footing as that theyd sooner go forth to the world as beggars  then by g they shall go forth as beggars ive said it now father and ill stick to it you know the stuff im made of as he finished speaking he swallowed down the last half of a third glass of hot spirits and water and then glared on his father with angry bloodshot eyes and a red almost lurid face the unfortunate father was beginning to know the son and to feel that his son would become his master  shortly after this they were interrupted and what further conversation they had on the matter that night took place in their joint bedroom to which uninviting retreat it is not now necessary that we should follow them     chapter vii  the famine year   they who were in the south of ireland during the winter of 184647 will not readily forget the agony of that period for many many years preceding and up to that time the increasing swarms of the country had been fed upon the potato and upon the potato only and now all at once the potato failed them and the greater part of eight million human beings were left without food  the destruction of the potato was the work of god and it was natural to attribute the sufferings which at once overwhelmed the unfortunate country to gods angerto his wrath for the misdeeds of which that country had been guilty for myself i do not believe in such exhibitions of gods anger when wars come and pestilence and famine when the people of a land are worse than decimated and the living hardly able to bury the dead i cannot coincide with those who would deprecate gods wrath by prayers i do not believe that our god stalks darkly along the clouds laying thousands low with the arrows of death and those thousands the most ignorant because men who are not ignorant have displeased him nor if in his wisdom he did do so can i think that mens prayers would hinder that which his wisdom had seen to be good and right  but though i do not believe in exhibitions of gods anger i do believe in exhibitions of his mercy when men by their folly and by the shortness of their vision have brought upon themselves penalties which seem to be overwhelming to which no end can be seen which would be overwhelming were no aid coming to us but our own then god raises his hand not in anger but in mercy and by his wisdom does for us that for which our own wisdom has been insufficient  but on no christian basis can i understand the justice or acknowledge the propriety of asking our lord to abate his wrath in detail or to alter his settled purpose if he be wise would we change his wisdom if he be merciful would we limit his mercy there comes upon us some strange disease and we bid him to stay his hand but the disease when it has passed by has taught us lessons of cleanliness which no master less stern would have made acceptable a famine strikes us and we again beg that that hand may be stayedbeg as the greeks were said to beg when they thought that the anger of phoebus was hot against them because his priest had been dishonoured we so beg thinking that gods anger is hot also against us but lo the famine passes by and a land that had been brought to the dust by mans folly is once more prosperous and happy  if this was ever so in the worlds history it was so in ireland at the time of which i am speaking the country especially in the south and west had been brought to a terrible passnot as so many said and do say by the idolatry of popery or by the sedition of demagogues or even mainly by the idleness of the people the idolatry of popery to my way of thinking is bad though not so bad in ireland as in most other papist countries that i have visited sedition also is bad but in ireland in late years it has not been deepseatedas may have been noted at ballingarry and other places where endeavour was made to bring sedition to its proof and as for the idleness of irelands people i am inclined to think they will work under the same compulsion and same persuasion which produce work in other countries  the fault had been the lowness of education and consequent want of principle among the middle classes and this fault had been found as strongly marked among the protestants as it had been among the roman catholics young men were brought up to do nothing property was regarded as having no duties attached to it men became rapacious and determined to extract the uttermost farthing out of the land within their power let the consequences to the people on that land be what they might  we used to hear much of absentees it was not the absence of the absentees that did the damage but the presence of those they left behind them on the soil the scourge of ireland was the existence of a class who looked to be gentlemen living on their property but who should have earned their bread by the work of their brain or failing that by the sweat of their brow there were men to be found in shoals through the country speaking of their properties and boasting of their places but who owned no properties and had no places when the matter came to be properly sifted  most englishmen have heard of profitrent in ireland the term is so common that no man cannot have heard of it it may of course designate a very becoming sort of income a man may for instance take a plot of land for one hundred pounds a year improve and build on it till it be fairly worth one thousand pounds a year and thus enjoy a profitrent of nine hundred pounds nothing can be better or fairer but in ireland the management was very different men there held tracts of ground very often at their full value paying for them such proportion of rent as a farmer could afford to pay in england and live but the irish tenant would by no means consent to be a farmer it was needful to him that he should be a gentleman and that his sons should be taught to live and amuse themselves as the sons of gentlemenbarring any such small trifle as education they did live in this way and to enable them to do so they underlet their land in small patches and at an amount of rent to collect which took the whole labour of their tenants and the whole produce of the small patch over and above the quantity of potatoes absolutely necessary to keep that tenants body and soul together  and thus a state of things was engendered in ireland which discouraged labour which discouraged improvements in farming which discouraged any produce from the land except the potato crop which maintained one class of men in what they considered to be the gentility of idleness and another class the people of the country in the abjectness of poverty  it is with thorough rejoicing almost with triumph that i declare that the idle genteel class has been cut up root and branch has been driven forth out of its holding into the wide world and has been punished with the penalty of extermination the poor cotter suffered sorely under the famine and under the pestilence which followed the famine but he as a class has risen from his bed of suffering a better man he is thriving as a labourer either in his own country or in some newerfor him betterland to which he has emigrated he even in ireland can now get eight and nine shillings a week easier and with more constancy than he could get four some fifteen years since but the other man has gone and his place is left happily vacant  there are an infinite number of smaller bearings in which this question of the famine and of agricultural distress in ireland may be regarded and should be regarded by those who wish to understand it the manner in which the poor law was first rejected and then accepted and then if one may say so swallowed whole by the people the way in which emigration has affected them the difference in the system of labour there from that here which in former days was so strong that an agricultural labourer living on his wages and buying food with them was a person hardly to be found all these things must be regarded by one who would understand the matter but seeing that this book of mine is a novel i have perhaps already written more on a dry subject than many will read  such having been the state of the country such its wretchedness a merciful god sent the remedy which might avail to arrest it and wewe deprecated his wrath but all this will soon be known and acknowledged acknowledged as it is acknowledged that new cities rise up in splendour from the ashes into which old cities have been consumed by fire if this beneficent agency did not from time to time disencumber our crowded places we should ever be living in narrow alleys with stinking gutters and supply of water at the minimum  but very frightful are the flames as they rush through the chambers of the poor and very frightful was the course of that violent remedy which brought ireland out of its misfortunes those who saw its course and watched its victims will not readily forget what they saw  slowly gradually and with a voice that was for a long time discredited the news spread itself through the country that the food of the people was gone that his own crop was rotten and useless each cotter quickly knew and realized the idea that he must work for wages if he could get them or else go to the poorhouse that the crop of his parish or district was gone became evident to the priest and the parson and the squire and they realized the idea that they must fall on other parishes or other districts for support but it was long before the fact made itself known that there was no food in any parish in any district  when this was understood men certainly did put their shoulders to the wheel with a great effort much abuse at the time was thrown upon the government and they who took upon themselves the management of the relief of the poor in the southwest were taken most severely to task i was in the country travelling always through it during the whole period and i have to sayas i did say at the time with a voice that was not very audiblethat in my opinion the measures of the government were prompt wise and beneficent and i have to say also that the efforts of those who managed the poor were as a rule unremitting honest impartial and successful  the feeding of four million starving people with food to be brought from foreign lands is not an easy job no government could bring the food itself but by striving to do so it might effectually prevent such bringing on the part of others nor when the food was there on the quays was it easy to put it in due proportions into the four million mouths some mouths and they alas the weaker ones would remain unfed but the opportunity was a good one for slashing philanthropical censure and then the business of the slashing censorious philanthropist is so easy so exciting and so pleasant  i think that no portion of ireland suffered more severely during the famine than the counties cork and kerry the poorest parts were perhaps the parishes lying back from the sea and near to the mountains and in the midst of such a district desmond court was situated the region immediately round castle richmond was perhaps better the tenants there had more means at their disposal and did not depend so absolutely on the potato crop but even round castle richmond the distress was very severe  early in the year relief committees were formed on one of which young herbert fitzgerald agreed to act his father promised and was prepared to give his best assistance both by money and countenance but he pleaded that the state of his health hindered him from active exertion and therefore his son came forward in his stead on this occasion as it appeared probable that he would do on all others having reference to the family property  this work brought people together who would hardly have met but for such necessity the priest and the parson of a parish men who had hitherto never been in a room together and between whom neither had known anything of the other but the errors of his doctrine found themselves fighting for the same object at the same board and each for the moment laid aside his religious ferocity gentlemen whose ancestors had come over with strongbow or maybe even with milesius sat cheek by jowl with retired haberdashers concerting new soup kitchens and learning on what smallest modicum of pudding made from indian corn a family of seven might be kept alive and in such condition that the father at least might be able to stand upright  the town of kanturk was the headquarters of that circle to which herbert fitzgerald was attached in which also would have been included the owner of desmond court had there been an owner of an age to undertake such work but the young earl was still under sixteen and the property was represented as far as any representation was made by the countess  but even in such a work as this a work which so strongly brought out what there was of good among the upper classes there was food for jealousy and ill will the name of owen fitzgerald at this time did not stand high in the locality of which we are speaking men had presumed to talk both to him and of him and he replied to their censures by scorn he would not change his mode of living for them or allow them to believe that their interference could in any way operate upon his conduct he had therefore affected a worse character for morals than he had perhaps truly deserved and had thus thrown off from him all intimacy with many of the families among whom he lived  when therefore he had come forward as others had done offering to join his brothermagistrates and the clergyman of the district in their efforts they had or he had thought that they had looked coldly on him his property was half way between kanturk and mallow and when this occurred he turned his shoulder upon the former place and professed to act with those whose meetings were held at the latter town thus he became altogether divided from that castle richmond neighbourhood to which he was naturally attached by old intimacies and family ties  it was a hard time this for the poor countess i have endeavoured to explain that the position in which she had been left with regard to money was not at any time a very easy one she possessed high rank and the name of a countess but very little of that wealth which usually constitutes the chief advantage of such rank and name but now such means as had been at her disposal were terribly crippled there was no poorer district than that immediately around her and none therefore in which the poor rates rose to a more fearful proportion of the rent the country was and for that matter still is divided for purposes of poorlaw rating into electoral districts in ordinary times a man or at any rate a lady may live and die in his or her own house without much noticing the limits or peculiarities of each district in one the rate may be one and a penny in the pound in another only a shilling but the difference is not large enough to create inquiry it is divided between the landlord and the tenant and neither perhaps thinks much about it but when the demand made rises to seventeen or eighteen shillings in the poundas was the case in some districts in those dayswhen out of every pound of rent that he paid the tenant claimed to deduct nine shillings for poor rates that is half the amount leviedthen a landlord becomes anxious enough as to the peculiarities of his own electoral division  in the case of protestant clergymen the whole rate had to be paid by the incumbent a gentleman whose halfyearly rentcharge amounted to perhaps two hundred pounds might have nine tenths of that sum deducted from him for poor rates i have known a case in which the proportion has been higher than this  and then the tenants in such districts began to decline to pay any rent at allin very many cases could pay no rent at all they too depended on the potatoes which were gone they too had been subject to those dreadful demands for poor rates and thus a landlord whose property was in any way embarrassed had but a bad time of it the property from which lady desmond drew her income had been very much embarrassed and for her the times were very bad  in such periods of misfortune a woman has always some friend let her be who she may some pair of broad shoulders is forthcoming on which may be laid so much of the burden as is by herself unbearable it is the great privilege of womanhood that which compensates them for the want of those other privileges which belong exclusively to manhoodsitting in parliament for instance preaching sermons and going on change  at this time lady desmond would doubtless have chosen the shoulders of owen fitzgerald for the bearing of her burden had he not turned against her as he had done but now there was no hope of that those broad shoulders had burdens of their own to bear of another sort and it was at any rate impossible that he should come to share those of desmond court  but a champion was forthcoming one indeed whose shoulders were less broad on looking at whose head and brow lady desmond could not forget her years as she had done while owen fitzgerald had been near herbut a champion nevertheless whom she greatly prized this was owens cousin herbert fitzgerald  mamma her daughter said to her one evening as they were sitting together in the only room which they now inhabited herbert wants us to go to that place near kilcommon tomorrow and says he will send the car at two i suppose i can go  there were two things that lady desmond noticed in this first that her daughter should have called young mr fitzgerald by his christian name and secondly that it should have come to that with them that a fitzgerald should send a vehicle for a desmond seeing that the desmond could no longer provide a vehicle for herself  you could have had the ponychair my dear  oh no mamma i would not do that the pony was now the only quadruped kept for the countesss own behoof and the young earls hunter was the only other horse in the desmond court stables i wouldnt do that mamma mary and emmeline will not mind coming round  but they will have to come round again to bring you back  yes mamma herbert said they wouldnt mind it we want to see how they are managing at the new soup kitchen they have there that one at clady is very bad the boiler wont boil at all  very well my dear only mind you wrap yourself up  oh yes i always do  but clara and lady desmond put on her sweetest smoothest smile as she spoke to her daughter  yes mamma  how long have you taken to call young mr fitzgerald by his christian name  oh i never do mamma said clara with a blush all over her face not to himself i mean you see mary and emmeline are always talking about him  and therefore you mean always to talk about him also  no mamma but one cant help talking about him he is doing so much for these poor people i dont think he ever thinks about anything else from morning to night emmeline says he always goes to it again after dinner dont you think he is very good about it mamma  yes my dear very good indeed almost good enough to be called herbert  but i dont call him so you know i dont protested clara very energetically  he is very good continued the countess very good indeed i dont know what on earth we should do without him if he were my own son he could hardly be more attentive to me  then i may go with the girls to that place i always forget the name  gortnaclough you mean  yes mamma it is all sir thomass property there and they have got a regular kitchen beautifully built hermr fitzgerald says with a regular cook i do wish we could have one at clady  mr fitzgerald will be here tomorrow morning and i will talk to him about it i fear we have not sufficient funds there  no thats just it i do wish i had some money now you wont mind if i am not home quite early we all mean to dine there at the kitchen the girls will bring something and then we can stay out the whole afternoon  it wont do for you to be out after nightfall clara  no i wont mamma they did want me to go home with them to castle richmond for tomorrow night but i declined that and clara uttered a slight sigh as though she had declined something that would have been very pleasant to her  and why did you decline it  oh i dont know i didnt know whether you would like it and besides  besides what  youd be here all alone mamma  the countess got up from her chair and coming over to the place where her daughter was sitting kissed her on her forehead in such a matter as that i dont want you to think of me my dear i would rather you went out i must remain here in this horrid dull wretched place but that is no reason why you should be buried alive i would much rather that you went out sometimes  no mamma i will remain with you  it will be quite right that you should go to castle richmond tomorrow if they send their carriage round here for you  itll only be the car  well the car and if the girls come all that way out of their road in the morning to pick you up it will be only civil that you should go back by castle richmond and you would enjoy an evening there with the girls very much  but i said decidedly that i would not go  tell them tomorrow as decidedly that you have changed your mind and will be delighted to accept their invitation they will understand that it is because you have spoken to me  but mamma  you will like going will you not  yes i shall like it  and so that matter was settled on the whole lady desmond was inclined to admit within her own heart that her daughter had behaved very well in that matter of the banishment of owen fitzgerald she knew that clara had never seen him and had refused to open his letters very little had been said upon the subject between the mother and daughter once or twice owens name had been mentioned and once when it had been mentioned with heavy blame on account of his alleged sins clara had ventured to take his part  people delight to say illnatured things she had said but one is not obliged to believe them all  from that time lady desmond had never mentioned his name rightly judging that clara would be more likely to condemn him in her own heart if she did not hear him condemned by others and so the mother and daughter had gone on as though the former had lost no friend and the latter had lost no lover  for some time after the love adventure clara had been pale and drooping and the countess had been frightened about her but latterly she had got over this the misfortune which had fallen so heavily upon them all seemed to have done her good she had devoted herself from the first to do her little quota of work towards lessening the suffering around her and the effort had been salutary to her  whether or no in her heart of hearts she did still think of owen fitzgerald her mother was unable to surmise from the fire which had flashed from her eyes on that day when she accused the world of saying illnatured things of him lady desmond had been sure that such was the case but she had never ventured to probe her childs heart she had given very little confidence to clara and could not therefore and did not expect confidence in return  nor was clara a girl likely in such a matter to bestow confidence on any one she was one who could hold her heart full and yet not speak of her hearts fulness her mother had called her a child and in some respects she then was so but this childishness had been caused not by lack of mental power but want of that conversation with others which is customary to girls of her age this want had in some respects made her childish for it hindered her from expressing herself in firm tones and caused her to blush and hesitate when she spoke but in some respects it had the opposite effect and made her older than her age for she was thoughtful silent and patient of endurance  latterly since this dreary faminetime had come upon them an intimacy had sprung up between clara and the castle richmond girls and in a measure too between clara and herbert fitzgerald lady desmond had seen this with great pleasure though she had objected to owen fitzgerald for her daughter she had no objection to the fitzgerald name herbert was his fathers only son and heir to the finest property in the countyat any rate to the property which at present was the best circumstanced owen fitzgerald could never be more than a little squire but herbert would be a baronet owens utmost ambition would be to live at hap house all his life and die the oracle of the duhallow hunt but herbert would be a member of parliament with a house in london a daughter of the house of desmond might marry the heir of sir thomas fitzgerald and be thought to have done well whereas she would disgrace herself by becoming the mistress of hap house lady desmond therefore had been delighted to see this intimacy  it had been in no spirit of faultfinding that she had remarked to her daughter as to her use of that christian name what would be better than that they should be to each other as herbert and clara but the cautious mother had known how easy it would be to frighten her timid fawnlike child it was no time no time as yet to question her heart about this second loverif lover he might be the countess was much too subtle in her way to frighten her childs heart back to its old passion that passion doubtless would die from want of food let it be starved and die and then this other new passion might spring up  the countess of desmond had no idea that her daughter with severe selfquestioning had taken her own heart to task about this former lover had argued with herself that the man who could so sin could live such a life and so live in these fearful times was unworthy of her love and must be torn out of her heart let the cost be what it might of such high resolves on her daughters part nay on the part of any young girl lady desmond had no knowledge  clara desmond had determined slowly determined to give up the man whom she had owned to love she had determined that duty and female dignity required her to do so and in this manner it had been done not by the childlike forgetfulness which her mother attributed to her  and so it was arranged that she should stay the following night at castle richmond     chapter viii  gortnaclough and berryhill   and now at last we will get to castle richmond at which place seeing that it gives the title to our novel we ought to have arrived long since  as had been before arranged the two miss fitzgeralds did call at desmond court early on the following day and were delighted at being informed by lady desmond that clara had changed her mind and would if they would now allow her stay the night at castle richmond  the truth was she did not like to leave me said the countess whispering prettily into the ear of the eldest of the two girls but i am delighted that she should have an opportunity of getting out of this dull place for a few hours it was so good of you to think of her  miss fitzgerald made some civil answer and away they all went herbert was on horseback and remained some minutes after them to discuss her own difficulties with the countess and to say a few words about that clady boiler that would not boil clara on this subject had opened her heart to him and he had resolved that the boiler should be made to boil so he said that he would go over and look at it resolving also to send that which would be much more efficacious than himself namely the necessary means and workmen for bringing about so desirable a result and then he rode after the girls and caught the car just as it reached gortnaclough  how they all spent their day at the soup kitchen which however though so called partook quite as much of the character of a bakehouse how they studied the art of making yellow indian meal into puddings how the girls wanted to add milk and sugar not understanding at first the deep principles of political economy which soon taught them not to waste on the comforts of a few that which was so necessary for the life of many how the poor women brought in their sick ailing children accepting the proffered food but bitterly complaining of it as they took itcomplaining of it because they wanted money with which they still thought that they could buy potatoesall this need not here or now be described our present business is to get them all back to castle richmond  there had been some talk of their dining at gortnaclough because it was known that the ladies at desmond court dined early but now that clara was to return to castle richmond that idea was given up and they all got back to the house in time for the family dinner  mamma said emmeline walking first into the drawingroom lady clara has come back with us after all and is going to stay here tonight we are so glad  lady fitzgerald got up from her sofa and welcomed her young guest with a kiss  it is very good of you to come she said very good indeed you wont find it dull i hope because i know you are thinking about the same thing as these children  lady clara muttered some sort of indistinct little protest as to the impossibility of being dull with her present friends  oh shes as full of corn meal and pints of soup as any one said emmeline and knows exactly how much turf it takes to boil fifteen stone of pudding dont you clara but come upstairs for we havent long and i know you are frozen you must dress with us dear for there will be no fire in your own room as we didnt expect you  i wish we could get them to like it said clara standing with one foot on the fender in the middle of the process of dressing so as to warm her toes and her friend emmeline was standing by her with her arm round her waist  i dont think we shall ever do that said mary who was sitting at the glass brushing her hair its so cold and heavy and uncomfortable when they get it  you see said emmeline though they did only have potatoes before they always had them quite warm and though a dinner of potatoes seems very poor they did have it altogether in their own houses you know and i think the very cooking it was some comfort to them  and i suppose they couldnt be taught to cook this themselves so as to make it comfortable in their own cabins said clara despondingly  herbert says its impossible said mary  and im sure he knows said clara  they would waste more than they would eat said emmeline besides it is so hard to cook it as it should be cooked sometimes it seems impossible to make it soft  so it does said clara sadly but if we could only have it hot for them when they come for it wouldnt that be better  the great thing is to have it for them at all said mary the wise for she had been studying the matter more deeply than her friend there are so many who as yet get none  herbert says that the millers will grind up the husks and all at the mills so as to make the most of it thats what makes it so hard to cook said emmeline  how very wrong of them protested clara but isnt herbert going to have a mill put up of his own  and so they went on till i fear they kept the castle richmond dinner waiting for full fifteen minutes  castle richmond too would have been a dull house as lady fitzgerald had intimated had it not been that there was a common subject of such vital interest to the whole party on that subject they were all intent and on that subject they talked the whole evening planning preparing and laying out schemes devising how their money might be made to go furthest discussing deep questions of political economy and making no doubt many errors in their discussions  lady fitzgerald took a part in all this and so occasionally did sir thomas indeed on this evening he was more active than was usual with him he got up from his armchair and came to the table in order that he might pore over the map of the estate with them for they were dividing the property into districts and seeing how best the poor might be visited in their own localities  and then as he did so he became liberal liberal indeed he always was but now he made offers of assistance more than his son had dared to ask and they were all busy contented and in a great degree joyousjoyous though their work arose from the contiguity of such infinite misery but what can ever be more joyous than efforts made for lessening misery  during all this time miss letty was fast asleep in her own armchair but let no one on that account accuse her of a hard heart for she had nearly walked her old legs off that day in going about from cabin to cabin round the demesne  but we must consult somers about that mill said sir thomas  oh of course said herbert i know how to talk somers over  this was added sotto voce to his mother and the girls now mr somers was the agent on the estate  this mill was to be at berryhill a spot also on sir thomass property but in a different direction from gortnaclough there was there what the americans would call a water privilege a stream to which some fall of land just there gave power enough to turn a mill and was now a question how they might utilize that power  during the day just past clara had been with them but they were now talking of what they would do when she would have left them this created some little feeling of awkwardness for clara had put her whole heart into the work at gortnaclough and it was evident that she would have been so delighted to continue with them  but why on earth need you go home tomorrow lady clara said herbert  oh i must mamma expects me you know  of course we should send word indeed i must send to clady tomorrow and the man must pass by desmond court gate  oh yes clara and you can write a line it would be such a pity that you should not see all about the mill now that we have talked it over together do tell her to stay mamma  i am sure i wish she would said lady fitzgerald could not lady desmond manage to spare you for one day  she is all alone you know said clara whose heart however was bent on accepting the invitation  perhaps she would come over and join us said lady fitzgerald feeling however that the subject was not without danger sending a carriage for a young girl like lady clara did very well but it might not answer if she were to offer to send for the countess of desmond  oh mamma never goes out  im quite sure shed like you to stay said herbert after you were all gone yesterday she said how delighted she was to have you go away for a little time and she did say she thought you could not go to a better place than castle richmond  i am sure that was very kind of her said lady fitzgerald  did she said clara longingly  and so after a while it was settled that she should send a line to her mother saying that she had been persuaded to stay over one other night and that she should accompany them to inspect the site of this embryo mill at berryhill  and i will write a line to the countess said lady fitzgerald telling her how impossible it was for you to hold your own intention when we were all attacking you on the other side  and so the matter was settled  on the following day they were to leave home almost immediately after breakfast and on this occasion miss letty insisted on going with them  theres a seat on the car i know herbert she said for you mean to ride and im just as much interested about the mill as any of you  im afraid the day would be too long for you aunt letty said mary we shall stay there you know till after four  not a bit too long when im tired i shall go into mrs townsends the glebe is not ten minutes drive from berryhill  the rev √Üneas townsend was the rector of the parish and he as well as his wife were fast friends of aunt letty as we get on in the story we shall i trust become acquainted with the rev √Üneas townsend and his wife it was ultimately found that there was no getting rid of aunt letty and so the party was made up  they were all standing about the hall after breakfast looking up their shawls and cloaks and coats and herbert was in the act of taking special and very suspicious care of lady claras throat when there came a ring at the door the visitor whoever he might be was not kept long waiting for one servant was in the hall and another just outside the front door with the car and a third holding herberts horse  i wish to see sir thomas said a mans voice as soon as the door was opened and the man entered the hall and then seeing that it was full of ladies retreated again into the doorway he was an elderly man dressed almost more than well for there was about him a slight affectation of dandyism and though he had for the moment been abashed there was about him also a slight swagger good morning ladies he said reentering again and bowing to young herbert who stood looking at him i believe sir thomas is at home would you send your servant in to say that a gentleman wants to see him for a minute or so on very particular business i am a little in a hurry like  the door of the drawingroom was ajar so that lady fitzgerald who was sitting there tranquilly in her own seat could hear the voice and she did hear it and knew that some stranger had come to trouble her husband but she did not come forth why should she was not herbert thereif indeed even herbert could be of any service  shall i take your card in to sir thomas sir said one of the servants coming forward  card said mollett senior out loud well if it is necessary i believe i have a card and he took from his pocket a greasy pocketbook and extracted from it a piece of pasteboard on which his name was written there give that to sir thomas i dont think theres much doubt but that hell see me and then uninvited he sat himself down in one of the hall chairs  sir thomass study the room in which he himself sat and in which indeed he might almost be said to live at presentfor on many days he only came out to dine and then again to go to bedwas at some little distance to the back of the house and was approached by a passage from the hall while the servant was gone the ladies finished their wrapping and got up on the car  oh mr fitzgerald said clara laughing i shant be able to breathe with all that on me  look at mary and emmeline said he they have got twice as much you dont know how cold it is  you had better have the fur close to your body said aunt letty look here and she showed that her gloves were lined with fur and her boots and that she had gotten some nondescript furry article of attire stuck in underneath the body of her dress  but you must let me have them a little looser mr fitzgerald said clara there that will do and then they all got upon the car and started herbert was perhaps two minutes after them before he mounted but when he left the hall the man was still sitting there for the servant had not yet come back from his fathers room  but the clatter of his horses hoofs was still distinct enough at the hall door when the servant did come back and in a serious tone desired the stranger to follow him sir thomas will see you said the servant putting some stress on the word will  oh i did not doubt that the least in the world said mr mollett as he followed the man along the passage  the morning was very cold there had been rainy weather but it now appeared to be a settled frost the roads were rough and hard and the man who was driving them said a word now and again to his young master as to the expediency of getting frost nails put into the horses shoes id better go gently mr herbert it may be he might come down at some of these pitches so they did go gently and at last arrived safely at berryhill  and very busy they were there all day the inspection of the site for the mill was not their only employment here also was an establishment for distributing food and a crowd of poor halffed wretches were there to meet them not that at that time things were so bad as they became afterwards men were not dying on the roadside nor as yet had the apathy of want produced its terrible cure for the agony of hunger the time had not yet come when the famished living skeletons might be seen to reject the food which could no longer serve to prolong their lives  though this had not come as yet the complaints of the women with their throngs of children were bitter enough and it was heartbreaking too to hear the men declare that they had worked like horses and that it was hard upon them now to see their children starve like dogs for in this earlier part of the famine the people did not seem to realize the fact that this scarcity and want had come from god though they saw the potatoes rotting in their own gardens under their own eyes they still seemed to think that the rich men of the land could stay the famine if they would that the fault was with them that the famine could be put down if the rich would but stir themselves to do it before it was over they were well aware that no human power could suffice to put it down nay more than that they had almost begun to doubt the power of god to bring back better days  they strove and toiled and planned and hoped at berryhill that day and infinite was the good that was done by such efforts as these that they could not hinder gods work we all know but much they did do to lessen the sufferings around and many were the lives that were thus saved  they were all standing behind the counter of a small store that had been hired in the villagethe three girls at least for aunt letty had already gone to the glebe and herbert was still down at the water privilege talking to a millwright and a carpenter this was a place at which indian corn flour that which after a while was generally termed meal in those famine days was sold to the poor at this period much of it was absolutely given away this plan however was soon found to be injurious for hundreds would get it who were not absolutely in want and would then sell itfor the famine by no means improved the morals of the people  and therefore it was found better to sell the flour to sell it at a cheap rate considerably less sometimes than the cost price and to put the means of buying it into the hands of the people by giving them work and paying them wages towards the end of these times when the full weight of the blow was understood and the subject had been in some sort studied the general rule was thus to sell the meal at its true price hindering the exorbitant profit of hucksters by the use of large stores and to require that all those who could not buy it should seek the means of living within the walls of workhouses the regular established workhousesunions as they were calledwere not as yet numerous but supernumerary houses were provided in every town and were crowded from the cellars to the roofs  it need hardly be explained that no general rule could be established and acted upon at once the numbers to be dealt with were so great that the exceptions to all rules were overwhelming but such and such like were the efforts made and these efforts ultimately were successful  the three girls were standing behind the counter of a little store which sir thomas had hired at berryhill when a woman came into the place with two children in her arms and followed by four others of different ages she was a gaunt tall creature with sunken cheeks and hollow eyes and her clothes hung about her in unintelligible rags there was a crowd before the counter for those who had been answered or served stood staring at the three ladies and could hardly be got to go away but this woman pressed her way through pushing some and using harsh language to others till she stood immediately opposite to clara  look at that madam she cried undoing an old handkerchief which she held in her hand and displaying the contents on the counter is that what the likes of you calls food for poor people is that fit ating to give to children would any av ye put such stuff as that into the stomachs of your own bairns and she pointed to the mess which lay revealed upon the handkerchief  the food as food was not nice to look at and could not have been nice to eat or probably easy of digestion when eaten  feel of that and the woman rubbed her forefinger among it to show that it was rough and hard and that the particles were as sharp as though sand had been mixed with it the stuff was halfboiled indian meal which had been improperly subjected at first to the full heat of boiling water and in its present state was bad food either for children or grown people feel of that said the woman would you like to be ating that yourself now  i dont think you have cooked it quite enough said clara looking into the womans face half with fear and half with pity and putting as she spoke her pretty delicate finger down into the nasty daubed mess of parboiled yellow flour  cooked it said the woman scornfully all the cooking on arth wouldnt make food of that fit for a christianfeel of the roughness of itand she turned to another woman who stood near her would you like to be putting sharp points like that into your childrens bellies  it was quite true that the grains of it were hard and sharp so as to give one an idea that it would make good eating neither for women nor children the millers and dealers who of course made their profits in these times did frequently grind up the whole corn without separating the grain from the husks and the shell of a grain of indian corn does not when ground become soft flour this woman had reason for her complaints as had many thousands reason for similar complaints  dont be throubling the ladies kitty said an old man standing by sure and werent you glad enough to be getting it  shed be axing the ladies to go home wid her and cook it for her after giving it her said another  who says it war guv me said the angry mother didnt i buy it here at this counter with mikes own hardarned money and its chaiting us they are give me back my money and she looked at clara as though she meant to attack her across the counter  mr fitzgerald is going to put up a mill of his own and then the corn will be better ground said emmeline fitzgerald deprecating the womans wrath  put up a mill said the woman still in scorn are you going to give me back my money or food that my poor bairns can ate  this individual little difficulty was ended by a donation to the angry woman of another lot of meal in taking away which she was careful not to leave behind her the mess which she had brought in her handkerchief but she expressed no thanks on being so treated  the hardest burden which had to be borne by those who exerted themselves at this period was the ingratitude of the poor for whom they workedor rather i should say thanklessness to call them ungrateful would imply too deep a reproach for their convictions were that they were being ill used by the upper classes when they received bad meal which they could not cook and even in their extreme hunger could hardly eat halfcooked when they were desired to leave their cabins and gardens and flock into the wretched barracks which were prepared for them when they saw their children wasting away under a suddenly altered system of diet it would have been unreasonable to expect that they should have been grateful grateful for what had they not at any rate a right to claim life to demand food that should keep them and their young ones alive but not the less was it a hard task for delicate women to work hard and to feel that all their work was unappreciated by those whom they so thoroughly commiserated whose sufferings they were so anxious to relieve  it was almost dark before they left berryhill and then they had to go out of their way to pick up aunt letty at mr townsends house  dont go in whatever you do girls said herbert we should never get away  indeed we wont unpack ourselves again before we get home will we clara  oh i hope not im very nice now and so warm but mr fitzgerald is not mrs townsend very queer  very queer indeed but you mustnt say a word about her before aunt letty they are sworn brothersinarms  i wont of course but mr fitzgerald shes very good is she not  yes in her way only its a pity shes so prejudiced  you mean about religion  i mean about everything if she wears a bonnet on her head shell think you very wicked because you wear a hat  will she what a very funny woman but mr fitzgerald i shant give up my hat let her say what she will  i should rather think not  and mr townsend we know him a little hes very good too isnt he  do you mean me to answer you truly or to answer you according to the goodnatured idea of never saying any ill of ones neighbour  oh both if you can  oh both must i well then i think him good as a man but bad as a clergyman  but i thought he worked so very hard as a clergyman  so he does but if he works evil rather than good you cant call him a good clergyman mind you would have my opinion and if i talk treason and heterodoxy and infidelity and papistry you must only take it for what its worth  im sure you wont talk infidelity  nor yet treason and then moreover mr townsend would be so much better a clergyman to my way of thinking if he would sometimes brush his hair and occasionally put on a clean surplice but remember not a word of all this to aunt letty  oh dear no of course not  mr townsend did come out of the house on the little sweep before the door to help miss letty up on the car though it was dark and piercingly cold  well young ladies and wont you come in now and warm yourselves  they all of course deprecated any such idea and declared that they were already much too late  richard mind you take care going down ballydahan hill said the parson giving a not unnecessary caution to the servant i came up it just now and it was one sheet of ice  now richard do be careful said miss letty  never fear miss said richard  well take care of you said herbert youre not frightened lady clara are you  oh no said clara and so they started  it was quite dark and very cold and there was a sharp hard frost but the lamps of the car were lighted and the horse seemed to be on his mettle for he did his work well ballydahan hill was not above a mile from the glebe and descending that richard by his young masters orders got down from his seat and went to the animals head herbert also himself got off and led his horse down the hill at first the girls were a little inclined to be frightened and miss letty found herself obliged to remind them that they couldnt melt the frost by screaming but they all got safely down and were soon chattering as fast as though they were already safe in the drawingroom of castle richmond  they went on without any accident till they reached a turn in the road about two miles from home and there all in a moment quite suddenly when nobody was thinking about the frost or the danger down came the poor horse on his side his feet having gone quite from under him and a dreadful cracking sound of broken timber gave notice that a shaft was smashed a shaft at least was smashed if only no other harm was done  it can hardly be that herbert fitzgerald cared more for such a stranger as lady clara desmond than he did for his own sisters and aunt but nevertheless it was to lady claras assistance that he first betook himself perhaps he had seen or fancied that he saw that she had fallen with the greatest violence  speak speak said he as he jumped from his horse close to her side are you hurt do speak to me and going down on his knees on the hard ground he essayed to lift her in his arms  oh dear oh dear said she no i am not hurt at least i think notonly just my arm a very little where is emmeline is emmeline hurt  no said emmeline picking herself up but oh dear dear ive lost my muff and ive spoiled my hat where are mary and aunt letty  after some considerable confusion it was found that nothing was much damaged except the car one shaft of which was broken altogether in two lady claras arm was bruised and rather sore but the three other ladies had altogether escaped the quantity of clothes that had been wrapped round them had no doubt enabled them to fall softly  and what about the horse richard asked young fitzgerald  he didnt come upon his knees at all at all master herbert said richard scrutinizing the animals legs with the car lamp in his hand i dont think hes a taste the worse but the car master herbert is clane smashed  such being found to be undoubtedly the fact there was nothing for it but that the ladies should walk home herbert again forgot that the age of his aunt imperatively demanded all the assistance that he could lend her and with many lamentations that fortune and the frost should have used her so cruelly he gave his arm to clara  but do think of miss fitzgerald said clara speaking gently into his ear  who oh my aunt aunt letty never cares for anybodys arm she always prefers walking alone  fie mr fitzgerald fie it is impossible to believe such an assertion as that and yet clara did seem to believe it for she took his proffered arm without further objection  it was halfpast seven when they reached the hall door and at that time they had all forgotten the misfortune of the car in the fun of the dark frosty walk home herbert had found a boy to lead his horse and richard was of course left with the ruins in the road  and hows your arm now asked herbert tenderly as they entered in under the porch  oh it does not hurt me hardly at all i dont mind it in the least and then the door was opened for them  they all flocked into the hall and there they were met by lady fitzgerald  oh mamma said mary i know youre quite frightened out of your life but theres nothing the matter the horse tumbled down but theres nobody hurt  and we had to walk home from the turn to ballyclough said emmeline but oh mamma whats the matter they all now looked up at lady fitzgerald and it was evident enough that something was the matter something to be thought of infinitely more than that accident on the road  oh mary mary what is it said aunt letty coming forward and taking hold of her sisterinlaws hand is my brother ill  sir thomas is not very well and ive been waiting for you so long wheres herbert i must speak to herbert and then the mother and son left the hall together  there was then a silence among the four ladies that were left there standing at first they followed each other into the drawingroom all wrapped up as they were and sat on chairs apart saying nothing to each other at last aunt letty got up  you had better go upstairs with lady clara said she i will go to your mamma  oh aunt letty do send us word pray send us word said emmeline  mary now began to cry i know hes very ill im sure hes very ill oh what shall we do  you had better go up stairs with lady clara said aunt letty i will send you up word immediately  oh dont mind me pray dont mind me said clara pray pray dont take notice of me and she rushed forward and throwing herself on her knees before emmeline began to kiss her  they remained here heedless of aunt lettys advice for some ten minutes and then herbert came to them the two girls flew at him with questions while lady clara stood by the window anxious to learn but unwilling to thrust herself into their family matters  my father has been much troubled today and is not well said herbert but i do not think there is anything to frighten us come let us go to dinner  the going to dinner was but a sorry farce with any of them but nevertheless they went through the ceremony each for the sake of the others  maynt we see him said the girls to their mother who did come down into the drawingroom for one moment to speak to clara  not tonight loves he should not be disturbed and so that day came to an end not satisfactorily     chapter ix  family councils   when the girls and aunt letty went to their chambers that night herbert returned to his mothers own dressingroom and there seated over the fire with her discussed the matter of his fathers sudden attack he had been again with his father and sir thomas had seemed glad to have him there but now he had left him for the night  he will sleep now mother said the son he has taken laudanum  i fear he takes that too often now  it was good for him to have it tonight he did not get too much for i dropped it for him and then they sat silent for a few moments together  mother said herbert who can this man have been  i have no knowledgeno ideano guess even said lady fitzgerald  it is that mans visit that has upset him  oh certainly i think there is no doubt of that i was waiting for the man to go and went in almost before he was out of the house  well  and i found your father quite prostrated  not on the floor  no not exactly on the floor he was still seated on his chair but his head was on the table over his arms  i have often found him in that way mother  but you never saw him looking as he looked this morning herbert when i went in he was speechless and he remained so i should say for some minutes  was he senseless  no he knew me well enough and grasped me by the hand and when i would have gone to the bell to ring for assistance he would not let me i thought he would have gone into a fit when i attempted it  and what did you do  i sat there by him with his hand in mine quite quietly and then he uttered a long deep sigh andoh herbert  well mother  at last he burst into a flood of tears and sobbed and cried like a child  mother  he did so that it was piteous to see him but it did him good for he was better after it and all the time he never let go my hand but held it and kissed it and then he took me by the waist and kissed me oh so often and all the while his tears were running like the tears of a girl and lady fitzgerald as she told the story could not herself refrain from weeping  and did he say anything afterwards about this man  yes not at first that is of course i asked him who he was as soon as i thought he could bear the question but he turned away and merely said that he was a stupid man about some old london business and that he should have gone to prendergast but when after a while i pressed him he said that the mans name was mollett and that he had or pretended to have some claim upon the city property  a claim on the city property why its not seven hundred a year altogether if any mollett could run away with it all that loss would not affect him like that  so i said herbert not exactly in those words but trying to comfort him he then put it off by declaring that it was the consciousness of his inability to see any one on business which affected him so grievously  it was that he said to me  and there may be something in that herbert  yes but then what should make him so weak to begin with if you remember mother he was very wellmore like himself than usual last night  oh i observed it he seemed to like having clara desmond there  didnt he mother i observed that too but then clara desmond is such a sweet creature the mother looked at her son as he said this but the son did not notice the look i do wonder what the real truth can be he continued do you think there is anything wrong about the property in general about this estate here  no i dont think that said the mother sadly  what can it be then but lady fitzgerald sat there and did not answer the question ill tell you what i will do mother ill go up to london and see prendergast and consult him  oh no you mustnt do that i am wrong to tell you all this for he told me to talk to no one but it would kill me if i didnt speak of it to you  all the same mother i think it would be best to consult prendergast  not yet herbert i dare say mr prendergast may be a very good sort of man but we none of us know him and if as is very probable this is only an affair of health it would be wrong in you to go to a stranger it might look  look what mother  people might thinkhe i meanthat you wanted to interfere  but who ought to interfere on his behalf if i dont  quite true dearest i understand what you mean and know how good you are but perhaps mr prendergast might not he might think you wanted  wanted what mother i dont understand you  wanted to take the things out of your fathers hands  oh mother  he doesnt know you and what is more i dont think he knows much of your father dont go to him yet and herbert promised that he would not  and you dont think that this man was ever here before he asked  well i rather think he was here once before many years agosoon after you went to school  so long ago as that  yes not that i remember him or indeed ever knew of his coming then if he did come but jones says that she thinks she remembers him  did jones see him now  yes she was in the hall as he passed through on his way out and it so happened that she let him in and out too when he came before that is if it is the same man  thats very odd  it did not happen here we were at tenby for a few weeks in the summer  i remember you went there with the girls just when i went back to school  jones was with us and richard we had none other of our own servants and jones says that the same man did come then that he stayed with your father for an hour or two and that when he left your father was depressedalmost as he was yesterday i well remember that i know that a man did come to him at tenby andoh herbert  what is it mother speak out at any rate to me  since that man came to him at tenby he has never been like what he was before  and then there was more questioning between them about jones and her remembrances it must be explained that jones was a very old and very valued servant she had originally been brought up as a child by mrs wainwright in that dorsetshire parsonage and had since remained firm to the fortunes of the young lady whose maid she had become on her first marriage as her mistress had been promoted so had jones at first she had been kitty to all the world now she was mrs jones to the world at large jones to sir thomas and her mistress and of late years to herbert and known by all manner of affectionate sobriquets to the young ladies sometimes they would call her johnny and sometimes the duchess but doubtless they and mrs jones thoroughly understood each other by the whole establishment mrs jones was held in great respect and by the younger portion in extreme awe her breakfast and tea she had in a little sittingroom by herself but the solitude of this was too tremendous for her to endure at dinnertime at that meal she sat at the head of the table in the servants hall though she never troubled herself to carve anything except puddings and pies for which she had a great partiality and of which she was supposed to be the most undoubted and severe judge known of anywhere in that part of the country  she was supposed by all her brother and sister servants to be a very croesus for wealth and wondrous tales were told of the money she had put by but as she was certainly honest and supposed to be very generous to certain poor relations in dorsetshire some of these stories were probably mythic it was known however as a fact that two castle richmond butlers one outdoor steward three neighbouring farmers and one wickedly ambitious coachman had endeavoured to tempt her to matrimonyin vain she didnt want none of them she told her mistress and what was more she wouldnt have none of them and therefore she remained mrs jones with brevet rank  it seemed from what lady fitzgerald said that mrs joness manner had been somewhat mysterious about this man mollett she had endeavoured to reassure and comfort her mistress saying that nothing would come of it as nothing had come of that other tenby visit and giving it as her counsel that the ladies should allow the whole matter to pass by without further notice but at the same time lady fitzgerald had remarked that her manner had been very serious when she first said that she had seen the man before  jones lady fitzgerald had said to her very earnestly if you know more about this man than you are telling me you are bound to speak out and let me know everything  whoi my lady what could i know only he do look to me like the same man and so i thought it right to say to your ladyship  lady fitzgerald had seen that there was nothing more to be gained by crossquestioning and so she had allowed the matter to drop but she was by no means satisfied that this servant whom she so trusted did not know more than she had told and then mrs jones had been with her in those dreadful dorsetshire days and an undefined fear began to creep over her very soul  god bless you my child said lady fitzgerald as her son got up to leave her and then she embraced him with more warmth even than was her wont all that we can do at present is to be gentle with him and not to encourage people around him to talk of his illness  on the next morning lady fitzgerald did not come down to breakfast but sent her love to clara and begged her guest to excuse her on account of headache sir thomas rarely came in to breakfast and therefore his absence was not remarkable his daughters however went up to see him as did also his sister and they all declared that he was very much better  it was some sudden attack i suppose said clara  yes very sudden he has had the same before said herbert but they do not at all affect his intellect or bodily powers depression is i suppose the name that the doctors would call it  and then at last it became noticeable by them that lady clara did not use her left arm oh clara said emmeline i see now that you are hurt how selfish we have been oh dear oh dear and both emmeline and mary immediately surrounded her examining her arm and almost carrying her to the sofa  i dont think it will be much said clara its only a little stiff  oh herbert what shall we do do look here the inside of her arm is quite black  herbert gently touching her hand did examine the arm and declared his opinion that she had received a dreadfully violent blow emmeline proposed to send for a doctor to pronounce whether or no it were broken mary said that she didnt think it was broken but that she was sure the patient ought not to be moved that day or probably for a week aunt letty in the mean time prescribed a coldwater bandage with great authority and bounced out of the room to fetch the necessary linen and basin of water  its nothing at all continued clara and indeed i shall go home today indeed i shall  it might be very bad for your arm that you should be moved said herbert  and your staying here will not be the least trouble to us we shall all be so happy to have you shall we not mary  of course we shall and so will mamma  i am so sorry to be here now said clara when i know you are all in such trouble about sir thomas but as for going i shall go as soon as ever you can make it convenient to send me indeed i shall and so the matter was discussed between them aunt letty in the mean time binding up the bruised arm with coldwater appliances  lady clara was quite firm about going and therefore at about twelve she was sent i should say taken for emmeline insisted on going with her in the carriage herbert would have gone also but he felt that he ought not to leave castle richmond that day on account of his father but he would certainly ride over he said and learn how her arm was the next morning  and about clady you know said clara  i will go on to clady also i did send a man there yesterday to see about the flue its the flue thats wrong i know  oh thank you i am so much obliged to you said clara and then the carriage drove off and herbert returned into the morning sittingroom with his sister mary  ill tell you what it is master herbert said mary  wellwhat is it  you are going to fall in love with her young ladyship  am i is that all you know about it and who are you going to fall in love with pray  oh his young lordship perhaps only he ought to be about ten years older so that im afraid that wouldnt do but clara is just the age for you it really seems as though it were all prepared ready to your hand  you girls always do think that those things are ready prepared and so saying herbert walked off with great manly dignity to some retreat among his own books and papers there to meditate whether this thing were in truth prepared for him it certainly was the fact that the house did seem very blank to him now that clara was gone and that he looked forward with impatience to the visit which it was so necessary that he should make on the following day to clady  the house at castle richmond was very silent and quiet that day when emmeline came back she and her sister remained together nothing had been said to them about molletts visit and they had no other idea than that this lowness of spirits on their fathers part to which they had gradually become accustomed had become worse and more dangerous to his health than ever  aunt letty talked much about it to herbert to lady fitzgerald to jones and to her brother and was quite certain that she had penetrated to the depth of the whole matter that nasty city property she said which had come with her grandmother had always given the family more trouble than it was worth indeed her grandmother had been a very troublesome woman altogether and no wonder for though she was a protestant herself she had had papist relations in lancashire she distinctly remembered to have heard that there was some flaw in the title of that property and she knew that it was very hard to get some of the tenants to pay any rent that she had always heard she was quite sure that this man was some person laying a claim to it and threatening to prosecute his claim at law it was a thousand pities that her brother should allow such a trifle as thisfor after all it was but a trifle to fret his spirits and worry him in this way but it was the wretched state of his health were he once himself again all such annoyances as that would pass him by like the wind  it must be acknowledged that aunt lettys memory in this respect was not exactly correct for as it happened sir thomas held his little property in the city of london by as firm a tenure as the laws and customs of his country could give him and seeing that his income thence arising came from ground rents near the river on which property stood worth some hundreds of thousands it was not very probable that his tenants should be in arrear but what she said had some effect upon herbert he was not quite sure whether this might not be the cause of his fathers grief and if the story did not have much effect upon lady fitzgerald at any rate it did as well as any other to exercise the ingenuity and affection of aunt letty  sir thomas passed the whole of that day in his own room but during a great portion of the day either his wife or sister or son was with him they endeavoured not to leave him alone with his own thoughts feeling conscious that something preyed upon his mind though ignorant as to what that something might be  he was quite aware of the nature of their thoughts perfectly conscious of the judgment they had formed respecting him he knew that he was subjecting himself in the eyes not only of his own family but of all those around him to suspicions which must be injurious to him and yet he could not shake off the feeling that depressed him  but at last he did resolve to make an attempt at doing so for some time in the evening he was altogether alone and he then strove to force his mind to work upon the matter which occupied itto arrange his ideas and bring himself into a state in which he could make a resolution for hours he had satnot thinking upon this subject for thought is an exertion which requires a combination of ideas and results in the deducing of conclusions from premises and no such effort as that had he hitherto madebut endeavouring to think while he allowed the matter of his grief to lie ever before his minds eye  he had said to himself over and over again that it behoved him to make some great effort to shake off this incubus that depressed him but yet no such effort had hitherto been even attempted now at last he arose and shook himself and promised to himself that he would be a man it might be that the misfortune under which he groaned was heavy but let ones sorrow be what it may there is always a better and a worse way of meeting it let what trouble may fall on a mans shoulders a man may always bear it manfully and are not troubles when so borne half cured it is the flinching from pain which makes pain so painful  this truth came home to him as he sat there that day thinking what he should do endeavouring to think in what way he might best turn himself but there was this that was especially grievous to him that he had no friend whom he might consult in this matter it was a sorrow the cause of which he could not explain to his own family and in all other troubles he had sought assistance and looked for counsel there and there only he had had one best steadiest dearest truest counsellor and now it had come to pass that things were so placed that in this great trouble he could not go to her  and now a friend was so necessary to him he felt that he was not fit to judge how he himself should act in this terrible emergency that it was absolutely necessary for him that he should allow himself to be guided by some one else but to whom should he appeal  he is a cold man said he to himself as one name did occur to him very cold almost unfeeling but he is honest and just and then again he sat and thought yes he is honest and just and what should i want better than honesty and justice and then shuddering as he resolved he did resolve that he would send for this honest and just man he would send for him or perhaps better still go to him at any rate he would tell him the whole truth of his grief and then act as the cold just man should bid him  but he need not do this yetnot quite yet so at least he said to himself falsely if a man decide with a fixed decision that his tooth should come out or his leg be cut off let the tooth come out or the leg be cut off on the earliest possible opportunity it is the flinching from such pain that is so grievously painful  but it was something to have brought his mind to bear with a fixed purpose upon these things and to have resolved upon what he would do though he still lacked strength to put his resolution immediately to the proof  then later in the evening his son came and sat with him and he was able in some sort to declare that the worst of that evil day had passed from him i shall breakfast with you all tomorrow he said and as he spoke a faint smile passed across his face  oh i hope you will said herbert we shall be so delighted but father do not exert yourself too soon  it will do me good i think  i am sure it will if the fatigue be not too much  the truth is herbert i have allowed this feeling to grow upon me till i have become weak under it i know that i ought to make an exertion to throw it off and it is possible that i may succeed  herbert muttered some few hopeful words but he found it very difficult to know what he ought to say that his father had some secret he was quite sure and it is hard to talk to a man about his secret without knowing what that secret is  i have allowed myself to fall into a weak state continued sir thomas speaking slowly while by proper exertion i might have avoided it  you have been very ill father said herbert  yes i have been ill very ill certainly but i do not know that any doctor could have helped me  father  no herbert do not ask me questions do not inquire at any rate not at present i will endeavournow at least i will endeavourto do my duty but do not urge me by questions or appear to notice me if i am infirm  but fatherif we could comfort you  ah if you could but never mind i will endeavour to shake off this depression and herbert comfort your mother do not let her think much of all this if it can be helped  but how can it be helped  and tell her this there is a matter that troubles my mind  is it about the property father  noyes it certainly is about the property in one sense  then do not heed it we shall none of us heed it who has so good a right to say so as i  bless you my darling boy but herbert such things must be heededmore or less you know but you may tell your mother this and perhaps it may comfort her i have made up my mind to go to london and to see prendergast i will explain the whole of this thing to him and as he bids me so will i act  this was thought to be satisfactory to a certain extent both by the mother and son they would have been better pleased had he opened his heart to them and told them everything but that it was clear he could not bring himself to do this mr prendergast they had heard was a good man and in his present state it was better that he should seek counsel of any man than allow his sorrow to feed upon himself alone     chapter x  the rector of drumbarrow and his wife   herbert fitzgerald in speaking of the rev √Üneas townsend to lady clara desmond had said that in his opinion the reverend gentleman was a good man but a bad clergyman but there were not a few in the county cork who would have said just the reverse and declared him to be a bad man but a good clergyman there were others indeed who knew him well who would have declared him to be perfect in both respects and others again who thought him in both respects to be very bad amidst these great diversities of opinion i will venture on none of my own but will attempt to describe him  in ireland stanch protestantism consists too much in a hatred of papistryin that rather than in a hatred of those errors against which we protestants are supposed to protest hence the crosswhich should i presume be the emblem of salvation to us allcreates a feeling of dismay and often of disgust instead of love and reverence and the very name of a saint savours in irish protestant ears of idolatry although irish protestants on every sunday profess to believe in a communion of such these are the feelings rather than the opinions of the most protestant of irish protestants and it is intelligible that they should have been produced by the close vicinity of roman catholic worship in the minds of men who are energetic and excitable but not always discreet or argumentative  one of such was mr townsend and few men carried their protestant fervour further than he did a cross was to him what a red cloth is supposed to be to a bull and so averse was he to the intercession of saints that he always regarded as a wolf in sheeps clothing a certain english clergyman who had written to him a letter dated from the feast of st michael and all angels on this account herbert fitzgerald took upon himself to say that he regarded him as a bad clergyman whereas most of his protestant neighbours looked upon this enthusiasm as his chief excellence  and this admiration for him induced his friends to overlook what they must have acknowledged to be defects in his character though he had a good livingat least what the laity in speaking of clerical incomes is generally inclined to call a good living we will say amounting in value to four hundred pounds a yearhe was always in debt this was the more inexcusable as he had no children and had some small private means  and nobody knew why he was in debtin which word nobody he himself must certainly be included he had no personal expenses of his own his wife though she was a very queer woman as lady clara had said could hardly be called an extravagant woman there was nothing large or splendid about the way of living at the glebe anybody who came there both he and she were willing to feed as long as they chose to stay and a good many in this way they did feed but they never invited guests and as for giving regular fixed dinnerparties as parish rectors do in england no such idea ever crossed the brain of either mr or mrs townsend  that they were both charitable all the world admitted and their admirers professed that hence arose all their difficulties but their charities were of a most indiscreet kind money they rarely had to give and therefore they would give promises to pay while their credit with the butcher and baker was good they would give meat and bread and both these functionaries had by this time learned that though mr townsend might not be able to pay such bills himself his friends would do so sooner or later if duly pressed and therefore the larder at drumbarrow glebethat was the name of the parishwas never long empty and then again it was never long full  but neither mr nor mrs townsend were content to bestow their charities without some other object than that of relieving material wants by their alms many infidels mr townsend argued had been made believers by the miracle of the loaves and fishes and therefore it was permissible for him to make use of the same means for drawing over proselytes to the true church if he could find hungry papists and convert them into wellfed protestants by one and the same process he must be doing a double good he arguedcould by no possibility be doing an evil  such being the character of mr townsend it will not be thought surprising that he should have his warm admirers and his hot detractors and they who were inclined to be among the latter were not slow to add up certain little disagreeable eccentricities among the list of his faultsas young fitzgerald had done in the matter of the dirty surplices  mr townsends most uncompromising foe for many years had been the rev bernard mcarthy the parish priest for the same parish of drumbarrow father bernard as he was called by his own flock or father barney as the protestants in derision were delighted to name him was much more a man of the world than his protestant colleague he did not do half so many absurd things as did mr townsend and professed to laugh at what he called the protestant madness of the rector but he also had been an eager i may also say a malicious antagonist what he called the souping system of the protestant clergyman stank in his nostrilsthat system by which as he stated the most ignorant of men were to be induced to leave their faith by the hope of soup or other food he was as firmly convinced of the inward heartdestroying iniquity of the parson as the parson was of that of the priest and so these two men had learned to hate each other and yet neither of them were bad men  i do not wish it to be understood that this sort of feeling always prevailed in irish parishes between the priest and the parson even before the days of the famine i myself have met a priest at a parsons table and have known more than one parish in which the protestant and roman catholic clergymen lived together on amicable terms but such a feeling as that above represented was common and was by no means held as proof that the parties themselves were quarrelsome or malicious it was a part of their religious convictions and who dares to interfere with the religious convictions of a clergyman  on the day but one after that on which the castle richmond ladies had been thrown from their car on the frosty road mr townsend and father bernard were brought together in an amicable way or in a way that was intended to be amicable for the first time in their lives the relief committee for the district in which they both lived was one and the same and it was of course well that both should act on it when the matter was first arranged father bernard took the bull by the horns and went there but mr townsend hearing this did not do so but now that it had become evident that much work and for a long time would have to be performed at these committees it was clear that mr townsend as a protestant clergyman could not remain away without neglecting his duty and so after many mental struggles and questions of conscience the parson agreed to meet the priest  the point had been very deeply discussed between the rector and his wife she had given it as her opinion that priest mcarthy was pitch pitch itself in its blackest turpitude and as such could not be touched without defilement had not all the protestant clergymen of ireland in a body or at any rate all those who were worth anything who could with truth be called protestant clergymen had they not all refused to enter the doors of the national schools because they could not do so without sharing their ministration there with papist priests with priests of the altar of baal as mrs townsend called them and should they now yield when after all the assistance needed was only for the bodynot for the soul  it may be seen from this that the ladys mind was not in its nature logical but the extreme absurdity of her arguments though they did not ultimately have the desired effect by no means came home to the understanding of her husband he thought that there was a great deal in what she said and almost felt that he was yielding to instigations from the evil one but public opinion was too strong for him public opinion and the innate kindness of his own heart he felt that at this very moment he ought to labour specially for the bodies of these poor people as at other times he would labour specially for their souls and so he yielded  well said his wife to him as he got off his car at his own door after the meeting what have you done one might have imagined from her tone of voice and her manner that she expected or at least hoped to hear that the priest had been absolutely exterminated and made away with in the good fight  mr townsend made no immediate answer but proceeded to divest himself of his rusty outside coat and to rub up his stiff grizzled bristly uncombed hair with both his hands as was his wont when he was not quite satisfied with the state of things  i suppose he was there said mrs townsend  oh yes he was there he is never away i take it when there is any talking to be done now mr townsend dearly loved to hear himself talk but no man was louder against the sins of other orators and then he began to ask how many minutes it wanted to dinnertime  mrs townsend knew his ways she would not have a ghost of a chance of getting from him a true and substantial account of what had really passed if she persevered in direct questions to the effect so she pretended to drop the matter and went and fetched her lords slippers the putting on of which constituted his evening toilet and then after some little hurrying inquiry in the kitchen promised him his dinner in fifteen minutes  was herbert fitzgerald there  oh yes he is always there hes a nice young fellow a very fine young fellow but  but what  he thinks he understands the irish roman catholics but he understands them no more thanthanthan this slipper he said having in vain cudgelled his brain for a better comparison  you know what aunt letty says about him she doubts he isnt quite right you know  mrs townsend by this did not mean to insinuate that herbert was at all afflicted in that way which we attempt to designate when we say that one of our friends is not all right and at the same time touch our heads with our forefinger she had intended to convey an impression that the young mans religious ideas were not exactly of that stanch trueblue description which she admired  well he has just come from oxford you know said mr townsend and at the present moment oxford is the most dangerous place to which a young man can be sent  and sir thomas would send him there though i remember telling his aunt over and over again how it would be and mrs townsend as she spoke shook her head sorrowfully  i dont mean to say you know that hes absolutely bitten  oh i knowi understand when they come to crosses and candlesticks the next step to the glory of mary is a very easy one i would sooner send a young man to rome than to oxford at the one he might be shocked and disgusted but at the other he is cajoled and cheated and ruined and then mrs townsend threw herself back in her chair and threw her eyes up towards the ceiling  but there was no hypocrisy or pretence in this expression of her feelings she did in her heart of hearts believe that there was some college or club of papists at oxford emissaries of the pope or of the jesuits in her moments of sterner thought the latter were the enemies she most feared whereas when she was simply pervaded by her usual chronic hatred of the irish roman catholic hierarchy she was wont to inveigh most against the pope and this college she maintained was fearfully successful in drawing away the souls of young english students indeed at oxford a man had no chance against the devil things were better at cambridge though even there there was great danger look at a and z and she would name two perverts to the church of rome of whom she had learned that they were cambridge men but thank god trinity college still stood firm her idea was that if there were left any real protestant truth in the church of england that church should look to feed her lambs by the hands of shepherds chosen from that seminary and from that seminary only  but isnt dinner nearly ready said mr townsend whose ideas were not so exclusively protestant as were those of his wife i havent had a morsel since breakfast and then his wife who was peculiarly anxious to keep him in a good humour that all might come out about father barney made another little visit to the kitchen  at last the dinner was served the weather was very cold and the rector and his wife considered it more cosy to use only the parlour and not to migrate into the cold air of a second room indeed during the winter months the drawingroom of drumbarrow glebe was only used for visitors and for visitors who were not intimate enough in the house to be placed upon the worn chairs and threadbare carpet of the diningparlour and very cold was that drawingroom found to be by each visitor  but the parlour was warm enough warm and cosy though perhaps at times a little close and of evenings there would pervade it a smell of whisky punch not altogether acceptable to unaccustomed nostrils not that the rector of drumbarrow was by any means an intemperate man his single tumbler of whisky toddy repeated only on sundays and some other rare occasions would by no means equal in point of drinking the ordinary port of an ordinary english clergyman but whisky punch does leave behind a savour of its intrinsic virtues delightful no doubt to those who have imbibed its grosser elements but not equally acceptable to others who may have been less fortunate  during dinner there was no conversation about herbert fitzgerald or the committee or father barney the old gardener who waited at table with all his garden clothes on him and whom the neighbours with respectful deference called mr townsends butler was a roman catholic as indeed were all the servants at the glebe and as are necessarily all the native servants in that part of the country and though mr and mrs townsend put great trust in their servant jerry as to the ordinary duties of gardening driving and butlering they would not knowingly trust him with a word of their habitual conversation about the things around them their idea was that every word so heard was carried to the priest and that the priest kept a book in which every word so uttered was written down if this were so through the parish the priest must in truth have had something to do both for himself and his private secretary for in spite of all precautions that were taken jerry and jerrys brethren no doubt did hear much of what was said the repetitions to the priest however i must take leave to doubt  but after dinner when the hot water and whisky were on the table when the two old armchairs were drawn cozily up on the rug each with an old footstool before it when the faithful wife had mixed that glass of punchor jug rather for after the old fashion it was brewed in such a receptacle and when to inspire increased confidence she had put into it a small extra modicum of the eloquent spirit then the mouth of the rector was opened and mrs townsend was made happy  and so father barney and i have met at last said he rather cheerily as the hot fumes of the toddy regaled his nostrils  and how did he behave now  well he was decent enoughthat is as far as absolute behaviour went you cant have a silk purse from off a sows ear you know  no indeed and goodness knows theres plenty of the sows ear about him but now √Üneas dear do tell me how it all was just from the beginning  he was there before me said the husband  catch a weasel asleep said the wife  i didnt catch him asleep at any rate continued he he was there before me but when i went into the little room where they hold the meeting  its at berryhill isnt it  yes at the widow caseys to see that woman bowing and scraping and curtsying to father barney and she his own mothers brothers daughter was the best thing in the world  that was just to do him honour before the quality you know  exactly when i went in there was nobody there but his reverence and master herbert  as thick as possible i suppose dear dear isnt it dreadfuldid i put sugar enough in it √Üneas  well i dont know perhaps you may give me another small lump at any rate you didnt forget the whisky  im sure it isnt a taste too strongand after such work as youve had todayand so young fitzgerald and father barney  yes there they were with their heads together it was something about a mill they were saying  oh its perfectly dreadful  but herbert stopped and introduced me at once to father barney  what a regular introduction i like that indeed  he didnt do it altogether badly he said something about being glad to see two gentlemen together  a gentleman indeed  who were both so anxious to do the best they could in the parish and whose influence was so greator something to that effect and then we shook hands  you did shake hands  oh yes if i went there at all it was necessary that i should do that  i am very glad it was not me thats all i dont think i could shake hands with father barney  theres no knowing what you can do my dear till you try  hm said mrs townsend meaning to signify thereby that she was still strong in the strength of her own impossibilities  and then there was a little general conversation about the potato for no one came in for a quarter of an hour or so the priest said that they were as badly off in limerick and clare as we are here now i dont believe that and when i asked him how he knew he quoted the freeman  the freeman indeed just like him i wonder it wasnt the nation in mrs townsends estimation the parish priest was much to blame because he did not draw his public information from some newspaper specially addicted to the support of the protestant cause  and then somers came in and he took the chair i was very much afraid at one time that father barney was going to seat himself there  you couldnt possibly have stood that  i had made up my mind what to do i should have walked about the room and looked on the whole affair as altogether irregularas though there was no chairman but somers was of course the proper man  and who else came  there was oleary from boherbue  he was another papist  oh yes there was a majority of them there was greilly the man who has got that large take of land over beyond banteer and then father barneys coadjutor came in  what that wretchedlooking man from gortnaclough  yes hes the curate of the parish you know  and did you shake hands with him too  indeed i did and you never saw a fellow look so ashamed of himself in your life  well there isnt much shame about them generally  and there wasnt much about him byandby you never heard a man talk such trash in your life till somers put him down  oh he was put down im glad of that  and to do father barney justice he did tell him to hold his tongue the fool began to make a regular set speech  father barney i suppose didnt choose that anybody should do that but himself  he did enough for the two certainly i never heard a man so fond of his own voice what he wants is to rule it all just his own way  of course he does and thats just what you wont let him do what other reason can there be for your going there  and so the matter was discussed what absolute steps were taken by the committee how they agreed to buy so much meal of such a merchant at such a price and with such funds how it was to be resold and never given away on any pretext how mr somers had explained that giving away their means was killing the goose that laid the golden eggs when the young priest in an attitude for oratory declared that the poor had no money with which to make the purchase and how in a few weeks time they would be able to grind their own flour at herbert fitzgeralds millall this was also told but the telling did not give so much gratification to mrs townsend as the sly hits against the two priests  and then while they were still in the middle of all this when the punchjug had given way to the teapot and the rector was beginning to bethink himself that a nap in his armchair would be very refreshing jerry came into the room to announce that richard had come over from castle richmond with a note for his riverence and so richard was shown in  now richard might very well have sent in his note by jerry which after all contained only some information with reference to a list of old women which herbert fitzgerald had promised to send over to the glebe but richard knew that the minister would wish to chat with him and richard himself had no indisposition for a little conversation  i hope yer riverences is quite well then said richard as he tendered his note making a double bow so as to include them both  pretty well thank you said mrs townsend and hows all the family  well then theyre all rightly considhering the masthers no just what he war you know maam  im afraid notim afraid not said the rector youll not take a glass of spirits richard  yer riverence knows i never does that said richard with somewhat of a conscious look of high morality for he was a rigid teetotaller  and do you mean to say that you stick to that always said mrs townsend who firmly believed that no good could come out of nazareth and that even abstinence from whisky must be bad if accompanied by anything in the shape of a roman catholic ceremony  i do mean to say maam that i never touched a dhrop of anything sthronger than wather barring tay since the time i got the pledge from the blessed apostle and richard boldly crossed himself in the presence of them both they knew well whom he meant by the blessed apostle it was father mathew  temperance is a very good thing however we may come by it said mr townsend who meant to imply by this that richards temperance had been come by in the worst way possible  thats thrue for you sir said richard but i never knew any pledge kept only the blessed apostles by which he meant to imply that no sanctity inherent in mr townsends sacerdotal proceedings could be of any such efficacy  and then mr townsend read the note ah yes said he tell mr herbert that im very much obliged to him there will be no other answer necessary  very well yer riverence ill be sure to give mr herbert the message and richard made a sign as though he were going  but tell me richard said mrs townsend is sir thomas any better for we have been really very uneasy about him  indeed and he is maam a dail betther this morning the lord be praised  it was a kind of a fit wasnt it richard asked the parson  a sort of a fit of illness of some kind im thinking said richard who had no mind to speak of his familys secrets out of doors whatever he might be called upon to tell the priest at any rate he was not called on to tell anything to the parson  but it was very sudden this time wasnt it richard asked the lady immediately after that strange man was shown into his roomeh  im sure maam i cant say but i dont think he was a haporth worse than ordinar till after the gentleman went away i did hear that he did his business with the gentleman just as usual like  and then he fell into a fit didnt he richard  not that i heard of maam he did a dail of talking about some law business i did hear our mrs jones say and then afther he warnt just the betther of it  was that all  and i dont think hes none the worse for it neither maam for the masther do seem to have more life in him this day than ise seen this many a month why hes been out and about with her ladyship in the ponycarriage all the morning  has he now well im delighted to hear that it is some trouble about the english estates i believe that vexes him  faix then maam i dont just know what it is that ails him unless it be just that he has too much money for to know what to do wid it thatd be the sore vexation to me i know  well ah yes i suppose i shall see mrs jones tomorrow or at latest the day after said mrs townsend resolving to pique the man by making him understand that she could easily learn all that she wished to learn from the woman a great comfort mrs jones must be to her ladyship  oh yes maam deed an she is said richard specially in the matter of puddins and pies and such like  he was not going to admit mrs joness superiority seeing that he had lived in the family long before his present mistresss marriage  and in a great many other things too richard shes quite a confidential servant thats because shes a protestant you know  now of all men women and creatures living richard the coachman of castle richmond was the most good tempered no amount of anger or scolding no professional misfortunesuch as the falling down of his horse upon the ice no hardshipsuch as three hours perpetual rain when he was upon the boxwould make him cross to him it was a matter of perfect indifference if he were sent off with his car just before breakfast or called away to some stable work as the dinner was about to smoke in the servants hall he was a great eater but what he didnt eat one day he could eat the next such things never ruffled him nor was he ever known to say that such a job wasnt his work he was always willing to nurse a baby or dig potatoes or cook a dinner to the best of his ability when asked to do so but he could not endure to be made less of than a protestant and of all protestants he could not endure to be made less of than mrs jones  cause shes a protestant is it maam  of course richard you cant but see that protestants are more trusted more respected more thought about than romanists can you  deed then i dont know maam  but look at mrs jones  oh i looks at her often enough and shes well enough too for a woman but we all know her weakness  whats that richard asked mrs townsend with some interest expressed in her tone for she was not above listening to a little scandal even about the servants of her great neighbours  why she do often talk about things she dont understand but shes a great hand at puddins and pies and thats what one mostly looks for in a woman  this was enough for mrs townsend for the present and so richard was allowed to take his departure in full selfconfidence that he had been one too many for the parsons wife  jerry said richard as they walked out into the yard together to get the castle richmond pony does they often thry to make a prothestant of you now  prothestants be d said jerry who by no means shared in richards good gifts as to temper  well i wouldnt say that at laist not of all of em  the likes of thems used to it said jerry  and then richard not waiting to do further battle on behalf of his protestant friends trotted out of the yard     chapter xi  second love   on the day after claras departure herbert did as a matter of course make his promised visit at desmond court it was on that day that sir thomas had been driving about in the ponycarriage with lady fitzgerald as richard had reported herbert had been with his father in the morning and then having seen him and his mother well packed up in their shawls and cloaks had mounted his horse and ridden off  i may be kept some time said he as i have promised to go on to clady and see after that soup kitchen  i shouldnt wonder if herbert became attached to clara desmond said the mother to sir thomas soon after they had begun their excursion  do you think so said the baronet and his tone was certainly not exactly that of approbation  well yes i certainly do think it probable i am sure he admires her and i think it very likely to come to more would there be any objection  they are both very young said sir thomas  but in herberts position will not a young marriage be the best thing for him  and she has no fortune not a shilling if he does marry young quite young you know it might be prudent that his wife should have something of her own  theyd live here said lady fitzgerald who knew that of all men her husband was usually most free from mercenary feelings and an overanxiety as to increased wealth either for himself or for his children and i think it would be such a comfort to you herbert you see is so fond of county business and so little anxious for what young men generally consider pleasure  there was nothing more said about it at that moment for the question in some measure touched upon money matters and considerations as to property from all of which lady fitzgerald at present wished to keep her husbands mind free but towards the end of the drive he himself again referred to it  she is a nice girl isnt she  very nice i think as far as ive seen her  she is pretty certainly  very pretty more than pretty much more she will be beautiful  but she is such a mere child you do not think that anything will come of it immediatelynot quite immediately  oh no certainly not quite immediately i think herbert is not calculated to be very sudden in any such feelings or in the expression of them but i do think such an event very probable before the winter is over  in the mean time herbert spent the whole day over at desmond court or at clady he found the countess delighted to see him and both she and lady clara went on with him to clady it was past five and quite dark before he reached castle richmond so that he barely got home in time to dress for dinner  the dinnerparty that evening was more pleasant than usual sir thomas not only dined with them but came into the drawingroom after dinner and to a certain extent joined in their conversation lady fitzgerald could see that this was done by a great effort but it was not remarked by aunt letty and the others who were delighted to have him with them and to see him once more interested about their interests  and now the building of the mill had been settled and the final orders were to be given by herbert at the spot on the following morning  we can go with you to berryhill i suppose cant we said mary  i shall be in a great hurry said herbert who clearly did not wish to be encumbered by his sisters on this special expedition  and why are you to be in such a hurry tomorrow asked aunt letty  well i shall be hurried i have promised to go to clady again and i must be back here early and must get another horse  why herbert you are becoming a hercules of energy said his father smiling you will have enough to do if you look to all the soup kitchens on the desmond property as well as our own  i made a sort of promise about this particular affair at clady and i must carry it out said herbert  and youll pay your devoirs to the fair lady clara on your way home of course said mary  more than probable he replied  and stay so late again that youll hardly be here in time for dinner continued mary to which little sally her brother vouchsafed no answer  but emmeline said nothing lady clara was specially her friend and she was too anxious to secure such a sisterinlaw to make any joke upon such a subject  on that occasion nothing more was said about it but sir thomas hoped within his heart that his wife was right in prophesying that his son would do nothing sudden in this matter  on the following morning young fitzgerald gave the necessary orders at berryhill very quickly and then coming back remounted another horse without going into the house then he trotted off to clady passing the gate of desmond court without calling did what he had promised to do at clady or rather that which he had made to stand as an excuse for again visiting that part of the world so quickly and after that with a conscience let us hope quite clear rode up the avenue at desmond court it was still early in the day when he got there probably not much after two oclock and yet mary had been quite correct in foretelling that he would only be home just in time for dinner  but nevertheless he had not seen lady desmond why or how it had occurred that she had been absent from the drawingroom the whole of the two hours which he had passed in the house it may be unnecessary to explain such however had been the fact the first five minutes had been passed in inquiries after the bruise and it must be owned in a surgical inspection of the still discoloured arm it must be very painful he had said looking into her face as though by doing so he could swear that he would so willingly bear all the pain himself if it were only possible to make such an exchange  not very she had answered smiling it is only a little stiff i cant quite move it easily  and then she lifted it up and afterwards dropped it with a little look of pain that ran through his heart  the next five minutes were taken up in discussing the case of the recusant boiler and then clara discovered that she had better go and fetch her mother but against the immediate taking of this step he had alleged some valid reason and so they had gone on till the dark night admonished him that he could do no more than save the dinner hour at castle richmond  the room was nearly dark when he left her and she got up and stood at the front window so that unseen she might see his figure as he rode off from the house he mounted his horse within the quadrangle and coming out at the great oldfashioned ugly portal galloped off across the green park with a loose rein and a happy heart what is it the song says      oh ladies beware of a gay young knight     who loves and who rides away   there was at claras heart as she stood there at the window some feeling of the expediency of being beware some shadow of doubt as to the wisdom of what she had done he rode away gaily with a happy spirit for he had won that on the winning of which he had been intent no necessity for caution presented itself to him he had seen and loved had then asked and had not asked in vain  she stood gazing after him as long as her straining eye could catch any outline of his figure as it disappeared through the gloom of the evening as long as she could see him or even fancy that she still saw him she thought only of his excellence of his high character his kind heart his talentswhich in her estimation were ranked perhaps above their real valuehis tastes which coincided so well with her own his quiet yet manly bearing his useful pursuits his gait appearance and demeanour all these were of a nature to win the heart of such a girl as clara desmond and then probably in some indistinct way she remembered the broad acres to which he was the heir and comforted herself by reflecting that this at least was a match which none would think disgraceful for a daughter even of an earl of desmond  but sadder thoughts did come when that figure had wholly disappeared her eye looking out into the darkness could not but see another figure on which it had often in past times delighted almost unconsciously to dwell there walking on that very road another lover another fitzgerald had sworn that he loved her and had truly sworn so as she well knew she had never doubted his truth to her and did not doubt it nowand yet she had given herself away to another  and in many things he too that other lover had been noble and gracious and fit for a woman to love in person he exceeded all that she had ever seen or dreamed of and why should we think that personal excellence is to count for nothing in female judgment when in that of men it ranks so immeasurably above all other excellences his bearing too was chivalrous and bold his language full of poetry and his manner of loving eager impetuous and of a kin to worship then too he was now in misfortune and when has that failed to soften even the softness of a womans heart  it was impossible that she should not make comparisons comparisons that were so distasteful to her impossible also that she should not accuse herself of some falseness to that first lover the time to us my friends seems short enough since she was walking there and listening with childish delight to owens protestations of love it was but little more than one year since but to her those months had been very long and reader if thou hast arrived at any period of life which enables thee to count thy past years by lustrums if thou art at a time of life past thirty we will say hast thou not found that thy years which are now short enough were long in those bygone days  those fourteen months were to her the space almost of a second life as she now looked back upon them when those earlier vows were made what had she cared for prudence for the worlds esteem or an alliance that might be becoming to her that owen fitzgerald was a gentleman of high blood and ancient family so much she had cared to know for the rest she had only cared to feel this that her heart beat high with pleasure when he was with her  did her heart beat as high now when his cousin was beside her no she felt that it did not and sometimes she felt or feared to feel that it might beat high again when she should again see the lover whom her judgment had rejected  her judgment had rejected him altogether long before an idea had at all presented itself to her that herbert fitzgerald could become her suitor nor had this been done wholly in obedience to her mothers mandate she had realized in her own mind the conviction that owen fitzgerald was not a man with whom any girl could at present safely link her fortune she knew well that he was idle dissipated and extravagant and she could not believe that these vices had arisen only from his banishment from her and that they would cease and vanish whenever that banishment might cease  messages came to her in underhand waysways well understood in ireland and not always ignored in englandto the effect that all his misdoings arose from his unhappiness that he drank and gambled only because the gates of desmond court were no longer open to him there was that in claras heart which did for a while predispose her to believe somewhat of this to hope that it might not be altogether false could any girl loving such a man not have had some such hope but then the stories of these revelries became worse and worse and it was dinned into her ears that these doings had been running on in all their enormity before that day of his banishment and so silently and sadly with no outspoken word either to mother or brother she had resolved to give him up  there was no necessity to her for any outspoken word she had promised her mother to hold no intercourse with the man and she had kept and would keep her promise why say more about it how she might have reconciled her promise to her mother with an enduring engagement had owen fitzgeralds conduct allowed her to regard her engagement as enduringthat had been a sore trouble to her while hope had remained but now no hope remained and that trouble was over  and then herbert fitzgerald had come across her path and those sweet loving kind fitzgerald girls who were always ready to cover her with such sweet caresses with whom she had known more of the happiness of friendliness than ever she had felt before they threw themselves upon her like sisters and she had never before enjoyed sisterly treatment he had come across her path and from the first moment she had become conscious of his admiration  she knew herself to be penniless and dreaded that she should be looked upon as wishing to catch the rich heir but every one had conspired to throw them together lady fitzgerald had welcomed her like a mother with more caressing soft tenderness than her own mother usually vouchsafed to her and even sir thomas had gone out of his usual way to be kind to her  that her mother would approve of such a marriage she could not doubt lady desmond in these latter days had not said much to her about owen but she had said very much of the horrors of poverty and she had been too subtle to praise the virtues of herbert with open plain words but she had praised the comforts of a handsome income and wellestablished family mansion clara at these times had understood more than had been intended and had therefore put herself on her guard against her mothers worldly wisdom but nevertheless the dropping of the water had in some little measure hollowed the stone beneath  and thus thinking of these things she stood at the window for some halfhour after the form of her accepted lover had become invisible in the gathering gloom of the evening  and then her mother entered the room and candles were brought lady desmond was all smiles and benignity as she had been for this last week past while herbert fitzgerald had been coming and going almost daily at desmond court but clara understood this benignity and disliked it  it was however now necessary that everything should be told herbert had declared that he should at once inform his father and mother and obtain their permission for his marriage he spoke of it as a matter on which there was no occasion for any doubt or misgiving he was an only son he said and trusted and loved in everything his father never opposed him on any subject whatever and would he was sure consent to any match he might propose but as to you he added with a lovers flattering fervour they are all so fond of you they all think so much of you that my only fear is that i shall be jealous theyll all make love to you aunt letty included  it was therefore essential that she should at once tell her mother and ask her mothers leave she had once before confessed a tale of love and had done so with palpitation of the heart with trembling of the limbs and floods of tears then her tale had been received with harsh sternness now she could tell her story without any trembling with no tears but it was almost indifferent to her whether her mother was harsh or tender  what has mr fitzgerald gone said the countess on entering the room  yes mamma this halfhour said clara not as yet coming away from the window  i did not hear his horse and imagined he was here still i hope he has not thought me terribly uncivil but i could not well leave what i was doing  to this little makebelieve speech clara did not think it necessary to return any answer she was thinking how she would begin to say that for saying which there was so strong a necessity and she could not take a part in small false badinage on a subject which was so near her heart  and what about that stupid mason at clady asked the countess still making believe  mr fitzgerald was there again today mamma and i think it will be all right now but he did not say much about it  why not you were all so full of it yesterday  clara who had half turned round towards the light now again turned herself towards the window this task must be done but the doing of it was so disagreeable how was she to tell her mother that she loved this man seeing that so short a time since she had declared that she loved another  and what was he talking about love said the countess ever so graciously or perhaps no questioning on the matter can be allowed may i ask questions or may i not eh clara and then the mother walking up towards the window put her fair white hands upon her daughters two shoulders  of course you may inquire said clara  then i do inquireimmediately what has this preux chevalier been saying to my clara that makes her stand thus solemn and silent gazing out into the dark night  mamma  well love  herbert fitzgerald hashas asked me to be his wife he has proposed to me  the mothers arm now encircled the daughter lovingly and the mothers lips were pressed to the daughters forehead herbert fitzgerald has asked you to be his wife has he and what answer has my bonny bird deigned to make to so audacious a request  lady desmond had never before spoken to her daughter in tones so gracious in a manner so flattering so caressing so affectionate but clara would not open her heart to her mothers tenderness she could not look into her mothers face and welcome her mothers consent with unutterable joy as she would have done had that consent been given a year since to a less prudent proposition that marriage for which she was now to ask her mothers sanction would of course be sanctioned she had no favour to beg nothing for which to be grateful with a slight motion unconsciously unwillingly but not the less positively she repulsed her mothers caress as she answered her question  i have accepted him mamma that is of course if you do not object  my own own child said the countess seizing her daughter in her arms and pressing her to her bosom and in truth clara was now probably for the first time her own hearts daughter her son though he was but a poor earl was earl of desmond he too though in truth but a poor earl was not absolutely destitutewould in truth be blessed with a fair future but lady clara had hitherto been felt only as a weight she had been born poor as poverty itself and hitherto had shown so little disposition to find for herself a remedy for this crushing evil but nownow matters were indeed changed she had obtained for herself the best match in the whole country round and in doing so had sacrificed her hearts young love was she not entitled to all a mothers tenderness who knew who could know the miseries of poverty so well as the countess of desmond who then could feel so much gratitude to a child for prudently escaping from them lady desmond did feel grateful to her daughter  my own own child my happy girl she repeated he is a man to whom any mother in all the land would be proud to see her daughter married never never did i see a young man so perfectly worthy of a girls love he is so thoroughly well educated so thoroughly well conducted so goodlooking so warmhearted so advantageously situated in all his circumstances of course he will go into parliament and then any course is open to him the property is i believe wholly unembarrassed and there are no younger brothers you may say that the place is his own already for old sir thomas is almost nobody i do wish you joy my own dearest dearest clara after which burst of maternal eloquence the countess pressed her lips to those of her child and gave her a mothers warmest kiss  clara was conscious that she was thoroughly dissatisfied with her mother but she could not exactly say why it was so she did return her mothers kiss but she did it coldly and with lips that were not eager  im glad you think that i have done right mamma  right my love of course i think that you have done right only i give you no credit dearest none in the least for how could you help loving one so lovable in every way as dear herbert  credit no there is no credit she said not choosing to share her mothers pleasantry  but there is this credit had you not been one of the sweetest girls that ever was born he would not have loved you  he has loved me because there was no one else here said clara  nonsense no one else here indeed has he not the power if he pleases to go and choose whomever he will in all london had he been mercenary and wanted money said the countess in a tone which showed how thoroughly she despised any such vice he might have had what he would but then he could not have had my clara but he has looked for beauty and manners and highbred tastes and an affectionate heart and in my opinion he could not have been more successful in his search after which second burst of eloquence she again kissed her daughter  twas thus at that moment that she congratulated the wife of the future sir herbert fitzgerald and then she allowed clara to go up to her own room there to meditate quietly on what she had done and on that which she was about to do but late in the evening lady desmond whose mind was thoroughly full of the subject again broke out into triumph  you must write to patrick tomorrow clara he must hear the good news from no one but yourself  had we not better wait a little mamma  why my love you hardly know how anxious your brother is for your welfare  i knew it was right to tell you mamma  right to tell me of course it was you could not have had the heart to keep it from me for half a day  but perhaps it may be better not to mention it further till we know  till we know what said the countess with a look of fear about her brow  whether sir thomas and lady fitzgerald will wish it if they object  object why should they object how can they object they are not mercenary people and you are an earls daughter and herbert is not like a girl the property is his own entailed on him and he may do as he pleases  in such a matter i am sure he would not wish to displease either his father or his mother  nonsense my dear quite nonsense you do not at all see the difference between a young man and a girl he has a right to do exactly as he likes in such a matter but i am quite sure that they will not object why should they how can they  mr fitzgerald says that they will not clara admitted almost grudgingly  of course they will not i dont suppose they could bring themselves to object to anything he might suggest i never knew a young man so happily situated in this respect he is quite a free agent i dont think they would say much to him if he insisted on marrying the cookmaid indeed it seems to me that his word is quite paramount at castle richmond  all the same mamma i would rather not write to patrick till something more has been settled  you are wrong there clara if anything disagreeable should happen which is quite impossible it would be absolutely necessary that your brother should know believe me my love i only advise you for your own good  but mr fitzgerald will probably be here tomorrow or if not tomorrow next day  i have no doubt he will love but why do you call him mr fitzgerald you were calling him herbert the other day dont you remember how i scolded you i should not scold you now  clara made no answer to this and then the subject was allowed to rest for that night she would call him herbert she said to herself but not to her mother she would keep the use of that name till she could talk with emmeline as a sister of all her anticipated pleasures that of having now a real sister was perhaps the greatest or rather that of being able to talk about herbert with one whom she could love and treat as a sister but herbert himself would exact the use of his own christian name for the delight of his own ears that was a matter of course that doubtless had been already done  and then mother and daughter went to bed the countess as she did so was certainly happy to her hearts core could it be that she had some hope unrecognized by herself that owen fitzgerald might now once more be welcomed at desmond court that something might now be done to rescue him from that slough of despond  and clara too was happy though her happiness was mixed she did love herbert fitzgerald she was sure of that she said so to herself over and over again love him of course she loved him and would cherish him as her lord and husband to the last day of her life the last gasp of her breath  but still as sleep came upon her eyelids she saw in her memory the bright flash of that other lovers countenance when he first astonished her with the avowal of his love as he walked beside her under the elms with his horse following at his heels     chapter xii  doubts   i believe there is no period of life so happy as that in which a thriving lover leaves his mistress after his first success his joy is more perfect then than at the absolute moment of his own eager vow and her halfassenting blushes then he is thinking mostly of her and is to a certain degree embarrassed by the effort necessary for success but when the promise has once been given to him and he is able to escape into the domain of his own heart he is as a conqueror who has mastered half a continent by his own strategy  it never occurs to him he hardly believes that his success is no more than that which is the ordinary lot of mortal man he never reflects that all the old married fogies whom he knows and despises have just as much ground for pride if such pride were enduring that every fat silent dull somnolent old lady whom he sees and quizzes has at some period been deemed as worthy a prize as his priceless galleon and so deemed by as bold a captor as himself  some one has said that every young mother when her first child is born regards the babe as the most wonderful production of that description which the world has yet seen and this too is true but i doubt even whether that conviction is so strong as the conviction of the young successful lover that he has achieved a triumph which should ennoble him down to late generations as he goes along he has a contempt for other men for they know nothing of such glory as his as he pores over his blackstone he remembers that he does so not so much that he may acquire law as that he may acquire fanny and then all other porers over blackstone are low and mean in his sightare mercenary in their views and unfortunate in their ideas for they have no fanny in view  herbert fitzgerald had this proud feeling strong within his heart as he galloped away across the greensward and trotted fast along the road home to castle richmond she was compounded of all excellencesso he swore to himself over and over againand being so compounded she had consented to bestow all these excellences upon him being herself goddesslike she had promised to take him as the object of her worlds worship so he trotted on fast and faster as though conscious of the halfcontinent which he had won by his skill and valour  she had told him about his cousin owen indeed the greater number of the soft musical words which she had spoken in that long three hours colloquy had been spoken on this special point it had behoved her to tell him all and she thought that she had done so nay she had done so with absolute truthto the best of her hearts power  you were so young then he had argued so very young  yes very young i am not very old now you know and she smiled sweetly on him  no no but a year makes so much difference you were all but a child then you do not love him now clara  no i do not love him now she had answered  and then he exacted a second a third a fourth assurance that she did absolutely actually and with her whole heart love him him herbert in lieu of that other him poor owen and with this he herbert was contented content nay but proud elated with triumph and conscious of victory in this spirit he rode home as fast as his horse could carry him  he too had to tell his tale to those to whom he owed obedience and to beg that they would look upon his intended bride with eyes of love and with parental affection but in this respect he was hardly troubled with more doubt than clara had felt how could any one object to his clara  there are young men who from their positions in life are obliged to abstain from early marriage or to look for dowries with their wives but he luckily was not fettered in this way he could marry as he pleased so long as she whom he might choose brought with her gentle blood a good heart a sweet temper and such attraction of person and manners as might make the establishment at castle richmond proud of his young bride and of whom could that establishment be more proud than of lady clara desmond so he rode home without any doubt to clog his happiness  but he had a source of joy which clara wanted she was almost indifferent to her mothers satisfaction but herbert looked forward with the liveliest keenest anticipation to his mothers gratified caresses and unqualified approvalto his fathers kind smile and warm assurance of consent clara had made herself known at castle richmond and he had no doubt but that all this would be added to his cup of happiness there was therefore no alloy to debase his virgin gold as he trotted quickly into the stableyard  but he resolved that he would say nothing about the matter that night he could not well tell them all in full conclave together early after breakfast he would go to his fathers room and after that he would find his mother there would then be no doubt that the news would duly leak out among his sisters and aunt letty  again only just barely in time herbert said mary as they clustered round the fire before dinner  you cant say i ever keep you waiting and i really think thats some praise for a man who has got a good many things on his hand  so it is herbert said emmeline but we have done something too we have been over to berryhill and the people have already begun there they were at work with their pickaxes among the rocks by the riverside  so much the better was mr somers there  we did not see him but he had been there said aunt letty but mrs townsend found us and who do you think came up to us in the most courteous affable condescending way  who i dont know brady the builder i suppose  no indeed brady was not half so civil for he kept himself to his own work it was the rev mr mcarthy if you please  i only hope you were civil to him said herbert with some slight suffusion of colour over his face for he rather doubted the conduct of his aunt to the priest especially as her great protestant ally mrs townsend was of the party  civil i dont know what you would have unless you wanted me to embrace him he shook hands with us all round i really thought mrs townsend would have looked him into the river when he came to her  she always was the quintessence of absurdity and prejudice said he  oh herbert exclaimed aunt letty  well and what of oh herbert i say she is so if you and mary and emmeline did not look him into the river when he shook hands with you why should she do so he is an ordained priest even according to her own tenetsonly she knows nothing of what her own tenets are  ill tell you what they are they are the substantial true and holy doctrines of the protestant religion founded on the gospel mrs townsend is a thoroughly protestant woman one who cannot abide the sorceries of popery  hates them as a mad dog hates water and with the same amount of judgment we none of us wish to be drowned but nevertheless there are some good qualities in water  but there are no good qualities in popery said aunt letty with her most extreme energy  are there not said herbert i should have thought that belief in christ belief in the bible belief in the doctrine of a saviours atonement were good qualities even the mahommedans religion has some qualities that are good  i would sooner be a mahommedan than a papist said aunt letty somewhat thoughtlessly but very stoutly  you would alter your opinion after the first week in a harem said herbert and then there was a burst of laughter in which aunt letty herself joined i would sooner go there than go to confession she whispered to mary as they all walked off to dinner  and how is the lady claras arm asked mary as soon as they were again once more round the fire  the lady claras arm is still very blue said herbert  and i suppose it took you half an hour to weep over it continued his sister  exactly by shrewsbury clock  and while you were weeping over the arm what happened to the hand she did not surrender it did she in return for so much tenderness on your part  emmeline thought that mary was very pertinacious in her badinage and was going to bid her hold her tongue but she observed that herbert blushed and walked away without further answer he went to the further end of the long room and there threw himself on to a sofa could it be that it was all settled thought emmeline to herself  she followed him to the sofa and sitting beside him took hold of his arm oh herbert if there is anything to tell do tell me  anything to tell said he what do you mean  oh you know i do love her so dearly i shall never be contented to love any one else as your wifenot to love her really really with all my heart  what geese you girls areyou are always thinking of love and weddings and orangeblossoms  it is only for you i think about them said emmeline i know there is something to tell dear herbert do tell me  there is a young bachelor duke coming here tomorrow he has a million a year and three counties all his own he has blue eyes and is the handsomest man that ever was seen is that news enough  very well herbert i would tell you anything  well tell me anything  ill tell you this i know youre in love with clara desmond and im sure shes in love with you and i believe you are both engaged and youre not nice at all to have a secret from me i never tease you as mary does and it would make me so happy to know it  upon this he put his arm round her waist and whispered one word into her ear she gave an exclamation of delight and as the tears came into her eyes congratulated him with a kiss oh dear oh dear i am so happy she exclaimed  hushsh he whispered i knew how it would be if i told you  but they will all know tomorrow will they not  leave that to me you have coaxed me out of my secret and you are bound to keep it and then he went away well pleased this description of delight on his sisters part was the first instalment of that joy which he had promised himself from the satisfaction of his family  lady fitzgerald had watched all that had passed and had already learned her mistakeher mistake in that she had prophesied that no immediate proposal was likely to be made by her son she now knew well enough that he had made such a proposal and that he had been accepted  and this greatly grieved her she had felt certain from the few slight words which sir thomas had spoken that there were valid reasons why her son should not marry a penniless girl that conversation joined to other things to the mans visit and her husbands deep dejection had convinced her that all was not right some misfortune was impending over them and there had been that in her own early history which filled her with dismay as she thought of this  she had ardently desired to caution her son in this respectto guard him if possible against future disappointment and future sorrow but she could not do so without obtaining in some sort her husbands assent to her doing so she resolved that she would talk it over with sir thomas but the subject was one so full of pain and he was so ill and therefore she had put it off  and now she saw that the injury was done nevertheless she said nothing either to emmeline or to herbert if the injury were done what good could now result from talking she doubtless would hear it all soon enough so she sat still watching them  on the following morning sir thomas did not come out to breakfast herbert went into his room quite early as was always his custom and as he left it for the breakfastparlour he said father i should like to speak to you just now about something of importance  something of importance herbert what is it anything wrong for sir thomas was nervous and easily frightened  oh dear no nothing is wrong it is nothing that will annoy you at least i think not but it will keep till after breakfast i will come in again the moment breakfast is over and so saying he left the room with a light step  in the breakfastparlour it seemed to him as though everybody was conscious of some important fact his mothers kiss was peculiarly solemn and full of solicitude aunt letty smirked as though she was aware of somethingsomething over and above the great protestant tenets which usually supported her and mary had no joke to fling at him  emmeline he whispered you have told  no indeed she replied but what mattered it everybody would know now in a few minutes so he ate his breakfast and then returned to sir thomas  father said he as soon as he had got into the armchair in which it was his custom to sit when talking with sir thomas i hope what i am going to tell you will give you pleasure i have proposed to a young lady and she hasaccepted me  you have proposed and have been accepted  yes father  and the young lady  is lady clara desmond i hope you will say that you approve of it she has no fortune as we all know but that will hardly matter to me and i think you will allow that in every other respect she is  perfect herbert would have said had he dared to express his true meaning but he paused for a moment to look for a less triumphant word and then paused again and left his sentence incomplete when he saw the expression of his fathers face  oh father you do not mean to say that you do not like her  but it was not dislike that was expressed in his fathers face as herbert felt the moment after he had spoken there was pain there and solicitude and disappointment a look of sorrow at the tidings thus conveyed to him but nothing that seemed to betoken dislike of any person  what is it sir why do you not speak to me can it be that you disapprove of my marrying  sir thomas certainly did disapprove of his sons marrying but he lacked the courage to say so much misery that had hitherto come upon him and that was about to come on all those whom he loved so well arose from this lack of courage he did not dare to tell his son that he advised him for the present to put aside all such hopes it would have been terrible for him to do so but he knew that in not doing so he was occasioning sorrow that would be more terrible  and yet he did not do it herbert saw clearly that the project was distasteful to his fatherthat project which he had hoped to have seen received with so much delight but nothing was said to him which tended to make him alter his purpose  do you not like her he asked his father almost piteously  yes yes i do like her we all like her very much indeed herbert  then why  you are so young my boy and she is so very young and  and what  why herbert it is not always practicable for the son even of a man of property to marry so early in life as this she has nothing you know  no said the young man proudly i never thought of looking for money  but in your position it is so essential if a young man wishes to marry  herbert had always regarded his father as the most liberal man breathingas openhearted and openhanded almost to a fault to him his only son he had ever been so refusing him nothing and latterly allowing him to do almost as he would with the management of the estate he could not understand that this liberality should be turned to parsimony on such an occasion as that of his sons marriage  you think then sir that i ought not to marry lady clara said herbert very bitterly  i like her excessively said sir thomas i think she is a sweet girl a very sweet girl all that i or your mother could desire to see in your wife but  but she is not rich  do not speak to me in that tone my boy said sir thomas with an expression that would have moved his enemy to pity let alone his son his son did pity him and ceased to wear the angry expression of face which had so wounded his father  but father i do not understand you he said is there any real objection why i should not marry i am more than twentytwo and you i think married earlier than that  in answer to this sir thomas only sighed meekly and piteously  if you mean to say continued the son that it will be inconvenient to you to make me any allowance  no no no you are of course entitled to what you want and as long as i can give it you shall have it  as long as you can give it father  as long as it is in my power i mean what can i want of anything but for youfor you and them  after this herbert sat silent for a while leaning on his arm he knew that there existed some mischief but he could not fathom it had he been prudent he would have felt that there was some impediment to his love some evil which it behoved him to fathom before he allowed his love to share it but when was a lover prudent  we should live here should we not father no second establishment would be necessary  of course you would live here said sir thomas glad to be able to look at the subject on any side that was not painful of course you would live here for the matter of that herbert the house should be considered as your own if you so wished it  against this the son put in his most violent protest nothing on earth should make him consider himself master of castle richmond as long as his father lived nor would clarahis clara wish it he knew her well he boasted it would amply suffice to her to live there with them all was not the house large enough and indeed where else could he live seeing that all his interests were naturally centred upon the property  and then sir thomas did give his consent it would be wrong to say that it was wrung from him he gave it willingly enough as far as the present moment was concerned when it was once settled he assured his son that he would love clara as his daughter but nevertheless  the father knew that he had done wrong and herbert knew that he also he himself had done wrongly he was aware that there was something which he did not understand but he had promised to see clara either that day or the next and he could not bring himself to unsay all that he had said to her he left his fathers room sorrowful at heart and discontented he had expected that his tidings would have been received in so far other a manner that he would have been able to go from his fathers study up stairs to his mothers room with so exulting a step that his news when once the matter was ratified by his fathers approval would have flown about the house with so loud a note of triumph and now it was so different his father had consented but it was too plain that there was no room for any triumph  well herbert said emmeline jumping up to meet him as he returned to a small back drawingroom through which he had gone to his fathers dressingroom she had calculated that he would come there and that she might thus get the first word from him after the interview was over  but there was a frown upon his brow and displeasure in his eyes there was none of that bright smile of gratified pride with which she had expected that her greeting would have been met is there anything wrong she said he does not disapprove does he  never mind and do leave me now i never can make you understand that one is not always in a humour for joking and so saying he put her aside and passed on  joking that was indeed hard upon poor emmeline seeing that her thoughts were so full of him that her heart beat so warmly for his promised bride but she said nothing shrinking back abashed and vanishing out of the way could it be possible that her father should have refused to receive lady clara desmond as his daughterinlaw  he then betook himself to a private territory of his own where he might be sure that he would remain undisturbed for some halfhour or so he would go to his mother of course but not quite immediately he would think over the matter endeavouring to ascertain what it was that had made his fathers manner and words so painful to him  but he could not get his thoughts to work rightlywhich getting of the thoughts to work rightly is bytheby as i take it the hardest work which a man is called upon to do not that the subject to be thought about need in itself be difficult were one to say that thoughts about hydrostatics and pneumatics are difficult to the multitude or that mental efforts in regions of political economy or ethical philosophy are beyond ordinary reach one would only pronounce an evident truism an absurd platitude but let any man take any subject fully within his own minds scope and strive to think about it steadily with some attempt at calculation as to results the chances are his mind will fly off willhenillhe to some utterly different matter when he wishes to debate within himself that question of his wifes temper he will find himself considering whether he may not judiciously give away half a dozen pairs of those old boots or when it behoves him to decide whether it shall be manure and a green crop or a fallow season and then grass seeds he cannot keep himself from inward inquiry as to the meaning of that peculiar smile on mrs walkers face when he shook hands with her last night  lord brougham and professor faraday can no doubt command their thoughts if many men could do so there would be many lord broughams and many professor faradays  at the present moment herbert fitzgerald had no right to consider himself as following in the steps of either one or other of these great men he wished to think about his fathers circumstances but his mind would fly off to clara desmond and her perfections and thus though he remained there for half an hour with his back to the fire and his hands in his pockets his deliberations had done him no good whateverhad rather done him harm seeing that he had only warmed himself into a firmer determination to go on with what he was doing and then he went to his mother  she kissed him and spoke very tenderly nay affectionately about clara but even she even his mother did not speak joyously and she also said something about the difficulty of providing a maintenance for a married son then to her he burst forth and spoke somewhat loudly  i cannot understand all this mother if either you or my father know any reason why i should be treated differently from other sons you ought to tell me not leave me to grope about in the dark  but my boy we both think that no son was ever entitled to more consideration or to kinder or more liberal treatment  why do i hear all this then about the difficulty of my marrying or if i hear so much why do i not hear more i know pretty well i believe what is my fathers income  if you do not he would tell you for the asking  and i know that i must be the heir to it whatever it isnot that that feeling would make any difference in my dealings with him not the least and under these circumstances i cannot conceive why he and you should look coldly upon my marriage  i look coldly on it herbert  do you not do you not tell me that there will be no income for me if that is to be so if that really is the case if the property has so dwindled away or become embarrassed  oh herbert there never was a man less likely to injure his sons property than your father  i do not mean that mother let him do what he likes with it i should not upbraid him even in my thoughts but if it be embarrassed if it has dwindled away if there be any reason why i should not regard myself as altogether untrammelled with regard to money he ought to tell me i cannot accuse myself of expensive tastes  dearest herbert nobody accuses you of anything  but i do desire to marry and now i have engaged myself and will not break from my engagement unless it be shown to me that i am bound in honour to do so then indeed  oh herbert i do not know what you mean  i mean this that i expect that clara shall be received as my wife with open arms  and so she shall be if she comes  or else that some reason should be given me why she should not come as to income something must be done i suppose if the means at our disposal are less than i have been taught to believe i at any rate will not complain but they cannot i think be so small as to afford any just reason why i should not marry  your father you see is ill and one can hardly talk to him fully upon such matters at present  then i will speak to somers he at any rate must know how the property is circumstanced and i suppose he will not hesitate to tell me  i dont think somers can tell you anything  then what is it as for the london estate mother that is all moonshine what if it were gone altogether it may be that it is that which vexes my father but if so it is a monomania  oh my boy do not use such a word  you know what i mean if any doubt as to that is creating this despondency it only shows that though we are bound to respect and relieve my fathers state of mind we are not at all bound to share it what would it really matter mother if that place in london were washed away by the thames there is more than enough left for us all unless  ah herbert that is it  then i will go to somers and he shall tell me my fathers interest in this property cannot have been involved without his knowledge and circumstanced as we and my father are he is bound to tell me  if there be anything within his knowledge to tell he will tell it  and if there be nothing within his knowledge then i can only look upon all this as a disease on my poor fathers part i will do all i can to comfort him in it but it would be madness to destroy my whole happiness because he labours under delusions  lady fitzgerald did not know what further to say she half believed that sir thomas did labour under some delusion but then she half believed also that he had upon his mind a sorrow terribly real which was in no sort delusive under such circumstances how could she advise her son instead of advising him she caressed him  but i may claim this from you mother that if somers tells me nothing which ought to make me break my word to clara you will receive her as your daughter you will promise me that will you not  lady fitzgerald did promise warmly assuring him that she already dearly loved clara desmond that she would delight in having such a daughterinlaw and that she would go to her to welcome her as such as soon as ever he should bid her do so with this herbert was somewhat comforted and immediately started on his search after mr somers  i do not think that any person is to be found as a rule attached to english estates whose position is analogous to that of an irish agent and there is a wide misunderstanding in england as to these irish functionaries i have attempted some pages back to describe the national delinquencies of a middleman or profitrenter in england we are apt to think that the agents on irish properties are to be charged with similar shortcomings this i can assert to be a great mistake and i believe that as a class the agents on irish properties do their duty in a manner beneficial to the people  that there are or were many agents who were also middlemen or profitrenters and that in this second position they were a nuisance to the country is no doubt true but they were no nuisance in their working capacity as agents that there are some bad agents there can be no doubt as there are also some bad shoemakers  the duties towards an estate which an agent performs in ireland are i believe generally shared in england between three or four different persons the family lawyer performs part the estate steward performs part and the landlord himself performs partas to small estates by far the greater part  in ireland let the estate be ever so smalleight hundred a year we will sayall the working of the property is managed by the agent it is he who knows the tenants and the limits of their holdings it is he who arranges leases and allowsor much more generally does not allowfor improvements he takes the rent and gives the order for the ejection of tenants if he cannot get it  i am far from saying that it would not be well that much of this should be done by the landlord himselfthat all of it should be so done on a small property but it is done by agents and as a rule is i think done honestly  mr somers was agent to the castle richmond property and as he took to himself as such five per cent on all rents paid and as he was agent also to sundry other small properties in the neighbourhood he succeeded in making a very snug income he had also an excellent house on the estate and was altogether very much thought of on the whole perhaps more than was sir thomas but in this respect it was probable that herbert might soon take the lead  he was a large heavy consequential man always very busy as though aware of being one of the most important wheels that kept the irish clock agoing but he was honest kindhearted in the main true as steel to his employers and goodhumouredas long as he was allowed to have his own way in these latter days he had been a little soured by herberts interference and had even gone so far as to say that in his humble judgment mr fitzgerald was wrong in doingso and so but he generally called him herbert was always kind to him and in his heart of hearts loved him dearly but that was a matter of course for had he not been agent to the estate before herbert was born  immediately after his interview with his mother mr herbert rode over to mr somerss house and there found him sitting alone in his office he dashed immediately into the subject that had brought him there i have come mr somers said he to ask you a question about the property  about the castle richmond property said mr somers rather surprised by his visitors manner  yes you know in what a state my poor father now is  i know that sir thomas is not very well i am sorry to say that it is long since he has been quite himself  there is something that is preying upon his spirits  i am afraid so herbert  then tell me fairly mr somers do you know what it is  notinthe least i have no conception whatever and never have had any i know no cause for trouble that should disquiet him  there is nothing wrong about the property  not to my knowledge  who has the titledeeds  they are at couttss  you are sure of that  well as sure as a man can be of a thing that he does not see i have never seen them there indeed have never seen them at all but i feel no doubt in my own mind as to their being at the bankers  is there much due on the estate  very little no estate in county cork has less on it miss letty has her income and when poulnasherry was boughtthat townland lying just under berryhill where the gorse cover is part of the purchase money was left on mortgage that is still due but the interest is less than a hundred a year  and that is all  all that i know of  could there be encumbrances without your knowing it  i think not i think it is impossible of all men your father is the last to encumber his estates in a manner unknown to his agent and to pay off the interest in secret  what is it then mr somers  i do not know and then mr somers paused of course you have heard of a visit he received the other day from a stranger  yes i heard of it  people about here are talking of it and hethat man with a younger manthey are still living in cork at a little drinkinghouse in south main street the younger man has been seen down here twice  but what can that mean  i do not know i tell you everything that i do know  herbert exacted a promise from him that he would continue to tell him everything which he might learn and then rode back to castle richmond  the whole thing must be a delusion he said to himself and resolved that there was no valid reason why he should make clara unhappy by any reference to the circumstance     chapter xiii  mr mollett returns to south main street   i must now take my readers back to that very unsavoury publichouse in south main street cork in which for the present lived mr matthew mollett and his son abraham  i need hardly explain to a discerning public that mr matthew mollett was the gentleman who made that momentous call at castle richmond and flurried all that household  drat it said mrs jones to herself on that day as soon as she had regained the solitude of her own private apartment after having taken a long look at mr mollett in the hall on that occasion she sat down on a low chair in the middle of the room put her two hands down substantially on her two knees gave a long sigh and then made the above exclamationdrat it  mrs jones was still thoroughly a saxon although she had lived for so many years among the celts but it was only when she was quite alone that she allowed herself the indulgence of so peculiarly saxon a mode of expressing either her surprise or indignation  its the same man she said to herself as come that day as sure as eggs and then for five minutes she maintained her position cogitating and hes like the other fellow too she continued only somehow hes not like him and then another pause and yet he is only it cant be and he aint just so tall and hes older like and then still meditating mrs jones kept her position for full ten minutes longer at the end of which time she got up and shook herself she deserved to be bracketed with lord brougham and professor faraday for she had kept her mind intent on her subject and had come to a resolution i wont say nothing to nobody noways was the expression of her minds purpose only ill tell missus as how he was the man as come to wales and she did tell so much to her mistressas we have before learned  mr mollett had gone down from cork to castle richmond in one of those delightful irish vehicles called a covered car an insidecovered car is an equipage much given to shaking seeing that it has a heavy top like a london cab and that it runs on a pair of wheels it is entered from behind and slopes backwards the sitter sits sideways between a cracked window on one side and a cracked doorway on the other and as a draught is always going in at the ear next the window and out at the ear next the door it is about as cold and comfortless a vehicle for winter as may be well imagined now the journey from castle richmond to cork has to be made right across the boggeragh mountains it is over twenty miles irish and the road is never very good mr mollett therefore was five hours in the covered car on his return journey and as he had stopped for lunch at kanturk and had not hurried himself at that meal it was very dark and very cold when he reached the house in south main street  i think i have explained that mr mollett senior was not absolutely a drunkard but nevertheless he was not averse to spirits in cold weather and on this journey had warmed himself with whisky once or twice on the road he had found a shebeen house when he crossed the nad river and another on the mountaintop and a third at the point where the road passes near the village of blarney and at all these convenient restingspots mr mollett had endeavoured to warm himself  there are men who do not become absolutely drunk but who do become absolutely cross when they drink more than is good for them and of such men mr mollett was one what with the cold air and what with the whisky and what with the jolting mr mollett was very cross when he reached the kanturk hotel so that he only cursed the driver instead of giving him the expected gratuity  ill come to yer honour in the morning said the driver  you may go to the devil in the morning answered mr mollett and this was the first intimation of his return which reached the ears of his expectant son  theres the governor said aby who was then flirting with miss odwyer in the bar somebodys been stroking him the wrong way of the air  the charms of miss odwyer in these idle days had been too much for the prudence of mr abraham mollett by far too much considering that in his sterner moments his ambition led him to contemplate a match with a young lady of much higher rank in life but wine which inspires us and fires us      with courage love and joy   had inspired him with courage to forget his prudence and with love for the lovely fanny  now nonsense mr aby she had said to him a few minutes before the wheels of the covered car were heard in south main street you know you main nothing of the sort  by eavens fanny i mean every word of it may this drop be my poison if i dont this piece of business here keeps me and the governor hon and hoff like and will do for some weeks perhaps but when thats done honly say the word and ill make you mrs m isnt that fair now  but mr aby  never mind the mister fan between friends  la i couldnt call you aby without it could i  try my darling  wellabythere now it does sound so uppish dont it but tell me this now what is the business that you and the old gentleman is about down at kanturk  abraham mollett hereupon had put one finger to his nose and then winked his eye  if you care about me as you say you do you wouldnt be shy of just telling me as much as that  thats business fan and business and love dont hamalgamate like whisky and sugar  then ill tell you what it is mr aby i dont want to have anything to do with a man who wont show his rispect by telling me his sacrets  thats it is it fan  i suppose you think i cant keep a sacret you think id be telling father i suppose  well its about some money thats due to him down there  who from  he expects to get it from some of those fitzgerald people  in saying so much mr mollett the younger had not utterly abandoned all prudence he knew very well that the cardriver and others would be aware that his father had been to castle richmond and that it was more than probable that either he or his father would have to make further visits there indeed he had almost determined that he would go down to the baronet himself under these circumstances it might be well that some pretext for these visits should be given  which fitzgerald mr aby is it the hap house young man  hap house i never heard of such a place these people live at castle richmond  ohhh if mr mollett have money due there sure he have a good mark to go upon why sir thomas is about the richest man in these parts  and who is this other man at appywhat is it you call his place  hap house oh its he is the thoroughgoing young gentleman only they say hes a leetle too fast to my mind mr owen is the finestlooking man to be seen anywheres in the county cork  hes a flame of yours is he fan  i dont know what you main by a flame but theres not a girl in cork but what likes the glance of his eye they do say that hed have lady clara desmond only there aint no money  and whats he to these other people  cousin i believe or hardly so much as that im thinking but all the same if anything was to happen to young mr herbert it would all go to him  it would would it  so people say  mr erbert is the son of the old cock at castle richmond isnt he  just so hes the young cock he he he  and if he was to benowhere like not his fathers son at all for instance it would all go to this andsome appy ouse man would it  every shilling they say house title and all  hum said mr abraham mollett and he began again to calculate his family chances perhaps after all this handsome young man who was at present too poor to marry his noble lady love might be the more liberal man to deal with but then any dealings with him would kill the golden goose at once all would depend on the size of the one egg which might be extracted  he certainly felt however that this fitzgerald family arrangement was one which it was beneficial that he should know but he felt also that it would be by no means necessary at present to communicate the information to his father he put it by in his mind regarding it as a fund on which he might draw if occasion should require it might perhaps be pleasant for him to make the acquaintance of this andsome young fitzgerald of appy ouse  and now fan my darling give us a kiss said he getting up from his seat  deed and i wont said fan withdrawing herself among the bottles and glasses  deed and you shall my love said aby pertinaciously as he prepared to follow her through the brittle ware  hushbe aisy now theres tom hes ears for everything and eyes like a cat  what do i care for tom  and father ll be coming in be aisy i tell you i wont now mr aby and thats enough youll break the bottle  d the bottle thats smashed hany way come fan whats a kiss among friends  cock you up with kisses indeed how bad you are for dainties there do you hear that thats the old gentleman and then as the voice of mr mollett senior was heard abusing the cardriver miss odwyer smoothed her apron put her hands to her side hair and removed the debris of the broken bottle  well governor said aby how goes it  how goes it indeed it goes pretty well i dare say in here where you can sit drinking toddy all the evening and doing nothing  why what on hearth would you have me be doing better here than paddling about in the streets isnt it  if you could do a stroke of work now and then to earn your bread it might be better now aby knew from experience that whenever his father talked to him about earning his bread he was half drunk and whole cross so he made no immediate reply on that point  you are cold i suppose governor and had better get a bit of something to eat and a little tea  and put my feet in hot water and tallow my nose and go to bed hadnt i miss odwyer ill trouble you to mix me a glass of brandypunch of all the roads i ever travelled thats the longest and hardest to get over dashed if i didnt begin to think id never be here and so saying he flung himself into a chair and put up his feet on the two hobs  there was a kettle on one of them which the young lady pushed a little nearer to the hot coals in order to show that the water should be boiling and as she did so aby gave her a wink over his fathers shoulder by way of conveying to her an intimation that the governor was a little cut or in other language tipsy and that the brandypunch should be brewed with a discreet view to past events of the same description all which miss odwyer perfectly understood  it may easily be conceived that aby was especially anxious to receive tidings of what had been done this day down in the kanturk neighbourhood he had given his views to his father as will be remembered and though mr mollett senior had not professed himself as absolutely agreeing with them he had nevertheless owned that he was imbued with the necessity of taking some great step he had gone down to take this great step and aby was very anxious to know how it had been taken  when the father and son were both sober or when the son was tipsy or when the father was absolutely drunkan accident which would occur occasionally the spirit and pluck of the son was in the ascendant he at such times was the more masterful of the two and generally contrived either by persuasion or bullying to govern his governor but when it did happen that mollett p√®re was half drunk and cross with drink then at such moments mollett fils had to acknowledge to himself that his governor was not to be governed  and indeed at such moments his governor could be very disagreeablecould say nasty bitter things showing very little parental affection and make himself altogether bad society not only to his son but to his sons companions also now it appeared to aby that his father was at present in this condition  he had only to egg him on to further drinking and the respectable gentleman would become stupid noisy soft and affectionate but then when in that state he would blab terribly it was much with the view of keeping him from that state that under the present circumstances the son remained with the father to do the father justice it may be asserted that he knew his own weakness and that knowing it he had abstained from heavy drinking since he had taken in hand this great piece of diplomacy  but you must be hungry governor wont you take a bit of something  shall we get you a steek mr mollett asked miss odwyer hospitably or just a bit of bacon with a couple of eggs or so it wouldnt be a minute you know  your eggs are all addled and bad said mr mollett and as for a beefsteak its my belief there isnt such a thing in all ireland after which civil speech miss odwyer winked at aby as much as to say you see what a state hes in  have a bit of buttered toast and a cup of tea governor suggested the son  im d if i do replied the father youre become uncommon fond of tea of latethat is for other people i dont see you take much of it yourself  a cup of tay is the thing to warm one afther such a journey as youve had thats certain mr mollett said fanny  thems your ideas about warming are they my dear said the elderly gentleman do you come and sit down on my knee here for a few minutes or so and thatd warm me better than all the tay in the world  aby showed by his face that he was immeasurably disgusted by the iniquitous coarseness of this overture miss odwyer however looking at the gentlemans age and his state as regarded liquor passed it over as of no moment whatsoever so that when in the later part of the evening aby expressed to that young lady his deep disgust she merely said oh bother what matters an old man like that  and then when they were at this pass mr odwyer came in he did not interfere much with his daughter in the bar room but he would occasionally take a dandy of punch there and ask how things were going on in doors he was a fat thickset man with a goodhumoured face a flattened nose and a great aptitude for stable occupations he was part owner of the kanturk car as has been before said and was the proprietor of sundry other cars open cars and covered cars plying for hire in the streets of cork  i hope the mare took your honour well down to kanturk and back again said he addressing his elder customer with a chuck of his head intended for a bow  i dont know what you call well said mr mollett she hadnt a leg to stand upon for the last three hours  not a leg to stand upon faix then and its shed have the four good legs if she travelled every inch of the way from donaghadee to tivora to which distance mr odwyer specially referred as being supposed to be the longest known in ireland  she may be able to do that but im blessed if shes fit to go to kanturk and back  shes done the work anyhow said mr odwyer who evidently thought that this last argument was conclusive  and a precious time shes been about it why my goodness it would have been better for me to have walked it as sir thomas said to me  what did you see sir thomas fitzgerald  hereupon aby gave his father a nudge but the father either did not appreciate the nudge or did not choose to obey it  yes i did see him why shouldnt i  only they do say hes hard to get to speak to nowadays hes not over well you know these years back  well or ill hell see me i take it when i go that distance to ask him theres no doubt about that is there aby  cant say im sure not knowing the gentleman said aby  we holds land from sir thomas we do that is me and my brother mick and a better landlord aint nowhere said mr odwyer  oh youre one of the tenants are you the rents are paid pretty well aint they  to the day said mr odwyer proudly  what would you think now mr mollett was continuing but aby interrupted him somewhat violently  hold your confounded stupid tongue will you you old jolterhead and on this occasion he put his hand on his fathers shoulder and shook him  who are you calling jolterhead who do you dare to speak to in that way you impudent young cub you am i to ask your leave when i want to open my mouth  aby had well known that his father in his present mood would not stand the manner in which the interruption was attempted nor did he wish to quarrel before the publican and his daughter but anything was better than allowing his father to continue in the strain in which he was talking  you are talking of things which you dont hunderstand and about people you dont know said aby youve had a drop too much on the road too and you ad better go to bed  old mollett turned round to strike at his son but even in his present state he was somewhat quelled by abys eye aby was keenly alive to the necessity for prudence on his fathers part though he was by no means able to be prudent himself  talking of things which i dont understand am i said the old man thats all you know about it give me another glass of that brandy toddy my dear  but abys look had quelled or at any rate silenced him and though he did advance another stage in tipsiness before they succeeded in getting him off to bed he said no more about sir thomas fitzgerald or his castle richmond secrets  nevertheless he had said enough to cause suspicion one would not have imagined on looking at mr odwyer that he was a very crafty person or one of whose finesse in affairs of the world it would be necessary to stand much in awe he seemed to be thick and stolid and incapable of deep inquiry but nevertheless he was as fond of his neighbours affairs as another and knew as much about the affairs of his neighbours at kanturk as any man in the county cork  he himself was a kanturk man and his wife had been a kanturk woman no less a person indeed than the sister of father bernard mcarthy rest her soulfor it was now at peace let us all hope she had been dead these ten years but he did not the less keep up his connection with the old town or with his brotherinlaw the priest or with the affairs of the persons there adjacent especially we may say those of his landlord sir thomas fitzgerald under whom he still held a small farm in conjunction with his brother mick the publican at kanturk  whats all that about sir thomas said he to his daughter in a low voice as soon as the molletts had left the bar  well i dont just know said fanny she was a good daughter and loved her father whose indoor affairs she kept tight enough for him but she had hardly made up her mind as yet whether or no it would suit her to be mrs abraham mollett should such be her destiny it might be as well for her not to talk about her husbands matters  is it true that the old man did see sir thomas today  you heard what passed father but i suppose it is true  and the young un has been down to kanturk two or three times what can the like of them have to do with sir thomas  to this fanny could only say that she knew nothing about it which in the main was true aby indeed had said that his father had gone down to collect money that was due to him but then fanny did not believe all that aby said  i dont like that young un at all continued mr odwyer hes a nasty sneaking fellow as cares for no one but his own belly im not over fond of the old un neither  they is both free enough with their money father said the prudent daughter  oh they is welcome in the way of business in course but look here fan dont you have nothing to say to that aby do you hear me  who i ha ha ha  its all very well laughing but mind what i says for i wont have it he is a nasty sneaking goodfornothing fellow besides being a heretic whatd your uncle bernard say  oh for the matter of that if i took a liking to a fellow i shouldnt ask uncle bernard what he had to say if he didnt like it i suppose he might do the other thing  well i wont have it do you hear that  laws father what nonsense you do talk whos thinking about the man he comes here for what he wants to ate and dhrink and i suppose the house is free to him as another if not wed betther just shut up the front door after which she tossed herself up and began to wipe her glasses in a rather dignified manner  mr odwyer sat smoking his pipe and chewing the cud of his reflections they aint afther no good im sure of that in saying which however he referred to the doings of the molletts down at kanturk rather than to any amatory proceedings which might have taken place between the young man and his daughter  on the following morning mr mollett senior awoke with a racking headache my belief is that when men pay this penalty for drinking they are partly absolved from other penalties the penalties on drink are various i mean those which affect the body exclusive of those which affect the mind there are great red swollen noses very disagreeable both to the wearer and his acquaintances there are morning headaches awful to be thought of there are sick stomachs by which means the offender escapes through a speedy purgatory there are sallow cheeks sunken eyes and shaking shoulders there are very big bellies and no bellies at all and there is delirium tremens for the most part a man escapes with one of these penalties if he have a racking headache his general health does not usually suffer so much as though he had endured no such immediate vengeance from violated nature young aby when he drank had no headaches but his eye was bloodshot his cheek bloated and his hand shook his father on the other hand could not raise his head after a debauch but when that was gone all ill results of his imprudence seemed to have vanished  at about noon on that day aby was sitting by his fathers bedside up to that time it had been quite impossible to induce him to speak a word he could only groan swallow sodawater with hairs of the dog that bit him in it and lay with his head between his arms but soon after noon aby did induce him to say a word or two the door of the room was closely shut the little table was strewed with sodawater bottles and last drops of small goes of brandy aby himself had a cigar in his mouth and on the floor near the bedfoot was a plate with a cold greasy mutton chop aby having endeavoured in vain to induce his father to fortify exhausted nature by eating the appearance of the room and the air within it would not have been pleasant to fastidious people but then the molletts were not fastidious  you did see sir thomas then  yes i did see him i wish aby youd let me lie just for another hour or so id be all right then the jolting of that confounded car has nearly shaken my head to pieces  but aby was by no means inclined to be so merciful the probability was that he would be able to pump his father more thoroughly in his present weak state than he might do in a later part of the afternoon so he persevered  but governor its so important we should know what were about did you see any one else except himself  i saw them all i believe except her i was told she never showed in the morning but im blessed if i dont think i saw the skirt of her dress through an open door ill tell you what aby i could not stand that  perhaps father after hall itll be better i should manage the business down there  i believe there wont be much more to manage but aby do leave me now theres a good fellow then in another hour or so ill get up and well have it all out  when youre out in the open air and comfortable it wont be fair to be bothering you with business come governor ten minutes will tell the whole of it if youll only mind your eye how did you begin with sir thomas and then aby went to the door opened it very gently and satisfied himself that there was nobody listening on the landingplace  mr mollett sighed wearily but he knew that his only hope was to get this job of talking over what was it you were saying aby  how did you begin with sir thomas  how did i begin with him let me see oh i just told him who i was and then he turned away and looked down under the fire like and i thought he was going to make a faint of it  i didnt suppose he would be very glad to see you governor  when i saw how badly he took it and how wretched he seemed i almost made up my mind to go away and never trouble him any more  you did did you  and just to take what hed choose to give me  oh thems your hideas hare they then i tell you what i shall just take the matter into my own hands hentirely you have no more eart than a chicken  ah thats very well aby but you did not see him  do you think that would make hany difference when a mans a job of work to do e should do it thems my notions do you think a man like that is to go and hact in that way and then not pay for it whose wife is she id like to know  there was a tone of injured justice about aby which almost roused the father to participate in the sons indignation well i did my best though the old gentleman was in such a taking said he  and what was your best come out with it at once  imm ijust told him who i was you know  i guess he understood that quite well  and then i said things werent going exactly well with me  you shouldnt have said that at all what matters that to him what you hask for you hask for because youre able to demand it thats the ground for hus to take and by  ill take it too there shall be no alfmeasures with me  and then i told himjust what we were agreed you know  that wed go snacks in the whole concern  i didnt exactly say that  then what the devil did you say  why i told him that looking at what the property was twelve hundred pounds wasnt much  i should think not either  and that if his son was to be allowed to have it all  a bastard you know keeping it away from the proper heir it may almost be doubted whether in so speaking aby did not almost think that he himself had a legitimate right to inherit the property at castle richmond  he must look to pay up handsome  but did you say what andsome meant  well i didntnot then he fell about upon the table like and i wasnt quite sure he wouldnt make a die of it and then heaven knows what might have happened to me  psha you as no pluck governor  ill tell you what it is aby i aint so sure youd have such an uncommon deal of pluck yourself  well ill try at any rate  it isnt such a pleasant thing to see an old gentleman in that state and what would happen if he chose to ring the bell and order the police to take me have you ever thought of that  gammon  but it isnt gammon a word from him would put me into quod and there i should be for the rest of my days but what would you care for that and poor mr mollett senior shook under the bedclothes as his attention became turned to this very dreary aspect of his affairs pluck indeed ill tell you what it is aby i often wonder at my own pluck  psha wouldnt a word from you split upon him and upon her and upon the young un and ruin em or a word from me either for the matter of that  mr mollett senior shook again he repented now as he had already done twenty times that he had taken that son of his into his confidence  and what on hearth did you say to him continued aby  well not much more then at least not very much more there was a good deal of words but they didnt seem to lead to much except this just to make him understand that he must come down handsome  and there was nothing done about hemmiline  no said the father rather shortly  if that was settled that would be the clincher there would be no further trouble to nobody then it would be all smooth sailing for your life governor and lots of tin  i tell you what it is aby you may just drop that for i wont have the young lady bothered about it nor yet the young ladys father  you wont wont you  no i wont so theres an end of it  i suppose i may pay my distresses to any young lady if i think fitting  and have yourself kicked into the ditch  i know too much for kicking governor  they shall know as much as you do and more too if you go on with that theres a measure in all things i wont have it done so i tell you and the father turned his face round to the wall  this was by no means the end of the conversation though we need not verbatim go through any more of it it appeared that old mollett had told sir thomas that his permanent silence could be purchased by nothing short of a settled genteel income for himself and his son no absolute sum having been mentioned and that sir thomas had required a fortnight for his answer which answer was to be conveyed to mr mollett verbally at the end of that time it was agreed that mr mollett should repeat his visit to castle richmond on that day fortnight  in the mean time ill go down and freshen the old gentleman up a bit said aby as he left his fathers bedroom     chapter xiv  the rejected suitor   after the interview between herbert and his mother it became an understood thing at castle richmond that he was engaged to lady clara sir thomas raised no further objection although it was clear to all the immediate family that he was by no means gratified at his sons engagement very little more passed between sir thomas and lady fitzgerald on the subject he merely said that he would consider the question of his sons income and expressed a hope or perhaps an opinion rather than a hope that the marriage would not take place quite immediately  under these circumstances herbert hardly spoke further to his father upon the matter he certainly did feel sore that he should be so treatedthat he should be made to understand that there was a difficulty but that the difficulty could not be explained to him no absolute opposition was however made and he would not therefore complain as to money he would say nothing till something should be said to him  with his mother however the matter was different she had said that she would welcome clara and she did so immediately after speaking to sir thomas she drove over to desmond court and said soft sweet things to clara in her most winning waysaid soft things also to the countess who received them very graciously took clara home to castle richmond for that night somewhat to the surprise and much to the gratification of herbert who found her sitting slily with the other girls when he came in before dinner and arranged for her to make a longer visit after the interval of a week or two herbert therefore was on thoroughly good terms with his mother and did enjoy some of the delights which he had promised himself  with his sisters also and especially with emmeline he was once more in a good humour to her he made ample apology for his former crossness and received ample absolution i was so harassed he said by my fathers manner that i hardly knew what i was doing and even now when i think of his evident dislike to the marriage it nearly drives me wild the truth of all which emmeline sadly acknowledged how could any of them talk of their father except in a strain of sadness  all these things did not happen in the drawingroom at castle richmond without also being discussed in the kitchen it was soon known over the house that master herbert was to marry lady clara and indeed there was no great pretence of keeping it secret the girls told the duchess as they called mrs jonesof course in confidencebut mrs jones knew what such confidence meant especially as the matter was more than once distinctly alluded to by her ladyship and thus the story was told in confidence to everybody in the establishment and then repeated by them in confidence also to nearly everybody out of it  ill news they say flies fast and this news which going in that direction became ill soon flew to hap house  so young fitzgerald and the divine clara are to hit it off are they said captain donnellan who had driven over from buttevant barracks to breakfast at hap house on a huntingmorning  there were other men present more intimate friends of owen than this captain who had known of owens misfortune in that quarter and a sign was made to donnellan to bid him drop the subject but it was too late  who my cousin herbert said owen sharply have you heard of this barry  well said barry those sort of things are always being said you know i did hear something of it somewhere but i cant say i thought much about it and then the subject was dropped during that mornings breakfast they all went to the hunt and in the course of the day owen contrived to learn that the report was well founded  that evening as the countess and her daughter were sitting together over the fire the grayheaded old butler brought in a letter upon an old silver salver saying for lady clara if you please my lady  the countess not unnaturally thought that the despatch had come from castle richmond and smiled graciously as clara put out her hand for the missive lady desmond again let her eyes drop upon the book which she was reading as though to show that she was by far too confiding a mamma to interfere in any correspondence between her daughter and her daughters lover at the moment lady clara had been doing nothing her work was indeed on her lap and her workbox was at her elbow but her thoughts had been far away far away as regards idea though not so as to absolute locality for in her mind she was walking beneath those elmtrees and a man was near her with a horse following at his heels  the messenger is to wait for an answer my lady said the old butler with a second nod which on this occasion was addressed to clara and then the man withdrew  lady clara blushed ruby red up to the roots of her hair when her eyes fell on the address of the letter for she knew it to be in the handwriting of owen fitzgerald perhaps the countess from the corner of her eye may have observed some portion of her daughters blushes but if so she said nothing attributing them to claras natural bashfulness in her present position she will get over it soon the countess may probably have said to herself  clara was indecisive disturbed in her mind and wretched owen had sent her other letters but they had been brought to her surreptitiously had been tendered to her in secret and had always been returned by her unopened she had not told her mother of these at least not purposely or at the moment but she had been at no trouble to conceal the facts and when the countess had once asked she freely told her what had happened with an absence of any confusion which had quite put lady desmond at her ease but this letter was brought to her in the most open manner and an answer to it openly demanded  she turned it round slowly in her hand and then looking up said mamma this is from owen fitzgerald what had i better do with it  from owen fitzgerald are you sure  yes mamma and then the countess had also to consider what steps under such circumstances had better be taken in the mean time clara held out her hand tendering the letter to her mother  you had better open it my dear and read it no doubt it must be answered lady desmond felt that now there could be no danger from owen fitzgerald indeed she thought that there was not a remembrance of him left in her daughters bosom that the old love such babylove as there had been had vanished quite swept out of that little heart by this new love of a brighter sort but then lady desmond knew nothing of her daughter  so instructed clara broke the seal and read the letter which ran thus      hap house february 184     my promised love     for let what will happen such you are i have this    morning heard tidings which if true will go far to drive    me to despair but i will not believe them from any lips    save your own i have heard that you are engaged to marry    herbert fitzgerald at once however i declare that i do    not believe the statement i have known you too well to    think that you can be false     but at any rate i beg the favour of an interview    with you after what has passed i think that under any    circumstances i have a right to demand it i have pledged    myself to you and as that pledge has been accepted i am    entitled to some consideration     i write this letter to you openly being quite willing    that you should show it to your mother if you think fit    my messenger will wait and i do implore you to send me an    answer and remember lady clara that having accepted    my love you cannot whistle me down the wind as though i    were of no account after what has passed between us you    cannot surely refuse to see me once more     ever your ownif you will have it so     owen fitzgerald   she read the letter very slowly ever and anon looking up at her mothers face and seeing that her mother wasnot reading her book but pretending to read it when she had finished it she held it for a moment and then said mamma will you not look at it  certainly my dear if you wish me to do so and she took the letter from her daughters hand and read it  just what one would expect from him my dear eager impetuous and thoughtless one should not blame him much for he does not mean to do harm but if he had any sense he would know that he was taking trouble for nothing  and what shall i do mamma  well i really think that i should answer him it was delightful to see the perfect confidence which the mother had in her daughter and i think i should see him if he will insist upon it it is foolish in him to persist in remembering two words which you spoke to him as a child but perhaps it will be well that you should tell him yourself that you were a child when you spoke those two words  and then clara sent off the following reply written under her mothers dictation though the countess strove very hard to convince her daughter that she was wording it out of her own head      lady clara desmond presents her compliments to mr owen    fitzgerald and will see mr owen fitzgerald at desmond    court at two oclock tomorrow if mr owen fitzgerald    persists in demanding such an interview lady clara    desmond however wishes to express her opinion that it    would be better avoided     desmond court    thursday evening   the countess thought that this note was very cold and formal and would be altogether conclusive but nevertheless at about eleven oclock that night there came another messenger from hap house with another letter saying that owen would be at desmond court at two oclock on the following day  he is very foolish that is all i can say said the countess  all that night and all the next morning poor clara was very wretched that she had been right to give up a suitor who lived such a life as owen fitzgerald lived she could not doubt but nevertheless was she true in giving him up had she made any stipulation as to his life when she accepted his love if he called her false as doubtless he would call her how would she defend herself had she any defence to offer it was not only that she had rejected him a poor lover but she had accepted a rich lover what could she say to him when he upbraided her for such sordid conduct  and then as to her whistling him down the wind did she wish to do that in what state did her heart stand towards him might it not be that let her be ever so much on her guard she would show him some tendernesstenderness which would be treason to her present affianced suitor oh why had her mother desired her to go through such an interview as this  when two oclock came clara was in the drawingroom she had said nothing to her mother as to the manner in which this meeting should take place but then at first she had had an idea that lady desmond would be present but as the time came near clara was still alone when her watch told her that it was already two she was still by herself and when the old servant opening the door announced that mr fitzgerald was there she was still unsupported by the presence of any companion it was very surprising that on such an occasion her mother should have kept herself away  she had not seen owen fitzgerald since that day when they had walked together under the elmtrees and it can hardly be said that she saw him now she had a feeling that she had injured himhad deceived and in a manner betrayed him and that feeling became so powerful with her that she hardly dared to look him in the face  he when he entered the room walked straight up to her and offered her his hand he too looked round the room to see whether lady desmond was there and not finding her was surprised he had hardly hoped that such an opportunity would be allowed to him for declaring the strength of his passion  she got up and taking his hand muttered something it certainly did not matter what for it was inaudible but such as the words were they were the first spoken between them  lady clara he began and then stopped himself and considering recommencedclara a report has reached my ears which i will believe from no lips but your own  she now sat down on a sofa and pointed to a chair for him but he remained standing and did so during the whole interview or rather walking for when he became energetic and impetuous he moved about from place to place in the room as though incapable of fixing himself in one position  clara was ignorant whether or no it behoved her to rebuke him for calling her simply by her christian name she thought that she ought to do so but she did not do it  i have been told he continued that you have engaged yourself to marry herbert fitzgerald and i have now come to hear a contradiction of this from yourself  but mr fitzgerald it is true  it is true that herbert fitzgerald is your accepted lover  yes she said looking down upon the ground and blushing deeply as she said it  there was a pause of a few moments during which she felt that the full fire of his glance was fixed upon her and then he spoke  you may well be ashamed to confess it he said you may well feel that you dare not look me in the face as you pronounce the words i would have believed it clara from no other mouth than your own  it appeared to clara herself now as though she were greatly a culprit she had not a word to say in her own defence all those arguments as to owens ill course of life were forgotten and she could only remember that she had acknowledged that she loved him and that she was now acknowledging that she loved another  but now owen had made his accusation and as it was not answered he hardly knew how to proceed he walked about the room endeavouring to think what he had better say next  i know this clara it is your mothers doing and not your own you could not bring yourself to be false unless by her instigation  no said she you are wrong there it is not my mothers doing what i have done i have done myself  is it not true he asked that your word was pledged to me had you not promised me that you would be my wife  i was very young she said falling back upon the only excuse which occurred to her at the moment as being possible to be used without incriminating him  young is not that your mothers teaching why those were her very words when she came to me at my house i did not know that youth was any excuse for falsehood  but it may be an excuse for folly said clara  folly what folly the folly of loving a poor suitor the folly of being willing to marry a man who has not a large estate clara i did not think that you could have learned so much in so short a time  all this was very hard upon her she felt that it was hard for she knew that he had done that which entitled her to regard her pledge to him as at an end but the circumstances were such that she could not excuse herself  am i to understand said owen fitzgerald that all that has passed between us is to go for nothing that such promises as we have made to each other are to be of no account to me they are sacred pledges from which i would not escape even if i could  as he then paused for a reply she was obliged to say something  i hope you have not come here to upbraid me mr fitzgerald  clara he continued i have passed the last year with perfect reliance upon your faith i need hardly tell you that it has not been passed happily for it has been passed without seeing you but though you have been absent from me i have never doubted you i have known that it was necessary that we should waitwait perhaps till years should make you mistress of your own actions but nevertheless i was not unhappy for i was sure of your love  now it was undoubtedly the case that fitzgerald was treating her unfairly and though she had not her wits enough about her to ascertain this by process of argument nevertheless the idea did come home to her it was true that she had promised her love to this man as far as such promise could be conveyed by one word of assent but it was true also that she had been almost a child when she pronounced that word and that things which had since occurred had entitled her to annul any amount of contract to which she might have been supposed to bind herself by that one word she bethought herself therefore that as she was so hard pressed she was forced to defend herself  i was very young then mr fitzgerald and hardly knew what i was saying afterwards when mamma spoke to me i felt that i was bound to obey her  what to obey her by forgetting me  no i have never forgotten you and never shall i remember too well your kindness to my brother your kindness to us all  psha you know i do not speak of that are you bound to obey your mother by forgetting that you have loved me  she paused a moment before she answered him looking now full before herhardly yet bold enough to look him in the face  no she said i have not forgotten that i loved you i shall never forget it child as i was it shall never be forgotten but i cannot love you nownot in the manner you would have me  and why not lady clara why is love to cease on your partto be thrown aside so easily by you while with me it remains so stern a fact and so deep a necessity is that just when the bargain has once been made should it not be equally binding on us both  i do not think you are fair to me mr fitzgerald she said and some spirit was now rising in her bosom  not fair to you do you say that i am unfair to you speak but one word to say that the troth which you pledged me a year since shall still remain unbroken and i will at once leave you till you yourself shall name the time when my suit may be renewed  you know that i cannot do that  and why not i know that you ought to do it  no mr fitzgerald i ought not i am now engaged to your cousin with the consent of mamma and of his friends i can say nothing to you now which i cannot repeat to him nor can i say anything which shall oppose his wishes  he is then so much more to you now than i am  he is everything to me now  that is all the reply i am to get then you acknowledge your falseness and throw me off without vouchsafing me any answer beyond this  what would you have me say i did do that which was wrong and foolish whenwhen we were walking there on the avenue i did give a promise which i cannot now keep it was all so hurried that i hardly remember what i said but of this i am sure that if i have caused you unhappiness i am very sorry to have done so i cannot alter it all now i cannot unsay what i said then nor can i offer you that which i have now absolutely given to another  and then as she finished speaking she did pluck up courage to look him in the face she was now standing as well as he but she was so standing that the table which was placed near the sofa was still between him and her as she finished speaking the door opened and the countess of desmond walked slowly into the room  owen fitzgerald when he saw her bowed low before her and then frankly offered her his hand there was something in his manner to ladies devoid of all bashfulness and yet never too bold he seemed to be aware that in speaking to any lady be she who she might he was only exercising his undoubted privilege as a man he never hummed and hawed and shook in his shoes as though the majesty of womanhood were too great for his encounter there are such men and many of them who carry this dread to the last day of their long lives i have often wondered what women think of men who regard women as too awful for the free exercise of open speech  mr fitzgerald she said accepting the hand which he offered to her but resuming her own very quickly and then standing before him in all the dignity which she was able to assume i quite concurred with my daughter that it was right that she should see you as you insisted on such an interview but you must excuse me if i interrupt it i must protect her from the embarrassment which youryour vehemence may occasion her  lady desmond he replied you are quite at liberty as far as i am concerned to hear all that passes between us your daughter is betrothed to me and i have come to claim from her the fulfilment of her promise  for shame mr fitzgerald for shame when she was a child you extracted from her one word of folly and now you would take advantage of that foolish word now when you know that she is engaged to a man she loves with the full consent of all her friends i thought i knew you well enough to feel sure that you were not so ungenerous  ungenerous no i have not that generosity which would enable me to give up my very hearts blood the only joy of my soul to such a one as my cousin herbert  you have nothing to give up mr fitzgerald you must have known from the very first that my daughter could not marry you  not marry me and why not lady desmond is not my blood as good as hisunless indeed you are prepared to sell your child to the highest bidder  clara my dear i think you had better leave the room said the countess no doubt you have assured mr fitzgerald that you are engaged to his cousin herbert  yes mamma  then he can have no further claim on your attendance and his vehemence will terrify you  vehement how can i help being vehement when like a ruined gambler i am throwing my last chance for such a stake  and then he intercepted clara as she stepped towards the drawingroom door she stopped in her course and stood still looking down upon the ground  mr fitzgerald said the countess i will thank you to let lady clara leave the room she has given you the answer for which you have asked and it would not be right in me to permit her to be subjected to further embarrassment  i will only ask her to listen to one word clara  mr fitzgerald you have no right to address my daughter with that freedom said the countess but owen hardly seemed to hear her  i here in your hearing protest against your marriage with herbert fitzgerald i claim your love as my own i bid you think of the promise which you gave me and i tell you that as i loved you then with all my heart so do i love you at this moment so shall i love you always now i will not hinder you any longer  and then he opened the door for her and she passed on bowing to him and muttering some word of farewell that was inaudible  he stood for a moment with the door in his hand meditating whether he might not say good morning to the countess without returning into the room but as he so stood she called him mr fitzgerald she said and so he therefore came back and once more closed the door  and then he saw that the countenance of lady desmond was much changed hitherto she had been every inch the countess stern and cold and haughty but now she looked at him as she used to look in those old winter evenings when they were accustomed to talk together over the evening fire in close friendliness while she lady desmond would speak to him in the intimacy of her heart of her children patrick and clara  mr fitzgerald she said and the tone of her voice also was changed you are hardly fair to us are you  not fair lady desmond  no not fair sit down now and listen to me for a moment if you had a child a penniless girl like clara would you be glad to see her married to such a one as you are yourself  in what way do you mean speak out lady desmond  no i will not speak out for i would not hurt you i myself am too fond of youas an old friend to wish to do so that you may marry and live happily live near us here so that we may know you i most heartily desire but you cannot marry that child  and why not if she loves me  nay not even if she did wealth and position are necessary to the station in which she has been born she is an earls daughter penniless as she is i will have no secrets from you as a mother i could not give her to one whose career is such as yours as the widow of an earl i could not give her to one whose means of maintaining her are so small if you will think of this you will hardly be angry with me  love is nothing then  is all to be sacrificed to your love think of it mr fitzgerald and let me have the happiness of knowing that you consent to this match  never said he never and so he left the room without wishing her further farewell     chapter xv  diplomacy   about a week after the last conversation that has been related as having taken place at the kanturk hotel mr mollett junior was on his way to castle richmond he had on that occasion stated his intention of making such a journey with the view of freshening the old gentleman up a bit and although his father did all in his power to prevent the journey going so far on one occasion as to swear that if it was made he would throw over the game altogether nevertheless aby persevered  you may leave the boards whenever you like governor said aby i know quite enough of the part to carry on the play  you think you do said the father in his anger but youll find yourself in the dark yet before youve done  and then again he expostulated in a different tone youll ruin it all aby you will indeed you dont know all the circumstances indeed you dont  dont i said aby then ill not be long learning them  the father did what he could but he had no means of keeping his son at home and so aby went aby doubtless entertained an idea that his father was deficient in pluck for the management of so difficult a matter and that he could supply what his father wanted so he dressed himself in his best and having hired a gig and a man who he flattered himself would look like a private servant he started from cork and drove himself to castle richmond  he had on different occasions been down in the neighbourhood prowling about like a thief in the night picking up information as he called it and seeing how the land lay but he had never yet presented himself to any one within the precincts of the castle richmond demesne his present intention was to drive up to the front door and ask at once for sir thomas fitzgerald sending in his card if need be on which were printed the words      mr abraham mollett junior   with the additional words piccadilly london written in the lefthand lower corner  ill take the bull by the horns said he to himself its better to make the spoon at once even if we do run some small chance of spoiling the horn and that he might be well enabled to carry out his purpose with reference to this bull he lifted his flask to his mouth as soon as he had passed through the great demesne gate and took a long pull at it theres nothing like a little jumping powder he said speaking to himself again and then he drove boldly up the avenue  he had not yet come in sight of the house when he met two gentlemen walking on the road they as he approached stood a little on one side not only so as to allow him to pass but to watch him as he did so they were mr somers and herbert fitzgerald  it is the younger of those two men im nearly certain of it said somers as the gig approached i saw him as he walked by me in kanturk street and i dont think i can mistake the horrid impudence of his face i beg your pardon sirand now he addressed mollett in the gigbut are you going up to the house  yes sir thats my notion just at present any commands that way  this is mr fitzgeraldmr herbert fitzgerald and i am mr somers the agent can we do anything for you  aby mollett raised his hat and the two gentlemen touched theirs thankee sir said aby but i believe my business must be with the worthy baronett himself more particularly as i appen to know that hes at home  my father is not very well said herbert and i do not think that he will be able to see you  ill take the liberty of hasking and of sending in my card said aby and he gave his horse a flick as intending thus to cut short the conversation but mr somers had put his hand upon the bridle and the beast was contented to stand still  if youll have the kindness to wait a moment said mr somers and he put on a look of severity which he well knew how to assume and which somewhat cowed poor aby you have been down here before i think continued mr somers  what at castle richmond no i havent and if i had whats that to you if sir thomas chooses to see me i haint hintruding i suppose  youve been down at kanturk beforeonce or twice for i have seen you  and supposing ive been there ten or twelve timeswhat is there in that said aby  mr somers still held the horses head and stood a moment considering  ill thank you to let go my oss said aby raising his whip and shaking the reins  what do you say your name is asked mr somers  i didnt say my name was anything yet i haint ashamed of it however nor hasnt hany cause to be thats my name and if youll send my card in to sir thomas with my compliments and say that hive three words to say to him very particular why hill be obliged to you and then mr mollett handed mr somers his card  mollett said mr somers very unceremoniously mollett mollett do you know the name herbert  herbert said that he did not  its about business i suppose asked mr somers  yes said aby private business very particular  the same that brought your father here and mr somers again looked into his face with a close scrutiny  aby was abashed and for a moment or two he did not answer well then it is the same business he said at last and ill thank you to let me go on im not used to be stopped in this way  you can follow us up to the house said mr somers to him come here herbert and then they walked along the road in such a way that aby was forced to allow his horse to walk after them  these are the men who are doing it said mr somers in a whisper to his companion whatever is in the wind whatever may be the cause of your fathers trouble they are concerned in it they are probably getting money from him in some way  do you think so  i do we must not force ourselves upon your fathers confidence but we must endeavour to save him from this misery do you go in to him with this card do not show it to him too suddenly and then find out whether he really wishes to see the man i will stay about the place for it may be possible that a magistrate will be wanted and in such a matter you had better not act  they were now at the halldoor and somers turning to mollett told him that mr herbert fitzgerald would carry the card to his father and then he added seeing that mollett was going to come down you had better stay in the gig till mr fitzgerald comes back just sit where you are youll get an answer all in good time  sir thomas was crouching over the fire in his study when his son entered with his eyes fixed upon a letter which he held in his hand and which when he saw herbert he closed up and put away  father said herbert in a cheerful everyday voice as though he had nothing special to communicate there is a man in a gig out there he says he wants to see you  a man in a gig and herbert could see that his father had already begun to tremble but every sound made him tremble now  yes a man in a gig what is it he says his name is i have his card here a young man  oh a young man said sir thomas  yes here it is abraham mollett i cant say that your friend seems to be very respectable in spite of his gig and herbert handed the card to his father  the son purposely looked away as he mentioned the name as his great anxiety was not to occasion distress but he felt that the sound of the word had been terrible in his fathers ears sir thomas had risen from his chair but he now sat down again or rather fell into it but nevertheless he took the card and said that he would see the man  a young man do you say herbert  yes father a young man and father if you are not well tell me what the business is and let me see him  but sir thomas persisted shaking his head and saying that he would see the man himself  somers is out there will you let him do it  no i wonder herbert that you can tease me so let the man be sent in here but oh herbertherbert  the young man rushed round and kneeled at his fathers knee what is it father why will you not tell me i know you have some grief and cannot you trust me do you not know that you can trust me  my poor boy my poor boy  what is it father if this man here is concerned in it let me see him  no no no  or at any rate let me be with you when he is here let me share your trouble if i can do nothing to cure it  herbert my darling leave me and send him in if it be necessary that you should bear this calamity it will come upon you soon enough  but i am afraid of this manfor your sake father  he will do me no harm let him come to me but herbert say nothing to somers about this somers has not seen the man has he  yes we both spoke to him together as he drove up the avenue  and what did he say did he say anything  nothing but that he wanted to see you and then he gave his card to mr somers mr somers wished to save you from the annoyance  why should it annoy me to see any man let mr somers mind his own business surely i can have business of my own without his interference with this herbert left his father and returned to the halldoor to usher in mr mollett junior  well said mr somers who was standing by the hall fire and who joined herbert at the front door  my father will see the man  and have you learned who he is  i have learned nothing but thisthat sir thomas does not wish that we should inquire now mr mollett sir thomas will see you so you can come down make haste now and remember that you are not to stay long for my father is ill and then leading aby through the hall and along a passage he introduced him into sir thomass room  and herbert said the father whereupon herbert again turned round his father was endeavouring to stand but supporting himself by the back of his chair do not disturb me for half an hour but come to me then and knock at the door this gentleman will have done by that time  if we do not put a stop to this your father will be in a madhouse or on his deathbed before long so spoke mr somers in a low solemn whisper when herbert again joined him at the halldoor  sit down sir sit down said sir thomas endeavouring to be civil and to seem at his ease at the same time aby was himself so much bewildered for the moment that he hardly perceived the embarrassment under which the baronet was labouring  aby sat down in the way usual to such men in such places on the corner of his chair and put his hat on the ground between his feet then he took out his handkerchief and blew his nose and after that he expressed an opinion that he was in the presence of sir thomas fitzgerald  and you are mr abraham mollett said sir thomas  yes sir thomas thats my name i believe sir thomas that you have the pleasure of some slight acquaintance with my father mr matthew mollett  what a pleasure under such circumstances sir thomas however nodded his head and aby went on  well now sir thomas business is business and my father e aint a good man of business a genleman like you sir thomas has seen that with alf an eye i know and then he waited a moment for an answer but as he got none he proceeded  my governors one of the best of fellows going but e aint sharp and decisive sharps the word now a days sir thomas aint it and he spoke this in a manner so suited to the doctrine which he intended to inculcate that the poor old gentleman almost jumped up in his chair  and aby seeing this seated himself more comfortably in his own the awe which the gilt bindings of the books and the thorough comfort of the room had at first inspired was already beginning to fade away he had come there to bully and though his courage had failed him for a moment under the stern eye of mr somers it quickly returned to him now that he was able to see how weak was his actual victim  sharps the word sir thomas and my governor e aint sharpnot sharp as he ought to be in such a matter as this this is what i calls a real bit of cheese now its no good going on piddling and peddling in such a case as this is it now sir thomas  sir thomas muttered something but it was no more than a groan  not the least use continued aby now the question as i takes it is this theres your son there as fetched me in ere a fine young genleman e is as ever i saw i will say that well now whos to have this ere property when you walk the plankas walk it you must some day in course is it to be this son of yours or is it to be this other fitzgerald of appy ouse now if you ask me im all for your son though maybe he maynt be all right as regards the dam  there was certainly some truth in what aby had said with reference to his father mr mollett senior had never debated the matter in terms sharp and decisive as these were think who they were of whom this brute was talking to that wretched gentleman the wife of his bosom than whom no wife was ever more dearly prized the son of his love the centre of all his hopes the heir of his wealthif that might still be so and yet he listened to such words as these and did not call in his servants to turn the speaker of them out of his doors  ive no wish for that appy ouse man sir thomas not the least and as for your good lady shes nothing to me one way or the otherwhatever she may be to my governor and here there fell a spasm upon the poor mans heart which nearly brought him from the chair to the ground but nevertheless he still contained himselfmy governors former lady my own mother continued aby whom i never seed shed gone to kingdom come you know before that time sir thomas there haint no doubt about that so you see and hereupon he dropped his voice from the tone which he had hitherto been using to an absolute whisper and drawing his chair close to that of the baronet and putting his hands upon his knees brought his mouth close to his companions earso you see he said when that youngster was born lady f was mrs mwasnt she and for the matter of that lady f is mrs m to this very hour thats the real chat aint it sir thomas my stepmother you know the governor could take her away with him tomorrow if he chose according to the law of the landcouldnt he now  there was no piddling or peddling about this at any rate old mollett in discussing the matter with his victim had done so by hints and inuendos through long windings by signs and the dropping of a few dark words he had never once mentioned in full terms the name of lady fitzgerald had never absolutely stated that he did possess or ever had possessed a wife it had been sufficient for him to imbue sir thomas with the knowledge that his son herbert was in great danger as to his heritage doubtless the two had understood each other but the absolute naked horror of the surmised facts had been kept delicately out of sight but such delicacy was not to abys taste sharp short and decisive that was his motto no long√¶ ambages for him the whip was in his hand as he thought and he could best master the team by using it  and yet sir thomas lived and bore it as he sat there half stupefied numbed as it were by the intensity of his grief he wondered at his own power of endurance she is mrs m you know aint she now he could sit there and hear that and yet live through it so much he could do and did do but as for speaking that was beyond him  young mollett thought that this freshening up of the old gentleman seemed to answer so he continued yes sir thomas your sons my favourite i tell you fairly but then you know if i backs the favourite in course i likes to win upon him how is it to be now and then he paused for an answer which however was not forthcoming  you see you havent been dealing quite on the square with the governor you two is has it were in a boat together well call that boat the lady f or the mrs m which ever you likeand then aby laughed for the conceit pleased himbut the hearnings of that boat should be divided hequally aint that about the ticket heh sir thomas come dont be down on your luck a little quiet talkeetalkee between you and mell soon put this small matter on a right footing  what is it you want tell me at once at last groaned the poor man  well now thats something like and ill tell you what we want there are only two of us you know the governor and i and very lonely we are for its a sad thing for a man to have the wife of his bosom taken from him  then there was a groan which struck even abys ear but sir thomas was still alive and listening and so he went on  this property here sir thomas is a good twelve thousand a year i know hall about it as though id been andling it myself for the last ten years and a great deal of cutting there is in twelve thousand a year youve ad your whack out of it and now we wants to have hourn thats henglish haint it  did your father send you here mr mollett  never you mind who sent me sir thomas perhaps he did and perhaps he didnt perhaps i

forty thousand pounds paid down on the nail half to the governor and half to your umble servant before the end of this year a couple of thousand more in hand for the years hexpensesandanda couple of hundred or so now at once before i leave you for to tell the truth were run huncommonly dry just at the present moment and then aby drew his breath and paused for an answer  poor sir thomas was now almost broken down his head swam round and round and he felt that he was in a whirlpool from which there was no escape he had heard the sum named and knew that he had no power of raising it his interest in the estate was but for his life and that life was now all but run out he had already begun to feel that his son must be sacrificed but he had struggled and endured in order that he might save his wife but what could he do now what further struggle could he make his present most eager desire was that that horrid man should be removed from his hearing and his eyesight  but aby had not yet done he had hitherto omitted to mention one not inconsiderable portion of the amicable arrangement which according to him would have the effect of once more placing the two families comfortably on their feet theres one other pint sir thomas he continued and hif i can bring you and your good lady to my way of thinking on that why we may all be comfortable for all that is come and gone youve a daughter hemmeline  what said sir thomas turning upon him for there was still so much of life left in him that he could turn upon his foe when he heard his daughters name thus polluted  has lovely a gal to my way of thinking as my heyes ever rested on and im not haccounted a bad judge of such cattle i can tell you sir thomas  that will do that will do said sir thomas attempting to rise but still holding on by the back of his chair you can go now sir i cannot hear more from you  go  yes sir go  i know a trick worth two of that sir thomas if you like to give me your daughter hemmeline for my wife whatever her fortins to be ill take it as part of my half of the forty thousand pounds there now and then aby again waited for a reply  but now there came a knock at the door and following quick upon the knock herbert entered the room well father said the son  herbert  yes father and he went round and supported his father on his arm  herbert will you tell that man to go  come sir you have disturbed my father enough will you have the kindness to leave him now  i may chance to disturb him more and you too sir if you treat me in that way let go my arm sir am i to have any answer from you sir thomas  but sir thomas could make no further attempt at speaking he was now once more seated in his chair holding his sons hand and when he again heard molletts voice he merely made a sign for him to go  you see the state my father is in mr mollett said herbert i do not know what is the nature of your business but whatever it may be you must leave him now and he made a slight attempt to push the visitor towards the door  youd better take care what youre doing mr fitzgerald said mollett by  you had if you anger me i might say a word that i couldnt unsay again which would put you into queer street i can tell you  dont quarrel with him my boy pray dont quarrel with him but let him leave me said sir thomas  mr mollett you see my fathers state you must be aware that it is imperative that he should be left alone  i dont know nothing about that young genleman business is business and i haint got hany answer to my proposals sir thomas do you say yes to them proposals but sir thomas was still dumb to all but the last come continued aby that was put in quite as much for your good as it was for mine but not a word came from the baronet  then i shant stir said aby again seating himself  then i shall have the servants in said herbert and a magistrate who is in the hall and he put his hand towards the handle of the bell  well as the old genlemans hill ill go now and come again but look you here sir thomas you have got my proposals and if i dont get an answer to them in three days timewhy youll hear from me in another way thats all and so will her ladyship and with this threat mr abraham mollett allowed himself to be conducted through the passage into the hall and from thence to his gig  see that he drives away see that he goes said herbert to mr somers who was still staying about the place  oh ill drive away fast enough said aby as he stepped into the gig and come back fast enough too he muttered to himself in the mean time herbert had run back to his fathers room  has he gone murmured sir thomas  yes he has gone there you can hear the wheels of his gig on the gravel  oh my boy my poor boy  what is it father why do you not tell me why do you allow such men as that to come and harass you when a word would keep them from you father good cannot come of it  no herbert no good will not come of it there is no good to come at all  then why will you not tell us  you will know it all soon enough but herbert do not say a word to your mother not a word as you value my love let us save her while we can you promise me that  herbert gave him the required promise  look here and he took up the letter which he had before crumpled in his hand mr prendergast will be here next week i shall tell everything to him  soon afterwards sir thomas went to his bed and there by his bedside his wife sat for the rest of the evening but he said no word to her of his sorrow  mr prendergast is coming here said herbert to mr somers  i am glad of it though i do not know him said mr somers for my dear boy it is necessary that there should be some one here     chapter xvi  the path beneath the elms   it will be remembered that in the last chapter but one owen fitzgerald left lady desmond in the drawingroom at desmond court somewhat abruptly having absolutely refused to make peace with the desmond faction by giving his consent to the marriage between clara and his cousin herbert and it will perhaps be remembered also that lady desmond had asked for this consent in a manner that was almost humble she had shown herself most anxious to keep on friendly terms with the rake of hap houserake and rou√© gambler and spendthrift as he was reputed to beif only he would abandon his insane claim to the hand of clara desmond but this feeling she had shown when they two were alone together after clara had left them as long as her daughter had been present lady desmond had maintained her tone of indignation and defiance but when the door was closed and they two were alone she had become kind in her language and almost tender  my readers will probably conceive that she had so acted overcome by her affection for owen fitzgerald and with a fixed resolve to win him for herself men and women when they are written about are always supposed to have fixed resolves though in life they are so seldom found to be thus armed to speak the truth the countess had had no fixed resolve in the matter either when she had thought about owens coming or when subsequently she had found herself alone with him in her drawingroom that clara should not marry himon so much she had resolved long ago but all danger on that head was it may be said over clara like a good child had behaved in the best possible manner had abandoned her first lover a lover that was poor and unfitted for her as soon as told to do so and had found for herself a second lover who was rich and proper and in every way desirable as regards clara the countess felt herself to be safe and to give her her due she had been satisfied that the matter should so rest she had not sought any further interview with fitzgerald he had come there against her advice and she had gone to meet him prompted by the necessity of supporting her daughter and without any other views of her own  but when she found herself alone with him when she looked into his face and saw how handsome how noble how good it wasgood in its inherent manliness and braveryshe could not but long that this feud should be over and that she might be able once more to welcome him as her friend if only he would give up this frantic passion this futile wicked senseless attempt to make them all wretched by an insane marriage would it not be sweet again to make some effort to rescue him from the evil ways into which he had fallen  but owen himself would make no response to this feeling clara desmond was his love and he would of his own consent yield her to no one in truth he was in a certain degree mad on this subject he did think that because the young girl had given him a promisehad said to him a word or two which he called a promiseshe was now of right his bride that there belonged to him an indefeasible property in her heart in her loveliness in the inexpressible tenderness of her young springing beauty of which no subsequent renouncing on her part could fairly and honestly deprive him that others should oppose the match was intelligible to him but it was hardly intelligible that she should betray him and as yet he did not believe that she herself was the mainspring of this renouncing others the countess and the castle richmond people had frightened her into falseness and therefore it became him to maintain his right by any meansalmost by any means within his power give her up of his own free will and voice say that herbert fitzgerald should take her with his consent that she should go as a bride to castle richmond while he stood by and smiled and wished them joy never and so he rode away with a stern heart leaving her standing there with something of sternness about her heart also  in the meantime clara when she was sure that her rejected suitor was well away from the place put on her bonnet and walked out it was her wont at this time to do so and she was becoming almost a creature of habit shut up as she was in that old dreary barrack her mother very rarely went with her and she habitually performed the same journey over the same ground at the same hour day after day so it had been and so it was stillunless herbert fitzgerald were with her  on the present occasion she saw no more of her mother before she left the house she passed the drawingroom door and seeing that it was ajar knew that the countess was there but she had nothing to say to her mother as to the late interview unless her mother had aught to say to her so she passed on in truth her mother had nothing to say to her she was sitting there alone with her head resting on her hand with that sternness at her heart and a cloud upon her brow but she was not thinking of her daughter had she not with her skill and motherly care provided well for clara had she not saved her daughter from all the perils which beset the path of a young girl had she not so brought her child up and put her forth into the world that portionless as that child was all the best things of the world had been showered into her lap why should the countess think more of her daughter it was of herself she was thinking and of what her life would be all alone absolutely alone in that huge frightful home of hers without a friend almost without an acquaintance without one soul near her whom she could love or who would love her she had put out her hand to owen fitzgerald and he had rejected it her he had regarded merely as the mother of the woman he loved and then the countess of desmond began to ask herself if she were old and wrinkled and ugly only fit to be a dowager in mind body and in name  over the same ground yes always over the same ground lady clara never varied her walk it went from the front entrance of the court with one great curve down to the old ruined lodge which opened on to the road running from kanturk to cork it was here that the row of elm trees stood and it was here that she had once walked with a hot eager lover beside her while a docile horse followed behind their feet it was here that she walked daily and was it possible that she should walk here without thinking of him  it was always on the little wellworn path by the roadside not on the road itself that she took her measured exercise and now as she went along she saw on the moist earth the fresh prints of a horses hoofs he also had ridden down the same way choosing to pass over the absolute spot in which those words had been uttered thinking of that moment as she also was thinking of it she felt sure that such had been the case she knew that it was this that had brought him therethere on to the foottraces which they had made together  and did he then love her so trulywith a love so hot so eager so deeply planted in his very soul was it really true that a passion for her had so filled his heart that his whole life must by that be made or marred had she done this thing to him had she so impressed her image on his mind that he must be wretched without her was she so much to him so completely all in all as regarded his future worldly happiness those words of his asserting that loveher lovewas to him a stern fact a deep necessityrecurred over and over again to her mind could it really be that in doing as she had done in giving herself to another after she had promised herself to him she had committed an injustice which would constantly be brought up against her by him and by her own conscience had she in truth deceived and betrayed himdeserted him because he was poor and given herself over to a rich lover because of his riches  as she thought of this she forgot again that factwhich indeed she had never more than half realized in her mindthat he had justified her in separating herself from him by his reckless course of living that his conduct must be held to have so justified her let the pledge between them have been of what nature it might now as she walked up and down that path she thought nothing of his wickedness and his sins she thought only of the vows to which she had once listened and the renewal of those vows to which it was now so necessary that her ear should be deaf  but was her heart deaf to them she swore to herself over and over again scores and scores of oaths that it was so but each time that she swore some lowest corner in the depth of her conscience seemed to charge her with a falsehood why was it that in all her hours of thinking she so much oftener saw his face owens than she did that other face of which in duty she was bound to think and dream it was in vain that she told herself that she was afraid of owen and therefore thought of him the tone of his voice that rang in her ears the oftenest was not that of his anger and sternness but the tone of his first assurance of lovethat tone which had been so inexpressibly sweet to herthat to which she had listened on this very spot where she now walked slowly thinking of him the look of his which was ever present to her eyes was not that on which she had almost feared to gaze but an hour ago but the form and spirit which his countenance had worn when they were together on that wellremembered day  and then she would think or try to think of herbert and of all his virtues and of all his goodness he too loved her well she never doubted that he had come to her with soft words and pleasant smiles and sweet honeyed complimentscompliments which had been sweet to her as they are to all girls but his soft words and pleasant smiles and honeyed lovemaking had never given her so strong a thrill of strange delight as had those few words from owen her very hearts core had been affected by the vigour of his affection there had been in it a mysterious grandeur which had half charmed and half frightened her it had made her feel that he were it fated that she should belong to him would indeed be her lord and ruler that his was a spirit before which hers would bend and feel itself subdued with him she could realize all that she had dreamed of womans love and that dream which is so sweet to some womenof womans subjugation but could it be the same with him to whom she was now positively affianced with him to whom she knew that she did now owe all her duty she feared that it was not the same  and then again she swore that she loved him she thought over all his excellences how good he was as a sonhow fondly his sisters loved himhow inimitable was his conduct in these hard trying times and she remembered also that it was right in every way that she should love him her mother and brother approved of it those who were to be her new relatives approved of it it was in every way fitting pecuniary considerations were so favourable but when she thought of that her heart sank low within her breast was it true that she had sold herself at her mothers bidding should not the remembrance of owens poverty have made her true to him had nothing else done so  but be all that as it might one thing at any rate was clear to her that it was now her fate her dutyand as she repeated again and again her wish to marry herbert no thought of rebellion against him and her mother ever occurred to her as desirable or possible she would be to him a true and loving wife a wife in very heart and soul but nevertheless walking thus beneath those trees she could not but think of owen fitzgerald  in this mood she had gone twice down from the house to the lodge and back again and now again she had reached the lodge the third time making thus her last journey for in these solitary walks her work was measured the exercise was needful but there was little in the task to make her prolong it beyond what was necessary but now as she was turning for the last time she heard the sound of a horses hoof coming fast along the road and looking from the gate she saw that herbert was coming to her she had not expected him but now she waited at the gate to meet him  it had been arranged that she was to go over in a few days to castle richmond and stay there for a fortnight this had been settled shortly before the visit made by mr mollett junior at that place and had not as yet been unsettled but as soon as it was known that sir thomas had summoned mr prendergast from london it was felt by them all that it would be as well that claras visit should be postponed herbert had been especially cautioned by his father at the time of molletts visit not to tell his mother anything of what had occurred and to a certain extent he had kept his promise but it was of course necessary that lady fitzgerald should know that mr prendergast was coming to the house and it was of course impossible to keep from her the fact that his visit was connected with the lamentable state of her husbands health and spirits indeed she knew as much as that without any telling it was not probable that mr prendergast should come there now on a visit of pleasure  whatever this may be that weighs upon his mind herbert had said he will be better for talking it over with a man whom he trusts  and why not with somers said lady fitzgerald  somers is too often with him too near to him in all the affairs of his life i really think he is wise to send for mr prendergast we do not know him but i believe him to be a good man  then lady fitzgerald had expressed herself as satisfiedas satisfied as she could be seeing that her husband would not take her into his confidence and after this it was settled that herbert should at once ride over to desmond court and explain that claras visit had better be postponed  herbert got off his horse at the gate and gave it to one of the children at the lodge to lead after him his horse would not follow him clara said to herself as they walked back together towards the house she could not prevent her mind running off in that direction she would fain not have thought of owen as she thus hung upon herberts arm but as yet she had not learned to control her thoughts his horse had followed him lovinglythe dogs about the place had always loved himthe men and women of the whole country round old and young all spoke of him with a sort of love everybody admired him as all this passed through her brain she was hanging on her accepted lovers arm and listening to his soft sweet words  oh yes it will be much better she said answering his proposal that she should put off her visit to castle richmond but i am so sorry that sir thomas should be ill mr prendergast is not a doctor is he  and then herbert explained that mr prendergast was not a doctor that he was a physician for the mind rather than for the body regarding clara as already one of his own family he told her as much as he had told his mother he explained that there was some deep sorrow weighing on his fathers heart of which they none of them knew anything save its existence that there might be some misfortune coming on sir thomas of which he herbert could not even guess the nature but that everything would be told to this mr prendergast  it is very sad said herbert  very sad very sad said clara with tears in her eyes poor gentleman i wish that we could comfort him  and i do hope that we may said herbert somers seems to think that his mind is partly affected and that this misfortune whatever it be may not improbably be less serious than we anticipatethat it weighs heavier on him than it would do were he altogether well  and your mother herbert  oh yes she also is to be pitied sometimes for moments she seems to dread some terrible misfortune but i believe that in her calm judgment she thinks that our worst calamity is the state of my fathers health  neither in discussing the matter with his mother or clara nor in thinking it over when alone did it ever occur to herbert that he himself might be individually subject to the misfortune over which his father brooded sir thomas had spoken piteously to him and called him poor and had seemed to grieve over what might happen to him but this had been taken by the son as a part of his fathers malady  everything around him was now melancholy and therefore these terms had not seemed to have any special force of their own he did not think it necessary to warn clara that bad days might be in store for both of them or to caution her that their path of love might yet be made rough  and whom do you think i met just now on horseback he asked as soon as this question of her visit had been decided  mr owen fitzgerald probably said clara he went from hence about an hour since  owen fitzgerald here he repeated as though the tidings of such a visit having been made were not exactly pleasant to him i thought that lady desmond did not even see him now  his visit was to me herbert and i will explain it to you i was just going to tell you when you first came in only you began about castle richmond  and have you seen him  oh yes i saw him mamma thought it best yesterday he wrote a note to me which i will show you and then she gave him such an account of the interview as was possible to her making it at any rate intelligible to him that owen had come thither to claim her for himself having heard the rumour of her engagement to his cousin  it was inexcusable on his partunpardonable said herbert speaking with an angry spot on his face and with more energy than was usual with him  was it why said clara innocently she felt unconsciously that it was painful to her to hear owen ill spoken of by her lover and that she would fain excuse him if she could  why dearest think what motives he could have had what other object than to place you in a painful position and to cause trouble and vexation to us all did he not know that we were engaged  oh yes he knew thatat least no i am not quite surei think he said that he had heard it but did not  did not what love  i think he said he did not quite believe it and then she was forced much against her will to describe to her betrothed how owen had boldly claimed her as his own  his conduct has been unpardonable said herbert again nay it has been ungentlemanlike he has intruded himself where he well knew that he was not wanted and he has done so taking advantage of a few words which under the present circumstances he should force himself to forget  but herbert it is i that have been to blame  no you have not been in the least to blame i tell you honestly that i can lay no blame at your door at the age you were then it was impossible that you should know your own mind and even had your promise to him been of a much more binding nature his subsequent conduct and your mothers remonstrance as well as your own age would have released you from it without any taint of falsehood he knew all this as well as i do and i am surprised that he should have forced his way into your mothers house with the mere object of causing you embarrassment  it was marvellous how well herbert fitzgerald could lay down the law on the subject of claras conduct and on all that was due to her and all that was not due to owen he was the victor he had gained the prize and therefore it was so easy for him to acquit his promised bride and heap reproaches on the head of his rejected rival owen had been told that he was not wanted and of course should have been satisfied with his answer why should he intrude himself among happy people with his absurd aspirations for were they not absurd was it not monstrous on his part to suppose that he could marry clara desmond  it was in this way that herbert regarded the matter but it was not exactly in that way that clara looked at it he did not force his way in she said he wrote to ask if we would see him and mamma said that she thought it better  that is forcing his way in the sense that i meant it and if i find that he gives further annoyance i shall tell him what i think about it i will not have you persecuted  herbert if you quarrel with him you will make me wretched i think it would kill me  i shall not do it if i can help it clara but it is my duty to protect you and if it becomes necessary i must do so you have no father and no brother of an age to speak to him and that consideration alone should have saved you from such an attack  clara said nothing more for she knew that she could not speak out to him the feelings of her heart she could not plead to him that she had injured owen that she had loved him and then given him up that she had been false to him she could not confess that after all the tribute of such a mans love could not be regarded by her as an offence so she said nothing further but walked on in silence leaning on his arm  they were now close to the house and as they drew near to it lady desmond met them on the doorstep i dare say you have heard that we had a visitor here this morning she said taking herberts hand in an affectionate motherly way and smiling on him with all her sweetness  herbert said that he had heard it and expressed an opinion that mr owen fitzgerald would have been acting far more wisely to have remained at home at hap house  yes perhaps so certainly so said lady desmond putting her arm within that of her future son and walking back with him through the great hall he would have been wiser he would have saved dear clara from a painful halfhour and he would have saved himself from perhaps years of sorrow he has been very foolish to remember claras childhood as he does remember it but my dear herbert what can we do you lords of creation sometimes will be foolish even about such trifling things as womens hearts  and then when herbert still persisted that owens conduct had been inexcusable and ungentlemanlike she softly flattered him into quiescence you must not forget she said that he perhaps has loved clara almost as truly as you do and then what harm can he do it is not very probable that he should succeed in winning clara away from you  oh no it is not that i mean it is for claras sake  and she probably will never see him again till she is your wife that event will i suppose take place at no very remote period  as soon as ever my fathers health will admit that is if i can persuade clara to be so merciful  to tell the truth herbert i think you could persuade her to anything of course we must not hurry her too much as for me my losing her will be very sad you can understand that but i would not allow any feeling of my own to stand in her way for halfanhour  she will be very near you you know  yes she will and therefore as i was saying it would be absurd for you to quarrel with mr owen fitzgerald for myself i am sorry for himvery sorry for him you know the whole story of what occurred between him and clara and of course you will understand that my duty at that time was plain clara behaved admirably and if only he would not be so foolish the whole matter might be forgotten as far as you and i are concerned i think it may be forgotten  but then his coming here  that will not be repeated i thought it better to show him that we were not afraid of him and therefore i permitted it had i conceived that you would have objected  oh no said herbert  well there was not much for you to be afraid of certainly said the countess and so he was appeased and left the house promising that he at any rate would do nothing that might lead to a quarrel with his cousin owen  clara who had still kept on her bonnet again walked down with him to the lodge and encountered his first earnest supplication that an early day should be named for their marriage she had many reasons excellent good reasons to allege why this should not be the case when was a girl of seventeen without such reasons and it is so reasonable that she should have such reasons that period of having love made to her must be by far the brightest in her life is it not always a pity that it should be abridged  but your fathers illness herbert you know  herbert acknowledged that to a certain extent his fathers illness was a reasononly to a certain extent it would be worse than useless to think of waiting till his fathers health should be altogether strong just for the present till mr prendergast should have gone and perhaps for a fortnight longer it might be well to wait but after thatand then he pressed very closely the hand which rested on his arm and so the matter was discussed between them with language and arguments which were by no means original  at the gate just as herbert was about to remount his horse they were encountered by a sight which for years past had not been uncommon in the south of ireland but which had become frightfully common during the last two or three months a woman was standing there of whom you could hardly say that she was clothed though she was involved in a mass of rags which covered her nakedness her head was all uncovered and her wild black hair was streaming round her face behind her back hung two children enveloped among the rags in some mysterious way and round about her on the road stood three others of whom the two younger were almost absolutely naked the eldest of the five was not above seven they all had the same wild black eyes and wild elfish straggling locks but neither the mother nor the children were comely she was short and broad in the shoulders though wretchedly thin her bare legs seemed to be of nearly the same thickness up to the knee and the naked limbs of the children were like yellow sticks it is strange how various are the kinds of physical development among the celtic peasantry in ireland in many places they are singularly beautiful especially as children and even after labour and sickness shall have told on them as labour and sickness will tell they still retain a certain softness and grace which is very nearly akin to beauty but then again in a neighbouring district they will be found to be squat uncouth and in no way attractive to the eye the tint of the complexion the nature of the hair the colour of the eyes shall be the same but in one place it will seem as though noble blood had produced delicate limbs and elegant stature whereas in the other a want of noble blood had produced the reverse the peasants of clare limerick and tipperary are in this way much more comely than those of cork and kerry  when herbert and clara reached the gate they found this mother with her five children crouching at the ditchside although it was still midwinter they had seen him enter the demesne and were now waiting with the patience of poverty for his return  an the holy virgin guide an save you my lady said the woman almost frightening clara by the sudden way in which she came forward an you too misther herbert and for the love of heaven do something for a poor crathur whose five starving childher have not had wholesome food within their lips for the last week past  clara looked at them piteously and put her hand towards her pocket her purse was never well furnished and now in these bad days was usually empty at the present moment it was wholly so i have nothing to give her not a penny she said whispering to her lover  but herbert had learned deep lessons of political economy and was by no means disposed to give promiscuous charity on the roadside what is your name said he and from where do you come  shure an its yer honor knows me well enough and her ladyship too may the heavens be her bed and dont i come from clady that is two long miles the fur side of it and my name is bridget sheehy shure an yer ladyship remembers me at clady the first day ye war over there about the biler  clara looked at her and thought that she did remember her but she said nothing and who is your husband said herbert  murty brien plaze yer honor and the woman ducked a curtsey with the heavy load of two children on her back it must be understood that among the poorer classes in the south and west of ireland it is almost rare for a married woman to call herself or to be called by her husbands name  and is he not at work  shure an he is yer honordown beyant kinsale by the say but whats four shilling a week for a mans diet let alone a woman and five bairns  and so he has deserted you  no yer honor hes not dasarted me thin hes a good man and a kind av he had the mains but weve a cabin up here on her ladyships ground that is and he has sent me up among my own people hoping that times would come round but faix yer honor im thinking that theyll never come round no more  and what do you want now bridget  what is it im wanting just a thrifle of money then to get a sup of milk for thim five childher as is starving and dying for the want of it and she pointed to the wretched naked brood around her with a gesture which in spite of her ugliness had in it something of tragic grandeur  but you know that we will not give money they will take you in at the poorhouse at kanturk  is it the poorhouse yer honor  or if you get a ticket from your priest they will give you meal twice a week at clady you know that why do you not go to father connellan  is it the mail an shure an havent i had it the last month past nothin else not a taste of a piaty or a dhrop of milk for nigh a month and now look at the childher look at them my lady they are dyin by the very roadside and she undid the bundle at her back and laying the two babes down on the road showed that the elder of them was in truth in a fearful state it was a child nearly two years of age but its little legs seemed to have withered away its cheeks were wan and yellow and sunken and the two teeth which it had already cut were seen with terrible plainness through its emaciated lips its head and forehead were covered with sores and then the mother moving aside the rags showed that its back and legs were in the same state look to that she said almost with scorn thats what the mail has donemy black curses be upon it and the day that it first come nigh the counthry and then again she covered the child and began to resume her load  do give her something herbert pray do said clara with her whole face suffused with tears  you know that we cannot give away money said herbert arguing with bridget sheehy and not answering clara at the moment you understand enough of what is being done to know that why do you not go into the union  shure thin an ill jist tramp on as fur as hap house i and my childher that is av they do not die by the roadside come on bairns mr owen wont be afther sending me to the kanturk union when i tell him that ive travelled all thim miles to get a dhrink of milk for a sick babe more by token when i tells him also that im one of the desmond tinantry its he that loves the desmonds lady claraloves them as his own hearts blood and its i that wish him good luck with his love in spite of all thats come and gone yet come on bairns come along we have seven weary miles to walk and then having rearranged her burden on her back she prepared again to start  herbert fitzgerald from the first moment of his interrogating the woman had of course known that he would give her somewhat in spite of all his political economy there were but few days in which he did not empty his pocket of his loose silver with these culpable deviations from his theoretical philosophy but yet he felt that it was his duty to insist on his rules as far as his heart would allow him to do so it was a settled thing at their relief committee that there should be no giving away of money to chance applicants for alms what money each had to bestow would go twice further by being brought to the general fundby being expended with forethought and discrimination this was the system which all attempted which all resolved to adopt who were then living in the south of ireland but the system was impracticable for it required frames of iron and hearts of adamant it was impossible not to waste money in almsgiving  oh herbert said clara imploringly as the woman prepared to start  bridget come here said herbert and he spoke very seriously for the womans allusion to owen fitzgerald had driven a cloud across his brow your child is very ill and therefore i will give you something to help you and he gave her a shilling and two sixpences  may the god in heaven bless you thin and make you happy whoever wins the bright darling by your side and may the good days come back to yer house and all that belongs to it may yer wife clave to you all her days and be a good mother to your childher and she would have gone on further with her blessing had not he interrupted her  go on now my good woman said he and take your children where they may be warm if you will be advised by me you will go to the union at kanturk and so the woman passed on still blessing them very shortly after this none of them required pressing to go to the workhouse every building that could be arranged for the purpose was filled to overflowing as soon as it was ready but the worst of the famine had not come upon them as yet and then herbert rode back to castle richmond     chapter xvii  father barney   mick odwyers publichouse at kanturk was by no means so pretentious an establishment as that kept by his brother in south main street cork but it was on the whole much less nasty it was a drinkingshop and a public car office and such places in ireland are seldom very nice but there was no attempt at hotel grandeur and the little room in which the family lived behind the bar was never invaded by customers  on one evening just at this timeat the time that is with which we have been lately concernedthree persons were sitting in this room over a cup of tea there was a gentleman middleaged but none the worse on that account who has already been introduced in these pages as father bernard mcarthy he was the parish priest of drumbarrow and as his parish comprised a portion of the town of kanturk he lived not exactly in the town but within a mile of it his sister had married mr odwyer of south main street and therefore he was quite at home in the little back parlour of mick odwyers house in kanturk indeed father bernard was a man who made himself at home in the houses of most of his parishionersand of some who were not his parishioners  his companions on the present occasion were two ladies who seemed to be emulous in supplying his wants the younger and more attractive of the two was also an old friend of ours being no other than fanny odwyer from south main street actuated doubtless by some important motive she had left her bar at home for one night having come down to kanturk by her fathers car with the intention of returning by it in the morning she was seated as a guest here on the corner of the sofa near the fire but nevertheless she was neither too proud nor too strange in her position to administer as best she might to the comfort of her uncle  the other lady was mistress odwyer the lady of the mansion she was fat very by no means fair and perhaps something over forty but nevertheless there were those who thought that she had her charms a better hand at curing a side of bacon there was not in the county cork nor a woman who was more knowing in keeping a house straight and snug over her husbands head that she had been worth more than a fortune to mick odwyer was admitted by all in kanturk for it was known to all that mick odwyer was not himself a good hand at keeping a house straight and snug  another cup of tay father bernard said this lady itll be more to your liking now than the first youll find father barney perfectly reliant on her word handed in his cup  and the muffin is quite hot said fanny stooping down to a tray which stood before the peat fire holding the muffin dish but perhaps youd like a morsel of buttered toast say the word uncle and ill make it in a brace of seconds  in course she will said mrs odwyer and happy too av youll only say that you have a fancy father bernard  but father bernard would not own to any such fancy the muffin he said was quite to his liking and so was the tea and from the manner in which he disposed of these delicacies even mrs townsend might have admitted that this assertion was true though she was wont to express her belief that nothing but lies could by any possibility fall from his mouth  and they have been staying with you now for some weeks havent they said father barney  off and on said fanny  but theres one of them mostly there isnt he added the priest  the two of them is mostly there just now sometimes one goes away for a day or two and sometimes the other  and they have no business which keeps them in cork continued the priest who seemed to be very curious on the matter  well they do have business i suppose said fanny but av so i never sees it fanny odwyer had a great respect for her uncle seeing that he filled an exalted position and was a connexion of whom she could be justly proud but though she had now come down to kanturk with the view of having a good talk with her aunt and uncle about the molletts she would only tell as much as she liked to tell even to the parish priest of drumbarrow and we may as well explain here that fanny had now permanently made up her mind to reject the suit of mr abraham mollett as she had allowed herself to see more and more of the little domestic ways of that gentleman and to become intimate with him as a girl should become with the man she intends to marry she had gradually learned to think that he hardly came up to her beau ideal of a lover that he was crafty and false did not perhaps offend her as it should have done dear fanny excellent and gracious as she was could herself be crafty on occasions he drank too but that came in the way of her profession it is hard perhaps for a barmaid to feel much severity against that offence but in addition to this aby was selfish and cruel and insolent and seldom altogether good tempered he was bad to his father and bad to those below him whom he employed old mollett would give away his sixpences with a fairly liberal hand unless when he was exasperated by drink and fatigue but aby seldom gave away a penny fanny had sharp eyes and soon felt that her english lover was not a man to be loved though he had two rings a gold chain and half a dozen fine waistcoats  and then another offence had come to light in which the molletts were both concerned since their arrival in south main street they had been excellent customersindeed quite a godsend in this light to fanny who had her own peculiar profit out of such housecustomers as they were they had paid their money like true britonsnot regularly indeed for regularity had not been desired but by a five pound now and another in a day or two just as they were wanted nothing indeed could be better than this for bills so paid are seldom rigidly scrutinized but of late within the last week fannys requests for funds had not been so promptly met and only on the day before her visit to kanturk she had been forced to get her father to take a bill from mr mollett senior for ¬£20 at two months date this was a great comedown as both fanny and her father felt and they had begun to think that it might be well to bring their connexion with the molletts to a close what if an end had come to the money of these people and their bills should be dishonoured when due it was all very well for a man to have claims against sir thomas fitzgerald but fanny odwyer had already learnt that nothing goes so far in this world as ready cash  they do have business i suppose said fanny  it wont be worth much im thinking said mrs odwyer when they cant pay their weekly bills at a house of public entertainment without flying their names at two months date  mrs odwyer hated any such payments herself and looked on them as certain signs of immorality that every man should take his drop of drink consume it noiselessly and pay for it immediatelythat was her idea of propriety in its highest form  and theyve been down here three or four times each of them said father barney thinking deeply on the subject  i believe they have said fanny but of course i dont know much of where theyve been to  father barney knew very well that his dear niece had been on much more intimate terms with her guest than she pretended the rumours had reached his ears some time since that the younger of the two strangers in south main street was making himself agreeable to the heiress of the hotel and he had intended to come down upon her with all the might of an uncle and if necessary with all the authority of the church but now that fanny had discarded her lover he wisely felt that it would be well for him to know nothing about it both uncles and priests may know too muchvery foolishly  i have seen them here myself said he and they have both been up at castle richmond  they do say as poor sir thomas is in a bad way said mrs odwyer shaking her head piteously  and yet he sees these men said father barney i know that for certain he has seen them though he will rarely see anybody nowadays  young mr herbert is adoing most of the business up about the place said mrs odwyer and people do say as how he is going to make a match of it with lady clara desmond and its the lucky girl shell be for hes a nice young fellow entirely  not half equal to her other joe mr owen that is said fanny  well i dont know that my dear such a house and property as castle richmond is not likely to go abegging among the young women and then mr herbert is not so rampageous like as him of hap house by all accounts  but father barney still kept to his subject and they are both at your place at the present moment eh fanny  they was to dine there after i left  and the old man said hed be down here again next thursday continued the priest i heard that for certain ill tell you what it is theyre not after any good here they are protestants aint they  oh black protestants said mrs odwyer but you are not taking your tay father bernard and she again filled his cup for him  if youll take my advice fanny youll give them nothing more without seeing their money theyll come to no good here im sure of that theyre afther some mischief with that poor old gentleman at castle richmond and its my belief the police will have them before theyve done  like enough said mrs odwyer  they may have them tomorrow for what i care said fanny who could not help feeling that aby mollett had at one time been not altogether left without hope as her suitor  but you wouldnt like anything like that to happen in your fathers house said father barney  bringing throuble and disgrace on an honest name said mrs odwyer  thered be no disgrace as i knows of said fanny stoutly father makes his money by the public and in course he takes in any that comes the way with money in their pockets to pay the shot  but these molletts aint got the money to pay the shot said mrs odwyer causticly youve about sucked em dhry im thinking and they owes you more now than youre like to get from em  i suppose father ll have to take that bill up said fanny assenting and so it was settled down there among them that the molletts were to have the cold shoulder and that they should in fact be turned out of the kanturk hotel as quickly as this could be done better a small loss at first than a big one at last said mrs odwyer with much wisdom theyll come to mischief down here as sure as my names mcarthy said the priest and id be sorry your father should be mixed up in it  and then by degrees the conversation was changed but not till the teathings had been taken away and a square small bottle of very particular whisky put on the table in its place and the sugar also was brought and boiling water in an immense jug as though father barney were going to make a deep potation indeed and a lemon in a wine glass and then the priest was invited with much hospitality to make himself comfortable nor did the luxuries prepared for him end here but fanny the pretty fan herself filled a pipe for him and pretended that she would light it for such priests are merry enough sometimes and can joke as well as other men with their pretty nieces  but youre not mixing your punch father bernard said mrs odwyer with a plaintive melancholy voice and the wather getting cowld and all faix then father bernard ill mix it for ye so i will and so she did and well she knew how and then she made another for herself and her niece urging that a thimbleful would do fanny all the good in life afther her ride acrass them cowld mountains and the priest looked on assenting blowing the comfortable streams of smoke from his nostrils  and so father bernard you and parson townsend is to meet again tomorrow at gortnaclough whereupon father bernard owned that such was the case with a nod not caring to disturb the pipe which lay comfortably on his lower lip  well well only to think on it continued mrs odwyer that the same room should hould the two of ye and she lifted up her hands and shook her head  it houlds us both very comfortable i can assure you mrs odwyer  and he aint rampageous and hightytighty he dont give hisself no airs  well no nothing in particular why should the man be such a fool as that  why in course but they are such fools father bernard they does think theyselves such grand folks now dont they id give a dandy of punch all round to the company just to hear you put him down once i would but he isnt upsetting at all then  not the last time we met he wasnt and i dont think he intends it things have come to that now that the parsons know where they are and what they have to look to theyre getting a lesson theyll not forget in a hurry where are their rent charges to come fromcan you tell me that mrs odwyer  mrs odwyer could not but she remarked that pride would always have a fall and theres no pride like protesthant pride said fanny it is so upsetting i cant abide it all which tended to show that she had quite given up her protestant lover  and is it getthing worse than iver with the poor crathurs said mrs odwyer referring not to the protestants but to the victims of the famine  indeed its getting no betther said the priest and im fearing it will be worse before it is over i havent married one couple in drumbarrow since november last  and thats a heavy sign father bernard  the surest sign in the world that they have no money among them at all at all and it is bad with thim mrs odwyervery bad very bad indeed  glory be to god the poor cratures said the softhearted lady it isnt much the like of us have to give away father bernard i neednt be telling you that but well help you knowwell help  and so will father uncle bernard if youre so bad off about here i know hell give you a thrifle for the asking in a short time however it came to pass that those in the cities could spare no aid to the country indeed it may be a question whether the city poverty was not the harder of the two  god bless you bothyouve soft hearts i know and father barney put his punch to his lips whatever you can do for me shall not be thrown away and ill tell you what mrs odwyer it does behove us all to put our best foot out now we will not let them say that the papists would do nothing for their own poor  deed then an theyll say anything of us father bernard theres nothing too hot or too heavy for them  at any rate let us not deserve it mrs odwyer there will be a lot of them at gortnaclough tomorrow and i shall tell them that we on our side wont be wanting to give them their due i must say that they are working well that young herbert fitzgeralds a trump whether hes protestant or catholic  an they do say hes a strong bearing towards the ould religion said mrs odwyer god bless his sweet young face av hed come back to us thats what i say  god bless his face any way say i said father barney with a wider philanthropy he is doing his best for the people and the time has come now when we must hang together if it be any way possible and with this the priest finished his pipe and wishing the ladies good night walked away to his own house     chapter xviii  the relief committee   at this time the famine was beginning to be systematised the sternest among landlords and masters were driven to acknowledge that the people had not got food or the means of earning it the people themselves were learning that a great national calamity had happened and that the work was gods work and the government had fully recognized the necessity of taking the whole matter into its own hands they were responsible for the preservation of the people and they acknowledged their responsibility  and then two great rules seemed to get themselves laid downnot by general consent for there were many who greatly contested their wisdombut by some force strong enough to make itself dominant the first was that the food to be provided should be earned and not given away and the second was that the providing of that food should be left to private competition and not in any way be undertaken by the government i make bold to say that both these rules were wise and good  but how should the people work that government should supply the wages was of course an understood necessity and it was also necessary that on all such work the amount of wages should be regulated by the price at which provisions might fix themselves these points produced questions which were hotly debated by the relief committees of the different districts but at last it got itself decided again by the hands of government that all hills along the country roads should be cut away and that the people should be employed on this work they were so employedvery little to the advantage of the roads for that or some following years  so you have begun my men said herbert to a gang of labourers whom he found collected at a certain point on ballydahan hill which lay on his road from castle richmond to gortnaclough in saying this he had certainly paid them an unmerited compliment for they had hitherto begun nothing some thirty or forty wretchedlooking men were clustered together in the dirt and slop and mud on the brow of the hill armed with such various tools as each was able to findwith tools for the most part which would go but a little way in making ballydahan hill level or accessible this question of tools also came to a sort of understood settlement before long and within three months of the time of which i am writing legions of wheelbarrows were to be seen lying near every hill wheelbarrows in hundreds and thousands the fate of those myriads of wheelbarrows has always been a mystery to me  so you have begun my men said herbert addressing them in a kindly voice there was a couple of gangsmen with them men a little above the others in appearance but apparently incapable of commencing the work in hand for they also were standing idle leaning against a bit of wooden paling it had however been decided that the works at ballydahan hill should begin on this day and there were the men assembled one fact admitted of no doubt namely this that the wages would begin from this day  and then the men came and clustered round herberts horse they were wretchedlooking creatures halfclad discontented with hungry eyes each having at his hearts core a deep sense of injustice done personally upon him they hated this work of cutting hills from the commencement to the endhated it though it was to bring them wages and save them and theirs from actual famine and death they had not been accustomed to the discomfort of being taken far from their homes to their daily work very many of them had never worked regularly for wages day after day and week after week up to this time such was not the habit of irish cottiers they held their own land and laboured there for a spell and then they would work for a spell as men do in england taking wages and then they would be idle for a spell it was not exactly a profitable mode of life but it had its comforts and now these unfortunates who felt themselves to be driven forth like cattle in droves for the first time suffered the full wretchedness of their position they were not rough and unruly or inclined to be troublesome and perhaps violent as men similarly circumstanced so often are in englandas irishmen are when collected in gangs out of ireland they had no aptitudes for such roughness and no spirits for such violence but they were melancholy given to complaint apathetic and utterly without interest in that they were doing  yz yer honer said one man who was standing shaking himself with his hands enveloped in the rags of his pockets he had on no coat and the keen north wind seemed to be blowing through his bones cold however as he was he would do nothing towards warming himself unless that occasional shake can be considered as a doing of something yz yer honer weve begun thin since before daylight this blessed morning  it was now eleven oclock and a pickaxe had not been put into the ground nor the work marked  been here before daylight said herbert and has there been nobody to set you to work  divil a sowl yer honer said another who was sitting on a hedgebank leaning with both his hands on a hoe which he held between his legs barring thady molloy and shawn brady they two do be over us but they knows nothin o such jobs as this  thady molloy and shawn brady had with the others moved up so as to be close to herberts horse but they said not a word towards vindicating their own fitness for command  and its mortial cowld standing here thin said another without a bit to ate or a sup to dhrink since last night and then only a lump of the yally mail and the speaker moved about on his toes and heels desirous of keeping his blood in circulation with the smallest possible amount of trouble  im telling the boys its home wed betther be going said a fourth  and lose the tizzy theyve promised us said he of the hoe  sorrow a tizzy theyll pay any of yez for standing here all day said an illlooking little wretch of a fellow with a black muzzle and a squinting eye ye may all die in the road first and the man turned away among the crowd as an irishman does who has made his speech and does not want to be answered  you need have no fear about that my men said herbert whether you be put to work or no youll receive your wages you may take my word for that  ive been telling em that for the last halfhour said the man with the hoe now rising to his feet shure an didnt mr somers be telling us that wed have saxpence each day as long we war here afore daylight said i yer honer an shure an wasnt it black night when we war here this blessed morning and devil a fear of the tizzy said i but its mortial cowld an itd be asier for uz to be doing a spell of work than crouching about on our hunkers down on the wet ground  all this was true it had been specially enjoined upon them to be early at their work an irishman as a rule will not come regularly to his task it is a very difficult thing to secure his services every morning at six oclock but make a special pointtell him that you want him very early and he will come to you in the middle of the night breakfast every morning punctually at eight oclock is almost impossible in ireland but if you want one special breakfast so that you may start by a train at 4 am you are sure to be served no irregular effort is distasteful to an irishman of the lower classes not if it entails on him the loss of a days food and the loss of a nights rest the actual pleasure of the irregularity repays him for all this and he never tells you that this or that is not his work he prefers work that is not his own your coachman will have no objection to turn the mangle but heaven and earth put together wont persuade him to take the horses out to exercise every morning at the same hour these men had been told to come early and they had been there on the roadside since five oclock it was not surprising that they were cold and hungry listless and unhappy  and then as young fitzgerald was questioning the sonamed gangmen as to the instructions they had received a jaunting car came up to the foot of the hill we war to wait for the ongineer shawn brady had said an shure an we have waited an heres one of misther carrolls cars from mallow said thady molloy and thats the ongineer hisself thady molloy was right this was the engineer himself who had now arrived from mallow from this time forth and for the next twelve months the country was full of engineers or of men who were so called i do not say this in disparagement but the engineers were like the yellow meal when there is an immense demand and that a suddenly immense demand for any article it is seldom easy to get it very good in those days men became engineers with a short amount of apprenticeship but as a rule they did not do their work badly in such days as those men if they be men at all will put their shoulders to the wheel  the engineer was driven up to where they were standing and he jumped off the car among the men who were to work under him with rather a pretentious air he had not observed or probably had not known herbert fitzgerald he was a very young fellow still under oneandtwenty beardless lighthaired blueeyed and fresh from england and what hill is this said he to the driver  ballydahan shure yer honer that last war connickacoppul and that other the big un intirely where the crass road takes away to buttevant that was glounthauneroughtymore faix and thats been the murthering hill for cattle since first i knew it bedad yer honer ll make it smooth as a bowlinggreen  ballydahan said the young man taking a paper out of his pocket and looking up the names in his list ive got it there should be thirtyseven of them here  shure an here we are these siven hours said our friend of the hoe and mighty cowld we are  thady molloy and shawn brady called out the engineer managing thoroughly to anglicise the pronunciation of the names though they were not celtically composite to any great degree  yez wes here said thady coming forward and then herbert came up and introduced himself and the young engineer took off his hat i came away from mallow before eight said he apologetically but i have four of these places to look after and when one gets to one of them it is impossible to get away again there was one place where i was kept two hours before i could get one of the men to understand what they were to do what is it you call that big hill  glounthauneroughtymore yer honer said the driver to whom the name was as easy and familiar as his own  and you are going to set these men to work now said herbert  well i dont suppose theyll do much today mr fitzgerald but i must try and explain to the head men how they are to begin they have none of them any tools you see and then he called out again thady molloy and shawn brady  wes here said thady again we did not exactly know whether yer honerd be afther beginning at the top or the botthom thats all that war staying us  never fear said shawn but well have ould ballydahan level in less than no time were the boys that can do it fair and aisy  it appeared to herbert that the young engineer seemed to be rather bewildered by the job of work before him and therefore he rode on not stopping to embarrass him by any inspection of his work in process of time no doubt so much of the top of ballydahan hill was carried to the bottom as made the whole road altogether impassable for many months but the great object was gained the men were fed and were not fed by charity what did it matter that the springs of every conveyance in the county cork were shattered by the process and that the works resulted in myriads of wheelbarrows  and then as he rode on towards gortnaclough herbert was overtaken by his friend the parson who was also going to the meeting of the relief committee you have not seen the men at ballydahan hill have you said herbert  mr townsend explained that he had not seen them his road had struck on to that on which they now were not far from the top of the hill but i knew they were to be there this morning said mr townsend  they have sent quite a lad of a fellow to show them how to work said herbert i fear we shall all come to grief with these roadcuttings  for heavens sake dont say that at the meeting said mr townsend or youll be playing the priests game out and out father barney has done all in his power to prevent the works  but what if father barney be right said herbert  but hes not right said the parson energetically hes altogether wrong i never knew one of them right in my life yet in anything how can they be right  but i think you are mixing up roadmaking and church doctrine mr townsend  i hope i may never be in danger of mixing up god and the devil you cannot touch pitch and not be defiled remember that herbert fitzgerald  i will remember nothing of the kind said herbert am i to set myself up as a judge and say that this is pitch and that is pitch do you remember st peter on the housetop was not he afraid of what was unclean  the meaning of that was that he was to convert the gentiles and not give way to their errors he was to contend with them and not give way an inch till he had driven them from their idolatry mr townsend had been specially primed by his wife that morning with vigorous hostility against father barney and was grieved to his heart at finding that his young friend was prepared to take the priests part in anything in this matter of the roads mr townsend was doubtless right but hardly on the score of the arguments assigned by him  i dont mean to say that there should be no roadmaking said herbert after a pause the general opinion seems to be that we cant do better i only say that we shall come to grief about it those poor fellows there have as much idea of cutting down a hill as i have and it seems to me that the young lad whom i left with them has not much more  theyll learn all in good time  let us hope it will be in good time  if we once let them have the idea that we are to feed them in idleness said mr townsend they will want to go on for ever in the same way and then when they receive such immense sums in money wages the priests will be sure to get their share if the matter had been left to me i would have paid the men in meal i would never have given them money they should have worked and got their food the priest will get a penny out of every shilling youll see else and so the matter was discussed between them as they went along to gortnaclough  when they reached the room in which the committee was held they found mr somers already in the chair priest mccarthy was there also with his coadjutor the rev columb creaghfather columb as he was always called and there was a mr oleary from boherbuy one of the middlemen as they were formerly namedthough by the way i never knew that word to be current in ireland it is familiar to all and was i suppose common some few years since but i never heard the peasants calling such persons by that title he was one of those with whom the present times were likely to go very hard he was not a bad man unless in so far as this that he had no idea of owing any duty to others beyond himself and his family his doctrine at present amounted to this that if you left the people alone and gave them no false hopes they would contrive to live somehow he believed in a good deal but he had no belief whatever in starvationnone as yet it was probable enough that some belief in this might come to him now before long there were also one or two others men who had some stake in the country but men who hadnt a tithe of the interest possessed by sir thomas fitzgerald  mr townsend again went through the ceremony of shaking hands with his reverend brethren and on this occasion did not seem to be much the worse for it indeed in looking at the two men cursorily a stranger might have said that the condescension was all on the other side mr mcarthy was dressed quite smartly his black clothes were spruce and glossy his gloves of which he still kept on one and showed the other were quite new he was clean shaven and altogether he had a shiny bright ebon appearance about him that quite did a credit to his side of the church but our friend the parson was discreditably shabby his clothes were all brown his white necktie could hardly have been clean during the last fortyeight hours and was tied in a knot which had worked itself nearly round to his ear as he had sat sideways on the car his boots were ugly and badly brushed and his hat was very little better than some of those worn by the workmenso calledat ballydahan hill but nevertheless on looking accurately into the faces of both one might see which man was the better nurtured and the better born that operation with the sows ear is one may say seldom successful with the first generation  a beautiful morning this said the coadjutor addressing herbert fitzgerald with a very mild voice and an unutterable look of friendship as though he might have said here we are in a boat together and of course we are all very fond of each other to tell the truth father columb was not a nicelooking young man he was redhaired slightly marked with the smallpox and had a low forehead and cunning eyes  yes it is a nice morning said herbert we dont expect anybody else here do we somers  at any rate we wont wait said somers so he sat down in the armchair and they all went to work  i am afraid mr somers said mr mcarthy from the other end of the table where he had constituted himself a sort of deputy chairman i am afraid we are going on a wrong tack the priest had shuffled away his chair as he began to speak and was now standing with his hands upon the table it is singular how strong a propensity some men have to get upon their legs in this way  how so mr mcarthy said somers but shant we be all more comfortable if we keep our chairs therell be less ceremony wont there mr townsend  oh certainly said townsend  less liable to interruption perhaps on our legs said father columb smiling blandly  but mr mcarthy was far too wise to fight the question so he sat down just as you like said he i can talk any way sitting or standing walking or riding its all one to me but ill tell you how we are on the wrong tack we shall never get these men to work in gangs on the road never they have not been accustomed to be driven like droves of sheep  but droves of sheep dont work on the road said mr townsend  i know that mr townsend continued mr mcarthy i am quite well aware of that but droves of sheep are driven and these men wont bear it  deed an they wont said father columb having altogether laid aside his bland smile now that the time had come as he thought to speak up for the people they may bear it in england but they wont here and the sternness of his eye was almost invincible  if they are so foolish they must be taught better manners said mr townsend but youll find theyll work just as other men dolook at the navvies  and look at the navvies wages said father columb  besides the navvies only go if they like it said the parish priest  and these men need not go unless they like it said mr somers only with this proviso that if they cannot manage for themselves they must fall into our way of managing for them  what i say is this said mr oleary let em manage for emselves god bless my sowl why we shall be skinned alive if we have to pay all this money back to government if government chooses to squander thousands in this way government should bear the brunt thats what i say eventually government that is the whole nation did bear the brunt but it would not have been very wise to promise this at the time  but we need hardly debate all that at the present moment said mr somers that matter of the roads has already been decided for us and we cant alter it if we would  then we may as well shut up shop said mr oleary  its all very aisy to talk in that way said father columb but the government as you call it cant make men work it cant force eight millions of the finest pisantry on gods earth and father columb was by degrees pushing away the seat from under him when he was cruelly and ruthlessly stopped by his own parish priest  i beg your pardon for a moment creagh said he but perhaps we are getting a little out of the track what mr somers says is very true if these men wont work on the roadand i dont think they willthe responsibility is not on us that matter has been decided for us  men will sooner work anywhere than starve said mr townsend  some men will said father columb with a great deal of meaning in his tone what he intended to convey was thisthat protestants no doubt would do so under the dominion of the flesh but that roman catholics being under the dominion of the spirit would perish first  at any rate we must try said father mcarthy  exactly said mr somers and what we have now to do is to see how we may best enable these workers to live on their wages and how those others are to live who when all is done will get no wages  i think we had better turn shopkeepers ourselves and open stores for them everywhere said herbert that is what we are doing already at berryhill  and import our own corn said the parson  and where are we to get the money said the priest  and why are we to ruin the merchants said oleary whose brother was in the flourtrade in cork  and shut up all the small shopkeepers said father columb whose mother was established in that line in the neighbourhood of castleisland  we could not do it said somers the demand upon us would be so great that we should certainly break down and then where would we be  but for a time somers pleaded herbert  for a time we may do something in that way till other means present themselves but we must refuse all outdoor relief they who cannot or do not bring money must go into the workhouses  you will not get houses in county cork sufficient to hold them said father bernard and so the debate went on not altogether without some sparks of wisdom with many sparks also of eager benevolence and some few passing clouds of fuliginous selfinterest and then lists were produced with the names on them of all who were supposed to be in wantwhich were about to become before long lists of the whole population of the country and at last it was decided among them that in their district nothing should be absolutely given away except to old women and widowswhich kindhearted clause was speedily neutralised by women becoming widows while their husbands were still living and it was decided also that as long as their money lasted the soupkitchen at berryhill should be kept open and mill kept going and the little shop maintained so that to some extent a check might be maintained on the prices of the hucksters and in this way they got through their work not perhaps with the sagacity of solomon but as i have said with an average amount of wisdom as will always be the case when men set about their tasks with true hearts and honest minds  and then when they parted the two clergymen of the parish shook hands with each other again having perhaps less animosity against each other than they had ever felt before there had been a joke or two over the table at which both had laughed the priest had wisely shown some deference to the parson and the parson had immediately returned it by referring some question to the priest how often does it not happen that when we come across those whom we have hated and avoided all our lives we find that they are not quite so bad as we had thought that old gentleman of whom we wot is never so black as he has been painted  the work of the committee took them nearly the whole day so that they did not separate till it was nearly dark when they did so somers and herbert fitzgerald rode home together  i always live in mortal fear said herbert that townsend and the priests will break out into warfare  as they havent done it yet they wont do it now said somers mcarthy is not without sense and townsend queer and intolerant as he is has good feeling if he and father columb were left together i dont know what might happen mr prendergast is to be with you the day after tomorrow is he not  so i understood my father to say  will you let me give you a bit of advice herbert  certainly  then dont be in the house much on the day after he comes hell arrive probably to dinner  i suppose he will  if so leave castle richmond after breakfast the next morning and do not return till near dinnertime it may be that your father will not wish you to be near him whatever this matter may be you may be sure that you will know it before mr prendergast leaves the country i am very glad that he is coming  herbert promised that he would take this advice and he thought himself that among other things he might go over to inspect that clady boiler and of course call at desmond court on his way and then when they got near to castle richmond they parted company mr somers stopping at his own place and herbert riding home alone     chapter xix  the friend of the family   on the day named by herbert and only an hour before dinner mr prendergast did arrive at castle richmond the great southern and western railway was not then open as far as mallow and the journey from dublin was long and tedious ill see him of course said sir thomas to lady fitzgerald but ill put off this business till tomorrow this he said in a tone of distress and agony which showed too plainly how he dreaded the work which he had before him but youll come in to dinner lady fitzgerald had said no he answered not today love i have to think about this and he put his hand up to his head as though this thinking about it had already been too much for him  mr prendergast was a man over sixty years of age being in fact considerably senior to sir thomas himself but no one would have dreamed of calling mr prendergast an old man he was short of stature well made and in good proportion he was wiry strong and almost robust he walked as though in putting his foot to the earth he always wished to proclaim that he was afraid of no man and no thing his hair was grizzled and his whiskers were grey and round about his mouth his face was wrinkled but with him even these things hardly seemed to be signs of old age he was said by many who knew him to be a stern man and there was that in his face which seemed to warrant such a character but he had also the reputation of being a very just man and those who knew him best could tell tales of him which proved that his sternness was at any rate compatible with a wide benevolence he was a man who himself had known but little mental suffering and who owned no mental weakness and it might be therefore that he was impatient of such weakness in others to chance acquaintances his manners were not soft or perhaps palatable but to his old friends his very brusqueness was pleasing he was a bachelor well off in the world and to a certain extent fond of society he was a solicitor by profession having his office somewhere in the purlieus of lincolns inn and living in an oldfashioned house not far distant from that classic spot i have said that he owned no mental weakness when i say further that he was slightly afflicted with personal vanity and thought a good deal about the set of his hair the shape of his coat the fit of his boots the whiteness of his hands and the external trim of his umbrella perhaps i may be considered to have contradicted myself but such was the case he was a handsome man too with clear bright gray eyes a welldefined nose and expressive mouthof which the lips however were somewhat too thin no man with thin lips ever seems to me to be genially human at all points  such was mr prendergast and my readers will i trust feel for sir thomas and pity him in that he was about to place his wounds in the hands of so ruthless a surgeon but a surgeon to be of use should be ruthless in one sense he should have the power of cutting and cauterizing of phlebotomy and bonehandling without effect on his own nerves this power mr prendergast possessed and therefore it may be said that sir thomas had chosen his surgeon judiciously none of the castle richmond family except sir thomas himself had ever seen this gentleman nor had sir thomas often come across him of late years but he was what we in england call an old family friend and i doubt whether we in england have any more valuable english characteristic than that of having old family friends old family feuds are not common with us nowadaysnot so common as with some other people sons who now hated their fathers enemies would have but a bad chance before a commission of lunacy but an old family friend is supposed to stick to one from generation to generation  on his arrival at castle richmond he was taken in to sir thomas before dinner you find me but in a poor state said sir thomas shaking in his fear of what was before him as the poor wretch does before an ironwristed dentist who is about to operate you will be better soon mr prendergast had said as a man always does say under such circumstances what other remark was possible to him sir thomas thinks that he had better not trouble you with business tonight said lady fitzgerald to this also mr prendergast agreed willingly we shall both of us be fresher tomorrow after breakfast he remarked as if any time made any difference to himas though he were not always fresh and ready for any work that might turn up  that evening was not passed very pleasantly by the family at castle richmond to all of them mr prendergast was absolutely a stranger and was hardly the man to ingratiate himself with strangers at the first interview and then too they were all somewhat afraid of him he had come down thither on some business which was to them altogether mysterious and as far as they knew he and he alone was to be intrusted with the mystery he of course said nothing to them on the subject but he looked in their eyes as though he were conscious of being replete with secret importance and on this very account they were afraid of him and then poor lady fitzgerald though she bore up against the weight of her misery better than did her husband was herself very wretched she could not bring herself to believe that all this would end in nothing that mr prendergast would put everything right and that after his departure they would go on as happily as ever this was the doctrine of the younger part of the family who would not think that anything was radically wrong but lady fitzgerald had always at her heart the memory of her early marriage troubles and she feared greatly though she feared she knew not what  herbert fitzgerald and aunt letty did endeavour to keep up some conversation with mr prendergast and the irish famine was of course the subject but this did not go on pleasantly mr prendergast was desirous of information but the statements which were made to him one moment by young fitzgerald were contradicted in the next by his aunt he would declare that the better educated of the roman catholics were prepared to do their duty by their country whereas aunt letty would consider herself bound both by party feeling and religious duty to prove that the roman catholics were bad in everything  oh herbert to hear you say so she exclaimed at one time it makes me tremble in my shoes it is dreadful to think that those people should have got such a hold over you  i really think that the roman catholic priests are liberal in their ideas and moral in their conduct this was the speech which had made aunt letty tremble in her shoes and it may therefore be conceived that mr prendergast did not find himself able to form any firm opinion from the statements then made to him instead of doing so he set them both down as wild irish whom it would be insane to trust and of whom it was absurd to make inquiries it may however be possibly the case that mr prendergast himself had his own prejudices as well as aunt letty and herbert fitzgerald  on the following morning they were still more mute at breakfast the time was coming in which mr prendergast was to go to work and even he gifted though he was with iron nerves began to feel somewhat unpleasantly the nature of the task which he had undertaken lady fitzgerald did not appear at all indeed during the whole of breakfasttime and up to the moment at which mr prendergast was summoned she was sitting with her husband holding his hand in hers and looking tenderly but painfully into his face she so sat with him for above an hour but he spoke to her no word of this revelation he was about to make herbert and the girls and even aunt letty sat solemn and silent as though it was known by them all that something dreadful was to be said and done at last herbert who had left the room returned to it my father will see you now mr prendergast if you will step up to him said he and then he ran to his mother and told her that he should leave the house till dinnertime  but if he sends for you herbert should you not be in the way  it is more likely that he should send for you and were i to remain here i should be going into his room when he did not want me and then he mounted his horse and rode off  mr prendergast with serious air and slow steps and solemn resolve to do what he had to do at any rate with justice walked away from the diningroom to the baronets study the task of an old friend is not always a pleasant one and mr prendergast felt that it was not so at the present moment be gentle with him said aunt letty catching hold of his arm as he went through the passage he merely moved his head twice in token of assent and then passed on into the room  the reader will have learnt by this time with tolerable accuracy what was the nature of the revelation which sir thomas was called upon to make and he will be tolerably certain as to the advice which mr prendergast as an honest man would give in that respect there was no difficulty the laws of meum and tuum are sufficiently clear if a man will open his eyes to look at them in this case they were altogether clear these broad acres of castle richmond did belong to sir thomasfor his life but after his death they could not belong to his son herbert it was a matter which admitted of no doubt no question as to whether the molletts would or would not hold their tongue could bear upon it in the least justice in this case must be done even though the heavens should fall it was sad and piteous stern and hard as was the man who pronounced this doom nevertheless the salt tear collected in his eyes and blinded him as he looked upon the anguish which his judgment had occasioned  yes herbert must be told that he in the world was nobody that he must earn his bread and set about doing so right soon who could say that his fathers life was worth a twelvemonths purchase he must be told that he was nobody in the world and instructed also to tell her whom he loved an earls daughter the same tidings that he was nobody that he would come to possess no property and that in the laws eyes did not possess even a name how would his young heart suffice for the endurance of so terrible a calamity and those pretty girls so softly brought upso tenderly nurtured it must be explained to them too that they must no longer be proud of their fathers lineage and their mothers fame and that other fitzgerald must be summoned and told of all this he on whom they had looked down whom the young heir had robbed of his love whom they had cast out from among them as unworthy notice must be sent to him that he was the heir to castle richmond that he would reign as the future baronet in those gracious chambers it was he who could now make a great county lady of the daughter of the countess  it will be very soon very soon sobbed forth the poor victim and indeed to look at him one might say that it would be soon there were moments when mr prendergast hardly thought that he would live through that frightful day  but all of which we have yet spoken hardly operated upon the baronets mind in creating that stupor of sorrow which now weighed him to the earth it was none of these things that utterly broke him down and crushed him like a mangled reed he had hardly mind left to remember his children it was for the wife of his bosom that he sorrowed  the wife of his bosom he persisted in so calling her through the whole interview and even in his weakness obliged the strong man before him so to name her also she was his wife before god and should be his to the end ah for how short a time was that is she to leave me he once said turning to his friend with his hands clasped together praying that some mercy might be shown to his wretchedness is she to leave me he repeated and then sank on his knees upon the floor  and how was mr prendergast to answer this question how was he to decide whether or no this man and woman might still live together as husband and wife oh my reader think of it if you can and put yourself for a moment in the place of that old family friend tell me tell me is she to leave me repeated the poor victim of all this misery  the sternness and justice of the man at last gave way no said he that cannot i should think be necessary they cannot demand that but you wont desert me said sir thomas when this crumb of comfort was handed to him and he remembered as he spoke the bloodshot eyes of the miscreant who had dared to tell him that the wife of his bosom might be legally torn from him by the hands of another man you wont desert me said sir thomas meaning by that to bind his friend to an obligation that at any rate his wife should not be taken from him  no said mr prendergast i will not desert you certainly not that certainly not that just then it was in his heart to promise almost anything that he was asked who could have refused such solace as this to a man so terribly overburthened  but there was another point of view at which mr prendergast had looked from the commencement but at which he could not get sir thomas to look at all it certainly was necessary that the whole truth in this matter should be made known and declared openly this fair inheritance must go to the right owner and not to the wrong though the affliction on sir thomas was very heavy and would be equally so on all the family he would not on that account for the sake of saving him and them from that affliction be justified in robbing another person of what was legally and actually that other persons property it was a matter of astonishment to mr prendergast that a conscientious man as sir thomas certainly was should have been able to look at the matter in any other light that he should ever have brought himself to have dealings in the matter with mr mollett justice in the case was clear and the truth must be declared but then they must take good care to find out absolutely what the truth was having heard all that sir thomas had to say and having sifted all that he did hear mr prendergast thoroughly believed in his heart of hearts that that wretched miscreant was the actual and true husband of the poor lady whom he would have to see but it was necessary that this should be proved castle richmond for the family and all earthly peace of mind for that unfortunate lady and gentleman were not to be given up on the bare word of a scheming scoundrel for whom no crime would be too black and no cruelty too monstrous the proofs must be looked into before anything was done and they must be looked into before anything was saidto lady fitzgerald we surely may give her that name as yet  but then how were they to get at the proofsat the proofs one way or the other that mollett himself had his marriage certificate sir thomas declared that evidence had been brought home to his own mind of the identity of the manthough what was the nature of that evidence he could not now describeas to that he was quite explicit indeed as i have said above he almost refused to consider the question as admitting of a doubt that mollett was the man to whom his wife had been married he thoroughly believed and to tell the truth mr prendergast was afraid to urge him to look for much comfort in this direction the whole manner of the man mollett had been such as to show that he himself was sure of his ground mr prendergast could hardly doubt that he was the man although he felt himself bound to remark that nothing should be said to lady fitzgerald till inquiry had been made mr mollett himself would be at castle richmond on the next day but one in accordance with the appointment made by himself and if necessary he could be kept in custody till he had been identified as being the man or as not being the man who had married miss wainwright  there is nobody living with you now who knew lady fitzgerald at asked mr prendergast  yes said sir thomas there is one maid servant and then he explained how mrs jones had lived with his wife before her first marriage during those few months in which she had been called mrs talbot and from that day even up to the present hour  then she must have known this man said mr prendergast  but sir thomas was not in a frame of mind at all suited to the sifting of evidence he did not care to say anything about mrs jones he got no crumb of comfort out of that view of the matter things had come out unwittingly for the most part in his conversations with mollett which made him quite certain as to the truth of the main part of the story all those dorsetshire localities were well known to the man the bearings of the house the circumstances of mr wainwrights parsonage the whole history of those months so that on this subject sir thomas had no doubt and we may as well know at once that there was no room for doubt our friend of the kanturk hotel south main street cork was the man who thirty years before had married the childdaughter of the dorsetshire parson  mr prendergast however stood awhile before the fire balancing the evidence the woman must have known him he said to himself and surely she could tell us whether he be like the man and lady fitzgerald herself would know but then who would have the hardness of heart to ask lady fitzgerald to confront that man  he remained with sir thomas that day for hours the long winter evening had begun to make itself felt by its increasing gloom before he left him wine and biscuits were sent in to them but neither of them even noticed the man who brought them twice in the day however mr prendergast gave the baronet a glass of sherry which the latter swallowed unconsciously and then at about four the lawyer prepared to take his leave i will see you early tomorrow said he immediately after breakfast  you are going then said sir thomas who greatly dreaded being left alone  not away you know said mr prendergast i am not going to leave the house  no said sir thomas no of course not but and then he paused  eh said mr prendergast you were saying something  they will be coming in to me now said sir thomas wailing like a child now when you are gone and what am i to say to them  i would say nothing at present nothing today  and my wife he asked again through this interview he studiously called her his wife isis she to know it  when we are assured that this mans story is true sir thomas she must know it that will probably be very soonin a day or two till then i think you had better tell her nothing  and what shall i say to her  say nothing i think it probable that she will not ask any questions if she does tell her that the business between you and me is not yet over i will tell your son that at present he had better not speak to you on the subject of my visit here and then he again took the hand of the unfortunate gentleman and having pressed it with more tenderness than seemed to belong to him he left the room  he left the room and hurried into the hall and out of the house but as he did so he could see that he was watched by lady fitzgerald she was on the alert to go to her husband as soon as she should know that he was alone of what then took place between those two we need say nothing but will wander forth for a while with mr prendergast into the widespreading park  mr prendergast had been used to hard work all his life but he had never undergone a day of severer toil than that through which he had just past nor was it yet over he had laid it down in a broad way as his opinion that the whole truth in this matter should be declared to the world let the consequences be what they might and to this opinion sir thomas had acceded without a word of expostulation but in this was by no means included all that portion of the burden which now fell upon mr prendergasts shoulders it would be for him to look into the evidence and then it would be for him alsoheavy and worst task of allto break the matter to lady fitzgerald  as he sauntered out into the park to wander about for half an hour in the dusk of the evening his head was throbbing with pain the family friend in this instance had certainly been severely taxed in the exercise of his friendship and what was he to do next how was he to conduct himself that evening in the family circle knowing as he so well did that his coming there was to bring destruction upon them all be tender to him aunt letty had said little knowing how great a call there would be on his tenderness of heart and how little scope for any tenderness of purpose  and was it absolutely necessary that that blow should fall in all its severity he asked himself this question over and over again and always had to acknowledge that it was necessary there could be no possible mitigation the son must be told that he was no sonno son in the eye of the law the wife must be told that she was no wife and the distant relative must be made acquainted with his golden prospects the position of herbert and clara and of their promised marriage had been explained to himand all that too must be shivered into fragments how was it possible that the penniless daughter of an earl should give herself in marriage to a youth who was not only penniless also but illegitimate and without a profession look at it in which way he would it was all misery and ruin and it had fallen upon him to pronounce the doom  he could not himself believe that there was any doubt as to the general truth of molletts statement he would of course inquire he would hear what the man had to say and see what he had to adduce he would also examine that old servant and if necessaryand if possible alsohe would induce lady fitzgerald to see the man but he did feel convinced that on this point there was no doubt and then he lifted up his hands in astonishment at the folly which had been committed by a marriage under such circumstancesas wise men will do in the decline of years when young people in the heyday of youth have not been wise if they had waited for a term of years he said and if he then had not presented himself a term of years such as jacob served for rachel seems so light an affair to old bachelors looking back at the loves of their young friends  and so he walked about in the dusk by no means a happy man nor in any way satisfied with the work which was still before him how was he to face lady fitzgerald or tell her of her fate in what words must he describe to herbert fitzgerald the position which in future he must fill the past had been dreadful to him and the future would be no less so in spite of his character as a hard stern man  when he returned to the house he met young fitzgerald in the hall have you been to your father he asked immediately herbert in a low voice and with a saddened face said that he had just come from his fathers room but mr prendergast at once knew that nothing of the truth had been told to him you found him very weak said mr prendergast oh very weak said herbert more than weak utterly prostrate he was lying on the sofa almost unable to speak my mother was with him and is still there  and she he was painfully anxious to know whether sir thomas had been weak enoughor strong enoughto tell his wife any of the story which that morning had been told to him  she is doing what she can to comfort him said herbert but it is very hard for her to be left so utterly in the dark  mr prendergast was passing on to his room but at the foot of the stairs herbert stopped him again going up the stairs with him and almost whispering into his ear  i trust mr prendergast said he that things are not to go on in this way  no no said mr prendergast  because it is unbearableunbearable for my mother and for me and for us all my mother thinks that some terrible thing has happened to the property but if so why should i not be told  of anything that really has happened or does happen you will be told  i dont know whether you are aware of it mr prendergast but i am engaged to be married and i have been given to understandthat is i thought that this might take place very soon my mother seems to think that your coming here maymay defer it if so i think i have a right to expect that something shall be told to me  certainly you have a right my dear young friend but mr fitzgerald for your own sake for all our sakes wait patiently for a few hours  i have waited patiently  yes i know it you have behaved admirably but i cannot speak to you now this time the day after tomorrow i will tell you everything that i know but do not speak of this to your mother i make this promise only to you and then he passed on into his bedroom  with this herbert was obliged to be content that evening he again saw his father and mother but he told them nothing of what had passed between him and mr prendergast lady fitzgerald remained in the study with sir thomas the whole evening nay almost the whole night and the slow hours as they passed there were very dreadful no one came to table but aunt letty mr prendergast and herbert and between them hardly a word was spoken the poor girls had found themselves utterly unable to appear they were dissolved in tears and crouching over the fire in their own room and the moment that aunt letty left the table mr prendergast arose also he was suffering he said cruelly from headache and would ask permission to go to his chamber it would have been impossible for him to have sat there pretending to sip his wine with herbert fitzgerald  after this herbert again went to his father and then in the gloom of the evening he found mr somers in the office a little magistrates room that was used both by him and by sir thomas but nothing passed between them herbert had nothing to tell and then at about nine he also went up to his bedroom a more melancholy day than that had never shed its gloom upon castle richmond     chapter xx  two witnesses   mr prendergast had given himself two days to do all that was to be done before he told herbert fitzgerald the whole of the family history he had promised that he would then let him know all that there was to be known and he had done so advisedly considering that it would be manifestly unjust to leave him in the dark an hour longer than was absolutely necessary to expect that sir thomas himself should with his own breath and his own words make the revelation either to his son or to his wife was to expect a manifest impossibility he would altogether have sank under such an effort as he had already sank under the effort of telling it to mr prendergast nor could it be left to the judgment of sir thomas to say when the story should be told he had now absolutely abandoned all judgment in the matter he had placed himself in the hands of a friend and he now expected that that friend should do all that there was to be done mr prendergast had therefore felt himself justified in making this promise  but how was he to set about the necessary intervening work and how pass the intervening hours it had already been decided that mr abraham mollett when he called should be shown as usual into the study but that he should there find himself confronted not with sir thomas but with mr prendergast but there was some doubt whether or no mr mollett would come it might be that he had means of ascertaining what strangers arrived at castle richmond and it might be that he would under the present circumstances think it expedient to stay away this visit however was not to take place till the second day after that on which mr prendergast had heard the story and in the meantime he had that examination of mrs jones to arrange and conduct  the breakfast was again very sad the girls suggested to their brother that he and mr prendergast should sit together by themselves in a small breakfast parlour but to this he would not assent nothing could be more difficult or embarrassing than a conversation between himself and that gentleman and he moreover was unwilling to let it be thought in the household that affairs were going utterly wrong in the family on this matter he need hardly have disturbed himself for the household was fully convinced that things were going very wrong maidservants and menservants can read the meaning of heavy brows and sad faces of long meetings and whispered consultations as well as their betters the two girls therefore and aunt letty appeared at the breakfasttable but it was as though so many ghosts had assembled round the urn  immediately after breakfast mr prendergast applied to aunt letty miss fitzgerald said he i think you have an old servant of the name of jones living here  yes sure said aunt letty she was living with my sisterinlaw before her marriage  exactlyand ever since too i believe said mr prendergast with a lawyers instinctive desire to divert suspicion from the true point  oh yes always mrs jones is quite one of ourselves  then would you do me the favour to beg mrs jones to oblige me with her company for half an hour or so there is an excellent fire in my room and perhaps mrs jones would not object to step there  aunt letty promised that mrs jones should be sent merely suggesting the breakfastparlour instead of the bedroom and to the breakfastparlour mr prendergast at once betook himself what can she know about the london property or about the irish property thought aunt letty to herself and then it occurred to her that perhaps all these troubles arose from some source altogether distinct from the property  in about a quarter of an hour a knock came to the breakfastparlour door and mrs jones having been duly summoned entered the room with a very clean cap and apron and with a very low curtsey good morning mrs jones said mr prendergast pray take a seat and he pointed to an armchair that was comfortably placed near the fire on the further side of the hearthrug mrs jones sat herself down crossed her hands on her lap and looked the very personification of meek obedience  and yet there was something about her which seemed to justify the soubriquet of duchess which the girls had given to her she had a certain grandeur about her cap and a majestical set about the skirt of her dress and a rigour in the lines of her mouth which indicated a habit of command and a confidence in her own dignity which might be supposed to be the very clearest attribute of duchessdom  you have been in this family a long time i am told mrs jones said mr prendergast using his pleasantest voice  a very long time indeed said mrs jones  and in a very confidential situation too i am told by sir thomas that pretty nearly the whole management of the house is left in your hands  sir thomas is very kind sir sir thomas always was very kindpoor gentleman  poor gentleman indeed you may well say that mrs jones this family is in great affliction you are no doubt aware of that and mr prendergast as he spoke got up went to the door and saw that it was firmly closed  mrs jones acknowledged that she was aware of it it was impossible she said for servants to shut their eyes to things if they tried ever so  of course of course said mr prendergast and particularly for a person so attached to them all as you are  well mr pendrergrass i am attached to them certainly i have seed em all born sirthat is the young ladies and mr herbert and as for her ladyship i didnt see her born in course for were both of an age but it comes much to the same thing like  exactly exactly you are quite one of themselves as sir thomass sister said to me just now mrs jones is quite one of ourselves those were her very words  im sure im much obliged to miss letty  well as i was saying a great sorrow has come upon them all mrs jones now will you tell me thisdo you know what it is can you guess at all do the servants know down stairs  id rather not be guessing on any such matters mr pendrergrass and as for them if they were impudent enough for the like theyd never dare to tell me them irish servants is very impudent betimes only theyre good at the heart too and there isnt oned hurt a dog belonging to the family  i am sure they would not said mr prendergast but you yourself you dont know what this trouble is  not a know said mrs jones looking down and smoothing her apron  well now of course you understand mrs jonesand i must explain this to you to account for my questions of course you understand that i am here as sir thomass friend to set certain matters right for him if i can  i supposed as much as that if you please sir  and any questions that i may ask you i ask altogether on his behalfon his behalf and on that of his wife lady fitzgerald i tell you that you may have no scruples as to answering me  oh sir i have no scruples as to that but of course sir in anything i say i must be guided byby  by your own judgment you were going to say  yes sir begging pardon for mentioning such a thing to the likes of you sir  quite right quite right everybody should use their own judgment in everything they do or say more or less but now mrs jones i want to know this you remember her ladyships first marriage i dare say  yes sir i remember it said mrs jones shaking her head  it was a sad affair wasnt it i remember it well though i was very young then so were you too mrs jones  young enough surely sir and foolish enough too we were the most of us that then sir  true true so we were but you remember the man dont youher ladyships husband mr talbot he called himself and mr prendergast took some trouble to look as though he did not at all wish to frighten her  yes i do remember him this she said after a considerable pause but it is a very long time ago you know mr pendrergrass  a very long time but i am sure you do remember you lived in the house you know for some months  yes i did he was my master for three months or thereabouts and to tell the truth i never got my wages for those three months yet but thats neither here nor there  do you believe now mrs jones that that mr talbot is still alive he asked the question in a very soft voice and endeavoured not to startle her by his look as he did so but it was necessary to his purpose that he should keep his eye upon her half the answer to his question was to be conveyed by the effect on the muscles of her face which that question would produce she might perhaps command her voice to tell a falsehood but be unable to command her face to support it  believe what sir said she and the lawyer could immediately perceive that she did believe and probably knew that that man who had called himself talbot was still alive  do you believe mrs jones that he is aliveher ladyships former husband you know  the question was so terrible in its nature that mrs jones absolutely shook under it did she think that that man was still alive why if she thought that what was she to think of her ladyship it was in that manner that she would have answered the question had she known how but she did not know she had therefore to look about her for some other words which might be equally evasive those which she selected served her turn just as well lord bless you sir she said it was not that the words were expressive but the tone was decidedly so it was as though she said how can that man be alive who has been dead these twenty years and more but nevertheless she was giving evidence all the time against the cause of her poor mistress  you think then that he is dead  dead sir oh laws why shouldnt he be dead and then there was a pause between them for a couple of minutes  mrs jones said mr prendergast when he had well considered the matter my belief is that your only object and wish is to do good to your master and mistress  surely sir surely it would be my bounden duty to do them good if i knew how  i will tell you how speak out to me the whole truth openly and freely i am here as the friend of sir thomas and of her ladyship he has sent to me that i may advise him what to do in a great trouble that has befallen him and i cannot give him good advice till i know the truth  what good could it do him poor gentleman to know that that man is alive  it will do him good to know the truth to know whether he be alive or no until he knows that he cannot act properly  poor gentleman poor gentleman said mrs jones putting her handkerchief up to her eyes  if you have any information in this matterand i think you have mrs jonesor even any suspicion it is your duty to tell me  well sir im sure i dont say against that you are sir thomass friend to be sure and no doubt you know best and im a poor ignorant woman but to speak candidly sir i dont feel myself free to talk on this matter i havent never made nor marred since ive been in this family not in such matters as them what ive seed ive kep to myself and when ive had my suspecs as a woman cant but have em ive kep them to myself also and saving your presence sir and meaning no offence to a gentleman like you and here she got up from her chair and made another curtsey i think id liefer hold my tongue than say anything more on this matter and then she remained standing as though she expected permission to retire  but there was still another pause and mr prendergast sat looking at the fire dont you know maam at last he said with almost an angry voice that the man was here in this house last week and now he turned round at her and looked her full in the face he did not however know mrs jones it might be difficult to coax her into free communication but it was altogether out of his power to frighten her into it  what i knows sir i knows said she and what i dont know i dont know and if you please sir lady fitzgeraldshes my missus and if im to be said anything more to about this here matter why id choose that her ladyship should be by and then she made a little motion as though to walk towards the door but mr prendergast managed to stop her  but we want to spare lady fitzgerald if we canat any rate for a while said he you would not wish to bring more sorrow upon her would you  god forbid mr pendrergrass and if i could take the sorrow from her heart i would willingly and bear it myself to the grave for her ladyship has been a good lady to me but no good never did come and never will of servants talking of their missusses and so if you please sir ill make bold toand again she made an attempt to reach the door  but mr prendergast was not yet persuaded that he could not get from the good old woman the information that he wanted and he was persuaded that she had the information if only she could be prevailed upon to impart it so he again stopped her though on this occasion she made some slight attempt to pass him by as she did so i dont think said she that there will be much use in my staying here longer  wait half a minute mrs jones just half a minute if i could only make you understand how we are all circumstanced here and i tell you what though you will trust me with nothing i will trust you with everything  i dont want no trust sir not about all this  but listen to me sir thomas has reason to believenay he feels quite surethat this man is alive  poor gentleman poor gentleman  and has been here in this house two or three times within the last month sir thomas is full sure of this now can you tell me whether the man who did come was this talbot or was not if you can answer that positively either one way or the other you will do a service to the whole familywhich shall not go unrewarded  i dont want no reward sir ask me to tattle of them for rewards after thirty years and she put her apron up to her eyes  well then for the good of the family can you say positively that the man who came here to your master was talbot or that he was not  indeed then sir i cant say anything positively nor for that matter not impositively either and then she shut herself up doggedly and sat with compressed lips determined to resist all the lawyers arts  mr prendergast did not immediately give up the game but he failed in learning from her any more than what she had already told him he felt confident that she did know the secret of this mans existence and presence in the south of ireland but he was forced to satisfy himself with that conviction so he let her go giving her his hand as she went in token of respect and receiving her demure curtsey with his kindest smile it may be thought he to himself that i have not done with her yet  and then he passed another tedious daya day that was terribly tedious to them all he paid a visit to sir thomas but as that arrangement about molletts visit had been made between them it was not necessary that anything should be done or said about the business on hand it was understood that further action was to be stayed till that visit was over and therefore for the present he had nothing to say to sir thomas he did not see lady fitzgerald throughout the whole day and it appeared to him not unnaturally that she purposely kept out of his way anticipating evil from his coming he took a walk with herbert and mr somers and was driven as far as the soupkitchen and mill at berry hill inquiring into the state of the poor or rather pretending to inquire it was a pretence with them all for at the present moment their minds were intent on other things and then there was that terrible dinner that mockery of a meal at which the three ladies were constrained to appear but at which they found it impossible to eat or to speak mr somers had been asked to join the party so that the scene after dinner might be less painful but even he felt that he could not talk as was his ordinary wont horrible suspicions of the truth had gradually come upon him and with a suspicion of such a truthof such a tragedy in the very householdhow could he or how could any one hold a conversation and then at about halfpast nine mr prendergast was again in his bedroom  on the next morning he was early with sir thomas persuading him to relinquish altogether the use of his study for that day on that evening they were to have another interview there in which mr prendergast was to tell his friend the result of what had been done and then he had to arrange certain manoeuvring with the servants in which he was forced to obtain the assistance of herbert mollett was to be introduced into the study immediately on his arrival and this was to be done in such a manner that mrs jones might assuredly be ignorant of his arrival on this duty our old friend richard was employed and it was contrived that mrs jones should be kept upstairs with her mistress all this was difficult enough but he could not explain even to herbert the reason why such scheming was necessary herbert however obeyed in silence knowing that something dreadful was about to fall on them  immediately after breakfast mr prendergast betook himself to the study and there remained with his london newspaper in his hand a dozen times he began a leading article in which the law was laid down with great perspicuity and certainty as to the present state of ireland but had the writer been treating of the sandwich islands he could not have attracted less of his attention he found it impossible to read on that evening he would have to reveal to herbert fitzgerald what was to be his fate  matthew mollett at his last interview with sir thomas had promised to call on this day and had been counting the days till that one should arrive on which he might keep his promise he was terribly in want of cash and as we all know aby had entirely failed in raising the windany immediate fund of windon the occasion of his visit to the baronet and now when this morning came old mollett was early on the road aby had talked of going with him but aby had failed so signally on the occasion of the visit which he did make to castle richmond that he had been without the moral strength to persist in his purpose  then i shall write to the baronet and go alone to london said mollett p√®re  bother replied mollett fils you haint got the cash governor  ive got what ll take me there my boy whether you know it or not and sir thomas ll be ready enough to send me a remittance when im once out of this country  and so aby had given waypartly perhaps in terror of mr somers countenance and matthew mollett started again in a covered car on that cold journey over the boggeragh mountains it was still midwinter being now about the end of february and the country was colder and wetter and more wretched and the people in that desolate district more ragged and more starved than when he had last crossed it but what were their rags and starvation to him he was worse off than they were they were merely dying as all men must do but he was inhabiting a hell on earth which no man need do they came out to him in shoals begging but they came in vain getting nothing from him but a curse through his chattering teeth what right had they to torment with their misery one so much more wretched than themselves  at a little before twelve the covered car was at the front door of castle richmond house and there was richard under the porch on former occasions mr mollett had experienced some little delay in making his way into the baronets presence the servants had looked cold upon him and he had felt as though there might be hot ploughshares under his feet at any step which he took but now everything seemed to be made easy richard took him in tow without a moments delay told him confidentially that sir thomas was waiting for him bade the covered car to be driven round into the yard with a voice that was uncommonly civil seeing that it was addressed to a cork carman and then ushered mr mollett through the hall and down the passage without one moments delay wretched as he had been during his journeywretched as an infernal spirithis hopes were now again elated and he dreamed of a golden paradise there was something pleasant in feeling his mastery over that poor old shattered baronet  the gentleman to wait upon sir thomas said richard opening the study door and then mr mollett senior found himself in the presence of mr prendergast  mr prendergast was sitting in a highbacked easy chair facing the fire when the announcement was made and therefore mollett still fancied that he was in the presence of sir thomas until he was well into the room and the door was closed upon him otherwise he might probably have turned on his heels and bolted he had had three or four interviews with mr prendergast having received different sums of money from that gentlemans hands and had felt on all such occasions that he was being looked through and through mr prendergast had asked but few questions never going into the matter of his molletts pecuniary connexion with sir thomas but there had always been that in the lawyers eye which had frightened the miscreant which had quelled his bluster as soon as it was assumed and had told him that he was known for a blackguard and a scoundrel and now when this man with the terrible gray eye got up from sir thomass chair and wheeling round confronted him looking him full in the face and frowning on him as an honest man does frown on an unconvicted rascalwhen i say this happened to mr mollett senior he thoroughly at that moment wished himself back in london he turned his eye round to the door but that was closed behind him he looked around to see whether sir thomas was there but no one was in the room with him but mr prendergast then he stood still and as that gentleman did not address him he was obliged to speak the silence was too awful for himoh mr prendergast said he is that you  yes mr mollett it is i  oh ahi suppose you are here about business of your own i was wishing to see sir thomas about a little business of my own maybe hes not in the way  no he is not not exactly but perhaps mr mollett i can do as well you have known me before you know and you may say to me openly anything you have to say to sir thomas  well i dont know about that sir my business is with the baronetparticular mr mollett as he spoke strained every nerve to do so without appearance of dismay but his efforts were altogether ineffectual he could not bring himself to look mr prendergast in the face for a moment or avoid feeling like a dog that dreads being kicked all manner of fears came upon him and he would at the moment have given up all his hopes of money from the castle richmond people to have been free from mr prendergast and his influence and yet mollett was not a coward in the ordinary sense of the word indeed he had been very daring in the whole management of this affair but then a course of crime makes such violent demands on a mans courage let any one think of the difference of attacking a thief and being attacked as a thief we are apt to call bad men cowards without much consideration mr mollett was not without pluck but his pluck was now quelled the circumstances were too strong against him  listen to me mr mollett and look here sir never mind turning to the door you cant go now till you and i have had some conversation you may make up your mind to this you will never see sir thomas fitzgerald againunless indeed he should be in the witnessbox when you are standing in the dock  mr prendergast sir  well have you any reason to give why you should not be put in the dock how much money have you got from sir thomas during the last two years by means of those threats which you have been using you were well aware when you set about this business that you were committing felony and have probably felt tolerably sure at times that you would some day be brought up short that day has come  mr prendergast had made up his mind that nothing could be gained by soft usage with mr mollett indeed nothing could be gained in any way by any usage unless it could be shown that mollett and talbot were not the same person he could afford therefore to tell the scoundrel that he was a scoundrel and to declare against himwar to the knife the more that mollett trembled the more abject he became the easier would be the task mr prendergast now had in hand well sir he continued are you going to tell me what business has brought you here today  but mr mollett though he did shake in his shoes did not look at the matter exactly in the same light he could not believe that sir thomas would himself throw up the game on any consideration or that mr prendergast as his friend would throw it up on his behalf he mollett had a strong feeling that he could have continued to deal easily with sir thomas and that it might be very hard to deal at all with mr prendergast but nevertheless the game was still open mr prendergast would probably distrust the fact of his being the ladys husband and it would be for him therefore to use the indubitable proofs of the facts that were in his possession  sir thomas knows very well what ive come about he began slowly and if hes told you why you know too and in that case  but what might or might not happen in that case mr mollett had not now an opportunity of explaining for the door opened and mrs jones entered the room  when that man comes this morning mr prendergast had said to herbert i must get you to induce mrs jones to come to us in the study as soon as may be he had not at all explained to herbert why this was necessary nor had he been at any pains to prevent the young heir from thinking and feeling that some terrible mystery hung over the house there was a terrible mysterywhich indeed would be more terrible still when it ceased to be mysterious he therefore quietly explained to herbert what he desired to have done and herbert awaiting the promised communication of that evening quietly did as he was bid  you must go down to him jones he had said  but id rather not sir i was with him yesterday for two mortal hours and oh mr herbert it aint for no good  but herbert was inexorable and mrs jones feeling herself overcome by the weight of the misfortune that was oppressing them all obeyed and descending to her masters study knocked at the door she knew that mr prendergast was there and she knew that sir thomas was not but she did not know that any stranger was in the room with mr prendergast mr mollett had not heard the knock nor indeed had mr prendergast but mrs jones having gone through this ceremony opened the door and entered  sir thomas knows does he said mr prendergast when mollett ceased to speak on the womans entrance oh mrs jones good morning here is your old master mr talbot  mollett of course turned round and found himself confronted with the woman they stared at each other for some moments and then mollett said in a low dull voice yes she knows me it was she that lived with her at tallyho lodge  you remember him now mrs jones dont you said mr prendergast  for another moment or two mrs jones stood silent and then she acknowledged herself overcome and felt that the world around her had become too much for her yes said she slowly i remembers him and then sinking into a chair near the door she put her apron up to her eyes and burst into tears  no doubt about that she remembers me well enough said mollett thinking that this was so much gained on his side but there aint a doubt about the matter at all mr prendergast you look here and youll see it all as plain as black and white and mr mollett dragged a large pocketbook from his coat and took out of it certain documents which he held before mr prendergasts eyes still keeping them in his own hand oh im all right i am said mollett  oh you are are you said the lawyer just glancing at the paper which he would not appear to heed i am glad you think so  if there were any doubt about it shed know said he pointing away up towards the body of the house both mr prendergast and mrs jones understood well who was that she to whom he alluded  you are satisfied at any rate mrs jones said the lawyer but mrs jones had hidden her face in her apron and would not look up she could not understand why this friend of the family should push the matter so dreadfully against them if he would rise from his chair and destroy that wretch who stood before them then indeed he might be called a friend  mr prendergast had now betaken himself to the door and was standing with his back to it and with his hands in his trouserspockets close to the chair on which mrs jones was sitting he had resolved that he would get that womans spoken evidence out of her and he had gotten it but now what was he to do with her nextwith her or with the late mr talbot of tallyho lodge and having satisfied himself of that fact which from the commencement he had never doubted what could he best do to spare the poor lady who was so terribly implicated in this mans presence  mrs jones said he standing over her and gently touching her shoulder i am sorry to have pained you in this way but it was necessary that we should know without a doubt who this man isand who he was truth is always the best you know so good a woman as you cannot but understand that  i suppose it is siri suppose it is said mrs jones through her tears now thoroughly humbled the world was pretty nearly at an end as far as she was concerned here in this very house of castle richmond in sir thomass own room was her ladyships former husband acknowledged as such what further fall of the planet into broken fragments could terrify or drive her from her course more thoroughly than this truth yes truth in the abstract might be very good but such a truth as this how could any one ever say that that was good such was the working of her mind but she took no trouble to express her thoughts  yes continued mr prendergast speaking still in a low voice with a tone that was almost tender truth is always best look at this wretched man here he would have killed the whole familydestroyed them one by onehad they consented to assist him in concealing the fact of his existence the whole truth will now be known and it is very dreadful but it will not be so dreadful as the want of truth  my poor lady my poor lady almost screamed mrs jones from under her apron wagging her head and becoming almost convulsive in her grief  yes it is very sad but you will live to acknowledge that even this is better than living in that mans power  i dont know that said mollett i am not so bad as youd make me i dont want to distress the lady  no not if you are allowed to rob the gentleman till theres not a guinea left for you to suck at i know pretty well the extent of the evil thats in you if we were to kick you from here to cork youd forgive all that so that we still allowed you to go on with your trade i wonder how much money youve had from him altogether  what does the money signify what does the money signify said mrs jones still wagging her head beneath her apron why didnt sir thomas go on paying it and then my lady need know nothing about it  it was clear that mrs jones would not look at the matter in a proper light as far as she could see there was no reason why a fair bargain should not have been made between mollett and sir thomasmade and kept on both sides with mutual convenience that doing of justice at the cost of falling heavens was not intelligible to her limited philosophy nor did she bethink herself that a leech will not give over sucking until it be gorged with blood mr prendergast knew that such leeches as mr mollett never leave the skin as long as there is a drop of blood left within the veins  mr prendergast was still standing against the door where he had placed himself to prevent the unauthorized departure of either mrs jones or mr mollett but now he was bethinking himself that he might as well bring this interview to an end mr mollett said he you are probably beginning to understand that you will not get much more money from the castle richmond family  i dont want to do any harm to any of them said mollett humbly and if i dont make myself troublesome i hope sir thomas will consider me  it is out of your power sir to do any further harm to any of them you dont pretend to think that after what has passed you can have any personal authority over that unfortunate lady  my poor mistress my poor mistress sobbed mrs jones  you cannot do more injury than you at present have done no one is now afraid of you no one here will ever give you another shilling when and in what form you will be prosecuted for inducing sir thomas to give you money i cannot yet tell now you may go and i strongly advise you never to show your face here again if the people about here knew who you are and what you are they would not let you off the property with a whole bone in your skin now go sir do you hear me  upon my word mr prendergast i have not intended any harm  go sir  and even now mr prendergast it can all be made straight and i will leave the country altogether if you wish it  go sir shouted mr prendergast if you do not move at once i will ring the bell for the servants  then if misfortune comes upon them it is your doing and not mine said mollett  oh mr pendrergrass if it can be hushed up said mrs jones rising from her chair and coming up to him with her hands clasped together dont send him away in your anger dontee now sir think of her ladyship do do do and the woman took hold of his arm and looked up into his face with her eyes swimming with tears then going to the door she closed it and returning again touched his arm and again appealed to him think of mr herbert sir and the young ladies what are they to be called sir if this man is to be my ladys husband oh mr pendrergrass let him go away out of the kingdom do let him go away  ill be off to australia by the next boat if youll only say the word said mollett to give him his due he was not at that moment thinking altogether of himself and of what he might get the idea of the misery which he had brought on these people did to a certain measure come home to him and it certainly did come home to him also that his own position was very perilous  mrs jones said the lawyer seeming to pay no attention whatever to molletts words you know nothing of such men as that if i were to take him at his word now he would turn upon sir thomas again before three weeks were over  by  i would not by all that is holy i would not mr prendergast do  mr mollett i will trouble you to walk out of this house i have nothing further to say to you  oh very well sir and then slowly mollett took his departure and finding his covered car at the door got into it without saying another word to any of the castle richmond family  mrs jones said mr prendergast as soon as mollett was gone i believe i need not trouble you any further your conduct has done you great honour and i respect you greatly as an honest woman and an affectionate friend  mrs jones could only acknowledge this by loud sobs  for the present if you will take my advice you will say nothing of this to your mistress  no sir no i shall say nothing oh dear oh dear  the whole matter will be known soon but in the mean time we may as well remain silent good day to you and then mrs jones also left the room and mr prendergast was alone     chapter xxi  fair arguments   as mollett left the house he saw two men walking down the road away from the sweep before the hall door and as he passed them he recognised one as the young gentleman of the house he also saw that a horse followed behind them on the grass by the roadside not led by the hand but following with the reins laid loose upon his neck they took no notice of him or his car but allowed him to pass as though he had no concern whatever with the destinies of either of them they were herbert and owen fitzgerald  the reader will perhaps remember the way in which owen left desmond court on the occasion of his last visit there it cannot be said that what he had heard had in any way humbled him nor indeed had it taught him to think that clara desmond looked at him altogether with indifference greatly as she had injured him he could not bring himself to look upon her as the chief sinner it was lady desmond who had done it all it was she who had turned against him because of his poverty who had sold her daughter to his rich cousin and robbed him of the love which he had won for himself or perhaps not of the loveit might be that this was yet his and if so was it not possible that he might beat the countess at her own weapons thinking over this he felt that it was necessary for him to do something to take some step and therefore he resolved to go boldly to his cousin and tell him that he regarded lady clara desmond as still his own  on this morning therefore he had ridden up to the castle richmond door it was now many months since he had been there and he was no longer entitled to enter the house on the acknowledged intimate footing of a cousin he rode up and asked the servant with grave ceremony whether mr herbert fitzgerald were at home he would not go in he said but if mr herbert were there he would wait for him at the porch herbert at the time was standing in the diningroom all alone gloomily leaning against the mantelpiece there was nothing for him to do during the whole of that day but wait for the evening when the promised revelation would be made to him he knew that mollett and mrs jones were with mr prendergast in the study but what was the matter now being investigated between themthat he did not know and till he knew that closely as he was himself concerned he could meddle with nothing but it was already past noon and the evening would soon be there  in this mood he was interrupted by being told that his cousin owen was at the door he wont come in at all mr herbert richard had said for richard according to order was still waiting about the porch but he says that you are to go to him there and then herbert after considering the matter for a moment joined his cousin at the front entrance  i want to speak to you a few words said owen but as i hear that sir thomas is not well i will not go into the house perhaps you will walk with me as far as the lodge never mind the mare she will not go astray and so herbert got his hat and accompanied him for the first hundred yards neither of them said anything owen would not speak of clara till he was well out of hearing from the house and at the present moment herbert had not much inclination to commence a conversation on any subject  owen was the first to speak herbert said he i have been told that you are engaged to marry lady clara desmond  and so i am said herbert feeling very little inclined to admit of any question as to his privilege in that respect things were happening around him which might haveheaven only knows what consequence he did fearfear with a terrible dread that something might occur which would shatter the cup of his happiness and rob him of the fruition of his hopes but nothing had occurred as yet and so i am he said it is no wonder that you should have heard it for it has been kept no secret and i also have heard of your visit to desmond court it might have been as well i think if you had stayed away  i thought differently said owen frowning blackly i thought that the most straightforward thing for me was to go there openly having announced my intention and tell them both mother and daughter that i hold myself as engaged to lady clara and that i hold her as engaged to me  that is absurd nonsense she cannot be engaged to two persons  anything that interferes with you you will of course think absurd i think otherwise it is hardly more than twelve months since she and i were walking there together and then she promised me her love i had known her long and well when you had hardly seen her i knew her and loved her and what is more she loved me remember it is not i only that say so she said it herself and swore that nothing should change her i do not believe that anything has changed her  do you mean to say that at present she cares nothing for me owen you must be mad on this matter  mad yes of course if i think that any girl can care for me while you are in the way strange as it may appear i am as mad even as that there are people who will not sell themselves even for money and titles i say again that i do not believe her to be changed she has been weak and her mother has persuaded her to her mother rank and money titles and property are everything she has sold her daughter and i have come to ask you whether under such circumstances you intend to accept the purchase  in his ordinary mood herbert fitzgerald was by no means a quarrelsome man indeed we may go further than that and say that he was very much the reverse his mind was argumentative rather than impulsive and in all matters he was readier to persuade than overcome but his ordinary nature had been changed it was quite new with him to be nervous and fretful but he was so at the present moment he was deeply concerned in the circumstances around him but yet had been allowed no voice in them in this affair that was so peculiarly his ownthis of his promised bride he was determined that no voice should be heard but his own and now contrary to his wont he was ready enough to quarrel with his cousin  of owen we may say that he was a man prone to fighting of all sorts and on all occasions by fighting i do not mean the oldfashioned resource of putting an end to fighting by the aid of two pistols which were harmless in nineteen cases out of twenty in saying that owen fitzgerald was prone to fight i do not allude to fighting of that sort i mean that he was impulsive and ever anxious to contend and conquer to yield was to him ignoble even though he might know that he was yielding to the right to strive for mastery was to him noble even though he strove against those who had a right to rule and strove on behalf of the wrong such was the nature of his mind and spirit and this nature had impelled him to his present enterprise at castle richmond but he had gone thither with an unwonted resolve not to be passionate he had he had said to himself right on his side and he had purposed to argue it out fairly with his more coldblooded cousin the reader may probably guess the result of these fair arguments on such a subject and i have come to ask you he said whether under such circumstances you intend to accept the purchase  i will not allow you to speak of lady desmond in such language nor of her daughter said herbert angrily  ah but herbert you must allow me i have been ill used in this matter and i have a right to make myself heard  is it i that have ill used you i did not know before that gentlemen made loud complaints of such ill usage from the hands of ladies  if the ill usage as you please to call it  it is your own word  very well if this ill usage came from clara desmond herself i should be the last person to complain of it and you would be the last person to whom i should make complaint but i feel sure that it is not so she is acting under the influence of her mother who has frightened her into this thing which she is doing i do not believe that she is false herself  i am sure that she is not false we are quite agreed there but it is not likely that we should agree further to tell you the truth frankly i think you are illjudged to speak to me on such a topic  perhaps in that respect you will allow me to think for myself but i have not yet said that which i came to say my belief is that unfair and improper restraint is put upon clara desmond that she has been induced by her mother to accept your offer in opposition to her own wishes and that therefore it is my duty to look upon her as still betrothed to me i do so regard her and shall act under such conviction the first thing that i do therefore is to call upon you to relinquish your claim  what to give her up  yes to give her upto acknowledge that you cannot honestly call upon her to fulfil her pledge to you  the man must be raving herbert said  very probably but remember this it may be that he will rave to some purpose when such insolence will be but of little avail to you raving yes i suppose that a man poor as i am must be mad indeed to set his heart upon anything that you may choose to fancy  all that is nonsense owen i ask for nothing but my own i won her love fairly and i mean to keep it firmly  you may possibly have won her hand but never her heart you are rich and it may be that even she will condescend to barter her hand but i doubt it i altogether doubt it it is her mothers doing as it was plain enough for me to see the other day at desmond court but much as she may fear her mother i cannot think that she will go to the altar with a lie in her mouth  and then they walked on in silence for a few yards herbert was anxious to get back to the house and was by no means desirous of continuing this conversation with his cousin he at any rate could get nothing by talking about lady clara desmond to owen fitzgerald he stopped therefore on the path and said that if owen had nothing further to say he herbert would go back to the house  nothing further nothing further if you understand me but you do not you are not honest enough in this matter to understand any purpose but your own  i tell you what owen i did not come out here to hear myself abused and i will not stand it according to my idea you had no right whatever to speak to me about lady clara desmond but you are my cousin and therefore i have borne it it may be as well that we should both understand that it is once for all i will not listen to you again on the same subject  oh you wont upon my word you are a very great man you will tell me next i suppose that this is your demesne and will warn me off  even if i did that i should not be wrong under such provocation  very well sir then i will go off but remember this herbert fitzgerald you shall live to rue the day when you treated me with such insolence and remember this also clara desmond is not your wife as yet everything now seems happy with you and fortunate you have wealth and a fine house and a family round you while i am there all alone left like a dog as far as my own relatives are concerned but yet it may come to pass that the earl of desmonds daughter will prefer my hand to yours and my house to your house they who mount high may chance to get a fall and then having uttered this caution he turned to his mare and putting his hand upon the saddle jumped into his seat and pressing her into a gallop darted off across the grass  he had not meant anything specially by his threat but his heart was sore within him during some weeks past he had become sick of the life that he was leading he had begun to hate his own solitary househis house that was either solitary or filled with riot and noise he sighed for the quiet hours that were once his at desmond court and the privilege of constant entrance there which was now denied him his cousin herbert had everything at his commandwealth station family ties society and all the consideration of high place every blessing was at the feet of the young heir but every blessing was not enough unless clara desmond was also added all this seemed so cruel to him as he sat alone in his parlour at hap house meditating on his future course of life and then he would think of claras promise of her assurance that nothing should frighten her from her pledge he thought of this as though the words had been spoken to him only yesterday he pondered over these things till he hated his cousin herbert and hating him he vowed that clara desmond should not be his wife is he to have everything he would say to himself no by heavens not everything he has enough and may be contented but he shall not have all and now with similar thoughts running through his mind he rode back to hap house  and herbert turned back to castle richmond as he approached the front door he met mr prendergast who was leaving the house but they had no conversation with each other herbert was in hopes that he might now at once be put out of suspense mollett was gone and would it not be better that the tale should be told but it was clear that mr prendergast had no intention of lessening by an hour the interval he had given himself he merely muttered a few words passing on and herbert went into the house  and then there was another long tedious dull afternoon herbert sat with his sisters but they had not the heart to talk to each other at about four a note was brought to him it was from mr prendergast begging herbert to meet him in sir thomass study at eight sir thomas had not been there during the day and now did not intend to leave his own room they dined at halfpast six and the appointment was therefore to take place almost immediately after dinner  tell mr prendergast that i will be there he said to the servant and so that afternoon passed away and the dinner also very slowly and very sadly     chapter xxii  the telling of the tale   the dinner passed away as the former dinners had done and as soon as aunt letty got up mr prendergast also rose and touching herbert on his shoulder whispered into his ear youll come to me at eight then herbert nodded his head and when he was alone he looked at his watch these slow dinners were not actually very long and there still remained to him some threequarters of an hour for anticipation  what was to be the nature of this history that it would affect himself personally in the closest manner he could not but know there seemed to be no doubt on the minds of any of them that the affair was one of money and his fathers money questions were his money questions mr prendergast would not have been sent for with reference to any trifle nor would any pecuniary difficulty that was not very serious have thrown his father into such a state of misery could it be that the fair inheritance was absolutely in danger  herbert fitzgerald was by no means a selfish man as regarded himself he could have met ruin in the face with more equanimity than most young men so circumstanced the gilt of the world had not eaten into his soul his heart was not as yet wedded to the splendour of pinchbeck this is saying much for him for how seldom is it that the hearts and souls of the young are able to withstand pinchbeck and gilding he was free from this pusillanimity free as yet as regarded himself but he was hardly free as regarded his betrothed he had promised her not in spoken words but in his thoughts rank wealth and all the luxuries of his promised high position and now on her behalf it nearly broke his heart to think that they might be endangered  of his mothers history he can hardly be said to have known anything that there had been something tragic in her early life that something had occurred before his fathers marriage and that his mother had been married twice he had learnedhe hardly knew when or from whom but on such matters there had never been conversation between him and any of his own family and it never occurred to him that all this sorrow arose in any way from this subject that his father had taken some fatal step with regard to the propertyhad done some foolish thing for which he could not forgive himself that was the idea with which his mind was filled  he waited with his watch in his hand till the dial showed him that it was exactly eight and then with a sinking heart he walked slowly out of the diningroom along the passage and into his fathers study for an instant he stood with the handle in his hand he had been terribly anxious for the arrival of this moment but now that it had come he would almost fain have had it again postponed his heart sank very low as he turned the lock and entering found himself in the presence of mr prendergast  mr prendergast was standing with his back to the fire for him too the last hour had been full of bitterness his heart also had sunk low within him his blood had run cold within his veins he too had it been possible would have put off this wretched hour  mr prendergast it may be was not much given to poetry but the feeling if not the words were there within him the work which a friend has to perform for a friend is so much heavier than that which comes in the way of any profession  when herbert entered the room mr prendergast came forward from where he was standing and took him by the hand this is a very sad affair he said very sad  at present i know nothing about it said herbert as i see people about me so unhappy i suppose it is sad if there be anything that i hate it is a mystery  sit down mr fitzgerald said the other sit down and mr prendergast himself sat down in the chair that was ordinarily occupied by sir thomas although he had been thinking about it all the day he had not even yet made up his mind how he was to begin his story even now he could not help thinking whether it might be possible for him to leave it untold but it was not possible  mr fitzgerald said he you must prepare yourself for tidings which are very grievous indeedvery grievous  whatever it is i must bear it said he  i hope you have that moral strength which enables a man to bear misfortune i have not known you in happy days and therefore perhaps can hardly judge but it seems to me that you do possess such courage did i not think so i could hardly go through the task that is before me  here he paused as though he expected some reply some assurance that his young friend did possess this strength of which he spoke but herbert said nothingnothing out loud if it were only for myself if it were only for myself it was thus that he spoke to his own heart  mr fitzgerald continued the lawyer i do not know how far you may be acquainted with the history of your mothers first marriage  herbert said that he was hardly acquainted with it in any degree and explained that he merely knew the fact that his mother had been married before she met sir thomas  i do not know that i need recount all the circumstances to you now though doubtless you will learn them your mothers conduct throughout was i believe admirable  i am quite sure of that no amount of evidence could make me believe the contrary  and there is no tittle of evidence to make any one think so but in her early youth when she was quite a child she was given in marriage to a manto a man of whom it is impossible to speak in terms too black or in language too strong and now this day  but here he paused it had been his intention to say that that very man the first husband of this loved mother now looked upon as dead for so many years this miscreant of whom he had spokenthat this man had been in that room that very day but he hardly knew how to frame the words  well said herbert well and he spoke in a hoarse voice that was scarcely audible  mr prendergast was afraid to bring out the very pith of his story in so abrupt a manner he wished to have the work over to feel that as regarded herbert it was donebut his heart failed him when he came to it  yes he said going back as it were to his former thoughts a heartless cruel debauched unscrupulous man one in whose bosom no good thing seemed to have been implanted your father when he first knew your mother had every reason to believe that this man was dead  and he was not dead mr prendergast could see that the young mans face became perfectly pale as he uttered these words he became pale and clutched hold of the table with his hand and there sat with mouth open and staring eyes  i am afraid not said mr prendergast i am afraid not  and  i must go further than that and tell you that he is still living  mr prendergast mr prendergast exclaimed the poor fellow rising up from his chair and shouting out as though for mercy mr prendergast also rose from his seat and coming up to him took him by the arm my dear boy my dear boy i am obliged to tell you it is necessary that you should know it the fact is as i say and it is now for you to show that you are a man  who was ever called upon for a stronger proof of manhood than this in nine cases out of ten it is not for oneself that one has to be brave a man we may almost say is no man whose own individual sufferings call for the exercise of much courage but we are all so mixed up and conjoined with otherswith others who are weaker and dearer than ourselves that great sorrows do require great powers of endurance  by degrees as he stood there in silence the whole truth made its way into his mindas he stood there with his arm still tenderly pressed by that old man no one now would have called the lawyer stern in looking at him for the tears were coursing down his cheeks but no tears came to the relief of young fitzgerald as the truth slowly came upon him fold by fold black cloud upon cloud till the whole horizon of his lifes prospect was dark as death he stood there silent for some few minutes hardly conscious that he was not alone as he saw all his joys disappearing from before his minds eye one by one his family pride the pleasant hightoned duties of his station his promised seat in parliament and prosperous ambition the full respect of all the world around him his wealth and pride of placefor let no man be credited who boasts that he can part with these without regret all these were gone but there were losses more bitter than these how could he think of his affianced bride and how could he think of his mother  no tears came to his relief while the truth with all its bearings burnt itself into his very soul but his face expressed such agony that it was terrible to be seen mr prendergast could stand that silence no longer so at last he spoke he spokefor the sake of words for all his tale had been told  you saw the man that was here yesterday that was he who then called himself talbot  what the man that went away in the car mollett  yes that was the man  herbert had said that no evidence could be sufficient to make him believe that his mother had been in any way culpable and such probably was the case he had that reliance on his motherthat assurance in his mind that everything coming from her must be goodthat he could not believe her capable of ill but nevertheless he could not prevent himself from asking within his own breast how it had been possible that his mother should ever have been concerned with such a wretch as that it was a question which could not fail to make itself audible what being on earth was sweeter than his mother more excellent more noble more fitted for the worlds high places more absolutely entitled to that universal respect which seemed to be given to her as her own by right and what being could be more loathsome more contemptible than he who was as he was now told his mothers husband there was in it a want of verisimilitude which almost gave him comfortwhich almost taught him to think that he might disbelieve the story that was told to him poor fellow he had yet to learn the difference that years may make in men and womenfor better as well as for worse circumstances had given to the poor halfeducated village girl the simple dignity of high station as circumstances had also brought to the lowest dregs of human existence the man whose personal bearing and apparent worldly standing had been held sufficient to give warrant that he was of gentle breeding and of honest standing nay her good fortune in such a marriage had once been almost begrudged her by all her maiden neighbours  but herbert as he thought of this was almost encouraged to disbelieve the story to him with his knowledge of what his mother was and such knowledge as he also had of that man it did not seem possible but how is all this known he muttered forth at last  i fear there is no doubt of its truth said mr prendergast your father has no doubt whatever has had nonei must tell you this plainlyfor some months  for some months and why have i not been told  do not be hard upon your father  hard no of course i would not be hard upon him  the burden he has had to bear has been very terrible he has thought that by payments of money to this man the whole thing might be concealed as is always the case when such payments are made the insatiable love of money grew by what it fed on he would have poured out every shilling into that mans hands and would have died himself a beggarhave died speedily too under such tormentsand yet no good would have been done the harpy would have come upon you and youafter you had innocently assumed a title that was not your own and taken a property to which you have no right you then would have had to ownthat which your father must own now  if it be so said herbert slowly it must be acknowledged  just so mr fitzgerald just so i know you will feel thatin such matters we can only sail safely by the truth there is no other compass worth a mans while to look at  of course not said herbert with hoarse voice one does not wish to be a robber and a thief my cousin shall have what is his own and then he involuntarily thought of the interview they had had on that very day but why did he not tell me when i spoke to him of her he said with something approaching to bitterness in his voice and a slight struggle in his throat that was almost premonitory of a sob  ah it is there that i fear for you i know what your feelings are but think of his sorrows and do not be hard on him  ah me ah me exclaimed herbert  i fear that he will not be with you long he has already endured till he is now almost past the power of suffering more and yet there is so much more that he must suffer  my poor father  think what such as he must have gone through in bringing himself into contact with that man and all this has been done that he might spare you and your mother think of the wound to his conscience before he would have lowered himself to an unworthy bargain with a swindler but this has been done that you might have that which you have been taught to look on as your own he has been wrong no other verdict can be given but you at any rate can be tender to such a fault you and your mother  i willi will said herbert but if it had happened a month since i could have borne it and then he thought of his mother and hated himself for what he had said how could he have borne that with patience and there is no doubt you say  i think none the man carries his proofs with him an old servant here in the house too knows him  what mrs jones  yes mrs jones and the burden of further proof must now of course be thrown on usnot on him directly that we believe the statement it is for us to ascertain its truth you and your father must not be seen to hold a false position before the world  and what are we to do now  i fear that your mother must be told and mr owen fitzgerald and then we must together openly prove the facts either in one way or in the other it will be better that we should do this togetherthat is you and your cousin owen conjointly do it openly before the worldso that the world may know that each of you desires only what is honestly his own for myself i tell you fairly that i have no doubt of the truth of what i have told you but further proof is certainly needed had i any doubt i would not propose to tell your mother as it is i think it will be wrong to keep her longer in the dark  does she suspect nothing  i do not know she has more power of selfcontrol than your father she has not spoken to me ten words since i have been in the house and in not doing so i have thought that she was right  my own mother my dear mother  if you ask me my opinion i think that she does suspect the truthvery vaguely with an indefinite feeling that the calamity which weighs so heavily on your father has come from this source she dear lady is greatly to be pitied but god has made her of firmer material than your father and i think that she will bear her sorrow with a higher courage  and she is to be told also  yes i think so i do not see how we can avoid it if we do not tell her we must attempt to conceal it and that attempt must needs be futile when we are engaged in making open inquiry on the subject your cousin when he hears of this will of course be anxious to know what his real prospects are  yes yes he will be anxious and determined too  and then when all the world will know it how is your mother to be kept in the dark and that which she fears and anticipates is as bad probably as the actual truth if my advice be followed nothing will be kept from her  we are in your hands i suppose mr prendergast  i can only act as my judgment directs me  and who is to tell her this he asked with a shudder and almost in a whisper the very idea of undertaking such a duty seemed almost too much for him and yet he must undertake a duty almost as terrible he himselfno one but himmust endure the anguish of repeating this story to clara desmond and to the countess but now the question had reference to his own mother and who is to tell her he asked  for a moment or two mr prendergast stood silent he had not hitherto in so many words undertaken this taskthis that would be the most dreadful of all but if he did not undertake it who would i suppose that i must do it at last he said very gently  and when  as soon as i have told your cousin i will go down to him tomorrow after breakfast is it probable that i shall find him at home  yes if you are there before ten the hounds meet tomorrow at cecilstown within three miles of him and he will not leave home till near eleven but it is possible that he may have a house full of men with him  at any rate i will try on such an occasion as this he may surely let his friends go to the hunt without him  and then between nine and ten this interview came to an end mr fitzgerald said mr prendergast as he pressed herberts hand you have borne all this as a man should do no loss of fortune can ruin one who is so well able to endure misfortune but in this mr prendergast was perhaps mistaken his knowledge of human nature had not carried him sufficiently far a mans courage under calamity is only tested when he is left in solitude the meanest among us can bear up while strange eyes are looking at us and then mr prendergast went away and he was alone  it had been his habit during the whole of this period of his fathers illness to go to sir thomas at or before bedtime these visits had usually been made to the study the room in which he was now standing but when his father had gone to his bedroom at an earlier hour herbert had always seen him there was he to go to him nownow that he had heard all this and if so how was he to bear himself there in his fathers presence he stood still thinking of this till the hand of the clock showed him that it was past ten and then it struck him that his father might be waiting for him it would not do for him now at such a moment to appear wanting in that attention which he had always shown he was still his fathers son though he had lost the right to bear his fathers name he was nameless now a man utterly without respect or standingplace in the world a being whom the law ignored except as the possessor of a mere life such was he now instead of one whose rights and privileges whose property and rank all the statutes of the realm and customs of his country delighted to honour and protect this he repeated to himself over and over again it was to such a pass as this to this bitter disappointment that his father had brought him but yet it should not be said of him that he had begun to neglect his father as soon as he had heard the story  so with a weary step he walked up stairs and found sir thomas in bed with his mother sitting by the bedside his mother held out her hand to him and he took it leaning against the bedside has mr prendergast left you she asked  he told her that mr prendergast had left him and gone to his own room for the night and have you been with him all the evening she asked she had no special motive in so asking but both the father and the son shuddered at the question yes said herbert i have been with him and now i have come to wish my father good night and you too mother if you intend to remain here but lady fitzgerald got up telling herbert that she would leave him with sir thomas and before either of them could hinder her from departing the father and the son were alone together  sir thomas when the door closed looked furtively up into his sons face might it be that he could read there how much had been already told or how much still remained to be disclosed that herbert was to learn it all that evening he knew but it might be that mr prendergast had failed to perform his task sir thomas in his heart trusted that he had failed he looked up furtively into herberts face but at the moment there was nothing there that he could read there was nothing there but black misery and every face round him for many days past had worn that aspect  for a minute or two herbert said nothing for he had not made up his mind whether or no he would that night disturb his fathers rest but he could not speak in his ordinary voice or bid his father goodnight as though nothing special to him had happened father said he after a short pause father i know it all now  my boy my poor boy my unfortunate boy  father said herbert do not be unhappy about me i can bear it and then he thought again of his bridehis bride as she was to have been but nevertheless he repeated his last words i can bear it father  i have meant it for the best herbert said the poor man pleading to his child  i know that all of us well know that but what mr prendergast says is true it is better that it should be known that man would have killed you had you kept it longer to yourself  sir thomas hid his face upon the pillow as the remembrance of what he had endured in those meetings came upon him the blow that had told heaviest was that visit from the son and the threats which the man had made still rung in his earswhen that youngster was born lady f was mrs m wasnt she    my governor could take her away tomorrow according to the law of the land couldnt he now these words and more such as these had nearly killed him at the time and now as they recurred to him he burst out into childish tears poor man the days of his manhood had gone and nothing but the tears of a second bitter childhood remained to him the hot iron had entered into his soul and shrivelled up the very muscles of his minds strength  herbert without much thought of what he was doing knelt down by the bedside and put his hand upon that of his father which lay out upon the sheet there he knelt for one or two minutes watching and listening to his fathers sobs you will be better now father he said for the great weight of this terrible secret will be off your mind but sir thomas did not answer him with him there could never be any better all things belonging to him had gone to ruin all those around him whom he had lovedand he had loved those around him very dearlywere brought to poverty and sorrow and disgrace the power of feeling this was left to him but the power of enduring this with manhood was gone the blow had come upon him too late in life  and herbert himself as he knelt there could hardly forbear from tears now at such a moment as this he could think of no one but his father the author of his being who lay there so grievously afflicted by sorrows which were in nowise selfish father he said at last will you pray with me and then when the poor sufferer had turned his face towards him he poured forth his prayer to his saviour that they all in that family might be enabled to bear the heavy sorrows which god in his mercy and wisdom had now thought fit to lay upon them i will not make his words profane by repeating them here but one may say confidently that they were not uttered in vain  and now dearest father good night he said as he rose from his knees and stretching over the bed he kissed his fathers forehead     chapter xxiii  before breakfast at hap house   it may be imagined that mr molletts drive back to cork after his last visit to castle richmond had not been very pleasant and indeed it may be said that his present circumstances altogether were as unpleasant as his worst enemies could desire i have endeavoured to excite the sympathy of those who are going with me through this story for the sufferings of that family of the fitzgeralds but how shall i succeed in exciting their sympathy for this other family of the molletts and yet why not if we are to sympathise only with the good or worse still only with the graceful how little will there be in our character that is better than terrestrial those molletts also were human and had strings to their hearts at which the world would now probably pull with sufficient vigour for myself i can truly say that my strongest feeling is for their wretchedness  the father and son had more than once boasted among themselves that the game they were now playing was a high one that they were in fact gambling for mighty stakes and in truth as long as the money came in to themflowing in as the result of their own craft in this gamethe excitement had about it something that was very pleasurable there was danger which makes all games pleasant there was money in handfuls for daily expensesthose daily wants of the appetite which are to such men more important by far than the distant necessities of life there was a possibility of future grandeur an opening out of magnificent ideas of fortune which charmed them greatly as they thought about it what might they not do with forty thousand pounds divided between them or even with a thousand a year each settled on them for life and surely their secret was worth that money nay was it not palpable to the meanest calculation that it was worth much more had they not the selling of twelve thousand a year for ever and ever to this family of fitzgerald  but for the last fortnight things had begun to go astray with them money easily come by goes easily and money badly come by goes badly theirs had come easily and badly and had so gone what necessity could there be for economy with such a milchcow as that close to their elbows so both of them had thought if not argued and there had been no economyno economy in the use of that very costly amusement the dicebox and now at the present moment ready money having failed to be the result of either of the two last visits to castle richmond the family funds were running low  it may be said that ready money for the moment was the one desire nearest to the heart of mollett p√®re when he took that last journey over the boggeragh mountainsready money wherewith to satisfy the pressing claims of miss odwyer and bring back civility or rather servility to the face and manner of tom the waiter at the kanturk hotel very little of that servility can be enjoyed by persons of the mollett class when money ceases to be ready in their hands and pockets and there is perhaps nothing that they enjoy so keenly as servility mollett p√®re had gone down determined that that comfort should at any rate be forthcoming to him whatever answer might be given to those other grander demands and we know what success had attended his mission he had looked to find his tame milchcow trembling in her accustomed stall and he had found a resolute bull there in her placea bull whom he could by no means take by the horns he had got no money and before he had reached cork he had begun to comprehend that it was not probable that he should get more from that source  during a part of the interview between him and mr prendergast some spark of mercy towards his victims had glimmered into his heart when it was explained to him that the game was to be given up that the family at castle richmond was prepared to acknowledge the truth and that the effort made was with the view of proving that the poor lady up stairs was not entitled to the name she bore rather than that she was so entitled then some slight promptings of a better spirit did for a while tempt him to be merciful oh what are you about to do he would have said had mr prendergast admitted of speech from him why make this terrible sacrifice matters have not come to that there is no need for you to drag to the light this terrible fact i will not divulge itno not although you are hard upon me in regard to these terms of mine i will still keep it to myself and trust to youto you who are all so rich and able to pay for what consideration you may please to give me this was the state of his mind when mrs joness evidence was being slowly evoked from her but it had undergone a considerable change before he reached cork by that time he had taught himself to understand that there was no longer a chance to him of any consideration whatever slowly he had brought it home to himself that these people had resolutely determined to blow up the ground on which they themselves stood this he perceived was their honesty he did not understand the nature of a feeling which could induce so fatal a suicide but he did understand that the feeling was there and that the suicide would be completed  and now what was he to do next in the way of earning his bread various thoughts ran through his brain and different resolveshalfformed but still perhaps capable of shapepresented themselves to him for the future it was still on the cardson the cards but barely sothat he might make money out of these people but he must wait perhaps for weeks before he again commenced such an attempt he might perhaps make money out of them and be merciful to them at the same timenot money by thousands and tens of thousands that golden dream was gone for ever but still money that might be comfortably luxurious as long as it could be made to last but then on one special point he made a firm and final resolutionwhatever new scheme he might hatch he alone would manage never again would he call into his councils that son of his loins whose rapacious greed had as he felt sure brought upon him all this ruin had aby not gone to castle richmond with his cruelty and his greed frightening to the very death the soul of that poor baronet by the enormity of his demands mr prendergast would not have been there of what further chance of castle richmond pickings there might be aby should know nothing he and his son would no longer hunt in couples he would shake him off in that escape which they must both now make from cork and he would not care how long it might be before he again saw his countenance  but then that question of ready money and that other question perhaps as interesting touching a criminal prosecution how was he to escape if he could not raise the wind and how could he raise the wind now that his milchcow had run so dry he had promised the odwyers money that evening and had struggled hard to make that promise with an easy face he now had none to give them his orders at the inn were treated almost with contempt for the last three days they had given him what he wanted to eat and drink but would hardly give him all that he wanted when he called for brandy they brought him whisky and it had only been by hard begging and by oaths as to the promised money that he had induced them to supply him with the car which had taken him on his fruitless journey to castle richmond as he was driven up to the door in south main street his heart was very sad on all these subjects  aby was again sitting within the bar but was no longer basking in the sunshine of fannys smiles he was sitting there because fanny had not yet mustered courage to turn him out he was halfdrunk for it had been found impossible to keep spirits from him and there had been hot words between him and fanny in which she had twitted him with his unpaid bill and he had twitted her with her former love and things had gone from bad to worse and she had all but called in tom for aid in getting quit of him she had however refrained thinking of the money that might be coming and waiting also till her father should arrive fannys love for mr abraham mollett had not been long lived  i will not describe another scene such as those which had of late been frequent in the kanturk hotel the father and the son soon found themselves together in the small room in which they now both slept at the top of the house and aby tipsy as he was understood the whole of what had happened at castle richmond when he heard that mr prendergast was seen in that room in lieu of sir thomas he knew at once that the game had been abandoned but something may yet be done at appy ouse aby said to himself only one must be deuced quick  the father and the son of course quarrelled frightfully like dogs over the memory of a bone which had been arrested from the jaws of both of them aby said that his father had lost everything by his pusillanimity and old mollett declared that his son had destroyed all by his rashness but we need not repeat their quarrels nor repeat all that passed between them and tom before food was forthcoming to satisfy the old mans wants as he ate he calculated how much he might probably raise upon his watch towards taking him to london and how best he might get off from cork without leaving any scent in the nostrils of his son his clothes he must leave behind him at the inn at least all that he could not pack upon his person lately he had made himself comfortable in this respect and he sorrowed over the fine linen which he had worn but once or twice since it had been bought with the last instalment from sir thomas nevertheless in this way he did make up his mind for the morrows campaign  and aby also made up his mind something at any rate he had learned from fanny odwyer in return for his honeyed words when herbert fitzgerald should cease to be the heir to castle richmond owen fitzgerald of hap house would be the happy man that knowledge was his own in absolute independence of his father and there might still be time for him to use it he knew well the locality of hap house and he would be there early on the following morning these tidings had probably not as yet reached the owner of that blessed abode and if he could be the first to tell him the game there too might be pretty enough if it were played well by such a masterhand as his own yes he would be at hap house early in the morningbut then how to get there  he left his father preparing for bed and going down into the bar found mr odwyer and his daughter there in close consultation they were endeavouring to arrive by their joint wisdom at some conclusion as to what they should do with their two guests fanny was for turning them out at once the first loss is the least said she and they is so disrispectable i niver know what theyre afther and always is expecting the plice will be down on them but the father shook his head he had done nothing wrong the police could not hurt him and thirty pounds as he told his daughter with much emphasis was a deuced sight of money the first loss is the least said fanny perseveringly and then aby entered to them  my father has made a mull of this matter again said he going at once into the middle of the subject e as come back without a shiner  ill be bound he has said mr odwyer sarcastically  and that when ed only got to go two or three miles further and hall his troubles would have been over  troubles over would they said fanny i wish hed have the goodness to get over his little troubles in this house by paying us our bill youll have to walk if its not done and that tomorrow mr mollett and so i tell you and take nothing with you i can tell you father ll have the police to see to that  dont you be so cruel now miss fanny said aby with a leering look i tell you what it is mr odwyer i must go down again to them diggings very early tomorrow starting say at four oclock  youll not have a foot out of my stables said mr odwyer thats all  look here mr odwyer theres been a sight of money due to us from those fitzgerald people down there you know em and whether theyre hable to pay or not i wont deny but what fathers ad the best of itad the best of it and sent it trolling bad luck to him but theres no good looking hafter spilt milk is there  if so be that sir thomas owed the likes of you money he would have paid it without your tramping down there time after time to look for it hes not one of that sort  no indeed said fanny and i dont believe anything about your seeing sir thomas  oh weve seed him hoften enough theres no mistake about that but now and then with a mysterious air and low voice he explained to them that this considerable balance of money still due to them was to be paid by the cousin mr owen of appy ouse and to substantiate all his story he exhibited a letter from mr prendergast to his father which some months since had intimated that a sum of money would be paid on behalf of sir thomas fitzgerald if mr mollett would call at mr prendergasts office at a certain hour the ultimate effect of all this was that the car was granted for the morning with certain dire threats as to any further breach of engagement  very early on the following morning aby was astir hoping that he might manage to complete his not elaborate toilet without disturbing his fathers slumbers for it must be known he had been very urgent with the odwyers as to the necessity of keeping this journey of his a secret from his governor but the governor was wide awake looking at him out of the corner of his closed eye whenever his back was turned and not caring much what he was about to do with himself mollett p√®re wished to be left alone for that morning that he also might play his little game in his own solitary fashion and was not at all disposed to question the movements of his son  at about five aby started for hap house his toilet i have said was not elaborate but in this i have perhaps wronged him up there in the bedroom he did not waste much time over his soap and water but he was aware that first impressions are everything and that one young man should appear smart and clever before another if he wished to carry any effect with him so he took his brush and comb in his pocket and a pot of grease with which he was wont to polish his long sidelocks and he hurriedly grasped up his pins and his rings and the satin stock which fanny in her kinder mood had folded for him and then during his long journey to hap house he did perform a toilet which may perhaps be fairly called elaborate  there was a long tortuous narrow avenue going from the mallow and kanturk road down to hap house which impressed aby with the idea that the man on whom he was now about to call was also a big gentleman and made him more uneasy than he would have been had he entered a place with less pretence there is a story current that in the west of england the grandeur of middleaged maiden ladies is measured by the length of the tail of their cats and aby had a perhaps equally correct idea that the length of the private drive up to a gentlemans house was a fair criterion of the splendour of his position if this man had about him as much grandeur as sir thomas himself would he be so anxious as aby had hoped to obtain the additional grandeur of sir thomas it was in that direction that his mind was operating when he got down from the car and rang at the doorbell  mr owen as everybody called him was at home but not down and so aby was shown into the diningroom it was now considerably past nine and the servant told him that his master must be there soon as he had to eat his breakfast and be at the hunt by eleven the servant at hap house was more unsophisticated than those at castle richmond and abys personal adornments had had their effect he found himself sitting in the room with the cups and saucersaye and with the silver teaspoons and began again to trust that his mission might be successful  and then the door opened and a man appeared clad from top to toe in hunting costume this was not owen fitzgerald but his friend captain donnellan as it had happened captain donnellan was the only guest who had graced the festivities of hap house on the previous evening and now he appeared at the breakfast table before his host aby got up from his chair when the gentleman entered and was proceeding to business but the captain gave him to understand that the master of the house was not yet in presence and so aby sat down again what was he to do when the master did arrive his story was not one which would well bear telling before a third person  and then while captain donnellan was scanning this visitor to his friend owen and bethinking himself whether he might not be a sheriffs officer and whether if so some notice ought not to be conveyed up stairs to the master of the house another car was driven up to the front door in this case the arrival was from castle richmond and the two servants knew each other well thady said richard with much authority in his voice this gentlman is mr prendergast from our place and he must see the masther before he goes to the hunt faix and the masther ll have something to do this blessed morning said thady as he showed mr prendergast also into the diningroom and went up stairs to inform his master that there was yet another gentleman come upon business the captain has got em both to hisself said thady as he closed the door  the name of mr pendhrergrast as the irish servants generally called him was quite unknown to the owner of hap house as was also that of mr mollett which had been brought up to him the first of the two but owen began to think that there must be something very unusual in a day so singularly ushered in to him callers at hap house on business were very few unless when tradesmen in want of money occasionally dropped in upon him but now that he was so summoned owen began to bestir himself with his boots and breeches a gentlemans costume for a hunting morning is always a slow onesometimes so slow and tedious as to make him think of forswearing such articles of dress for all future ages but now he did bestir himselfin a moody melancholy sort of manner for his manner in all things latterly had become moody and melancholy  in the mean time captain donnellan and the two strangers sat almost in silence in the diningroom the captain though he did not perhaps know much of things noticeable in this world did know something of a gentleman and was therefore not led away as poor thady had been by abys hat and rings he had stared aby full in the face when he entered the room and having explained that he was not the master of the house had not vouchsafed another word but then he had also seen that mr prendergast was of a different class and had said a civil word or two asking him to come near the fire and suggesting that owen would be down in less than five minutes but the old cock wouldnt crow as he afterwards remarked to his friend and so they all three sat in silence the captain being very busy about his knees as hunting gentlemen sometimes are when they come down to bachelor breakfasts  and then at last owen fitzgerald entered the room he has been described as a handsome man but in no dress did he look so well as when equipped for a days sport and what dress that englishmen ever wear is so handsome as this or we may perhaps say what other dress does english custom allow them that is in any respect not the reverse of handsome we have come to be so dingyin our taste i was going to say but it is rather in our want of tasteso careless of any of the laws of beauty in the folds and lines and hues of our dress so opposed to grace in the arrangement of our persons that it is not permitted to the ordinary english gentleman to be anything else but ugly chimneypot hats swallowtailed coats and pantaloons that fit nothing came creeping in upon us one after the other while the georges reignedcreeping in upon us with such pictures as we painted under the reign of west and such houses as we built under the reign of nash till the english eye required to rest on that which was constrained dull and graceless for the last two score of years it has come to this that if a man go in handsome attire he is a popinjay and a vain fool and as it is better to be ugly than to be accounted vain i would not counsel a young friend to leave the beaten track on the strength of his own judgment but not the less is the beaten track to be condemned and abandoned and abolished if such be in any way possible beauty is good in all things and i cannot but think that those old venetian senators and florentine men of council owed somewhat of their countrys pride and power to the manner in which they clipped their beards and wore their flowing garments  but an englishman may still make himself brave when he goes forth into the hunting field custom there allows him colour and garments that fit his limbs strength is the outward characteristic of manhood and at the covertside he may appear strong look at men as they walk along fleetstreet and ask yourself whether any outward sign of manhood or strength can be seen there and of gentle manhood outward dignity should be the trade mark i will not say that such outward dignity is incompatible with a black hat and plaid trousers for the eye instructed by habit will search out dignity for itself wherever it may truly exist let it be hidden by what vile covering it may but any man who can look well at his club will look better as he clusters round the hounds while many a one who is comely there is mean enough as he stands on the hearthrug before his club fire in my mind men like churches and books and women too should be brave not mean in their outward garniture  and owen as i have said was brave as he walked into his diningroom the sorrow which weighed on his heart had not wrinkled his brow but had given him a set dignity of purpose his tall figure which his present dress allowed to be seen was perfect in its symmetry of strength his bright chestnut hair clustered round his forehead and his eye shone like that of a hawk they must have been wrong who said that he commonly spent his nights over the winecup that pleasure always leaves its disgusting traces round the lips and owen fitzgeralds lips were as full and lusty as apollos mollett as he saw him was stricken with envy if i could only get enough money out of this affair to look like that was his first thought as his eye fell on the future heir not understanding poor wretch that he was that all the gold of california could not bring him one inch nearer to the goal he aimed at i think i have said before that your silk purse will not get itself made out of that coarse material with which there are so many attempts to manufacture that article and mr prendergast rose from his chair when he saw him with a respect that was almost involuntary he had not heard men speak well of owen fitzgeraldnot that illnatured things had been said by the family at castle richmond but circumstances had prevented the possibility of their praising him if a relative or friend be spoken of without praise he is in fact censured from what he had heard he had certainly not expected a man who would look so noble as did the owner of hap house who now came forward to ask him his business  both mr prendergast and aby mollett rose at the same time since the arrival of the latter gentleman aby had been wondering who he might be but no idea that he was that lawyer from castle richmond had entered his head that he was a stranger like himself aby saw but he did not connect him with his own business indeed he had not yet realized the belief though his father had done so that the truth would be revealed by those at castle richmond to him at hap house his object now was that the old gentleman should say his say and begone leaving him to dispose of the other young man in the topboots as best he might but then as it happened that was also mr prendergasts line of action  gentlemen said owen i beg your pardon for keeping you waiting but the fact is that i am so seldom honoured in this way in a morning that i was hardly ready donnellan theres the tea dont mind waiting these gentlemen will perhaps join us and then he looked hard at aby as though he trusted in providence that no such profanation would be done to his tablecloth  thank you i have breakfasted said mr prendergast  and so ave i said aby who had eaten a penny loaf in the car and would have been delighted to sit down at that rich table but he was a little beside himself and not able to pluck up courage for such an effort  i dont know whether you two gentlemen have come about the same business said owen looking from one to the other  no said mr prendergast very confidently but not very correctly i wish to speak to you mr fitzgerald for a few minutes but my business with you is quite private  so is mine said aby very private very private indeed  well gentlemen i have just half an hour in which to eat my breakfast attend to business get on my horse and leave the house out of that twentyfive minutes are very much at your service donnellan i beg your pardon do pitch into the broiled bones while they are hot never mind me and now gentlemen if you will walk with me into the other room first come first served that i suppose should be the order and he opened the door and stood with it ajar in his hand  i will wait mr fitzgerald if you please said mr prendergast and as he spoke he motioned mollett with his hand to go to the door  oh i can wait sir id rather wait sir i would indeed said aby my business is a little particular and if youll go on sir ill take up with the genleman as soon as youve done sir  but mr prendergast was accustomed to have his own way i should prefer that you should go first sir and to tell the truth mr fitzgerald what i have to say to you will take some time it is of much importance to yourself and to others and i fear that you will probably find that it will detain you from your amusement today  owen looked black as he heard this the hounds were going to draw a covert of his own and he was not in the habit of remaining away from the drawing of any coverts belonging to himself or others on any provocation whatever that will be rather hard said he considering that i do not know any more than the man in the moon what youve come about  you shall be the sole judge yourself sir of the importance of my business with you said mr prendergast  well mr i forget your name said owen  my names mollett said aby whereupon mr prendergast looked up at him very sharply but he said nothinghe said nothing but he looked very sharply indeed he now knew well who this man was and guessed with tolerable accuracy the cause of his visit but nevertheless at the moment he said nothing  come along then mr mollett i hope your affair is not likely to be a very long one also perhaps youll excuse my having a cup of tea sent in to me as you talk to me there is nothing like saving time when such very important business is on the tapis donnellan send thady in with a cup of tea like a good fellow now mr mollett  mr mollett rose slowly from his chair and followed his host he would have given all he possessed in the world and that was very little to have had the coast clear but in such an emergency what was he to do by the time he had reached the door of the drawingroom he had all but made up his mind to tell fitzgerald that seeing there was so much other business on hand this morning at hap house this special piece of business of his must stand over but then how could he go back to cork emptyhanded so he followed owen into the room and there opened his budget with what courage he had left to him  captain donnellan as he employed himself on the broiled bones twice invited mr prendergast to assist him but in vain donnellan remained there waiting for owen till eleven and then got on his horse youll tell fitzgerald will you that ive started hell see nothing of todays hunt thats clear  i dont think he will said mr prendergast     chapter xxiv  after breakfast at hap house   i dont think he will said mr prendergast and as he spoke captain donnellans ear could detect that there was something approaching to sarcasm in the tone of the old mans voice the captain was quite sure that his friend would not be even at the heel of the hunt that day and without further compunction proceeded to fasten his buckskin gloves round his wrists the meet was so near to them that they had both intended to ride their own hunters from the door and the two nags were now being led up and down upon the gravel  but at this moment a terrible noise was heard to take place in the hall there was a rush and crushing there which made even mr prendergast to jump from his chair and drove captain donnellan to forget his gloves and run to the door  it was as though all the winds of heaven were being driven down the passage and as though each separate wind was shod with heavyheeled boots captain donnellan ran to the door and mr prendergast with slower steps followed him when it was opened owen was to be seen in the hall apparently in a state of great excitement and the gentleman whom he had lately asked to breakfasthe was to be seen also in a position of unmistakeable discomfort he was at that moment proceeding with the utmost violence into a large round bed of bushes which stood in the middle of the great sweep before the door of the house his feet just touching the ground as he went and then having reached his bourne he penetrated face foremost into the thicket and in an instant disappeared he had been kicked out of the house owen fitzgerald had taken him by the shoulders with a run along the passage and hall and having reached the door had applied the flat of his foot violently to poor abys back and sent him flying down the stone steps and now as captain donnellan and mr prendergast stood looking on mr mollett junior buried himself altogether out of sight among the shrubs  you have done for that fellow at any rate owen said captain donnellan glancing for a moment at mr prendergast i should say that he will never get out of that alive  not if he wait till i pick him out said owen breathing very hard after his exertion an infernal scoundrel and now mr prendergast if you are ready sir i am it was as much as he could do to finish these few words with that sang froid which he desired to assume so violent was his attempt at breathing after his late exercise  it was impossible not to conceive the idea that as one disagreeable visitor had been disposed of in a somewhat summary fashion so might be the other also mr prendergast did not look like a man who was in the habit of leaving gentlemens houses in the manner just now adopted by mr mollett but nevertheless as they had come together both unwished for and unwelcome captain donnellan did for a moment bethink himself whether there might not be more of such fun if he remained there on the spot at any rate it would not do for him to go to the hunt while such deeds as these were being done it might be that his assistance would be wanted  mr prendergast smiled with a saturnine and somewhat bitter smilethe nearest approach to a laugh in which he was known to indulgefor the same notion came also into his head he has disposed of him and now he is thinking how he will dispose of me such was mr prendergasts thought about the matter and that made him smile and then too he was pleased at what he had seen that this mollett was the son of that other mollett with whom he had been closeted at castle richmond was plain enough it was plain enough also to him used as he was to trace out in his mind the courses of action which men would follow that mollett junior having heard of his fathers calamitous failure at castle richmond had come down to hap house to see what he could make out of the hitherto unconscious heir it had been matter of great doubt with mr prendergast when he first heard young molletts name mentioned whether or no he would allow him to make his attempt he mr prendergast could by a word have spoilt the game but acting as he was forced to act on the spur of the moment he resolved to permit mr mollett junior to play out his play he would be yet in time to prevent any ill result to mr fitzgerald should that gentleman be weak enough to succumb to any such ill results as things had now turned out mr prendergast rejoiced that mr mollett junior had been permitted to play out his play and now mr prendergast if you are ready i am said owen  perhaps we had better first pick up the gentleman among the trees said mr prendergast and he and captain donnellan went down into the bushes  do as you please about that said owen i have touched him once and shall not touch him again and he walked back into the diningroom  one of the grooms who were leading the horses had now gone to the assistance of the fallen hero and as captain donnellan also had already penetrated as far as abys shoulders mr prendergast thinking that he was not needed returned also to the house i hope he is not seriously hurt he said  not he said owen those sort of men are as used to be kicked as girls are to be kissed and it comes as naturally to them but anything short of having his bones broken will be less than he deserves  may i ask what was the nature of his offence  owen remained silent for a moment looking his guest full in the face well not exactly said he he has been talking of people of whom he knows nothing but it would not be well for me to repeat what he has said to a perfect stranger  quite right mr fitzgerald it would not be well but there can be no harm in my repeating it to you he came here to get money from you for certain tidings which he brought tidings which if true would be of great importance to you as i take it however he has altogether failed in his object  and how do you come to know all this sir  merely from having heard that man mention his own name i also have come with the same tidings and as i ask for no money for communicating them you may believe them to be true on my telling  what tidings asked owen with a frown and an angry jerk in his voice no remotest notion had yet come in upon his mind that there was any truth in the story that had been told him he had looked upon it all as a lie and had regarded mollett as a sorry knave who had come to him with a poor and low attempt at raising a few pounds and even now he did not believe mr prendergasts words had been too sudden to produce belief of so great a fact and his first thought was that an endeavour was being made to fool him  those tidings which that man has told you said mr prendergast solemnly that you should not have believed them from him shows only your discretion but from me you may believe them i have come from castle richmond and am here as a messenger from sir thomasfrom sir thomas and from his son when the matter became clear to them both then it was felt that you also should be made acquainted with it  owen fitzgerald now sat down and looked up into the lawyers face staring at him i may say that the power of saying much was for the moment taken away from him by the words that he heard what was it really possible that that title that property that place of honour in the country was to be his when one frail old man should drop away and then again was it really true that all this immeasurable misery was to fallhad fallenupon that family whom he had once known so well it was but yesterday that he had been threatening all manner of evil to his cousin herbert and had his threats been proved true so quickly but there was no shadow of triumph in his feelings owen fitzgerald was a man of many faults he was reckless passionate prone to depreciate the opinion of others extravagant in his thoughts and habits ever ready to fight both morally and physically those who did not at a moments notice agree with him he was a man who would at once make up his mind that the world was wrong when the world condemned him and who would not in compliance with any argument allow himself to be so but he was not avaricious nor cruel nor selfseeking nor vindictive in his anger he could pronounce all manner of ill things against his enemy as he had pronounced some ill things against herbert but it was not in him to keep up a sustained wish that those ill things should really come to pass this news which he now heard and which he did not yet fully credit struck him with awe but created no triumph in his bosom he realized the catastrophe as it affected his cousins of castle richmond rather than as it affected himself  do you mean to say that lady fitzgerald and then he stopped himself he had not the courage to ask the question which was in his mind could it really be the case that lady fitzgeraldthat she whom all the world had so long honoured under that name was in truth the wife of that mans fatherof the father of that wretch whom he had just spurned from his house the tragedy was so deep that he could not believe in it  we fear that it is so mr fitzgerald said mr prendergast that it certainly is so i cannot say and therefore if i may take the liberty to give you counsel i would advise you not to make too certain of this change in your prospects  too certain said he with a bitter laugh do you suppose then that i would wish to see all this ruin accomplished heavens and earth lady fitzgerald i cannot believe it  and then captain donnellan also returned to the room fitzgerald said he what the mischief are we to do with this fellow he says that he cant walk and he bleeds from his face like a pig  what fellow oh do what you like with him here give him a pound note and let him go to the d and donnellan for heavens sake go to cecilstown at once do not wait for me i have business that will keep me here all day  but i do not know what to do with this fellow thats bleeding said the captain piteously as he took the proffered note if he puts up with a pound note for what youve done to him hes softer than what i take him for  he will be very glad to be allowed to escape without being given up to the police said mr prendergast  but i dont know what to do with him said captain donnellan he says that he cant stand  then lay him down on the dunghill said owen fitzgerald but for heavens sake do not let him interrupt me and donnellan you will altogether lose the day if you stay any longer whereupon the captain seeing that in very truth he was not wanted did take himself off casting as he went one farewell look on aby as he lay groaning on the turf on the far side of the tuft of bushes  hes kilt intirely im thinking yer honor said thady who was standing over him on the other side  hell come to life again before dinnertime said the captain  oh in course hell do that yer honor said thady and then added sotto voce to himself as the captain rode down the avenue faix an i dont know about that shure an its the masther has a heavy hand and then thady stood for a while perplexed endeavouring to reanimate aby by a sight of the pound note which he held out visibly between his thumb and fingers  and now mr prendergast and owen were again alone and what am i to do said owen after a pause of a minute or two and he asked the question with a serious solemn voice  just for the presentfor the next day or twoi think that you should do nothing as soon as the first agony of this time is over at castle richmond i think that herbert should see you it would be very desirable that he and you should take in concert such proceedings as will certainly become necessary the absolute proof of the truth of this story must be obtained you understand i hope mr fitzgerald that the case still admits of doubt  owen nodded his head impatiently as though it were needless on the part of mr prendergast to insist upon this he did not wish to take it for true a moment sooner than was necessary  it is my duty to give you this caution many lawyersi presume you know that i am a lawyer  i did not know it said owen but it makes no difference  thank you thats very kind said mr prendergast but the sarcasm was altogether lost upon his hearer some lawyers as i was saying would in such a case have advised their clients to keep all their suspicions nay all their knowledge to themselves why play the game of an adversary they would ask but i have thought it better that we should have no adversary  and you will have none said owen none in me at least  i am much gratified in so perceiving and in having such evidence that my advice has not been indiscreet it occurred to me that if you received the first intimation of these circumstances from other sources you would be bound on your own behalf to employ an agent to look after your own interests  i should have done nothing of the kind said owen  ah but my dear young friend in such a case it would have been your duty to do so  then i should have neglected my duty and do you tell herbert this from me that let the truth be what it may i shall never interrupt him in his title or his property it is not there that i shall look either for justice or revenge he will understand what i mean  but mr prendergast did not by any means nor did he enter into the tone of owen fitzgeralds mind they were both just men but just in an essentially different manner the justice of mr prendergast had come of thought and education as a young man when entering on his profession he was probably less just than he was now he had thought about matters of law and equity till thought had shown to him the beauty of equity as it should be practisedoften by the aid of law and not unfrequently in spite of law such was the justice of mr prendergast that of owen fitzgerald had come of impulse and nature and was the justice of a very young man rather than of a very wise one that title and property did not as he felt of justice belong to him but to his cousin what difference could it make in the true justice of things whether or no that wretched man was still alive whom all the world had regarded as dead in justice he ought to be dead now that this calamity of the mans life had fallen upon sir thomas and lady fitzgerald and his cousin herbert it would not be for him to aggravate it by seizing upon a heritage which might possibly accrue to him under the letter of the worlds law but which could not accrue to him under heavens law such was the justice of owen fitzgerald and we may say this of it in its dispraise as comparing it with that other justice that whereas that of mr prendergast would wear for ever through ages and ages that other justice of owens would hardly have stood the pull of a ten years struggle when children came to him would he not have thought of what might have been theirs by right and then have thought of what ought to be theirs by right and so on  but in speaking of justice he had also spoken of revenge and mr prendergast was altogether in the dark what revenge he did not know that poor owen had lost a love and that herbert had found it in the midst of all the confused thoughts which this astounding intelligence had brought upon him owen still thought of his love there herbert had robbed himrobbed him by means of his wealth and in that matter he desired justicejustice or revenge he wanted back his love let him have that and herbert might yet be welcome to his title and estates  mr prendergast remained there for some halfhour longer explaining what ought to be done and how it ought to be done of course he combated that idea of owens that the property might be allowed to remain in the hands of the wrong heir had that been consonant with his ideas of justice he would not have made his visit to hap house this morning right must have its way and if it should be that lady fitzgeralds marriage with sir thomas had not been legal owen on sir thomass death must become sir owen and herbert could not become sir herbert so much to the mind of mr prendergast was as clear as crystal let justice be done even though these castle richmond heavens should fall in ruins  and then he took his departure leaving owen to his solitude much perplexed and where is that man mr prendergast asked as he got on to his car  bedad thin yer honer hes very bad intirely hes jist sitthing over the kitchen fire moaning and croning this way and that but sorrow a word hes spoke since the masther hoisted him out o the big hall door and thin for bloodwhy saving yer honers presence hes one mash of gore  youd better wash his face for him and give him a little tea said mr prendergast and then he drove away  and strange ideas floated across owen fitzgeralds brain as he sat there alone in his hunting gear leaning on the still covered breakfasttable they floated across his brain backwards and forwards and at last remained there taking almost the form of a definite purpose he would make a bargain with herbert let each of them keep that which was fairly his own let herbert have all the broad lands of castle richmond let him have the title the seat in parliament and the county honour but for him owenlet him have clara desmond he desired nothing that was not fairly his own but as his own he did regard her and without her he did not know how to face the future of his life and in suggesting this arrangement to himself he did not altogether throw over her feelings he did take into account her heart though he did not take into account her worldly prospects she had loved himhimowen and he would not teach himself to believe that she did not love him still her mother had been too powerful for her and she had weakly yielded but as to her heartowen could not bring himself to believe that that was gone from him  they two would make a bargainhe and his cousin honour and renown and the money and the title would be everything to his cousin herbert had been brought up to expect these things and all the world around him had expected them for him it would be terrible to him to find himself robbed of them but the loss of clara desmond was equally terrible to owen fitzgerald he allowed his heart to fill itself with a romantic sense of honour teaching him that it behoved him as a man not to give up his love without her he would live disgraced in his own estimation but who would not think the better of him for refraining from the possession of those castle richmond acres yes he would make a bargain with herbert who was there in the world to deny his right to do so  as he sat revolving these things in his mind he suddenly heard a rushing sound as of many horsemen down the avenue and going to the window he saw two or three leading men of the hunt accompanied by the grayhaired old huntsman and through and about and under the horsemen were the dogs running in and out of the laurels which skirted the road with their noses down giving every now and then short yelps as they caught up the uncertain scent from the leaves on the ground and hurried on upon the trail of their game  yo ho to him messenger hark to him maybird good bitch merrylass hes down here genlemen and hell never get away alive he came to a bad place when he looked out for going to ground anywhere near mr owen  and then there came fast trotting down through the other horsemen making his way eagerly to the front a stout heavy man with a florid handsome face and eager eye he might be some fifty years of age but no lad there of threeandtwenty was so anxious and impetuous as he he was riding a largeboned fasttrotting bay horse that pressed on as eagerly as his rider as he hurried forward all made way for him till he was close to the shrubs in the front of the house  bless my soul gentlemen he said in an angry voice how in the name of all thats good are hounds to hunt if you press them down the road in that way by heavens barry you are enough to drive a man wild yoicks merrylass there it is patpat was the huntsmanoutside the low wall there down towards the river this was sam ogrady the master of the duhallow hounds the god of owens idolatry no better fellow ever lived and no master of hounds so good such at least was the opinion common among duhallow sportsmen  yes yer honerhe did skirt round there i knows that but hes been among them laurels at the bottom and hell be about the place and outhouses somewhere theres a drain here that i knows on and he knows on but mr owen he knows on it too and there aint a chance for him so argued pat the duhallow huntsman the experienced craft of whose aged mind enabled him to run counter to the cutest dodges of the cutest fox in that and any of the three neighbouring baronies  and now the sweep before the door was crowded with red coats and owen looking from his diningroom window felt that he must take some step as an ordinary rule had the hunt thus drifted near his homestead he would have been off his horse and down among his bottles sending up sherry and cherrybrandy and there would have been comfortable drink in plenty and cold meat perhaps not in plenty and every one would have been welcome in and out of the house but now there was that at his heart which forbade him to mix with the men who knew him so well and among whom he was customarily so loudly joyous dressed as he was he could not go among them without explaining why he had remained at home and as to that he felt that he was not able to give any explanation at the present moment  whats the matter with owen said one fellow to captain donnellan  upon my word i hardly know two chaps came to him this morning before he was up about business they said he nearly murdered one of them out of hand and i believe that hes locked up somewhere with the other this minute  but in the meantime a servant came up to mr ogrady and touching his hat asked the master of the hunt to go into the house for a moment and then mr ogrady dismounting entered in through the front door he was only there two minutes for his mind was still outside among the laurels with the fox but as he put his foot again into the stirrup he said to those around him that they must hurry away and not disturb owen fitzgerald that day it may therefore easily be imagined that the mystery would spread quickly through that portion of the county of cork  they must hurry awaybut not before they could give an account of their fox neither for gods nor men must he be left as long as his skin was whole above ground there is an importance attaching to the pursuit of a fox which gives it a character quite distinct from that of any other amusement which men follow in these realms it justifies almost anything that men can do and that at any place and in any season there is about it a sanctity which forbids interruption and makes its votaries safe under any circumstances of trespass or intrusion a man in a hunting county who opposes the county hunt must be a misanthrope willing to live in seclusion fond of being in coventry and in love with the enmity of his fellowcreatures there are such men but they are regarded as lepers by those around them all this adds to the nobleness of the noble sport and makes it worthy of a mans energies  and then the crowd of huntsmen hurried round from the front of the house to a paddock at the back and then again through the stable yard to the front the hounds were abouthere there and everywhere as any one ignorant of the craft would have said but still always on the scent of that doomed beast from one thicket to another he tried to hide himself but the moist leaves of the underwood told quickly of his whereabouts he tried every hole and cranny about the house but every hole and corner had been stopped by owens jealous care he would have lived disgraced for ever in his own estimation had a fox gone to ground anywhere about his domicile at last a loud whoop was heard just in front of the hall door the poor fox with his last gasp of strength had betaken himself to the thicket before the door and there the dogs had killed him at the very spot on which aby mollett had fallen  standing well back from the window still thinking of clara desmond owen fitzgerald saw the fate of the hunted animal he saw the head and tail severed from the carcase by old pat and the body thrown to the houndsa ceremony over which he had presided so many scores of times and then when the dogs had ceased to growl over the bloody fragments he saw the hunt move away back along the avenue to the high road all this he saw but still he was thinking of clara desmond     chapter xxv  a muddy walk on a wet morning   all that day of the hunt was passed very quietly at castle richmond herbert did not once leave the house having begged mr somers to make his excuse at a relief committee which it would have been his business to attend a great portion of the day he spent with his father who lay all but motionless in a state that was apparently half comatose during all those long hours very little was said between them about this tragedy of their family why should more be said now now that the worst had befallen themall that worst to hide which sir thomas had endured such superhuman agony and then four or five times during the day he went to his mother but with her he did not stay long to her he could hardly speak upon any subject for to her as yet the story had not been told  and she when he thus came to her from time to time with a soft word or two or a softer kiss would ask him no question she knew that he had learned the whole and knew also from the solemn cloud on his brow that that whole must be very dreadful indeed we may surmise that her womans heart had by this time guessed somewhat of the truth but she would inquire of no one jones she was sure knew it all but she did not ask a single question of her servant it would be told to her when it was fitting why should she move in the matter  whenever herbert entered her room she tried to receive him with something of a smile it was clear enough that she was always glad of his coming and that she made some little show of welcoming him a book was always put away very softly and by the slightest motion but herbert well knew what that book was and whence his mother sought that strength which enabled her to live through such an ordeal as this  and his sisters were to be seen moving slowly about the house like the very ghosts of their former selves their voices were hardly heard no ring of customary laughter ever came from the room in which they sat when they passed their brother in the house they hardly dared to whisper to him as to sitting down at table now with mr prendergast that effort was wholly abandoned they kept themselves even from the sound of his footsteps  aunt letty perhaps spoke more than the others but what could she speak to the purpose herbert she once said as she caught him close by the door of the library and almost pulled him into the roomherbert i charge you to tell me what all this is  i can tell you nothing dear aunt nothingnothing as yet  but herbert tell me this is it about my sister for very many years past aunt letty had always called lady fitzgerald her sister  i can tell you nothingnothing today  then tomorrow  i do not knowwe must let mr prendergast manage this matter as he will i have taken nothing on myself aunt lettynothing  then i tell you what herbert it will kill me it will kill us all as it is killing your father and your darling mother i tell you that it is killing her fast human nature cannot bear it for myself i could endure anything if i were trusted and sitting down in one of the highbacked library chairs she burst into a flood of tears a sight which as regarded aunt letty herbert had never seen before  what if they all died thought herbert to himself in the bitterness of the moment there was that in store for some of them which was worse than death what business had aunt letty to talk of her misery of course she was wretched as they all were but how could she appreciate the burden that was on his back what was clara desmond to her  shortly after noon mr prendergast was back at the house but he slunk up to his room and no one saw anything of him at halfpast six he came down and herbert constrained himself to sit at the table while dinner was served and so the day passed away one more day only mr prendergast was to stay at castle richmond and then if as he expected certain letters should reach him on that morning he was to start for london late on the following day it may well be imagined that he was not desirous of prolonging his visit  early on the following morning herbert started for a long solitary walk on that day mr prendergast was to tell everything to his mother and it was determined between them that her son should not be in the house during the telling in the evening when he came home he was to see her so he started on his walk resolving some other things also in his mind before he went he would reach desmond court before he returned home that day and let the two ladies there know the fate that was before them then after that they might let him know what was to be his fatebut on this head he would not hurry them  so he started on his walk resolving to go round by gortnaclough on his way to desmond court and then to return home from that place the road would be more than twenty long irish miles but he felt that the hard work would be of service it was instinct rather than thought which taught him that it would be good for him to put some strain on the muscles of his body and thus relieve the muscles of his mind if his limbs could become thoroughly tiredthoroughly tired so that he might wish to restthen he might hope that for a moment he might cease to think of all this sorrow which encompassed him  so he started on his walk taking with him a thick cudgel and his own thoughts he went away across the demesne and down into the road that led away by gortnaclough and boherbue towards castleisland and the wilds of county kerry as he went the men about the place refrained from speaking to him for they all knew that bad news had come to the big house they looked at him with lowered eyes and with tenderness in their hearts for they loved the very name of fitzgerald the love which a poor irishman feels for the gentleman whom he regards as his masterhis masther though he has probably never received from him in money wages for a days work and in all his intercourse has been the man who has paid money and not the man who received itthe love which he nevertheless feels if he has been occasionally looked on with a smiling face and accosted with a kindly word is astonishing to an englishman i will not say that the feeling is altogether good love should come of love where personal love exists on one side and not even personal regard on the other there must be some mixture of servility that unbounded respect for human grandeur cannot be altogether good for human greatness if the greatness be properly sifted it may be so  he got down into the road and went forth upon his journey at a rapid pace the mud was deep upon the way but he went through the thickest without a thought of it he had not been out long before there came on a cold light drizzling rain such a rain as gradually but surely makes its way into the innermost rag of a mans clothing running up the inside of his waterproof coat and penetrating by its perseverance the very folds of his necktie such cold drizzling rain is the commonest phase of hard weather during irish winters and those who are out and about get used to it and treat it tenderly they are euphemistical as to the weather calling it hazy and soft and never allowing themselves to carry bad language on such a subject beyond the word dull and yet at such a time one breathes the rain and again exhales it and become as it were oneself a water spirit assuming an aqueous fishlike nature into ones inner fibres it must be acknowledged that a man does sometimes get wet in ireland but then a wetting there brings no cold in the head no husky voice no need for multitudinous pockethandkerchiefs as it does here in this land of catarrhs it is the east wind and not the rain that kills and of east wind in the south of ireland they know nothing  but herbert walked on quite unmindful of the mist swinging his thick stick in his hand and ever increasing his pace as he went he was usually a man careful of such things but it was nothing to him now whether he were wet or dry his mind was so full of the immediate circumstances of his destiny that he could not think of small external accidents what was to be his future life in this world and how was he to fight the battle that was now before him that was the question which he continually asked himself and yet never succeeded in answering how was he to come down from the throne on which early circumstances had placed him and hustle and struggle among the crowd for such approach to other thrones as his sinews and shoulders might procure for him if he had been only born to the struggle he said to himself how easy and pleasant it would have been to him but to find himself thus cast out from his place by an accidentcast out with the eyes of all the world upon him to be talked of and pointed at and pitied to have little aids offered him by men whom he regarded as beneath himall this was terribly sore and the burden was almost too much for his strength i do not care for the money he said to himself a dozen times and in saying so he spoke in one sense truly but he did care for things which money buys for outward respect permission to speak with authority among his fellowmen for power and place and the feeling that he was prominent in his walk of life to be in advance of other men that is the desire which is strongest in the hearts of all strong men and in that desire how terrible a fall had he not received from this catastrophe  and what were they all to do he and his mother and his sisters how were they to actnow at once in what way were they to carry themselves when this man of law and judgment should have gone from them for himself his course of action must depend much upon the word which might be spoken to him today at desmond court there would still be a drop of comfort left at the bottom of his cup if he might be allowed to hope there but in truth he feared greatly what the countess would say to him he thought he could foretell what it would behove him to say himselfin matter though not in wordsthat he knew well would not the two sayings tally well together and could it be right for him even to hope that the love of a girl of seventeen should stand firm against her mothers will when her lover himself could not dare to press his suit and then another reflection pressed on his mind sorely clara had already given up one poor lover at her mothers instance might she not resume that lover also at her mothers instance now that he was no longer poor what if owen fitzgerald should take from him everything  and so he walked on through the mud and rain always swinging his big stick perhaps after all the worst of it was over with him when he could argue with himself in this way it is the first plunge into the cold water that gives the shock we may almost say that every human misery will cease to be miserable if it be duly faced and something is done towards conquering our miseries when we face them in any degree even if not with due courage herbert had taken his plunge into the deep dark cold comfortless pool of misfortune and he felt that the waters around him were very cold but the plunge had been taken and the worst perhaps was gone by  as he approached near to gortnaclough he came upon one of those gangs of roaddestroyers who were now at work everywhere earning their pittance of yellow meal with a pickaxe and a wheelbarrow in some sort or other the labourers had been got to their work gangsmen there were with lists who did see more or less accurately that the men before they received their sixpence or eightpence for their days work did at any rate pass their day with some sort of tool in their hands and consequently the surface of the hill began to disappear and there were chasms in the road which caused those who travelled on wheels to sit still staring across with angry eyes and sometimes to apostrophize the doer of these deeds with very naughty words the doer was the board of works or the board as it was familiarly termed and were it not that those ill words must have returned to the bosoms which vented them and have flown no further no board could ever have been so terribly curseladen to find oneself at last utterly stopped after proceeding with great strain to ones horse for half a mile through an artificial quagmire of slush up to the wheelbox is harassing to the customary traveller and men at that crisis did not bethink themselves quite so frequently as they should have done that a people perishing from famine is more harassing  but herbert was not on wheels and was proceeding through the slush and across the chasm regardless of it all when he was stopped by some of the men all the land thereabouts was castle richmond property and it was not probable that the young master of it all would be allowed to pass through some two score of his own tenantry without greetings and petitions and blessings and complaints  faix yer honer thin mr herbert said one man standing at the bottom of the hill with the halffilled wheelbarrow still hanging in his handsan englishman would have put down the barrow while he was speaking making some inner calculation about the waste of his muscles but an irishman would despise himself for such low economyfaix thin yer honer mr herbert an its yourself is a sight good for sore eyes may the heavens be your bed for its you is the frind to a poor man  how are you pat said herbert without intending to stop how are you mooney i hope the work suits you all and then he would at once have passed on with his hat pressed down low over his brow  but this could be by no means allowed in the first place the excitement arising from the young masters presence was too valuable to be lost so suddenly and then when might again occur so excellent a time for some mention of their heavy grievances men whose whole amount of worldly good consists in a bare allowance of nauseous food just sufficient to keep body and soul together must be excused if they wish to utter their complaints to ears that can hear them  arrah yer honer thin were none on us very well and how could we with the male at a penny a pound said pat  sorrow to it for male said mooney its the worst vittles iver a man tooked into the inside of him saving yer honers presence its as much as i can do to raise the bare arm of me since the day i first began with the yally male  its as wake as cats we all is said another who from the weary way in which he dragged his limbs about certainly did not himself seem to be gifted with much animal strength  and the childer is worse yer honer said a fourth the male is bad for them intirely saving yer honers presence their bellies is gone away most to nothing  and theres six of us in family yer honer said pat six mouths to feed and whats eight pennorth of yally male among such a lot as that let alone the sundays when theres nothing  an shure mr herbert said another a small man with a squeaking voice whose rags of clothes hardly hung on to his body warnt i here with the other boys the last friday as iver was ax pat condon else yer honer and yet when they comed to give out the wages they sconced me of and so on there were as many complaints to be made as there were men if only he could bring himself to listen to them  on ordinary occasions herbert would listen to them and answer them and give them at any rate the satisfaction which they derived from discoursing with him if he could give them no other satisfaction but now on this day with his own burden so heavy at his heart he could not even do this he could not think of their sorrows his own sorrow seemed to him to be so much the heavier so he passed on running the gauntlet through them as best he might and shaking them off from him as they attempted to cling round his steps nothing is so powerful in making a man selfish as misfortune  and then he went on to gortnaclough he had not chosen his walk to this place with any fixed object except this perhaps that it enabled him to return home round by desmond court it was one of the places at which a relief committee sat every fortnight and there was a soupkitchen here which however had not been so successful as the one at berryhill and it was the place of residence selected by father barneys coadjutor but in spite of all this when herbert found himself in the wretched dirty straggling damp street of the village he did not know what to do or where to betake himself that every eye in gortnaclough would be upon him was a matter of course he could hardly turn round on his heel and retrace his steps through the village as he would have to do in going to desmond court without showing some pretext for his coming there so he walked into the little shop which was attached to the soupkitchen and there he found the rev mr columb creagh giving his orders to the little girl behind the counter  herbert fitzgerald was customarily very civil to the roman catholic priests around himsomewhat more so indeed than seemed good to those very excellent ladies mrs townsend and aunt letty but it always went against the grain with him to be civil to the rev columb creagh and on this special day it would have gone against the grain with him to be civil to anybody but the coadjutor knew his character and was delighted to have an opportunity of talking to him when he could do so without being snubbed either by mr somers the chairman or by his own parish priest mr creagh had rejoiced much at the idea of forming one at the same council board with county magistrates and protestant parsons but the fruition of his promised delights had never quite reached his lips he had been like sancho panza in his government he had sat down to the grand table day after day but had never yet been allowed to enjoy the rich dish of his own oratory whenever he had proposed to help himself mr somers or father barney had stopped his mouth now probably he might be able to say a word or two and though the glory would not be equal to that of making a speech at the committee still it would be something to be seen talking on equal terms and on affairs of state to the young heir of castle richmond  mr fitzgerald well i declare and how are you sir and he took off his hat and bowed and got hold of herberts hand shaking it ruthlessly and altogether he made him very disagreeable  herbert though his mind was not really intent on the subject asked some question of the girl as to the amount of meal that had been sold and desired to see the little passbook that they kept at the shop  we are doing pretty well mr fitzgerald said the coadjutor pretty well i always keep my eye on for fear things should go wrong you know  i dont think theyll do that said herbert  no i hope not but its always good to be on the safe side you know and to tell you the truth i dont think were altogether on the right tack about them shops its very hard on a poor woman  now the fact was though the relief committee at gortnaclough was attended by magistrates priests and parsons the shop there was herbert fitzgeralds own affair it had been stocked with his or his fathers money the flour was sold without profit at his risk and the rent of the house and wages of the woman who kept it came out of his own pocketmoney under these circumstances he did not see cause why mr creagh should interfere and at the present moment was not well inclined to put up with such interference  we do the best we can mr creagh said he interrupting the priest and no good will be done at such a time as this by unnecessary difficulties  no no certainly not but still i do think and mr creagh was girding up his loins for eloquence when he was again interrupted  i am rather in a hurry today said herbert and therefore if you please we wont make any change now never mind the book today sally good day mr creagh and so saying he left the shop and walked rapidly back out of the village  the poor coadjutor was left alone at the shopdoor anathematizing in his heart the pride of all protestants he had been told that this mr fitzgerald was different from others that he was a man fond of priests and addicted to the ould religion and so hearing he had resolved to make the most of such an excellent disposition but he was forced to confess to himself that they were all alike mr somers could not have been more imperious nor mr townsend more insolent  and then through the still drizzling rain herbert walked on to desmond court by the time that he reached the desolatelooking lodge at the demesne gate he was nearly wet through and was besmeared with mud up to his knees but he had thought nothing of this as he walked along his mind had been intent on the scene that was before him in what words was he to break the news to clara desmond and her mother and with what words would they receive the tidings the former question he had by no means answered to his own satisfaction when all muddy and wet he passed up to the house through that desolate gate  is lady desmond at home he asked of the butler her ladyship is at home said the grayhaired old man with his blandest smile and so is lady clara he had already learned to look on the heir of castle richmond as the coming saviour of the impoverished desmond family     chapter xxvi  comfortless   but mr herbert yer honor youre wet through and throughsurely said the butler as soon as fitzgerald was well inside the hall herbert muttered something about his being only damp and that it did not signify but it did signifyvery muchin the butlers estimation whose being wet through could signify more for was not mr herbert to be a baronet and to have the spending of twelve thousand a year and would he not be the future husband of lady clara not signify indeed  an shure mr herbert you havent walked to desmond court this blessed morning tare an ages well theres no knowing what you young gentlemen wont do but ill see and get a pair of trousers of my lords ready for you in two minutes faix and hes nearly as big as yourself now mr herbert  but herbert would hardly speak to him and gave no assent whatever as to his proposition for borrowing the earls clothes ill go in as i am said he and the old man looking into his face saw that there was something wrong shure an he aint going to sthrike off now said this irish caleb balderstone to himself he also as well as some others about desmond court had feared greatly that lady clara would throw herself away upon a poor lover  it was now past noon and fitzgerald pressed forward into the room in which lady clara usually sat it was the same in which she had received owens visit and here of a morning she was usually to be found alone but on this occasion when he opened the door he found that her mother was with her since the day on which clara had disposed of herself so excellently the mother had spent more of her time with her daughter looking at clara now through herbert fitzgeralds eyes the countess had began to confess to herself that her child did possess beauty and charm  she got up to greet her future soninlaw with a sweet smile and that charming quiet welcome with which a woman so well knows how to make her house pleasant to a man that is welcome to it and clara not rising but turning her head round and looking at him greeted him also he came forward and took both their hands and it was not till he had held claras for half a minute in his own that they both saw that he was more than ordinarily serious i hope sir thomas is not worse said lady desmond with that voice of feigned interest which is so common after all if anything should happen to the poor old weak gentleman might it not be as well  my father has not been very well these last two days he said  i am so sorry said clara and your mother herbert  but herbert how wet you are you must have walked said the countess  herbert in a few dull words said that he had walked he had thought that the walk would be good for him and he had not expected that it would be so wet and then lady desmond looking carefully into his face saw that in truth he was very seriousso much so that she knew that he had come there on account of his seriousness but still his sorrow did not in any degree go to her heart he was grieving doubtless for his fatheror his mother the house at castle richmond was probably sad because sickness and fear of death were therenay perhaps death itself now hanging over some loved head but what was this to her she had had her own sorrowsenough of them perhaps to account for her being selfish so with a solemn face but with nothing amiss about her heart she again asked for tidings from castle richmond  do tell us said clara getting up i am afraid sir thomas is very ill the old baronet had been kind to her and she did regard him to her it was a sorrow to think that there should be any sorrow at castle richmond  yes he is ill said herbert we have had a gentleman from london with us for the last few daysa friend of my fathers his name is mr prendergast  is he a doctor asked the countess  no not a doctor said herbert he is a lawyer  it was very hard for him to begin his story and perhaps the more so in that he was wet through and covered with mud he now felt cold and clammy and began to have an idea that he should not be seated there in that room in such a guise clara too had instinctively learned from his face and tone and general bearing that something truly was the matter at other times when he had been there since that day on which he had been accepted he had been completely master of himself perhaps it had almost been deemed a fault in him that he had had none of the timidity or hesitation of a lover he had seemed to feel no doubt that he with his fortune and position at his back need feel no scruple in accepting as his own the fair hand for which he had asked but nownothing could be more different from this than his manner was now  lady desmond was now surprised though probably not as yet frightened why should a lawyer have come from london to visit sir thomas at a period of such illness and why should herbert have walked over to desmond court to tell them of this illness there must be something in this lawyers coming which was intended to bear in some way on her daughters marriage but herbert she said you are quite wet will you not put on some of patricks things  no thank you said he i shall not stay long i shall soon have said what i have got to say  but do herbert said clara i cannot bear to see you so uncomfortable and then you will not be in such a hurry to go back  ill as my father is said he i cannot stay long but i have thought it my duty to come over and tell youtell you what has happened at castle richmond  and now the countess was frightened there was that in herberts tone of voice and the form of his countenance which was enough to frighten any woman what had happened at castle richmond what could have happened there to make necessary the presence of a lawyer and at the same time thus to sadden her future soninlaw and clara also was frightened though she knew not why his manner was so different from that which was usual he was so cold and serious and awestruck that she could not but be unhappy  and what is it said the countess  herbert then sat for a few minutes silent thinking how best he should tell them his story he had been all the morning resolving to tell it but he had in nowise as yet fixed upon any method it was all so terribly tragic so frightful in the extent of its reality that he hardly knew how it would be possible for him to get through his task  i hope that no misfortune has come upon any of the family said lady desmond now beginning to think that there might be misfortunes which would affect her own daughter more nearly than the illness either of the baronet or of his wife  oh i hope not said clara getting up and clasping her hands what is it herbert why dont you speak and coming round to him she took hold of his arm  dearest clara he said looking at her with more tenderness than had ever been usual with him i think that you had better leave us i could tell it better to your mother alone  do clara love go dearest and we will call you byandby  clara moved away very slowly towards the door and then she turned round if it is anything that makes you unhappy herbert she said i must know it before you leave me  yes yes either i or your mother you shall be told certainly  yes yes you shall be told said the countess and now go my darling thus dismissed clara did go and betook herself to her own chamber had owen had sorrows to tell her he would have told them to herself of that she was quite sure and now herbert for heavens sake what is it said the countess pale with terror she was fully certain now that something was to be spoken which would be calculated to interfere with her daughters prospects  we all know the story which herbert had to tell and we need not therefore again be present at the telling of it sitting there wet through in lady desmonds drawingroom he did contrive to utter it allthe whole of it from the beginning to the end making it clearly to be understood that he was no longer fitzgerald of castle richmond but a nameless pennyless outcast without the hope of portion or position doomed from henceforth to earn his bread in the sweat of his browif only he could be fortunate enough to find the means of earning it  nor did lady desmond once interrupt him in his story she sat perfectly still listening to him almost with unmoved face she was too wise to let him know what the instant working of her mind might be before she had made her own fixed resolve and she had conceived the truth much before he had completed the telling of it we generally use three times the number of words which are necessary for the purpose which we have in hand but had he used six times the number she would not have interrupted him it was good in him to give her this time to determine in what tone and with what words she would speak when speaking on her part should become absolutely necessary and now he concluded by sayingand at this time he was standing up on the rugyou know it all lady desmond it will perhaps be best that clara should learn it from you  he had said not a word of giving up his pretensions to lady claras hand but then neither had he in any way hinted that the match should in his opinion be regarded as unbroken he had not spoken of his sorrow at bringing down all this poverty on his wife and surely he would have so spoken had he thought their engagement was still valid but then he had not himself pointed out that the engagement must necessarily be broken as in lady desmonds opinion he certainly should have done  yes said she in a cold low meaningless voicein a voice that told nothing by its toneslady clara had better hear it from me but in the title which she gave her daughter herbert instantly read his doom he however remained silent it was for the countess now to speak  but it is possible it may not be true she said speaking almost in a whisper looking not into his face but by him at the fire  it is possible but so barely possible that i did not think it right to keep the matter from you any longer  it would have been very wrongvery wicked i may say said the countess  it is only two days since i knew anything of it myself said he vindicating himself  you were of course bound to let me know immediately she said harshly  and i have let you know immediately lady desmond and then they were both again silent for a while  and mr prendergast thinks there is no doubt she asked  none said herbert very decidedly  and he has told your cousin owen  he did so yesterday and by this time my poor mother knows it also and then there was another period of silence  during the whole time lady desmond had uttered no one word of condolencenot a syllable of commiseration for all the sufferings that had come upon herbert and his family and he was beginning to hate her for her harshness the tenor of her countenance had become hard and she received all his words as a judge might have taken them merely wanting evidence before he pronounced his verdict the evidence she was beginning to think sufficient and there could be no doubt as to her verdict after what she had heard a match between herbert fitzgerald and her daughter would be out of the question it is very dreadful she said thinking only of her own child and absolutely shivering at the danger which had been incurred  it is very dreadful said herbert shivering also it was almost incredible to him that his great sorrow should be received in such a way by one who had professed to be so dear a friend to him  and what do you propose to do mr fitzgerald said the countess  what do i propose he said repeating her words hitherto i have had neither time nor heart to propose anything such a misfortune as that which i have told you does not break upon a man without disturbing for a while his power of resolving i have thought so much of my mother and of clara since mr prendergast told me all this thatthatthat and then a slight gurgling struggle fell upon his throat and hindered him from speaking he did not quite sob out and he determined that he would not do so if she could be so harsh and strong he would be harsh and strong also  and again lady desmond sat silent still thinking how she had better speak and act after all she was not so cruel nor so bad as herbert fitzgerald thought her what had the fitzgeralds done for her that she should sorrow for their sorrows she had lived there in that old ugly barrack long desolate full of dreary wretchedness and poverty and lady fitzgerald in her prosperity had never come to her to soften the hardness of her life she had come over to ireland a countess and a countess she had been proud enough at first in her little glorytoo proud no doubt and proud enough afterwards in her loneliness and poverty and there she had livedalone whether the fault had been her own or no she owed little to the kindness of any one for no one had done aught to relieve her bitterness and then her weak puny child had grown up in the same shade and was now a lovely woman gifted with high birth and that special priceless beauty which high blood so often gives there was a prize now within the walls of that old barracksomething to be wonsomething for which a man would strive and a mother smile that her son might win it and now lady fitzgerald had come to her she had never complained of this she said to herself the bargain between clara desmond and herbert fitzgerald had been good for both of them and let it be made and settled as a bargain young herbert fitzgerald had money and position her daughter had beauty and high blood let it be a bargain but in all this there was nothing to make her love that rich prosperous family at castle richmond there are those whose nature it is to love newfound friends at a few hours warning but the countess of desmond was not one of them the bargain had been made and her daughter would have been able to perform her part of it she was still able to give that which she had stipulated to give but herbert fitzgerald was now a bankrupt and could give nothing would it not have been madness to suppose that the bargain should still hold good  one person and one only had come to her at desmond court whose coming had been a solace to her weariness of all those among whom she had lived in cold desolateness for so many years one only had got near her heart there had been but one irish voice that she had cared to hear and the owner of that voice had loved her child instead of loving her  and she had borne that wretchedness too if not well at least bravely true she had separated that lover from her daughter but the circumstances of both had made it right for her as a mother to do so what mother circumstanced as she had been would have given her girl to owen fitzgerald so she had banished from the house the only voice that sounded sweetly in her ears and again she had been alone  and then perhaps thoughts had come to her when herbert fitzgerald was frequent about the place a rich and thriving wooer that owen might come again to desmond court when clara had gone to castle richmond years were stealing over her ah yes she knew that full well all her youth and the pride of her days she had given up for that countessship which she now wore so gloomilygiven up for pieces of gold which had turned to stone and slate and dirt within her grasp years alas were fast stealing over her but nevertheless she had something to give her womans beauty was not all faded and she had a heart which was as yet virginwhich had hitherto loved no other man might not that suffice to cover a few years seeing that in return she wanted nothing but love and so she had thought lingering over her hopes while herbert was there at his wooing  it may be imagined with what feelings at her heart she had seen and listened to the frantic attempt made by owen to get back his childish love but that too she had borne bravely if not well it had not angered her that her child was loved by the only man she had ever loved herself she had stroked her daughters hair that day and kissed her cheek and bade her be happy with her better richer lover and had she not been right in this nor had she been angry even with owen she could forgive him all because she loved him but might there not even yet be a chance for her when clara should in very truth have gone to castle richmond  but now how was she to think about all this now and thinking of these things how was it possible that she should have heart left to feel for the miseries of lady fitzgerald with all her miseries would not lady fitzgerald still be more fortunate than she let come what might lady fitzgerald had had a life of prosperity and love no she could not think of lady fitzgerald nor of herbert she could only think of owen fitzgerald of her daughter and of herself  he owen was now the heir to castle richmond and would as far as she could learn soon become the actual possessor he who had been cast forth from desmond court as too poor and contemptible in the worlds eye to be her daughters suitor would become the rich inheritor of all those broad acres and that old coveted family honour and this owen still loved her daughterloved her not as herbert did with a quiet gentlemanlike everyday attachment but with the old true passionate love of which she had read in books and dreamed herself before she had sold herself to be a countess that owen did so love her daughter she was very sure and then as to her daughter that she did not still love this new heir in her heart of heartsof that the mother was by no means sure that her child had chosen the better part in choosing money and a title she had not doubted and that having so chosen clara would be happyof that also she did not doubt clara was young she would say and her heart in a few months would follow her hand  but now how was she to decide sitting there with herbert fitzgerald before her gloomy as death cold shivering and muddy telling of his own disasters with no more courage than a whipped dog as she looked at him she declared to herself twenty times in half a second that he had not about him a tithe of the manhood of his cousin owen women love a bold front and a voice that will never own its master to have been beaten in the worlds fight had owen came there with such a story he would have claimed his right boldly to the ladys hand in spite of all that the world had done to him  let her have him said lady desmond to herself and the struggle within her bosom was made and over no wonder that herbert looking into her face for pity should find that she was harsh and cruel she had been sacrificing herself and had completed the sacrifice owen fitzgerald the heir to castle richmond sir owen as he would soon be should have her daughter they two at any rate should be happy and sheshe would live there at desmond court lonely as she had ever lived while all this was passing through her mind she hardly thought of herbert and his sorrows that he must be given up and abandoned and left to make what best fight he could by himself as to that how was it possible that she as a mother should have any doubt  and yet it was a pitya thousand pities herbert fitzgerald with his domestic virtues his industry and thorough respectability would so exactly have suited claras taste and mode of lifehad he only continued to be the heir of castle richmond she and owen would not enter upon the world together with nearly the same fair chance of happiness who could prophecy to what owen might be led with his passionate impulses his strong will his unbridled temper and his love of pleasure that he was noblehearted affectionate brave and tender in his inmost spirit lady desmond was very sure but were such the qualities which would make her daughter happy when clara should come to know her future lord as claras mother knew him would clara love him and worship him as her mother did the mother believed that clara had not in her bosom heart enough for such a love but then as i have said before the mother did not know the daughter  you say that you will break all this to clara said herbert having during this silence turned over some of his thoughts also in his mind if so i may as well leave you now you can imagine that i am anxious to get back to my mother  yes it will be better that i should tell her it is very sad very sad very sad indeed  yes it is a hard load for a man to bear he answered speaking very very slowly but for myself i think i can bear it if  if what asked the countess  if clara can bear it  and now it was necessary that lady desmond should speak out she did not mean to be unnecessarily harsh but she did mean to be decided and as she spoke her face became stern and illfavoured that clara will be terribly distressed she said terribly terribly distressed repeating her words with great emphasis of that i am quite sure she is very young and will i hope in time get over it and then too i think she is one whose feelings young as she is have never conquered her judgment therefore i do believe that with gods mercy she will be able to bear it but mr fitzgerald  well  of course you feel with meand i am sure that with your excellent judgment it is a thing of coursethat everything must be over between you and lady clara and then she came to a full stop as though all had been said that could be considered necessary  herbert did not answer at once but stood there shivering and shaking in his misery he was all but overcome by the chill of his wet garments and though he struggled to throw off the dead feeling of utter cold which struck him to the heart he was quite unable to master it he could hardly forgive himself that on such an occasion he should have been so conquered by his own outer feelings but now he could not help himself he was weak with hunger toothough he did not know it for he had hardly eaten food that day and was nearly exhausted with the unaccustomed amount of hard exercise which he had taken he was moreover thoroughly wet through and heavy laden with the mud of the road it was no wonder that lady desmond had said to herself that he looked like a whipped dog  that must be as lady clara shall decide he said at last barely uttering the words through his chattering teeth  it must be as i say said the countess firmly whether by her decision or by yoursor if necessary by mine but if your feelings are as i take them to be those of a man of honour you will not leave it to me or to her what now that you have the world to struggle with would you seek to drag her down into the struggle  our union was to be for better or worse i would have given her all the better and  yes and had there been a union she would have bravely borne her part in sharing the worst but who ought to be so thankful as you that this truth has broken upon you before you had clogged yourself with a wife of high birth but without fortune alone a man educated as you are with your talents may face the world without fearing anything but how could you make your way now if my daughter were your wife when you think of it mr fitzgerald you will cease to wish for it  never i have given my heart to your daughter and i cannot take back the gift she has accepted it and she cannot return it  and what would you have her do lady desmond asked with anger and almost passion in her voice  waitas i must wait said herbert that will be her duty as i believe it will also be her wish  yes and wear out her young heart here in solitude for the next ten years and then learn when her beauty and her youth are gone but no mr fitzgerald i will not allow myself to contemplate such a prospect either for her or for you under the lamentable circumstances which you have now told me it is imperative that this match should be broken off ask your own mother and hear what she will say and if you are a man you will not throw upon my poor child the hard task of declaring that it must be so you by your calamity are unable to perform your contract with her and it is for you to announce that that contract is therefore over  herbert in his present state was unable to argue with lady desmond he had in his brain and mind and heart and soulat least so he said to himself afterwards having perhaps but a loose idea of the different functions of these four different propertiesa thorough conviction that as he and clara had sworn to each other that for life they would live together and love each other no misfortune to either of them could justify the other in breaking that oathcould even justify him in breaking it though he was the one on whom misfortune had fallen he no doubt had first loved clara for her beauty but would he have ceased to love her or have cast her from him if by gods will her beauty had perished and gone from her would he not have held her closer to his heart and told her with strong comforting vows that his love had now gone deeper than that that they were already of the same bone of the same flesh of the same family and hearthstone he knew himself in this and knew that he would have been proud so to do and so to feelthat he would have cast from him with utter indignation any who would have counselled him to do or to feel differently and why should claras heart be different from his  all this i say was his strong conviction but nevertheless her heart might be different she might look on that engagement of theirs with altogether other thoughts and other ideas and if so his voice should never reproach hernot his voice however his heart might do so such might be the case with her but he did not think it and therefore he would not pronounce that decision which claras mother expected from him  when you have told her of this i suppose i may be allowed to see her he said avoiding the direct proposition which lady desmond had made to him  allowed to see her said lady desmond now also in her turn speaking very slowly i cannot answer that question as yet not quite immediately i should say but if you will leave the matter in my hands i will write to you if not tomorrow then the next day  i would sooner that she should write  i cannot promise thati do not know how far her good sense and strength may support her under this affliction that she will suffer terribly on your account as well as on her own you may be quite sure and then again there was a pause of some moments  i at any rate shall write to her he then said and shall tell her that i expect her to see me her will in this matter shall be my will if she thinks that her misery will be greater in being engaged to a poor man thanthan in relinquishing her love she shall hear no word from me to overpersuade her but lady desmond i will say nothing that shall authorize her to think that she is given up by me till i have in some way learned from herself what her own feelings are and now i will say goodbye to you  goodbye said the countess thinking that it might be as well that the interview should be ended but mr fitzgerald you are very wet and i fear that you are very cold you had better take something before you go countess as she was she had no carriage in which she could send him home no horse even on which he could ride nothing thank you lady desmond he said and so without offering her the courtesy of his hand he walked out of the room  he was very angry with her as he tried to make the blood run quicker in his veins by hurrying down the avenue into the road at his quickest pace so angry with her that for a while in his indignation he almost forgot his father and his mother and his own family tragedy that she should have wished to save her daughter from such a marriage might have been natural but that she should have treated him so coldly so harshlywithout one spark of love or pityhim who to her had been so loyal during his courtship of her daughter it was almost incredible to him was not his story one that would have melted the heart of a strangerat which men would weep he himself had seen tears in the eyes of that dry timeworn worldused london lawyer as the full depth of the calamity had forced itself upon his heart yes mr prendergast had not been able to repress his tears when he told the tale but lady desmond had shed no tears when the tale had been told to her no soft womans message had been sent to the afflicted mother on whom it had pleased god to allow so heavy a hand to fall no word of tenderness had been uttered for the sinking father there had been no feeling for the household which was to have been so nearly linked with her own no looking round with greedy eyes for wealth for her daughter lady desmond had found a match that suited her now that match no longer suited her greed and she could throw from her without a struggle to her feelings the suitor that was now poor and the family of the suitor that was now neither grand nor powerful  and then too he felt angry with clara though he knew that as yet at any rate he had no cause in spite of what he had said and felt he would imagine to himself that she also would be cold and untrue let her go he said to himself love is worth nothingnothing if it does not believe itself to be of more worth than everything beside if she does not love me now in my miseryif she would not choose me now for her husbandher love has never been worthy the name love that has no faith in itself that does not value itself above all worldly things is nothing if it be not so with her let her go back to him  it may easily be understood who was the him and then herbert walked on so rapidly that at length his strength almost failed him and in his exhaustion he had more than once to lean against a gate on the roadside with difficulty at last he got home and dragged himself up the long avenue to the front door even yet he was not warm through to his heart and he felt as he entered the house that he was quite unfitted for the work which he might yet have to do before he could go to his bed     chapter xxvii  comforted   when herbert fitzgerald got back to castle richmond it was nearly dark he opened the hall door without ringing the bell and walking at once into the diningroom threw himself into a large leathern chair which always stood near the fireplace there was a bright fire burning on the hearth and he drew himself close to it putting his wet feet up on to the fender thinking that he would at any rate warm himself before he went in among any of the family the room with its deep red curtains and rubyembossed paper was almost dark and he knew that he might remain there unseen and unnoticed for the next half hour if he could only get a glass of wine he tried the cellaret which was as often open as locked but now unfortunately it was closed in such a case it was impossible to say whether the butler had the key or aunt letty so he sat himself down without that luxury  by this time as he well knew all would have been told to his mother and his first duty would be to go to herto go to her and comfort her if comfort might be possible by telling her that he could bear it all that as far as he was concerned title and wealth and a proud name were as nothing to him in comparison with his mothers love in whatever guise he may have appeared before lady desmond he would not go to his mother with a fainting heart she should not hear his teeth chatter nor see his limbs shake so he sat himself down there that he might become warm and in five minutes he was fast asleep  how long he slept he did not know not very long probably but when he awoke it was quite dark he gazed at the fire for a moment bethought himself of where he was and why shook himself to get rid of his slumber and then roused himself in his chair as he did so a soft sweet voice close to his shoulder spoke to him herbert it said are you awake and he found that his mother seated by his side on a low stool had been watching him in his sleep  mother he exclaimed  herbert my child my son and the mother and son were fast locked in each others arms  he had sat down there thinking how he would go to his mother and offer her solace in her sorrow how he would bid her be of good cheer and encourage her to bear the world as the world had now fallen to her lot he had pictured to himself that he would find her sinking in despair and had promised himself that with his vows his kisses and his prayers he would bring her back to her selfconfidence and induce her to acknowledge that gods mercy was yet good to her but now on awakening he discovered that she had been tending him in his misery and watching him while he slept that she might comfort him with her caresses the moment that he awoke to the remembrance of his misfortunes  herbert herbert my son my son she said again as she pressed him close in her arms  mother has he told you  yes she had learned it all but hardly more than she had known before or at any rate not more than she had expected as she now told him for many days past she had felt that this trouble which had fallen upon his father must have come from the circumstances of their marriage and she would have spoken out she said when the idea became clear to her had she not then been told that mr prendergast had been invited to come thither from london then she knew that she had better remain silent at any rate till his visit had been made  and herbert again sat in the chair and his mother crouched or almost kneeled on the cushion at his knee dearest dearest dearest mother he said as he supported her head against his shoulder we must love each other now more than ever we have loved  and you forgive us herbert for all that we have done to you  mother if you speak in that way to me you will kill me my darling darling mother  there was but little more said between them upon the matterbut little more at least in words but there was an infinity of caresses and deepdeep assurances of undying love and confidence and then she asked him about his bride and he told her where he had been and what had happened you must not claim her herbert she said to him god is good and will teach you to bear even that also  must i not he asked with a sadly plaintive voice  no my child you invited her to share your prosperity and would it be just  but mother if she wills it  it is for you to give her back her troth then leave it to time and her own heart  but if she love me mother she will not take back her troth would i take back hers because she was in sorrow  men and women herbert are different the oak cares not whether the creeper which hangs to it be weak or strong if it be weak the oak can give it strength but the staff which has to support the creeper must needs have strength of its own  he made no further answer to her but understood that he must do as she bade him he understood now also without many arguments within himself that he had no right to expect from clara desmond that adherence to him and his misfortunes which he would have owed to her had she been unfortunate he understood this now but still he hoped two hearts that have once become as one cannot be separated he said to himself that night as he resolved that it was his duty to write to her unconditionally returning to her her pledges  but herbert what a state you are in said lady fitzgerald as the flame of the coal glimmering out threw a faint light upon his clothes  yes mother i have been walking  and you are wet  i am nearly dry now i was wet but mother i am tired and fagged it would do me good if i could get a glass of wine  she rang the bell and gave her orders calmlythough every servant in the house now knew the whole truthand then lit a candle herself and looked at him my child what have you done to yourself oh herbert you will be ill and then with his arm round her waist she took him up to her own room and sat by him while he took off his muddy boots and clammy socks and made him hot drinks and tended him as she had done when he was a child and yet she had that day heard of her great ruin with truth indeed had mr prendergast said that she was made of more enduring material than sir thomas  and she endeavoured to persuade him to go to his bed but in this he would not listen to her he must he said see his father that night you have been with him mother sincesince  oh yes directly after mr prendergast left me  well  he cried like a child herbert we both sobbed together like two children it was very piteous but i think i left him better than he has been he knows now that those men cannot come again to harass him  herbert gnashed his teeth and clenched his fist as he thought of them but he could not speak of them or mention their name before his mother what must her thoughts be as she remembered that elder man and looked back to her early childhood  he is very weak she went on to say almost helplessly weak now and does not seem to think of leaving his bed i have begged him to let me send to dublin for sir henry but he says that nothing ails him  and who is with him now mother  the girls are both there  and mr prendergast  lady fitzgerald then explained to him that mr prendergast had returned to dublin that afternoon starting twentyfour hours earlier than he intendedor at any rate than he had said that he intended having done his work there he had felt that he would now only be in the way and moreover though his work was done at castle richmond other work in the same matter had still to be done in england mr prendergast had very little doubt as to the truth of molletts storyindeed we may say he had no doubt otherwise he would hardly have made it known to all that world round castle richmond but nevertheless it behoved him thoroughly to sift the matter he felt tolerably sure that he should find mollett in london and whether he did or no he should be able to identify or not to identify that scoundrel with the mr talbot who had hired chevy chase lodge in dorsetshire and who had undoubtedly married poor mary wainwright  he left a kind message for you said lady fitzgeraldmy readers must excuse me if i still call her lady fitzgerald for i cannot bring my pen to the use of any other name and it was so also with the dependents and neighbours of castle richmond when the time came that the poor lady felt that she was bound publicly to drop her title it was not in her power to drop it no effort that she could make would induce those around her to call her by another name  he bade me say she continued that if your future course of life should take you to london you are to go to him and look to him as another father he has no child of his own he said and you shall be to him as a son  i will be no ones son but yoursyours and my fathers he said again embracing her  and then when under his mothers eye he had eaten and drank and made himself warm he did go to his father and found both his sisters sitting there they came and clustered round him taking hold of his hands and looking up into his face loving him and pitying him and caressing him with their eyes but standing there by their fathers bed they said little or nothing nor did sir thomas say muchexcept this indeed that just as herbert was leaving him he declared with a faint voice that henceforth his son should be master of that house and the disposer of that propertyas long as i live he exclaimed with his weak voice as long as i live  no father not so  yes yes as long as i live it will be little that you will have even sovery little but so it shall be as long as i live  very little indeed poor man for alas his days were numbered  and then when herbert left the room emmeline followed him she had ever been his dearest sister and now she longed to be with him that she might tell him how she loved him and comfort him with her tears and clara tooclara whom she had welcomed as a sistershe must learn now how clara would behave for she had already made herself sure that her brother had been at desmond court the herald of his own ruin  may i come with you herbert she asked closing in round him and getting under his arm how could he refuse her so they went together and sat over a fire in a small room that was sacred to her and her sister and there with many sobs on her part and much wouldbe brave contempt of poverty on his they talked over the altered world as it now showed itself before them  and you did not see her she asked when with many efforts she had brought the subject round to clara desmond and her brothers walk to desmond court  no she left the room at my own bidding i could not have told it myself to her  and you cannot know then what she would say  no i cannot know what she would say but i know now what i must say myself all that is over emmeline i cannot ask her to marry a beggar  ask her no there will be no need of asking her she has already given you her promise you do not think that she will desert you you do not wish it  herein were contained two distinct questions the latter of which herbert did not care to answer i shall not call it desertion he said indeed the proposal will come from me i shall write to her telling her that she need think about me no longer only that i am so weary i would do it now  and how will she answer you if she is the clara that i take her for she will throw your proposal back into your face she will tell you that it is not in your power to reject her now she will swear to you that let your words be what they may she will think of youmore now than she has ever thought in better days she will tell you of her love in words that she could not use before i know she will i know that she is good and true and honest and generous oh i should die if i thought she were false but herbert i am sure that she is true you can write your letter and we shall see  herbert with wise arguments learned from his mother reasoned with his sister explaining to her that clara was now by no means bound to cling to him but as he spoke them his arm fastened itself closely round his sisters waist for the words which she uttered with so much energy were comfortable to him  and then seated there before he moved from the room he made her bring him pens ink and paper and he wrote his letter to clara desmond she would fain have stayed with him while he did so sitting at his feet and looking into his face and trying to encourage his hope as to what claras answer might be but this he would not allow so she went again to her fathers room having succeeded in obtaining a promise that claras answer should be shown to her and the letter when it was written copied and recopied ran as follows      castle richmond  night     my dearest clara   it was with great difficulty that he could satisfy himself with that or indeed with any other mode of commencement in the short little lovenotes which had hitherto gone from him sent from house to house he had written to her with appellations of endearment of his ownas all lovers do and as all lovers seem to think that no lovers have done before themselveswith appellations which are so sweet to those who write and so musical to those who read but which sound so ludicrous when barbarously made public in hideous law courts by brazenbrowed lawyers with mercenary tongues in this way only had he written and each of these sweet silly songs of love had been as full of honey as words could make it but he had never yet written to her on a full sheet of paper a sensible positive letter containing thoughts and facts as men do write to women and women also to men when the lollypops and candied sugardrops of early love have passed away now he was to write his first serious letter to herand probably his lastand it was with difficulty that he could get himself over the first three words but there they were decided on at last      my dearest clara     before you get this your mother will have told you    all that which i could not bring myself to speak out    yesterday as long as you were in the room i am sure you    will understand now why i begged you to go away and will    not think the worse of me for doing so you now know the    whole truth and i am sure that you will feel for us all    here     having thought a good deal upon the matter chiefly during    my walk home from desmond court and indeed since i    have been at home i have come to the resolution that    everything between us must be over it would be unmanly    in me to wish to ruin you because i myself am ruined our    engagement was of course made on the presumption that    i should inherit my fathers estate as it is i shall    not do so and therefore i beg that you will regard that    engagement as at an end of my own love for you i will say    nothing but i know that you have loved me truly and that    all this therefore will cause you great grief it is    better however that it should be so than that i should    seek to hold you to a promise which was made under such    different circumstances     you will of course show this letter to your mother she    at any rate will approve of what i am now doing and so    will you when you allow yourself to consider it calmly     we have not known each other so long that there is much    for us to give back to each other if you do not think it    wrong i should like still to keep that lock of your hair    to remind me of my first loveand as i think my only    one and you i hope will not be afraid to have near you    the one little present that i made you     and now dearest clara goodbye let us always think    each of the other as of a very dear friend may god bless    you and preserve you and make you happy     yours with sincere affection     herbert fitzgerald   this when at last he had succeeded in writing it he read over and over again but on each occasion he said to himself that it was cold and passionless stilted and unmeaning it by no means pleased him and seemed as though it could bring but one answera cold acquiescence in the proposal which he so coldly made but yet he knew not how to improve it and after all it was a true exposition of that which he had determined to say all the worldher world and his worldwould think it better that they should part and let the struggle cost him what it would he would teach himself to wish that it might be soif not for his own sake then for hers so he fastened the letter and taking it with him determined to send it over so that it should reach clara quite early on the following morning  and then having once more visited his father and once more kissed his mother he betook himself to bed it had been with him one of those days which seem to pass away without reference to usual hours and periods it had been long dark and he seemed to have been hanging about the house doing nothing and aiding nobody till he was weary of himself so he went off to bed almost wondering as he bethought himself of what had happened to him within the last two days that he was able to bear the burden of his life so easily as he did he betook himself to bed and with the letter close at his hand so that he might despatch it when he awoke he was soon asleep after all that walk terrible as it had been was in the end serviceable to him  he slept without waking till the light of the february morning was beginning to dawn into his room and then he was roused by a servant knocking at the door it was grievous enough that awaking to his sorrow after the pleasant dreams of the night  here is a letter mr herbert from desmond court said richard the boy as brought it says as how  a letter from desmond court said herbert putting out his hand greedily  yes mr herbert the boys been here this hour and better i warnt just up and about myself or i wouldnt have let em keep it from you not half a minute  and where is he i have a letter to send to desmond court but never mind perhaps  its no good minding for the gossoons gone back any ways and then richard having drawn the blind and placed a little table by the bedhead left his young master to read the despatch from desmond court herbert till he saw the writing feared that it was from the countess but the letter was from clara she also had thought good to write before she betook herself to bed and she had been earlier in despatching her messenger here is her letter      dear herbert my own herbert     i have heard it all but remember this nothing nothing    nothing can make any change between you and me i will    hear of no arguments that are to separate us i know    beforehand what you will say but i will not regard    itnot in the least i love you ten times the more for    all your unhappiness and as i would have shared your good    fortune i claim my right to share your bad fortune pray    believe me that nothing shall turn me from this for i    will not be given up     give my kindest love to your dear dear dearest    mothermy mother as she is and must be and to my    darling girls i do so wish i could be with them and with    you my own herbert i cannot help writing in confusion    but i will explain all when i see you i have been so    unhappy     your own faithful     clara   having read this herbert fitzgerald in spite of his affliction was comforted     chapter xxviii  for a that and a that   herbert as he started from his bed with this letter in his hand felt that he could yet hold up his head against all that the world could do to him how could he be really unhappy while he possessed such an assurance of love as this and while his mother was able to give him so glorious an example of endurance he was not really unhappy the lowspirited brokenhearted wretchedness of the preceding day seemed to have departed from him as he hurried on his clothes and went off to his sisters room that he might show his letter to emmeline in accordance with the promise he had made her  may i come in he said knocking at the door i must come in for i have something to show you but the two girls were dressing and he could not be admitted emmeline however promised to come to him and in about three minutes she was out in the cold little sittingroom which adjoined their bedroom with her slippers on and her dressing gown wrapped round her an object presentable to no male eyes but those of her brother  emmeline said he i have got a letter this morning  not from clara  yes from clara there you may read it and he handed her the precious epistle  but she could not have got your letter said emmeline before she looked at the one in her hand  certainly not for i have it here i must write another now but in truth i do not know what to say i can be as generous as she is  and then his sister read the letter my own clara she exclaimed as she saw what was the tenor of it did i not tell you so herbert i knew well what she would do and say love you ten times betterof course she does what honest girl would not my own beautiful clara i knew i could depend on her i did not doubt her for one moment but in this particular it must be acknowledged that miss emmeline fitzgerald hardly confined herself to the strictest veracity for she had lain awake half the night perplexed with doubt what oh what if clara should be untrue such had been the burden of her doubting midnight thoughts i will not be given up she continued quoting the letter no of course not and i tell you what herbert you must not dare to talk of giving her up money and titles may be tossed to and fro but not hearts how beautifully she speaks of dear mamma and now the tears began to run down the young ladys cheeks oh i do wish she could be with us my darling darling darling clara unhappy yes i am sure lady desmond will give her no peace but never mind she will be true through it all and i said so from the first and then she fell to crying and embracing her brother and declaring that nothing now should make her altogether unhappy  but emmeline you must not think that i shall take her at her word it is very generous of her  nonsense herbert and then there was another torrent of eloquence in answering which herbert found that his arguments were of very little efficacy  and now we must go back to desmond court and see under what all but overwhelming difficulties poor clara wrote her affectionate letter and in the first place it should be pointed out how very wrong herbert had been in going to desmond court on foot through the mud and rain a man can hardly bear himself nobly unless his outer aspect be in some degree noble it may be very sad this having to admit that the tailor does in great part make the man but such i fear is undoubtedly the fact could the chancellor look dignified on the woolsack if he had had an accident with his wig or allowed his robes to be torn or soiled does not half the piety of a bishop reside in his lawn sleeves and all his meekness in his antivirile apron had herbert understood the world he would have had out the best pair of horses standing in the castle richmond stables when going to desmond court on such an errand he would have brushed his hair and anointed himself he would have clothed himself in his rich spanish cloak he would have seen that his hat was brushed and his boots spotless and then with all due solemnity but with head erect he would have told his tale out boldly the countess would still have wished to be rid of him hearing that he was a pauper but she would have lacked the courage to turn him from the house as she had done  but seeing how wobegone he was and wretched how mean to look at and low in his outward presence she had been able to assume the mastery and had kept it throughout the interview and having done this her opinion of his prowess naturally became low and she felt that he would have been unable to press his cause against her  for some time after he had departed she sat alone in the room in which she had received him she expected every minute that clara would come down to her still wishing however that she might be left for a while alone but clara did not come and she was able to pursue her thoughts  how very terrible was this tragedy that had fallen out in her close neighbourhood that was the first thought that came to her now that herbert had left her how terrible overwhelming and fatal what calamity could fall upon a woman so calamitous as this which had now overtaken that poor lady at castle richmond could she live and support such a burden could she bear the eyes of people when she knew the light in which she must be now regarded to lose at one blow her name her pride of place her womans rank and high respect could it be possible that she would still live on it was thus that lady desmond thought and had any one told her that this degraded mother would that very day come down from her room and sit watchful by her sleeping son in order that she might comfort and encourage him when he awoke she would not have found it in her heart to believe such a marvel but then lady desmond knew but one solace in her sorrowshad but one comfort in her sad reflections she was countess of desmond and that was all to lady fitzgerald had been vouchsafed other solace and other comforts  and then on one point the countess made herself fixed as fate by thinking and rethinking upon it till no doubt remained upon her mind the match between clara and herbert must be broken off let the cost be what it might anda point on which there was more room for doubt and more pain in coming to a conclusionthat other match with the more fortunate cousin must be encouraged and carried out for herself if her hope was small while owen was needy and of poor account what hope could there be now that he would be rich and great moreover owen loved clara and not herself and claras hand would once more be vacant and ready for the winning for herself her only chance had been in claras coming marriage  in all this she knew that there would be difficulty she was sure enough that clara would at first feel the imprudent generosity of youth and offer to join her poverty to herberts poverty that was a matter of course she lady desmond herself would have done this at claras ageso at least to herself she said and also to her daughter but a little time and a little patience and a little care would set all this in a proper light herbert would go away and would gradually be forgotten owen would again come forth from beneath the clouds with renewed splendour and then was it not probable that in her very heart of hearts owen was the man whom clara had ever loved  and thus having realized to herself the facts which herbert had told her she prepared to make them known to her daughter she got up from her chair intending at first to seek her and then changing her purpose rang the bell and sent for her she was astonished to find how violently she herself was affected not so much by the circumstances as by this duty which had fallen to her of telling them to her child she put one hand upon the other and felt that she herself was in a tremor and was conscious that the blood was running quick round her heart clara came down and going to her customary seat waited till her mother should speak to her  mr fitzgerald has brought very dreadful news lady desmond said after a minutes pause  oh mamma said clara she had expected bad tidings having thought of all manner of miseries while she had been up stairs alone but there was that in her mothers voice which seemed to be worse than the worst of her anticipations  dreadful indeed my child it is my duty to tell them to you but i must caution you before i do so to place a guard upon your feelings that which i have to say must necessarily alter all your future prospects and unfortunately make your marrying herbert fitzgerald quite impossible  mamma she exclaimed with a loud voice jumping from her chair not marry him why what can he have done is it his wish to break it off  lady desmond had calculated that she would best effect her object by at once impressing her daughter with the idea that under the circumstances which were about to be narrated this marriage would not only be imprudent but altogether impracticable and out of the question clara must be made to understand at once that the circumstances gave her no optionthat the affair was of such a nature as to make it a thing manifest to everybody that she could not now marry herbert fitzgerald she must not be left to think whether she could or whether she could not exercise her own generosity and therefore not without discretion the countess announced at once to her the conclusion at which it would be necessary to arrive but clara was not a girl to adopt such a conclusion on any other judgment than her own or to be led in such a matter by the feelings of any other person  sit down my dear and i will explain it all but dearest clara grieved as i must be to grieve you i am bound to tell you again that it must be as i say for both your sakes it must be so but especially perhaps for his but when i have told you my story you will understand that this must be so  tell me then mother she said this for lady desmond had again paused  wont you sit down dearest  well yes it does not matter and clara at her mothers bidding sat down and then the story was told to her  it was a difficult tale for a mother to tell to so young a childto a child whom she had regarded as being so very young there were various little points of law which she thought that she was obliged to explain how it was necessary that the castle richmond property should go to an heiratlaw and how it was impossible that herbert should be that heiratlaw seeing that he had not been born in lawful wedlock all these things lady desmond attempted to explain or was about to attempt such explanation but desisted on finding that her daughter understood them as well as she herself did and then she had to make it also intelligible to clara that owen would be called on when sir thomas should die to fill the position and enjoy the wealth accruing to the heir of castle richmond when owen fitzgeralds name was mentioned a slight blush came upon claras cheek it was very slight but nevertheless her mother saw it and took advantage of it to say a word in owens favour  poor owen she said he will not be the first to triumph in this change of fortune  i am sure he will not said clara he is much too generous for that and then the countess began to hope that the task might not be so very difficult ignorant woman had she been able to read one page in her daughters heart she would have known that the task was impossible after that the story was told out to the end without further interruption and then clara hiding her face within her hands on the head of the sofa uttered one long piteous moan  it is all very dreadful said the countess  oh lady fitzgerald dear lady fitzgerald sobbed forth clara  yes indeed poor lady fitzgerald her fate is so dreadful that i know not how to think of it  but mamma and as she spoke clara pushed back from her forehead her hair with both her hands showing as she did so the form of her forehead and the firmness of purpose that was written there legible to any eyes that could read but mamma you are wrong about my not marrying herbert fitzgerald why should i not marry him not now as we perhaps might have done but for this but at some future time when he may think himself able to support a wife mamma i shall not break our engagement certainly not  this was said in a tone of voice so very decided that lady desmond had to acknowledge to herself that there would be difficulty in her task but she still did not doubt that she would have her way if not by concession on the part of her daughter then by concession on the part of herbert fitzgerald i can understand your generosity of feeling my dear she said and at your age i should probably have felt the same and therefore i do not ask you to take any steps towards breaking your engagement the offer must come from mr fitzgerald and i have no doubt that it will come he as a man of honour will know that he cannot now offer to marry you and he will also know as a man of sense that it would be ruin for him to think ofof such a marriage under his present circumstances  why mamma why should it be ruin to him  why my dear do you think that a wife with a titled name can be of advantage to a young man who has not only got his bread to earn but even to look out for a way in which he may earn it  if there be nothing to hurt him but the titled name that difficulty shall be easily conquered  dearest clara you know what i mean you must be aware that a girl of your rank and brought up as you have been cannot be a fitting wife for a man who will now have to struggle with the world at every turn  clara as this was said to her and as she prepared to answer blushed deeply for she felt herself obliged to speak on a matter which had never yet been subject of speech between her and her mother mamma she said i cannot agree with you there i may have what the world calls rank but nevertheless we have been poor and i have not been brought up with costly habits why should i not live with my husband asasas poorly as i have lived with my mother you are not rich dear mamma and why should i be  lady desmond did not answer her daughter at once but she was not silent because an answer failed her her answer would have been ready enough had she dared to speak it out yes it is true we have been poor i your mother did by my imprudence bring down upon my head and on yours absolute unrelenting pitiless poverty and because i did so i have never known one happy hour i have spent my days in bitter remorsein regretting the want of those things which it has been the more terrible to want as they are the customary attributes of people of my rank i have been driven to hate those around me who have been rich because i have been poor i have been utterly friendless because i have been poor i have been able to do none of those sweet soft lovely things by doing which other women win the smiles of the world because i have been poor poverty and rank together have made me wretchedhave left me without employment without society and without love and now would you tell me that because i have been poor you would choose to be poor also it would have been thus that she would have answered had she been accustomed to speak out her thoughts but she had ever been accustomed to conceal them  i was thinking quite as much of him as of you at last she said such an engagement to you would be fraught with much misery but to him it would be ruinous  i do not think it mamma  but it is not necessary clara that you should do anything you will wait of course and see what herbert may say himself  herbert  wait half a moment my love i shall be very much surprised if we do not find that mr fitzgerald himself will tell you that the match must be abandoned  but that will make no difference mamma  no difference my dear you cannot marry him against his will you do not mean to say that you would wish to bind him to his engagement if he himself thought it would be to his disadvantage  yes i will bind him to it  clara  i will make him know that it is not for his disadvantage i will make him understand that a friend and companion who loves him as i love himas no one else will ever love him nowfor i love him because he was so highfortuned when he came to me and because he is now so lowfortunedthat such a wife as i will be cannot be a burden to him i will cling to him whether he throws me off or no a word from him might have broken our engagement before but a thousand words cannot do it now  lady desmond stared at her daughter for clara in her excitement was walking up and down the room the countess had certainly not expected all this and she was beginning to think that the subject for the present might as well be left alone but clara had not done as yet  mamma she said i will not do anything without telling you but i cannot leave herbert in all his misery to think that i have no sympathy with him i shall write to him  not before he writes to you clara you would not wish to be indelicate  i know but little about delicacywhat people call delicacy but i will not be ungenerous or unkind mamma you brought us two together was it not so did you not do so fearing that i mightmight still care for herberts cousin you did it and half wishing to obey you half attracted by all his goodness i did learn to love herbert fitzgerald and i did learn to forgetno but i learned to cease to love his cousin you did this and rejoiced at it and now what you did must remain done  but dearest clara it will not be for his good  it shall be for his good mamma i would not desert him now for all that the world could give me neither for mother nor brother could i do that without your leave i would not have given him the right to regard me as his own but now i cannot take that right back again even at your wish i must write to him at once mamma and tell him this  clara at any rate you must not do that that at least i must forbid  mother you cannot forbid it now the daughter said after walking twice the length of the room in silence if i be not allowed to send a letter i shall leave the house and go to him  this was all very dreadful lady desmond was astounded at the manner in which her daughter carried herself and the voice with which she spoke the form of her face was altered and the very step with which she trod was unlike her usual gait what would lady desmond do she was not prepared to confine her daughter as a prisoner nor could she publicly forbid the people about the place to go upon her message  i did not expect that you would have been so undutiful she said  i hope i am not so clara answered but now my first duty is to him did you not sanction our loving each other people cannot call back their hearts and their pledges  you will at any rate wait till tomorrow clara  it is dark now said clara despondingly looking out through the window upon the falling night i suppose i cannot send tonight  and you will show me what you write dearest  no mamma if i wrote it for your eyes it could not be the same as if i wrote it only for his  very gloomy sombre and silent was the countess of desmond all that night nothing further was said about the fitzgeralds between her and her daughter before they went to bed and then lady desmond did speak a few futile words  clara she said you had better think over what we have been saying in bed tonight you will be more collected tomorrow morning  i shall think of it of course said clara but thinking can make no difference and then just touching her mothers forehead with her lips she went off slowly to her room  what sort of a letter she wrote when she got there we have already seen and have seen also that she took effective steps to have her letter carried to castle richmond at an hour sufficiently early in the morning there was no danger that the countess would stop the message for the letter had been read twenty times by emmeline and mary and had been carried by herbert to his mothers room before lady desmond had left her bed do not set your heart on it too warmly said herberts mother to him  but is she not excellent said herbert it is because she speaks of you in such a way  you would not wish to bring her into misery because of her excellence  but mother i am still a man said herbert this was too much for the suffering woman the one fault of whose life had brought her son to such a pass and throwing her arm round his neck she wept upon his shoulders  there were other messengers went and came that day between desmond court and castle richmond clara and her mother saw nothing of each other early in the morning they did not breakfast together nor was there a word said between them on the subject of the fitzgeralds but lady desmond early in the morningearly for her that issent her note also to castle richmond it was addressed to aunt letty miss letitia fitzgerald and went to say that lady desmond was very anxious to see miss letty under the present circumstances of the family as described to lady desmond by mr herbert fitzgerald she felt that she could not ask to see his motherit was thus that she overcame the difficulty which presented itself to her as to the proper title now to be given to lady fitzgeraldbut perhaps miss letty would be good enough to see her if she called at such and such an hour aunt letty much perplexed had nothing for it but to say that she would see her the countess must now be looked on as closely connected with the familyat any rate until that match were broken off and therefore aunt letty had no alternative and so precisely at the hour named the countess and aunt letty were seated together in the little breakfastroom of which mention has before been made  no two women were ever closeted together who were more unlike each otherexcept that they had one common strong love for family rank but in aunt letty it must be acknowledged that this passion was not unwholesome or malevolent in its course of action she delighted in being a fitzgerald and in knowing that her branch of the fitzgeralds had been considerable people ever since her norman ancestor had come over to ireland with strongbow but then she had a useful idea that considerable people should do a considerable deal of good her family pride operated more inwardly than outwardlyinwardly as regarded her own family and not outwardly as regarded the world her brother and her nephew and her sisterinlaw and nieces were she thought among the highest commoners in ireland they were gentlefolks of the first water and walked openly before the world accordingly proving their claim to gentle blood by gentle deeds and honest conduct perhaps she did think too much of the fitzgeralds of castle richmond but the sin was one of which no recording angel could have made much in his entry that she was a stupid old woman prejudiced in the highest degree and horribly ignorant of all the world beyond her own very narrow circleeven of that i do not think that the recording angel could under the circumstances have made a great deal  and now how was her family pride affected by this horrible catastrophe that had been made known to her herbert the heir whom as heir she had almost idolized was nobody her sisterinlaw whom she had learned to love with the whole of her big heart was no sisterinlaw her brother was one who in lieu of adding glory to the family would always be regarded as the most unfortunate of the fitzgerald baronets but with her human nature was stronger than family pride and she loved them all not better but more tenderly than ever  the two ladies were closeted together for about two hours and then when the door was opened aunt letty might have been seen with her bonnet much on one side and her poor old eyes and cheeks red with weeping the countess too held her handkerchief to her eyes as she got back into her pony carriage she saw no one else there but aunt letty and from her mood when she returned to desmond court it might be surmised that from aunt letty she had learned little to comfort her  they will be beggars she said to herselfbeggarswhen the door of her own room had closed upon her and there are few people in the world who held such beggary in less esteem than did the countess of desmond it may almost be said that she hated herself on account of her own poverty     chapter xxix  ill news flies fast   a dull cold wretched week passed over their heads at castle richmond during which they did nothing but realize the truth of their position and then came a letter from mr prendergast addressed to herbert in which he stated that such inquiries as he had hitherto made left no doubt on his mind that the man named mollett who had lately made repeated visits at castle richmond was he who had formerly taken the house in dorsetshire under the name of talbot in his packet mr prendergast sent copies of documents and of verbal evidence which he had managed to obtain but with the actual details of these it is not necessary that i should trouble those who are following me in this story in this letter mr prendergast also recommended that some intercourse should be had with owen fitzgerald it was expedient he said that all the parties concerned should recognise owens position as the heir presumptive to the title and estate and as he he said had found mr fitzgerald of hap house to be forbearing generous and highspirited he thought that this intercourse might be conducted without enmity or ill blood and then he suggested that mr somers should see owen fitzgerald  all this herbert explained to his father gently and without complaint but it seemed now as though sir thomas had ceased to interest himself in the matter such battle as it had been in his power to make he had made to save his sons heritage and his wifes name and happiness even at the expense of his own conscience that battle had gone altogether against him and now there was nothing left for him but to turn his face to the wall and die absolute ruin through his fault had come upon him and all that belonged to himruin that would now be known to the world at large and it was beyond his power to face that world again in that the glory was gone from the house of his son and of his sons mother the glory was gone from his own house he made no attempt to leave his bed though strongly recommended so to do by his own family doctor and then a physician came down from dublin who could only feel whatever he might say how impossible it is to administer to a mind diseased the mind of that poor man was diseased past all curing in this world and there was nothing left for him but to die  herbert of course answered claras letter but he did not go over to see her during that week nor indeed for some little time afterwards he answered it at considerable length professing his ready willingness to give back to clara her troth and even recommending her with very strong logic and unanswerable arguments of worldly sense to regard their union as unwise and even impossible but nevertheless there protruded through all his sense and all his rhetoric evidences of love and of a desire for love returned which were much more unanswerable than his arguments and much stronger than his logic clara read his letter not as he would have advised her to read it but certainly in the manner which best pleased his heart and answered it again declaring that all that he said was no avail he might be false to her if he would if through fickleness of heart and purpose he chose to abandon her she would never complainnever at least aloud but she would not be false to him nor were her inclinations such as to make it likely that she should be fickle even though her affection might be tried by a delay of years love with her had been too serious to be thrown aside all which was rather strong language on the part of a young lady but was thought by those other young ladies at castle richmond to show the very essence of becoming youngladyhood they pronounced clara to be perfect in feeling and in judgment and herbert could not find it in his heart to contradict them  and of all these doings writings and resolves clara dutifully told her mother poor lady desmond was at her wits end in the matter she could scold her daughter but she had no other power of doing anything clara had so taken the bit between her teeth that it was no longer possible to check her with any usual rein in these days young ladies are seldom deprived by force of paper pen and ink and the absolute incarceration of such an offender would be still more unusual another countess would have taken her daughter away either to london and a series of balls or to the south of italy or to the family castle in the north of scotland but poor lady desmond had not the power of other countesses now that it was put to the trial she found that she had no power even over her own daughter mamma it was your own doing clara would say and the countess would feel that this alluded not only to her daughters engagement with herbert the disinherited but also to her nonengagement with owen the heir  under these circumstances lady desmond sent for her son the earl was still at eton but was now grown to be almost a mansuch a man as forward eton boys are at sixteentall and lathy and handsome with soft incipient whiskers a bold brow and blushing cheeks with all a boys love for frolic still strong within him but some touch of a mans pride to check it in her difficulty lady desmond sent for the young earl who had now not been home since the previous midsummer hoping that his young manhood might have some effect in saving his sister from the disgrace of a marriage which would make her so totally bankrupt both in wealth and rank  mr somers did go once to hap house at herberts instigation but very little came of his visit he had always disliked owen regarding him as an unthrift any close connexion with whom could only bring contamination on the fitzgerald property and owen had returned the feeling tenfold his pride had been wounded by what he had considered to be the agents insolence and he had stigmatised mr somers to his friends as a selfseeking mercenary prig very little therefore came of the visit mr somers to give him his due had attempted to do his best being anxious for herberts sake to conciliate owen perhaps havingand why notsome eye to the future agency but owen was hard and cold and uncommunicativevery unlike what he had before been to mr prendergast but then mr prendergast had never offended his pride  you may tell my cousin herbert he said with some little special emphasis on the word cousin that i shall be glad to see him as soon as he feels himself able to meet me it will be for the good of us both that we should have some conversation together will you tell him mr somers that i shall be happy to go to him or to see him here perhaps my going to castle richmond during the present illness of sir thomas may be inconvenient and this was all that mr somers could get from him  in a very short time the whole story became known to everybody round the neighbourhood and what would have been the good of keeping it secret there are some secretskept as secrets because they cannot well be discussed openlywhich may be allowed to leak out with so much advantage the day must come and that apparently at no distant time when all the world would know the fate of that fitzgerald family when sir owen must walk into the hall of castle richmond the undoubted owner of the mansion and demesne why then keep it secret herbert openly declared his wish to mr somers that there should be no secret in the matter there is no disgrace he said thinking of his mother nothing to be ashamed of let the world say what it will  down in the servants hall the news came to them gradually whispered about from one to another they hardly understood what it meant or how it had come to pass but they did know that their masters marriage had been no marriage and that their masters son was no heir mrs jones said not a word in the matter to any one indeed since that day on which she had been confronted with mollett she had not associated with the servants at all but had kept herself close to her mistress she understood what it all meant perfectly and the depth of the tragedy had so cowed her spirit that she hardly dared to speak of it who told the servantsor who does tell servants of such matters it is impossible to say but before mr prendergast had been three days out of the house they all knew that the mr owen of hap house was to be the future master of castle richmond  an a sore day itll be a sore day a sore day said richard seated in an armchair by the fire at the end of the servants hall shaking his head despondingly  faix an you may say that said corney the footman that misther owen will go tatthering away to the divil when the old place comes into his hans no fear hell make it fly  sorrow seize the ould lawyer for coming down here at all at all said the cook  i never knew no good come of thim dry ould bachelors said biddy the housemaid specially the englishers  the two of yez are no better nor simpletons said richard magisterially twarnt he that done it the likes of him couldnt do the likes o that  and what was it as done it said biddy  ax no questions and may be youll be tould no lies replied richard  in course we all knows its along of her ladyships marriage which warnt no marriage said the cook may the heavens be her bed when the lord takes her a betther lady nor a kinderhearted niver stepped the floor of a kitchen  deed an thats thrue for you cook said biddy with the corner of her apron up to her eyes but tell me richard wont poor mr herbert have nothing  never you mind about mr herbert said richard who had seen biddy grow up from a slip of a girl and therefore was competent to snub her at every word  ah but i do mind said the girl i minds more about him than ere a one of em and av that lady clara wont have em a cause of this  not a step she wont thin said corney shell go back to mr owen he was her fust love youll see else and so the matter was discussed in the servants hall at the great house  but perhaps the greatest surprise the greatest curiosity and the greatest consternation were felt at the parsonage the rumour reached mr townsend at one of the relief committeesand mrs townsend from the mouth of one of her servants during his absence on the same day and when mr townsend returned to the parsonage they met each other with blank faces  oh √Üneas said she before she could get his greatcoat from off his shoulders have you heard the news  what newsabout castle richmond  yes about castle richmond and then she knew that he had heard it  some glimmering of lady fitzgeralds early history had been known to both of them as it had been known almost to all in the country but in late years this history had been so much forgotten that men had ceased to talk of it and this calamity therefore came with all the weight of a new misfortune  and √Üneas who told you of it she asked as they sat together over the fire in their dingy dirty parlour  well strange to say i heard it first from father barney  oh mercy and is it all about the country in that way  herbert you know has not been at any one of the committees for the last ten days and mr somers for the last week past has been as silent as death so much so that that horrid creature father columb would have made a regular set speech the other day at gortnaclough if i hadnt put him down  dear dear dear said mrs townsend  and i was talking to father barney about this todayabout mr somers that is  yes yes yes  and then he said i suppose you know what has happened at castle richmond  how on earth had he learned asked mrs townsend jealous that a roman catholic priest should have heard such completely protestant news before the protestant parson and his wife  oh they learn everythingfrom the servants i suppose  of course the mean creatures said mrs townsend forgetting probably her own little conversation with her own man of all work that morning but go on √Üneas  what has happened said i at castle richmond oh you havent heard said he and i was obliged to own that i had not though i saw that it gave him a kind of triumph why said he very bad news has reached them indeed the worst of news and then he told me about lady fitzgerald to give him his due i must say that he was very sorryvery sorry the poor young fellow he saidthe poor young fellow and i saw that he turned away his face to hide a tear  crocodile tears said mrs townsend  no they were not said her reverend lord and father barney is not so bad as i once thought him  i hope you are not going over too √Üneas and his consort almost cried as such a horrid thought entered her head in her ideas any feeling short of absolute enmity to a servant of the church of rome was an abandonment of some portion of the protestant basis of the church of england the small end of the wedge she would call it when people around her would suggest that the heart of a roman catholic priest might possibly not be altogether black and devilish  well i hope not my dear said mr townsend with a slight touch of sarcasm in his voice but as i was saying father barney told me then that this mr prendergast  oh i had known of his being there from the day of his coming  this mr prendergast it seems knew the whole affair from beginning to end  but how did he know it √Üneas  that i cant tell you he was a friend of sir thomas before his marriage i know that and he has told them that it is of no use their attempting to keep it secret he was over at hap house with owen fitzgerald before he went  and has owen fitzgerald been told  yes he has been toldtold that he is to be the next heir so father barney says  mrs townsend wished in her heart that the news could have reached her through a purer source but all this coming though it did from father barney tallied too completely with what she herself had heard to leave on her mind any doubt of its truth and then she began to think of lady fitzgerald and her condition of herbert and of his and of the condition of them all till by degrees her mind passed away from father barney and all his iniquities  it is very dreadful she said in a low voice  very dreadful very dreadful i hardly know how to think of it and i fear that sir thomas will not live many months to give them even the benefit of his life interest  and when he dies all will be gone  everything  and then tears stood in her eyes also and in his also after a while it is very easy for a clergyman in his pulpit to preach eloquently upon the vileness of worldly wealth and the futility of worldly station but where will you ever find one who when the time of proof shall come will give proof that he himself feels what he preaches mr townsend was customarily loud and eager upon this subject and yet he was now shedding tears because his young friend herbert was deprived of his inheritance     chapter xxx  pallida mors   mr somers returning from hap house gave owens message to herbert fitzgerald but at the same time told him that he did not think any good would come of such a meeting  i went over there he said because i would not willingly omit anything that mr prendergast had suggested but i did not expect any good to come of it you know what i have always thought of owen fitzgerald  but mr prendergast said that he behaved so well  he did not know prendergast and was cowed for the moment by what he had heard that was natural enough you do as you like however only do not have him over to castle richmond  owen however did not trust solely to mr somers but on the following day wrote to herbert suggesting that they had better meet and begging that the place and time of meeting might be named he himself again suggested hap house and declared that he would be at home on any day and at any hour that his cousin might name only as he added the sooner the better herbert wrote back by the same messenger saying that he would be with him early on the following morning and on the following morning he drove up to the door of hap house while owen was still sitting with his coffeepot and knife and fork before him  captain donnellan whom we saw there on the occasion of our first morning visit was now gone and owen fitzgerald was all alone in his home the captain had been an accustomed guest spending perhaps half his time there during the hunting season but since mr prendergast had been at hap house he had been made to understand that the master would fain be alone and since that day owen had never hunted nor been noticed in his old haunts nor had been seen talking to his old friends he had remained at home sitting over the fire thinking wandering up and down his own avenue or standing about the stable idly almost unconscious of the grooming of his horses once and once only he had been mounted and then as the dusk of evening was coming on he had trotted over quickly to desmond court as though he had in hand some purport of great moment but if so he changed his mind when he came to the gate for he walked on slowly for three or four hundred yards beyond it and then turning his horses head slowly made his way back past the gate and then trotted quickly home to hap house in these moments of his life he must make or mar himself for life twas so that he felt it and how should he make himself or how avoid the marring that was the question which he now strove to answer  when herbert entered the room he rose from his chair and walked quickly up to his visitor with extended hand and a look of welcome in his face his manner was very different from that with which he had turned and parted from his cousin not many days since in the demesne at castle richmond then he had intended absolutely to defy herbert fitzgerald but there was no spirit of defiance now either in his hand or face or in the tone of his voice  i am very glad you have come said he i hope you understood that i would have gone to you only that i thought it might be better for both of us to be here  herbert said something to the effect that he had been quite willing to come over to hap house but he was not at the moment so selfpossessed as the other and hardly knew how to begin the subject which was to be discussed between them  of course you know that mr prendergast was here said owen  oh yes said herbert  and mr somers also i tell you fairly herbert that when mr somers came i was not willing to say much to him what has to be said must be said between you and me and not to any third party i could not open my heart nor yet speak my thoughts to mr somers  in answer to this herbert again said that owen need have no scruple in speaking to him it is all plain sailing too plain i fear said he there is no doubt whatever now as to the truth of what mr prendergast has told you  and then having said so much herbert waited for owen to speak he herbert himself had little or nothing to say castle richmond with its title and acres was not to be his but was to be the property of this man with whom he was now sitting when that was actually and positively understood between them there was nothing further to be said nothing as far as herbert knew that other sorrow of his that other and deeper sorrow which affected his mothers name and stationas to that he did not find himself called on to speak to owen fitzgerald nor was it necessary that he should say anything as to his great consolationthe consolation which had reached him from clara desmond  and is it true herbert asked owen at last that my uncle is so very ill in the time of their kindly intercourse owen had always called sir thomas his uncle though latterly he had ceased to do so  he is very ill very ill indeed said herbert this was a subject in which owen had certainly a right to feel interested seeing that his own investiture would follow immediately on the death of sir thomas but herbert almost felt that the question might as well have been spared it had been asked however almost solely with the view of gaining some few moments  herbert he said at last standing up from his chair as he made an effort to begin his speech i dont know how far you will believe me when i tell you that all this news has caused me great sorrow i grieve for your father and your mother and for you from the very bottom of my heart  it is very kind of you said herbert but the blow has fallen and as for myself i believe that i can bear it i do not care so very much about the property  nor do i and now owen spoke rather louder and with his own look of strong impulse about his mouth and forehead nor do i care so much about the property you were welcome to it and are so still i have never coveted it from you and do not covet it  it will be yours now without coveting replied herbert and then there was another pause during which herbert sat still while owen stood leaning with his back against the mantelpiece  herbert said he after they had thus remained silent for two or three minutes i have made up my mind on this matter and i will tell you truly what i do desire and what i do not i do not desire your inheritance but i do desire that clara desmond shall be my wife  owen said the other also getting up i did not expect when i came here that you would have spoken to me about this  it was that we might speak about this that i asked you to come here but listen to me when i say that i want clara desmond to be my wife i mean to say that i want that and that only it may be true that i am or shall be legally the heir to your fathers estate herbert i will relinquish all that because i do not feel it to be my own i will relinquish it in any way that may separate myself from it most thoroughly but in return do you separate yourself from her who was my own before you had ever known her  and thus he did make the proposition as to which he had been making up his mind since the morning on which mr prendergast had come to him  herbert for a while was struck dumb with amazement not so much at the quixotic generosity of the proposal as at the singular mind of the man in thinking that such a plan could be carried out herberts best quality was no doubt his sturdy common sense and that was shocked by a suggestion which presumed that all the legalities and ordinary bonds of life could be upset by such an agreement between two young men he knew that owen fitzgerald could not give away his title to an estate of fourteen thousand a year in this offhand way and that no one could accept such a gift were it possible to be given the estate and title must belong to owen and could not possibly belong to any one else merely at his word and fancy and then again how could the love of a girl like clara desmond be bandied to and fro at the will of any suitor or suitors that she had once accepted owens love herbert knew but since that in a soberer mood and with maturer judgment she had accepted his how could he give it up to another or how could that other take possession of it if so abandoned the bargain was one quite impossible to be carried out and yet owen in proposing it had fully intended to be as good as his word  that is impossible said herbert in a low voice  why impossible may i not do what i like with that which is my own it is not impossible i will have nothing to do with that property of yours in fact it is not my own and i will not take it i will not rob you of that which you have been born to expect but in return for this  owen do not talk of it would you abandon a girl whom you loved for any wealth or any property  you cannot love her as i love her i will talk to you on this matter openly as i have never yet talked to any one since first i saw clara desmond the only wish of my life has been that i might have her for my wife i have longed for her as a child longsif you know what i mean by that when i saw that she was old enough to understand what love meant i told her what was in my heart and she accepted my love she swore to me that she would be mine let mother or brother say what they would as sure as you are standing there a living man she loved me with all truth and that i loved her herbert i have never loved aught but her nothing elseneither man nor woman nor wealth nor title all i ask is that i may have that which was my own  but owen and herbert touched his cousins arm  well why do you not speak i have spoken plainly enough  it is not easy to speak plainly on all subjects i would not if i could avoid it say a word that would hurt your feelings  never mind my feelings speak out and let us have the truth in gods name my feelings have never been much considered yeteither in this matter or in any other  it seems to me said herbert that the giving of lady claras hand cannot depend on your will or on mine  you mean her mother  no by no means her mother now would be the last to favour me i mean herself if she loves me as i hope and believenay am sure  she did love me shouted owen  but even if so i do not now say anything of that but even if so surely you would not have her marry you if she does not love you still you would not wish her to be your wife if her heart belongs to me  it has been given you at her mothers bidding  however given it is now my own and it cannot be returned look here owen i will show you her last two letters if you will allow me not in pride i hope but that you may truly know what are her wishes and he took from his breast where they had been ever since he received them the two letters which clara had written to him owen read them both twice over before he spoke first one and then the other and an indescribable look of pain fell on his brow as he did so they were so tenderly worded so sweet so generous he would have given all the world to have had those letters addressed by her to himself but even they did not convince him his heart had never changed and he could not believe that there had been any change in hers  i might have known he said as he gave them back that she would be too noble to abandon you in your distress as long as you were rich i might have had some chance of getting her back despite the machinations of her mother but now that she thinks you are poor and then he stopped and hid his face between his hands  and in what he had last said there was undoubtedly something of truth claras love for herbert had never been passionate till passion had been created by his misfortune and in her thoughts of owen there had been much of regret though she had resolved to withdraw her love she had not wholly ceased to love him judgment had bade her to break her word to him and she had obeyed her judgment she had admitted to herself that her mother was right in telling her that she could not join her own bankrupt fortunes to the fortunes of one who was both poor and a spendthrift and thus she had plucked from her heart the picture of the man she had lovedor endeavoured so to pluck it some love for him however had unwittingly lingered there and then herbert had come with his suit a suitor fitted for her in every way she had not loved him as she had loved owen she had never felt that she could worship him and tremble at the tones of his voice and watch the glance of his eye and gaze into his face as though he were half divine but she acknowledged his worth and valued him she knew that it behoved her to choose some suitor as her husband and now that her dream was gone where could she choose better than here and thus herbert had been accepted he had been accepted but the dream was not wholly gone owen was in adversity ill spoken of by those around her shunned by his own relatives living darkly away from all that is soft in life and for these reasons clara could not wholly forget her dream she had in some sort unconsciously clung to her old love till he to whom she had plighted her new troth was in adversityand then all was changed then her love for herbert did become a passion and then as owen had become rich she felt that she could think of him without remorse he was quite right in perceiving that his chance was gone now that herbert had ceased to be rich  owen said herbert and his voice was full of tenderness for at this moment he felt that he did love and pity his cousin we must each of us bear the weight which fortune has thrown on us it may be that we are neither of us to be envied i have lost all that men generally value and you  i have lost all on earth that is valuable to me but no it is not lostnot lost as yet as long as her name is clara desmond she is as open for me to win as she is for you and herbert think of it before you make me your enemy see what i offer younot as a bargain mind you i give up all my title to your fathers property i will sign any paper that your lawyers may bring to me which may serve to give you back your inheritance as for me i would scorn to take that which belongs in justice to another i will not have your property come what may i will not have it i will give it up to you either as to my enemy or as to my friend  i sincerely hope that we may be friends but what you say is impossible  it is not impossible i hereby pledge myself that i will not take an acre of your fathers lands but i pledge myself also that i will always be your enemy if clara desmond becomes your wife and i mean what i say i have set my heart on one thing and on one thing only and if i am ruined in that i am ruined indeed  herbert remained silent for he had nothing further that he knew how to plead he felt as other men would feel that each of them must keep that which fate had given him fate had decreed that owen should be the heir to castle richmond and the decree thus gone forth must stand valid and fate had also decreed that owen should be rejected by clara desmond which other decree as herbert thought must be held as valid also but he had no further inclination to argue upon the subject his cousin was becoming hot and angry and herbert was beginning to wish that he was on his way home that he might be once more at his fathers bedside or in his mothers room comforting her and being comforted  well said owen after a while in his deeptoned voice what do you say to my offer  i have nothing further to say we must each take our own course as for me i have lost everything but one thing and it is not likely that i shall throw that away from me  nor so help me heaven in my need will i let that thing be filched from me i have offered you kindness and brotherly love and wealth and all that friendship could do for a man give me my way in this and i will be to you such a comrade and such a brother  should i be a man owen were i to give up this  be a man yes it is pride on your part you do not love her you have never loved her as i have loved you have not sat apart long months and months thinking of her as i have done from the time she was a child i marked her as my own as god will help me when i die she is all that i have coveted in this worldall but her i have coveted with such longings of the heart that i cannot bring myself to live without hernor will i and then again they both were silent  it may be as well that we should part now said herbert at last i do not know that we can gain anything by further talking on this subject  well you know that best but i have one further question to ask you  what is it owen  you still think of marrying clara desmond  certainly of course i think of it  and when i presume you are not so chickenhearted as to be afraid of speaking out openly what you intend to do  i cannot say when i had hoped that it would have been very soon but all this will of course delay it it may be years first  these last were the only pleasant words that owen had heard if there were to be a delay of years might not his chance still be as good as herberts but then this delay was to be the consequence of his cousins ruined prospectsand the accomplishment of that ruin owen had pledged himself to prevent was he by his own deed to enable his enemy to take that very step which he was so firmly resolved to prevent  you will give me your promise said he that you will not marry her for the next three years make me that promise and i will make you the same  herbert felt that there could be no possibility of his now marrying within the time named but nevertheless he would not bring himself to make such a promise as this he would make no bargain about clara desmond about his clara which could in any way admit a doubt as to his own right had owen asked him to promise that he would not marry her during the next week he would have given no such pledge no said he i cannot promise that  she is now only seventeen  it does not matter i will make no such promise because on such a subject you have no right to ask for any when she will consent to run her risk of happiness in coming to me then i shall marry her  owen was now walking up and down the room with rapid steps you have not the courage to fight me fairly said he  i do not wish to fight you at all  ah but you must fight me shall i see the prey taken out of my jaws and not struggle for it no by heavens you must fight me and i tell you fairly that the fight shall be as hard as i can make it i have offered you that which one living man is seldom able to offer to anothermoney and land and wealth and station all these things i throw away from me because i feel that they should be yours and i ask only in return the love of a young girl i ask that because i feel that it should be mine if it has gone from mewhich i do not believeit has been filched and stolen by a thief in the night she did love me if a girl ever loved a man but she was separated from me and i bore that patiently because i trusted her but she was young and weak and her mother was strong and crafty she has accepted you at her mothers instance and were i base enough to keep from you your fathers inheritance her mother would no more give her to you now than she would to me then this is true and if you know it to be trueas you do know you will be mean and dastard and a cowardyou will be no fitzgerald if you keep from me that which i have a right to claim as my own not fight ay but you must fight we cannot both live here in this country if clara desmond become your wife mark my words if that take place you and i cannot live here alongside of each others houses he paused for a moment after this and then added you can go now if you will for i have said out my say  and herbert did goalmost without uttering a word of adieu what could he say in answer to such threats as these that his cousin was in every way unreasonableas unreasonable in his generosity as he was in his claims he felt convinced but an unreasonable man though he is one whom one would fain conquer by arguments were it possible is the very man on whom arguments have no avail a madman is mad because he is mad herbert had a great deal that was very sensible to allege in favour of his views but what use of alleging anything of sense to such a mind as that of owen fitzgerald so he went his way without further speech  when he was gone owen for a time went on walking his room and then sank again into his chair abominably irrational as his method of arranging all these family difficulties will no doubt seem to all who may read of it to him it had appeared not only an easy but a happy mode of bringing back contentment to everybody he was quite serious in his intention of giving up his position as heir to castle richmond mr prendergast had explained to him that the property was entailed as far as him but no farther and had done this doubtless with the view not then expressed to some friendly arrangement by which a small portion of the property might be saved and restored to the children of sir thomas but owen had looked at it quite in another light he had in justice no right to inquire into all those circumstances of his old cousins marriage such a union was a marriage in the eye of god and should be held as such by him he would take no advantage of so terrible an accident  he would take no advantage so he said to himself over and over again but yet as he said it he resolved that he would take advantage he would not touch the estate but surely if he abstained from touching it herbert would be generous enough to leave to him the solace of his love and he had no scruple in allotting to clara the poorer husband instead of the richer he was no poorer now than when she had accepted him looking at it in that light had he not a right to claim that she should abide by her first acceptance could any one be found to justify the theory that a girl may throw over a poor lover because a rich lover comes in the way owen had his own ideas of right and wrongideas which were not without a basis of strong rugged justice and nothing could be more antagonistic to them than such a doctrine as this and then he still believed in his heart that he was dearer to clara than that other richer suitor he heard of her from time to time and those who had spoken to him had spoken of her as pining for love of him in this there had been much of the flattery of servants and something of the subservience of those about him who wished to stand well in his graces but he had believed it he was not a conceited man nor even a vain man he did not think himself more clever than his cousin and as for personal appearance it was a matter to which his thoughts never descended but he had about him a selfdependence and assurance in his own manhood which forbade him to doubt the love of one who had told him that she loved him  and he did not believe in herberts love his cousin was as he thought of a calibre too cold for love that clara was valued by him owen did not doubtvalued for her beauty for her rank for her grace and peerless manner but what had such value as that to do with love would herbert sacrifice everything for clara desmond would he bid pelion fall on ossa would he drink up esil all this would owen do and more he would do more than any laertes had ever dreamed he would give up for now and for ever all title to those rich lands which made the fitzgeralds of castle richmond the men of greatest mark in all their county  and thus he fanned himself into a fury as he thought of his cousins want of generosity herbert would be the heir and because he was the heir he would be the favoured lover but there might yet be time and opportunity and at any rate clara should not marry without knowing what was the whole truth herbert was ungenerous but clara still might be just if notthen as he had said before he would fight out the battle to the end as with an enemy  herbert when he got on to his horse to ride home was forced to acknowledge to himself that no good whatever had come from his visit to hap house words had been spoken which might have been much better left unspoken an angry man will often cling to his anger because his anger has been spoken he will do evil because he has threatened evil and is ashamed to be better than his words and there was no comfort to be derived from those lavish promises made by owen with regard to the property to herberts mind they were mere moonshinevery graceful on the part of the maker but meaning nothing no one could have castle richmond but him who owned it legally owen fitzgerald would become sir owen and would as a matter of course be sir owen of castle richmond there was no comfort on that score and then on that other score there was so much discomfort of giving up his bride herbert never for a moment thought but he did think with increasing annoyance of the angry threats which had been pronounced against him  when he rode into the stableyard as was his wont he found richard waiting for him this was not customary as in these latter days richard though he always drove the car as a sort of subsidiary coachman to the young ladies to whom the car was supposed to belong in fee did not act as general groom he had been promoted beyond this and was a sort of hangeron about the house half indoor servant and half out doing very much what he liked and giving advice to everybody from the cook downwards he thanked god that he knew his place he would often say but nobody else knew it nevertheless everybody liked him even the poor housemaid whom he snubbed  is anything the matter asked herbert looking at the mans sorrowladen face  deed an there is mr herbert sir thomas is  my father is not dead exclaimed herbert  oh no mr herbert its not so bad as that but he is very failingvery failing my lady is with him now  herbert ran into the house and at the bottom of the chief stairs he met one of his sisters who had heard the steps of his horse oh herbert i am so glad you have come said she her eyes and cheeks were red with tears and her hand as her brother took it was cold and numbed  what is it mary is he worse  oh so much worse mamma and emmeline are there he has asked for you three or four times and always says that he is dying i had better go up and say that you are here  and what does my mother think of it  she has never left him and therefore i cannot tell but i know from her face that she thinks that he isdying shall i go up herbert and so she went and herbert following softly on his toes stood in the corridor outside the bedroomdoor waiting till his arrival should have been announced it was but a minute and then his sister returning to the door summoned him to enter  the room had been nearly darkened but as there were no curtains to the bed herbert could see his mothers face as she knelt on a stool at the bedside his father was turned away from him and lay with his hand inside his wifes and emmeline was sitting on the foot of the bed with her face between her hands striving to stifle her sobs here is herbert now dearest said lady fitzgerald with a low soft voice almost a whisper yet clear enough to cause no effort in the hearing i knew that he would not be long and herbert obeying the signal of his mothers eye passed round to the other side of the bed  father said he are you not so well today  my poor boy my poor ruined boy said the dying man hardly articulating the words as he dropped his wifes hand and took that of his son herbert found that it was wet and clammy and cold and almost powerless in its feeble grasp  dearest father you are wrong if you let that trouble you all that will never trouble me is it not well that a man should earn his own bread is it not the lot of all good men but still the old man murmured with his broken voice my poor boy my poor boy  the hopes and aspirations of his eldest son are as the breath of his nostrils to an englishman who has been born to land and fortune what had not this poor man endured in order that his son might be sir herbert fitzgerald of castle richmond but this was no longer possible and from the moment that this had been brought home to him the father had felt that for him there was nothing left but to die my poor boy he muttered tell me that you have forgiven me  and then they all knelt round the bed and prayed with him and afterwards they tried to comfort him telling him how good he had been to them and his wife whispered in his ear that if there had been fault the fault was hers but that her conscience told her that such fault had been forgiven and while she said this she motioned the children away from him and strove to make him understand that human misery could never kill the soul and should never utterly depress the spirit dearest love she said still whispering to him in her low sweet voiceso dear to him but utterly inaudible beyondif you would cease to accuse yourself so bitterly you might yet be better and remain with us to comfort us  but the slender halfknit man whose arms are without muscles and whose back is without pith will strive in vain to lift the weight which the brawny vigour of another tosses from the ground almost without an effort it is with the mind and the spirit as with the body only this that the muscles of the body can be measured but not so those of the spirit lady fitzgerald was made of other stuff than sir thomas and that which to her had cost an effort but with an effort had been done surely was to him as impossible as the labour of hercules my poor boy my poor ruined boy he still muttered as she strove to comfort him  mamma has sent for mr townsend emmeline whispered to her brother as they stood together in the bow of the window  and do you really think he is so bad as that  i am sure that mamma does i believe he had some sort of a fit before you came at any rate he did not speak for two hours  and was not finucane here finucane was the mallow doctor  yes but he had left before papa became so much worse mamma has sent for him also  but i do not know that it boots to dally longer in a dying chamber it is an axiom of old that the stage curtain should be drawn before the inexorable one enters in upon his final work doctor finucane did come but his coming was all in vain sir thomas had known that it was in vain and so also had his patient wife there was that mind diseased towards the cure of which no doctor finucane could make any possible approach and mr townsend came also let us hope not in vain though the cure which he fain would have perfected can hardly be effected in such moments as those let us hope that it had been already effected the only crying sin which we can lay to the charge of the dying man is that of which we have spoken he had endeavoured by pensioning falsehood and fraud to preserve for his wife her name and for his son that sons inheritance even over this deep as it was the recording angel may have dropped some cleansing tears of pity  that night the poor man died and the fitzgeralds who sat in the chambers of castle richmond were no longer the owners of the mansion there was no speech of sir herbert among the servants as there would have been had these tidings not have reached them dr finucane had remained in the house and even he in speaking of the son had shown that he knew the story they were strangers there now as they all knewintruders as they would soon be considered in the house of their cousin owen or rather not their cousin in that he was above them by right of his blood they had no right to claim him as their relation  it may be said that at such a moment all this should not have been thought of but those who say so know little as i imagine of the true effect of sorrow no wife and no children ever grieved more heartily for a father but their grief was blacker and more gloomy in that they knew that they were outcasts in the world  and during that long night as herbert and his sisters sat up cowering round the fire he told them of all that had been said at hap house and can it not be as he says mary had asked  and that herbert should give up his wife said emmeline  no but that other thing  do not dream of it said herbert it is all all impossible the house that we are now in belongs to sir owen fitzgerald     chapter xxxi  the first month   and now i will beg my readers to suppose a month to have passed by since sir thomas fitzgerald died it was a busy month in ireland it may probably be said that so large a sum of money had never been circulated in the country in any one month since money had been known there and yet it may also be said that so frightful a mortality had never occurred there from the want of that which money brings it was well understood by all men now that the customary food of the country had disappeared there was no longer any difference of opinion between rich and poor between protestant and roman catholic as to that no man dared now to say that the poor if left to themselves could feed themselves or to allege that the sufferings of the country arose from the machinations of moneymaking speculators the famine was an established fact and all men knew that it was gods doingall men knew this though few could recognize as yet with how much mercy gods hand was stretched out over the country  or may it not perhaps be truer to say that in such matters there is no such thing as mercyno special merciesno other mercy than that fatherly forbearing allseeing perfect goodness by which the creator is ever adapting this world to the wants of his creatures and rectifying the evils arising from their faults and follies sed quo musa tendis such discourses of the gods as these are not to be fitly handled in such small measures  at any rate there was the famine undoubted now by any one and death who in visiting castle richmond may be said to have knocked at the towers of a king was busy enough also among the cabins of the poor and now the great fault of those who were the most affected was becoming one which would not have been at first sight expected one would think that starving men would become violent taking food by open theftfeeling and perhaps not without some truth that the agony of their want robbed such robberies of its sin but such was by no means the case i only remember one instance in which the bakers shops were attacked and in that instance the work was done by those who were undergoing no real suffering at clonmel in tipperary the bread was one morning stripped away from the bakers shops but at that time and in that place there was nothing approaching to famine the fault of the people was apathy it was the feeling of the multitude that the world and all that was good in it was passing away from them that exertion was useless and hope hopeless ah me your honour said a man to me therell never be a bit and a sup again in the county cork the life of the world is fairly gone  and it was very hard to repress this feeling the energy of a man depends so much on the outward circumstances that encumber him it is so hard to work when work seems hopelessso hard to trust where the basis of our faith is so far removed from sight when large tracts of land went out of cultivation was it not natural to think that agriculture was receding from the country leaving the green hills once more to be brown and barren as hills once green have become in other countries and when men were falling in the highways and women would sit with their babes in their arms listless till death should come to them was it not natural to think that death was making a huge successthat he the inexorable one was now the inexorable indeed  there were greatly trusting hearts that could withstand the weight of this terrible pressure and thinking minds which saw that good would come out of this great evil but such hearts and such minds were not to be looked for among the suffering poor and were not perhaps often found even among those who were not poor or suffering it was very hard to be thus trusting and thoughtful while everything around was full of awe and agony  the people however were conscious of gods work and were becoming dull and apathetic they clustered about the roads working lazily while their strength lasted them and afterwards when strength failed them for this they clustered more largely in the poorhouses and in every townin every assemblage of houses which in england would be called a village there was a poorhouse any big barrack of a tenement that could be obtained at a moments notice whatever the rent became a poorhouse in the course of twelve hoursin twelve nay in two hours what was necessary but the bare walls and a supply of yellow meal bad provision this for all a mans wantsas was said often enough by irrational philanthropists but better provision than no shelter and no yellow meal it was bad that men should be locked up at night without any of the appliances of decency bad that they should be herded together for day after day with no resource but the eating twice a day of enough unsavoury food to keep life and soul togethervery bad ye philanthropical irrationalists but is not a choice of evils all that is left to us in many a contingency was not even this better than that life and soul should be allowed to part without any effort at preserving their union  and thus life and soul were kept together the government of the day having wisely seen what at so short a notice was possible for them to do and what was absolutely impossible it is in such emergencies as these that the watching and the wisdom of a government are necessary and i shall always thinkas i did think thenthat the wisdom of its action and the wisdom of its abstinence from action were very good and now again the fields in ireland are green and the markets are busy and money is chucked to and fro like a weathercock which the players do not wish to have abiding with them and the tardy speculator going over to look for a bit of land comes back muttering angrily that fancy prices are demanded theyll run you up to thirtythree years purchase says the tardy speculator thinking as it seems that he is specially ill used agricultural wages have been nearly doubled in ireland during the last fifteen years think of that master brook work for which at six shillings a week there would be a hundred hungry claimants in 1845in the good old days before the famine when repeal was so immediately expectedwill now fetch ten shillings the claimants being by no means numerous in 1843 and 1844 i knew men to work for fourpence a daysomething over the dole on which we are told being mostly incredulous as we hear it that a coolie labourer can feed himself with rice in indianot one man or two men the broken down incapables of the parish but the best labour of the country one and twopence is now about the cheapest rate at which a man can be hired for agricultural purposes while this is so and while the prices are progressing there is no cause for fear let bishops a and b and archbishops c and d fret and fume with never so great vexation touching the clipped honours of their father the pope  but again quo musa tendis i could write on this subject for a week were it not that rhadamanthus awaits me rhadamanthus the critic and rhadamanthus is of all things impatient of an episode  life and soul were kept together in those terrible daysthat is the irish life and soul generally there were many slips in which the union was violently dissolvedmany cases in which the yellow meal allowed was not sufficient or in which it did not reach the sufferer in time to prevent such dissolutioncases which when numbered together amounted to thousands and then the pestilence came taking its victims by tens of thousandsbut that was after the time with which we shall have concern here and immigration followed taking those who were saved by hundreds of thousands but the millions are still there a thriving people for his mercy endureth for ever  during this month the month ensuing upon the death of sir thomas fitzgerald herbert could of course pay no outward attention to the wants or relief of the people he could make no offer of assistance for nothing belonged to him nor could he aid in the councils of the committees for no one could have defined the position of the speaker and during that month nothing was defined about castle richmond lady fitzgerald was still always called by her title the people of the country including the tradesmen of the neighbouring towns addressed the owner of hap house as sir owen and gradually the name was working itself into common use though he had taken no steps to make himself legally entitled to wear it but no one spoke of sir herbert the story was so generally known that none were so ignorant as to suppose him to be his fathers heir the servants about the place still called him mr herbert orders to that effect having been specially given and the peasants of the country with that tact which graces them and with that anxiety to abstain from giving pain which always accompanies them unless when angered carefully called him by no name they knew that he was not sir herbert but they would not believe but what perchance he might be so yet on some future day so they took off their old hats to him and passed him silently in his sorrow or if they spoke to him addressed his honour simply omitting all mention of that christian name which the poor irishman is generally so fond of using mister blake sounds cold and unkindly in his ears it is the masther or his honour or if possible misther thady or if there be any handle that is used with avidity pat is a happy man when he can address his landlord as sir patrick  but now the ould masthers son could be called by no name men knew not what he was to be though they knew well that he was not that which he ought to be and there were some who attempted to worship owen as the rising sun but for such of them as had never worshipped him before that game was rather hopeless in those days he was not much seen neither hunting nor entertaining company but when seen he was rough enough with those who made any deep attempt to ingratiate themselves with his coming mightiness and during this month he went over to london having been specially invited so to do by mr prendergast but very little came of his visit there except that it was certified to him that he was beyond all doubt the baronet and there shall be no unnecessary delay sir owen said mr prendergast in putting you into full possession of all your rights in answer to which owen had replied that he was not anxious to be put in possession of any rights that as far as any active doing of his own was concerned the title might lie in abeyance and that regarding the property he would make known his wish to mr prendergast very quickly after his return to ireland but he intimated at the same time that there could be no ground for disturbing lady fitzgerald as he had no intention under any circumstances of living at castle richmond  had you not better tell lady fitzgerald that yourself said mr prendergast catching at the idea that his friends widowmy readers will allow me so to call hermight be allowed to live undisturbed at the family mansion if not for life at any rate for a few years if this young man were so generous why should it not be so he would not want the big house at any rate till he were married  it would be better that you should say so said owen i have particular reasons for not wishing to go there  but allow me to say my dear young friendand i hope i may call you so for i greatly admire the way in which you have taken all these tidingsthat i would venture to advise you to drop the remembrance of any unpleasantness that may have existed you should now feel yourself to be the closest friend of that family  so i would if and then owen stopped short though mr prendergast gave him plenty of time to finish his sentence were he minded to do so  in your present position continued the lawyer your influence will be very great  i cant explain it all said owen but i dont think my influence will be great at all and what is more i do not want any influence of that sort i wish lady fitzgerald to understand that she is at perfect liberty to stay where she isas far as i am concerned not as a favour from me mind for i do not think that she would take a favour from my hands  but my dear sir  therefore you had better write to her about remaining there  mr prendergast did write to her or rather to herbert but in doing so he thought it right to say that the permission to live at castle richmond should be regarded as a kindness granted them by their relative it is a kindness which under the circumstances your mother may i think accept without compunction at any rate for some time to cometill she shall have suited herself without hurrying her choice but nevertheless it must be regarded as a generous offer on his part and i do hope my dear herbert that you and he will be fast friends  but mr prendergast did not in the least comprehend the workings of owens mind and herbert who knew more of them than any one else did not understand them altogether owen had no idea of granting any favour to his relatives who as he thought had never granted any to him what owen wantedor what he told himself that he wantedwas justice it was his duty as a just man to abstain from taking hold of those acres and he was prepared to do his duty but it was equally herberts duty as a just man to abstain from taking hold of clara desmond and he was resolved that he would never be herberts friend if herbert did not perform that duty and then though he felt himself bound to give up the acresthough he did regard this as an imperative duty he nevertheless felt also that something was due to him for his readiness to perform such a dutythat some reward should be conceded to him what this reward was to be or rather what he wished it to be we all know  herbert had utterly refused to engage in any such negotiation but owen nevertheless would not cease to think that something might yet be done who was so generous as clara and would not clara herself speak out if she knew how much her old lover was prepared to do for this newer lover half a dozen times owen made up his mind to explain the whole thing to mr prendergast but when he found himself in the presence of the lawyer he could not talk about love young men are so apt to think that their seniors in age cannot understand romance or acknowledge the force of a passion but here they are wrong for there would be as much romance after forty as before i take it were it not checked by the fear of ridicule so owen stayed a week in london seeing mr prendergast every day and then he returned to hap house  in the mean time life went on at a very sad pace at desmond court there was no concord whatever between the two ladies residing there the mother was silent gloomy and sometimes bitter seldom saying a word about herbert fitzgerald or his prospects but saying that word with great fixity of purpose when it was spoken no one she said should attribute to her the poverty and misery of her child that marriage should not take place from her house or with her consent and clara for the most part was silent also in answer to such words as the above she would say nothing but when as did happen once or twice she was forced to speak she declared openly enough that no earthly consideration should induce her to give up her engagement  and then the young earl came home brought away from his school in order that his authority might have effect on his sister to speak the truth he was unwilling enough to interfere and would have declined to come at all could he have dared to do so eton was now more pleasant to him than desmond court which indeed had but little of pleasantness to offer to a lad such as he was now he was sixteen and manly for his age but the question in dispute at desmond court offered little attraction even to a manly boy of sixteen in that former question as to owen he had said a word or two knowing that owen could not be looked upon as a fitting husband for his sister but now he knew not how to counsel her again as to herbert seeing that it was but the other day that he had written a long letter congratulating her on that connection  towards the end of the month however he did arrive making glad his mothers heart as she looked at his strong limbs and his handsome open face and clara too threw herself so warmly into his arms that he did feel glad that he had come to her oh patrick it is so sweet to have you here she said before his mother had had time to speak to him  dearest clara  but patrick you must not be cruel to me look here patrick you are my only brother and i so love you that i would not offend you or turn you against me for worlds you are the head of our family too and nothing should be done that you do not like but if so much depends on you you must think well before you decide on anything  he opened his young eyes and looked intently into her face for there was an earnestness in her words that almost frightened him you must think well of it all before you speak patrick and remember this you and i must be honest and honourable whether we be poor or no you remember about owen fitzgerald how i gave way then because i could do so without dishonour but now  but clara i do not understand it all as yet  no you cannotnot as yetand i will let mamma tell you the story all i ask is this that you will think of my honour before you say a word that can favour either her or me and then he promised her that he would do so and his mother when on the following morning she told him all the history found him reserved and silent  look at his position said the mother pleading her cause before her son he is illegitimate and  yes but mother  i know all that my dear i know what you would say and no one can pity mr fitzgeralds position more than i do but you would not on that account have your sister ruined it is romance on her part  but what does he say  he is quite willing to give up the match he has told me so and said as much to his aunt whom i have seen three times on the subject  do you mean that he wishes to give it up  noat least i dont know if he does he cannot express such a wish because clara is so headstrong patrick in my heart i do not believe that she cares for him i have doubted it for some time  but you wanted her to marry him  so i did it was an excellent match and in a certain way she did like him and then you know there was that great danger about poor owen it was a great danger then but now she is so determined about this because she thinks it would be ungenerous to go back from her word and in this way she will ruin the very man she wishes to serve of course he cannot break off the match if she persists in it what i want you to perceive is this that he utterly penniless as he is will have to begin the world with a clog round his neck because she is so obstinate what could possibly be worse for him than a titled wife without a penny and in this way the countess pleaded her side of the question before her son  it was quite true that she had been three times to castle richmond and had thrice driven aunt letty into a state bordering on distraction if she could only get the castle richmond people to take it up as they ought to do it was thus she argued with herselfand with aunt letty also endeavouring to persuade her that these two young people would undoubtedly ruin each other unless those who were really wise and prudent and who understood the worldsuch as aunt letty for instancewould interfere to prevent it  aunt letty on the whole did agree with her though she greatly disliked her miss fitzgerald had strongly planted within her bosom the prudent oldworld notion that young gentlefolks should not love each other unless they have plenty of money and that if unfortunately such did love each other it was better that they should suffer all the pangs of hopeless love than marry and trust to god and their wits for bread and cheese to which opinion of aunt lettys as well as to some others entertained by that lady with much pertinacity i cannot subscribe myself as an adherent  lady desmond had wit enough to discover that aunt letty did agree with her in the main and on this account she was eager in seeking her assistance lady fitzgerald of course could not be seen and there was no one else at castle richmond who could be supposed to have any weight with herbert and therefore lady desmond was very eloquent with aunt letty talking much of the future miseries of the two young people till the old lady had promised to use her best efforts in enlisting lady fitzgerald on the same side you cannot wonder miss fitzgerald that i should wish to put an end to the cruel position in which my poor girl is placed you know how much a girl suffers from that kind of thing  aunt letty did dislike lady desmond very much but nevertheless she could not deny the truth of all this and therefore it may be said that the visits of the countess to castle richmond were on the whole successful  and the month wore itself away also in that sad household and the fitzgeralds were gradually becoming used to their position family discussions were held among them as to what they should do and where they should live in future mr prendergast had written seeing that owen had persisted in refusing to make the offer personally himselfsaying that there was no hurry for any removal sir owen he saidhaving considered deeply whether or no he would call him by the title or no and having resolved that it would be best to do so at oncesir owen was inclined to behave very generously lady fitzgerald could have the house and demesne at any rate for twelve months and by that time the personal property left by sir thomas would be realized and there would be enough mr prendergast said for the three ladies to live in decent quiet comfort mr prendergast had taken care before he left castle richmond that a will should be made and duly executed by sir thomas leaving what money he had to his three children by namein trust for their mothers use till the girls should be of age that trust would be vested in herbert  decent quiet comfort said mary to her brother and sister as they conned the letter over how comfortless it sounds  and so the first month after the death of sir thomas passed by and the misfortunes of the fitzgerald family ceased to be the only subject spoken of by the inhabitants of county cork     chapter xxxii  preparations for going   at the end of the month herbert began to prepare himself for facing the world the first question to be answered was that one which is so frequently asked in most families but which had never yet been necessary in thiswhat profession would he follow all manners of ways by which an educated man can earn his bread had been turned over in his mind and in the minds of those who loved him beginning with the revenues of the archbishop of armagh which was aunt lettys idea and ending with a seat at a government desk which was his own mr prendergast had counselled the law not his own lower branch of the profession but a barristers fullblown wig adding in his letter to lady fitzgerald that if herbert would come to london and settle in chambers he mr prendergast would see that his life was made agreeable to him but mr somers gave other advice in those days assistant poorlaw commissioners were being appointed in ireland almost by the score and mr somers declared that herbert had only to signify his wish for such a position and he would get it the interest which he had taken in the welfare of the poor around him was well known and as his own story was well known also there could be no doubt that the government would be willing to assist one so circumstanced and who when assisted would make himself so useful such was the advice of mr somers and he might have been right but for this that both herbert and lady fitzgerald felt that it would be well for them to move out of that neighbourhoodout of ireland altogether if such could be possible  aunt letty was strong for the church a young man who had distinguished himself at the university so signally as her nephew had done taking his degree at the very first attempt and that in so high a class of honour as the fourth would not fail to succeed in the church he might not perhaps succeed as to armagh that she admitted but there were some thirty other bishoprics to be had and it would be odd if with his talents he did not get one of them think what it would be if he were to return to his own country as bishop of cork cloyne and ross as to which amalgamation of sees however aunt letty had her own ideas he was slightly tainted with the venom of puseyism aunt letty said to herself but nothing would dispel this with so much certainty as the theological studies necessary for ordination and then aunt letty talked it over by the hour together with mrs townsend and both those ladies were agreed that herbert should get himself ordained as quickly as possiblenot in england where there might be danger even in ordination but in good wholesome protestant ireland where a church of england clergyman was a clergyman of the church of england and not a priest slipping about in the mud half way between england and rome  herbert himself was anxious to get some employment by which he might immediately earn his bread but not unnaturally wished that london should be the scene of his work anywhere in ireland he would be known as the fitzgerald who ought to have been fitzgerald of castle richmond and then too he as other young men had an undefined idea that as he must earn his bread london should be his ground he had at first been not ill inclined to that church project and had thus given a sort of ground on which aunt letty was able to standhad as it were given her some authority for carrying on an agitation in furtherance of her own views but herbert himself soon gave up this idea a man he thought to be a clergyman should have a very strong predilection in favour of that profession and so he gradually abandoned that ideaactuated as poor aunt letty feared by the agency of the evil one working through the means of puseyism  his mother and sisters were in favour of mr prendergasts views and as it was gradually found by them all that there would not be any immediate pressure as regarded pecuniary means that seemed at last to be their decision herbert would remain yet for three or four weeks at castle richmond till matters there were somewhat more thoroughly settled and would then put himself into the hands of mr prendergast in london mr prendergast would select a legal tutor for him and proper legal chambers and then not long afterwards his mother and sisters should follow and they would live together at some small villa residence near st johns wood road or perhaps out at brompton  it is astonishing how quickly in this world of ours chaos will settle itself into decent and graceful order when it is properly looked in the face and handled with a steady hand which is not sparing of the broom some three months since everything at castle richmond was ruin such ruin indeed that the very power of living under it seemed to be doubtful when first mr prendergast arrived there a feeling came upon them all as though they might hardly dare to live in a world which would look at them as so thoroughly degraded as regards means they would be beggars and as regards position so much worse than beggars a broken world was in truth falling about their ears and it was felt to be impossible that they should endure its convulsions and yet live  but now the world had fallen the ruin had come and they were already strong in future hopes they had dared to look at their chaos and found that it still contained the elements of order there was much still that marred their happiness and forbade the joyousness of other days their poor father had gone from them in their misery and the house was still a house of mourning and their mother too though she bore up so wonderfully against her fate and for their sakes hoped and planned and listened to their wishes was a stricken woman that she would never smile again with any heartfelt joy they were all sure but nevertheless their chaos was conquered and there was hope that the fields of life would again show themselves green and fruitful  on one subject their mother never spoke to them nor had even herbert dared to speak to her not a word had been said in that house since mr prendergast left it as to the future whereabouts or future doings of that man to whom she had once given her hand at the altar but she had ventured to ask by letter a question of mr prendergast her question had been this what must i do that he may not come to me or to my children in answer to this mr prendergast had told her after some delay that he believed she need fear nothing he had seen the man and he thought that he might assure her that she would not be troubled in that respect  it is possible said mr prendergast that he may apply to you by letter for money if so give him no answer whatever but send his letters to me  and are you all going asked mrs townsend of aunt letty with a lachrymose voice soon after the fate of the family was decided they were sitting together with their knees over the fire in mrs townsends diningparlour in which the perilous state of the country had been discussed by them for many a pleasant hour together  well i think we shall you see my sister would never be happy here  no no the shock and the change would be too great for her poor lady fitzgerald and when is that man coming into the house  what owen  yes sir owen i suppose he is now  well i dont know he does not seem to be in any hurry i believe that he has said that my sister may continue to live there if she pleases but of course she cannot do that  they do say about the country whispered mrs townsend that he refuses to be the heir at all he certainly has not had any cards printed with the title on themi know that as a fact  he is a very singular man very you know i never could bear him said aunt letty  no nor i either he has not been to our church once these six months but its very odd isnt it of course you know the story  what story asked aunt letty  about lady clara owen fitzgerald was dreadfully in love with her before your herbert had ever seen her and they do say that he has sworn his cousin shall never live if he marries her  they can never marry now you know only think of it there would be three hundred a year between themnot at present that is added aunt letty looking forward to a future period after her own death  that is very little very little indeed said mrs townsend remembering however that she herself had married on less but miss fitzgerald if herbert does not marry her do you think this owen will  i dont think shed have him i am quite sure she would not  not when he has all the property and the title too  no nor double as much what would people say of her if she did but however there is no fear for she declares that nothing shall induce her to give up her engagement with our herbert  and so they discussed it backward and forward in every way each having her own theory as to that singular rumour which was going about the country signifying that owen had declined to accept the title aunt letty however would not believe that any good could come from so polluted a source and declared that he had his own reasons for the delay its not for any love of us she said if he refuses to take either that or the estate and in this she was right but she would have been more surprised still had she learned that owens forbearance arose from a strong anxiety to do what was just in the matter  and so herbert wont go into the church  and letty shook her head sorrowing  √Üneas would have been so glad to have taken him for a twelvemonths reading said mrs townsend he could have come here you know when you went away and been ordained at cork and got a curacy close in the neighbourhood where he was known it would have been so nice wouldnt it  aunt letty would not exactly have advised the scheme as suggested by mrs townsend her ideas as to herberts clerical studies would have been higher than this trinity college dublin was in her estimation the only place left for good church of england ecclesiastical teaching but as herbert was obstinately bent on declining sacerdotal life there was no use in dispelling mrs townsends bright vision  its all of no use she said he is determined to go to the bar  the bar is very respectable said mrs townsend kindly  and you mean to go with them too said mrs townsend after another pause youll hardly be happy im thinking so far away from your old home  it is sad to change at my time of life said aunt letty plaintively im sixtytwo now  nonsense said mrs townsend who however knew her age to a day  sixtytwo if i live another week and i have never yet had any home but castle richmond there i was born and till the other day i had every reason to trust that there i might die but what does it matter  no thats true of course what does it matter where we are while we linger in this vale of tears but couldnt you get a little place for yourself somewhere near here theres callaghans cottage with the twoacre piece for a cow and as nice a spot of a garden as there is in the county cork  i wouldnt separate myself from her now said aunt letty for all the cottages and all the gardens in ireland the lord has been pleased to throw us together and together we will finish our pilgrimage whither she goes i will go and where she lodges i will lodge her people shall be my people and her god my god and then mrs townsend said nothing further of callaghans pretty cottage or of the twoacre piece  but one reason for her going aunt letty did not give even to her friend mrs townsend her income that which belonged exclusively to herself was in no way affected by these sad castle richmond revolutions this was a comfortablewe may say a generous provision for an old maiden lady amounting to some six hundred a year settled upon her for life and this if added to what could be saved and scraped together would enable them to live comfortably as far as means were concerned in that suburban villa to which they were looking forward but without aunt lettys income that suburban villa must be but a poor home mr prendergast had calculated that some fourteen thousand pounds would represent the remaining property of the family with which it would be necessary to purchase government stock such being the case aunt lettys income was very material to them  i trust you will be able to find some one there who will preach the gospel to you said mrs townsend in a tone that showed how serious were her misgivings on the subject  i will search for such a one at any rate said aunt letty you need not be afraid that i shall be a backslider  but they have crosses now over the communion tables in the churches in england said mrs townsend  i know it is very bad said aunt letty but there will always be a remnant left the lord will not utterly desert us and then she took her departure leaving mrs townsend with the conviction that the land to which her friend was going was one in which the light of the gospel no longer shone in its purity  it was not wonderful that they should all be anxious to get away from castle richmond for the house there was now not a pleasant one in which to live let all those who have houses and the adjuncts of houses think how considerable a part of their lifes pleasures consists in their interest in the things around them when will the seakale be fit to cut and when will the crocuses come up will the violets be sweeter than ever and the geranium cuttings are they thriving we have dug and manured and sown and we look forward to the reaping and to see our garners full the very furniture which ministers to our daily uses is loved and petted and in decorating our rooms we educate ourselves in design the place in church which has been our own for yearsis not that dear to us and the voice that has told us of gods tidingseven though the drone become more evident as it waxes in years and though it grows feeble and indolent and the faces of those who have lived around us do we not love them too the servants who have worked for us and the children who have first toddled beneath our eyes and prattled in our ears and now run their strong races screaming loudly splashing us as they passvery unpleasantly do we not love them all do they not all contribute to the great sum of our enjoyment all men love such things more or less even though they know it not and women love them even more than men  and the fitzgeralds were about to leave them all the early buds of spring were now showing themselves but how was it possible that they should look to them one loves the bud because one expects the flower the seakale now was beyond their notice and though they plucked the crocuses they did so with tears upon their cheeks after much consideration the church had been abandoned by all except aunt letty and herbert that lady fitzgerald should go there was impossible and the girls were only too glad to be allowed to stay with their mother and the schools in which they had taught since the first day in which teaching had been possible for them had to be abandoned with such true pangs of heartfelt sorrow  from the time when their misery first came upon them from the days when it first began to be understood that the world had gone wrong at castle richmond this separation from the schools had commenced the work had been dropped for a while but the dropping had in fact been final and there was nothing further to be done than the saddest of all leavetaking the girls had sent word to the children perhaps imprudently that they would go down and say a word of adieu to their pupils the children had of course told their mothers and when the girls reached the two neat buildings which stood at the corner of the park there were there to meet them not unnaturally a concourse of women and children  in former prosperous days the people about castle richmond had as a rule been better to do than their neighbours money wages had been more plentiful and there had been little or no subletting of land the children had been somewhat more neatly clothed and the women less haggard in their faces but this difference was hardly perceptible any longer to them the miss fitzgeralds looking at the povertystricken assemblage it almost seemed as though the misfortune of their house had brought down its immediate consequences on all who had lived within their circle but this was the work of the famine in those days one could rarely see any member of a peasants family bearing in his face a look of health the yellow meal was a useful foodthe most useful doubtless which could at that time be found but it was not one that was gratifying either to the eye or palate  the girls had almost regretted their offer before they had left the house it would have been better they said to themselves to have had the children up in the hall and there to have spoken their farewells and made their little presents the very entering those schoolrooms again would almost be too much for them but this consideration was now too late and when they got to the corner of the gate they found that there was a crowd to receive them mary i must go back said emmeline when she first saw them but aunt letty who was with them stepped forward and they soon found themselves in the schoolroom  we have come to say goodbye to you all said aunt letty trying to begin a speech  may the heavens be yer bed then the lot of yez for ye war always good to the poor may the blessed virgin guide and protect ye wherever ye bea blessing against which aunt letty at once entered a little inward protest perturbed though she was in spirit may the heavens rain glory on yer heads for ye war always the finest family that war ever in the county cork  you know i dare say that we are going to leave you continued aunt letty  we knows it we knows it sorrow come to them as did it all faix an therell niver be any good in the counthry at all at all when youre gone miss emmeline an whatll we do at all for the want of yez and when shall we see the likes of yez eh miss letty but therell be sore eyes weeping for ye and for her leddyship too may the lord almighty bless her and presarve her and carry her sowl to glory when she dies for av there war iver a good woman on gods arth that woman is leddy fitzgerald  and then aunt letty found that there was no necessity for her to continue her speech and indeed no possibility of her doing so even if she were so minded the children began to wail and cry and the mothers also mixed loud sobbings with their loud prayers and emmeline and mary dissolved in tears sat themselves down drawing to them the youngest bairns and those whom they had loved the best kissing their sallow faminestricken unwholesome faces and weeping over them with a love of which hitherto they had been hardly conscious  there was not much more in the way of speech possible to any of them for even aunt letty was far gone in tender wailing and it was wonderful to see the liberties that were taken even with that venerable bonnet the women had first of all taken hold of her hands to kiss them and had kissed her feet and her garments and her shoulders and then behind her back they had made crosses on her although they knew how dreadfully she would have raged had she caught them polluting her by such doings and they grasped her arms and embraced them till at last those who were more daring reached her forehead and her face and poor old aunt letty who in her emotion could not now utter a syllable was almost pulled to pieces among them  mary and emmeline had altogether surrendered themselves and were the centres of clusters of children who hung upon them and the sobs now were no longer low and tearful but they had grown into long protracted groanings and loud wailings and clapping of hands and tearings of the hair o my reader have you ever seen a railway train taking its departure from an irish station with a freight of irish emigrants if so you know how the hair is torn and how the hands are clapped and how the low moanings gradually swell into notes of loud lamentation it means nothing i have heard men saymen and women too but such men and women are wrong it means much it means this that those who are separated not only love each other but are anxious to tell each other that they so love we have all heard of demonstrative people a demonstrative person i take it is he who is desirous of speaking out what is in his heart for myself i am inclined to think that such speaking out has its good ends the faculty of silence is it not of all things the most beautiful that is the doctrine preached by a great latterday philosopher for myself i think that the faculty of speech is much more beautifulof speech if it be made but by howlings and wailings and loud clappings of the hand what is in a man let it come out and be known to those around him if it be bad it will find correction if it be good it will spread and be beneficent  and then one woman made herself audible over the sobs of the crowding children she was a gaunt highboned woman but she would have been comely if not handsome had not the famine come upon her she held a baby in her arms and another little toddling thing had been hanging on her dress till emmeline had seen it and plucked it away and it was now sitting in her lap quite composed and sucking a piece of cake that had been given to it an its a bad day for us all said the woman beginning in a low voice which became louder and louder as she went on its a bad day for us all that takes away from us the only rale friends that we iver had and the back of my hand to them that have come in the way bringin sorrow an desolation an misery on gentlefolks that have been good to the poor since iver the poor have been in the land rale gentlefolks sich as there aint no others to be found nowadays in any of these parts ohone ohone but its a bad day for us and for the childer for where shall we find the dhrop to comfort us or the bit to ate when the sickness comes on us as its likely to come now when the fitzgeralds is out of the counthry may the lord bless them and keep them and presarve them and the holy virgin have them in her keepin  whishh said aunt letty who could not allow such idolatry to pass by unobserved or unrebuked  an shure the blessin of a poor woman cannot haram you continued the mother an ill tell you what neighbours itll be a bad day for him that folk call the heir when he puts his foot in that house  deed an thats thrue for you bridget magrath said another voice from among the crowd of women  a bad day intirely continued the woman with the baby av the house stans over his head when he does the like o that therell be no justice in the heavens  but mrs magrath said aunt letty trying to interrupt her you must not speak in that way you are mistaken in supposing that mr owen  well all live to see said the woman for the times comin quick upon us now but its a bad law that kills our ould masther over our heads an takes away from us our ould misthress an as for him they calls mr owen  but the ladies found it impossible to listen to her any longer so with some difficulty they extricated themselves from the crowd by which they were surrounded and once more shaking hands with those who were nearest to them escaped into the park and made their way back towards the house  they had not expected so much demonstration and were not a little disconcerted at the scene which had taken place aunt letty had never been so handled in her life and hardly knew how to make her bonnet sit comfortably on her head and the two girls were speechless till they were half across the park  i am glad we have been said emmeline at last as soon as the remains of her emotion would allow her to articulate her words  it would have been dreadful to have gone away without seeing them said mary poor creatures poor dear creatures we shall never again have any more people to be fond of us like that  there is no knowing said aunt letty the lord giveth and the lord taketh away and blessed is the name of the lord you are both young and may come back again but for me  dear aunt letty if we come back you shall come too  if i only thought that my bones could lie here near my brothers but never mind what signifies it where our bones lie and then they were silent for a while till aunt letty spoke again i mean to be quite happy over in england i believe i shall be happiest of you all if i can find any clergyman who is not half perverted to idolatry  this took place some time before the ladies left castle richmondperhaps as much as three weeks it was even before herberts departure who started for london the day but one after the scene here recorded he had gone to various places to take his last farewell to see the townsends at the parsonage to call on father barney at kanturk and had even shaken hands with the rev mr creagh at gortnaclough but one farewell visit had been put off for the last it was now arranged that he was to go over to desmond court and see clara before he went there had been some difficulty in this for lady desmond had at first declared that she could not feel justified in asking him into her house but the earl was now at home and her ladyship had at last given her consent he was to see the countess first and was afterwards to see claraalone he had declared that he would not go there unless he were to be allowed an interview with her in private the countess as i have said at last consented trusting that her previous eloquence might be efficacious in counteracting the ill effects of her daughters imprudence on the day after that interview he was to start for london never to return as he said to emmeline unless he came to seek his wife  but you will come to seek your wife said emmeline stoutly i shall think you fainthearted if you doubt it     chapter xxxiii  the last stage   on the day before his departure for london herbert fitzgerald once more got on his horsethe horse that was to be no longer his after that dayand rode off towards desmond court he had already perceived how foolish he had been in walking thither through the mud and rain when last he went there and how much he had lost by his sad appearance that day and by his want of personal comfort so he dressed himself with some caredressing not for his love but for the countessand taking his silvermounted whip in his gloved hand he got up on his wellgroomed nag with more spirit than he had hitherto felt  nothing could be better than the manner in which at this time the servants about castle richmond conducted themselves most of themindeed all but threehad been told that they must go and in so telling them the truth had been explained it had been found aunt letty said to one of the elder among them that mr herbert was not the heir to the property and therefore the family was obliged to go away mrs jones of course accompanied her mistress richard had been told both by herbert and by aunt letty that he had better remain and live on a small patch of land that should be provided for him but in answer to this he stated his intention of removing himself to london if the london air was fit for my leddy and miss letty it would be fit for him its no good any more talking mr herbert said richard i main to go so there was no more talking and he did go  but all the other servants took their months warning with tears and blessings and strove one beyond another how they might best serve the ladies of the family to the end id lose the little fingers off me to go with you miss emmeline so i would said one poor girlall in vain if they could not keep a retinue of servants in ireland it was clear enough that they could not keep them in london  the groom who held the horse for herbert to mount touched his hat respectfully as his young master rode off slowly down the avenue and then went back to the stables to meditate with awe on the changes which had happened in his time and to bethink himself whether or no he could bring himself to serve in the stables of owen the usurper  herbert did not take the direct road to desmond court but went round as though he were going to gortnaclough and then turning away from the gortnaclough road made his way by a cross lane towards clady and the mountains he hardly knew himself whether he had any object in this beyond one which he did not express even to himselfthat namely of not being seen on the way leading to desmond court but this he did do thereby riding out of the district with which he was most thoroughly acquainted and passing by cabins and patches of now deserted land which were strange to him it was a poor bleak damp undrained country lying beyond the confines of his fathers property which in good days had never been pleasant to the eye but which now in these daysdays that were so decidedly bad was anything but pleasant it was one of those tracts of land which had been divided and subdivided among the cottiers till the fields had dwindled down to parts of acres each surrounded by rude low banks which of themselves seemed to occupy a quarter of the surface of the land the original landmarks the big earthen banksbanks so large that a horse might walk on the top of themwere still visible enough showing to the practised eye what had once been the fields into which the land had been divided but these had since been bisected and crossected and intersected by family arrangements in which brothers had been jealous of brothers and fathers of their children till each little lot contained but a rood or two of available surface  this had been miserable enough to look at even when those roods had been cropped with potatoes or oats but now they were not cropped at all nor was there preparation being made for cropping them they had been let out under the conacre system at so much a rood for the potato season at rents amounting sometimes to ten or twelve pounds the acre but nobody would take them now there in that electoral division the whole proceeds of such land would hardly have paid the poor rates and therefore the land was left uncultivated  the winter was over for it was now april and had any tillage been intended it would have been commencedeven in ireland it was the beginning of april but the weather was still stormy and cold and the east wind which as a rule strikes ireland with but a light hand was blowing sharply on a sudden a squall of rain came onone of those spring squalls which are so piercingly cold but which are sure to pass by rapidly if the wayfarer will have patience to wait for them herbert remembering his former discomfiture resolved that he would have such patience and dismounting from his horse at a cabin on the roadside entered it himself and led his horse in after him in england no one would think of taking his steed into a poor mans cottage and would hardly put his beast into a cottagers shed without leave asked and granted but people are more intimate with each other and take greater liberties in ireland it is no uncommon thing on a wet huntingday to see a cabin packed with horses and the children moving about among them almost as unconcernedly as though the animals were pigs but then the irish horses are so well mannered and goodnatured  the cabin was one abutting as it were on the road not standing back upon the land as is most customary and it was built in an angle at a spot where the road made a turn so that two sides of it stood close out in the wayside it was small and wretched to look at without any sort of outside shed or even a scrap of potatogarden attached to ita miserable lowroofed damp ragged tenement as wretched as any that might be seen even in the county cork  but the nakedness of the exterior was as nothing to the nakedness of the interior when herbert entered followed by his horse his eye glanced round the dark place and it seemed to be empty of everything there was no fire on the hearth though a fire on the hearth is the easiest of all luxuries for an irishman to acquire and the last which he is willing to lose there was not an article of furniture in the whole place neither chairs nor table nor bed nor dresser there was there neither dish nor cup nor plate nor even the iron pot in which all the cookery of the irish cottiers menage is usually carried on beneath his feet was the damp earthen floor and around him were damp cracked walls and over his head was the old lumpy thatch through which the water was already dropping but inside was to be seen none of those articles of daily use which are usually to be found in the houses even of the poorest  but nevertheless the place was inhabited squatting in the middle of the cabin seated on her legs crossed under her with nothing between her and the wet earth there crouched a woman with a child in her arms at first so dark was the place herbert hardly thought that the object before him was a human being she did not move when he entered or speak to him or in any way show sign of surprise that he should have come there there was room for him and his horse without pushing her from her place and as it seemed he might have stayed there and taken his departure without any sign having been made by her  but as his eyes became used to the light he saw her eyes gleaming brightly through the gloom they were very large and bright as they turned round upon him while he movedlarge and bright but with a dull unwholesome brightnessa brightness that had in it none of the light of life  and then he looked at her more closely she had on her some rag of clothing which barely sufficed to cover her nakedness and the baby which she held in her arms was covered in some sort but he could see as he came to stand close over her that these garments were but loose rags which were hardly fastened round her body her rough short hair hung down upon her back clotted with dirt and the head and face of the child which she held was covered with dirt and sores on no more wretched object in its desolate solitude did the eye of man ever fall  in those days there was a form of face which came upon the sufferers when their state of misery was far advanced and which was a sure sign that their last stage of misery was nearly run the mouth would fall and seem to hang the lips at the two ends of the mouth would be dragged down and the lower parts of the cheeks would fall as though they had been dragged and pulled there were no signs of acute agony when this phasis of countenance was to be seen none of the horrid symptoms of gnawing hunger by which one generally supposes that famine is accompanied the look is one of apathy desolation and death when custom had made these signs easily legible the poor doomed wretch was known with certainty its no use in life meddling with him hes gone said a lady to me in the far west of the south of ireland while the poor boy whose doom was thus spoken stood by listening her delicacy did not equal her energy in doing goodfor she did much good but in truth it was difficult to be delicate when the hands were so full and then she pointed out to me the signs on the lads face and i found that her reading was correct  the famine was not old enough at the time of which we are speaking for herbert to have learned all this or he would have known that there was no hope left in this world for the poor creature whom he saw before him the skin of her cheek had fallen and her mouth was dragged and the mark of death was upon her but the agony of want was past she sat there listless indifferent hardly capable of suffering even for her child waiting her doom unconsciously  as he had entered without eliciting a word from her so might he have departed without any outward sign of notice but this would have been impossible on his part i have come in out of the rain for shelter said he looking down on her  out o the rain is it said she still fixing on him her glassy bright eyes yer honours welcome thin but she did not attempt to move nor show any of those symptoms of reverence which are habitual to the irish when those of a higher rank enter their cabins  you seem to be very poorly off here said herbert looking round the bare walls of the cabin have you no chair and no bed to lie on  deed no said she  and no fire said he for the damp and chill of the place struck through to his bones  deed no she said again but she made no wail as to her wants and uttered no complaint as to her misery  and are you living here by yourself without furniture or utensils of any kind  its jist as yer honour sees it answered she  for a while herbert stood still looking round him for the woman was so motionless and uncommunicative that he hardly knew how to talk to her that she was in the lowest depth of distress was evident enough and it behoved him to administer to her immediate wants before he left her but what could he do for one who seemed to be so indifferent to herself he stood for a time looking round him till he could see through the gloom that there was a bundle of straw lying in the dark corner beyond the hearth and that the straw was huddled up as though there were something lying under it seeing this he left the bridle of his horse and stepping across the cabin moved the straw with the handle of his whip as he did so he turned his back from the wall in which the small windowhole had been pierced so that a gleam of light fell upon the bundle at his feet and he could see that the body of a child was lying there stripped of every vestige of clothing  for a minute or two he said nothinghardly indeed knowing how to speak and looking from the corpselike woman back to the lifelike corpse and then from the corpse back to the woman as though he expected that she would say something unasked but she did not say a word though she so turned her head that her eyes rested on him  he then knelt down and put his hand upon the body and found that it was not yet stone cold the child apparently had been about four years old while that still living in her arms might perhaps be half that age  was she your own asked herbert speaking hardly above his breath  deed yes said the woman she was my own own little kitty but there was no tear in her eye or gurgling sob audible from her throat  and when did she die he asked  deed thin and i dont jist knownot exactly and sinking lower down upon her haunches she put up to her forehead the hand with which she had supported herself on the floorthe hand which was not occupied with the baby and pushing back with it the loose hairs from her face tried to make an effort at thinking  she was alive in the night wasnt she he said  i blieve thin she was yer honour twas broad day im thinking when she guv over moaning she warnt that way when he went away  and whos he  jist mike thin  and is mike your husband he asked she was not very willing to talk but it appeared at last that mike was her husband and that having become a cripple through rheumatism he had not been able to work on the roads in this condition he and his should of course have gone into a poorhouse it was easy enough to give such advice in such cases when one came across them and such advice when given at that time was usually followed but there were so many who had no advice who could get no aid who knew not which way to turn themselves this wretched man had succeeded in finding some one who would give him his foodfood enough to keep himself alivefor such work as he could do in spite of his rheumatism and this work to the last he would not abandon even this was better to him than the poorhouse but then as long as a man found work out of the poorhouse his wife and children would not be admitted into it they would not be admitted if the fact of the working husband was known the rule in itself was salutary as without it a man could work earning such wages as were adjudged to be needful for a family and at the same time send his wife and children to be supported on the rates but in some cases such as this it pressed very cruelly exceptions were of course made in such cases if they were known but then it was so hard to know them  this man mike the husband of that woman and the father of those children alive and dead had now gone to his work leaving his home without one morsel of food within it and the wife of his bosom and children of his love without the hope of getting any and then looking closely round him herbert could see that a small basin or bowl lay on the floor near her capable of holding perhaps a pint and on lifting it he saw that there still clung to it a few grains of uncooked indian cornflourthe yellow meal as it was called her husband she said at last had brought home with him in his cap a handful of this flour stolen from the place where he was workingperhaps a quarter of a pound then worth over a farthing and she had mixed this with water in a basin and this was the food which had sustained her or rather had not sustained her since yesterday morningher and her two children the one that was living and the one that was dead  such was her story told by her in the fewest of words and then he asked her as to her hopes for the future but though she cared as it seemed but little for the past for the future she cared less deed thin an i dont jist know she would say no more than that and would not even raise her voice to ask for alms when he pitied her in her misery but with her the agony of death was already over  and the child that you have in your arms he said is it not cold and he stood close over her and put out his hand and touched the babys body as he did so she made some motion as though to arrange the clothing closer round the childs limbs but herbert could see that she was making an effort to hide her own nakedness it was the only effort that she made while he stood there beside her  is she not cold he said again when he had turned his face away to relieve her from her embarrassment  cowld she muttered with a vacant face and wondering tone of voice as though she did not quite understand him i suppose she is could why wouldnt she be could were could enough if thats all but still she did not stir from the spot on which she sat and the child though it gave from time to time a low moan that was almost inaudible lay still in her arms with its big eyes staring into vacancy  he felt that he was stricken with horror as he remained there in the cabin with the dying woman and the naked corpse of the poor dead child but what was he to do he could not go and leave them without succour the woman had made no plaint of her suffering and had asked for nothing but he felt that it would be impossible to abandon her without offering her relief nor was it possible that he should leave the body of the child in that horribly ghastly state so he took from his pocket his silk handkerchief and returning to the corner of the cabin spread it as a covering over the corpse at first he did not like to touch the small naked dwindled remains of humanity from which life had fled but gradually he overcame his disgust and kneeling down he straightened the limbs and closed the eyes and folded the handkerchief round the slender body the mother looked on him the while shaking her head slowly as though asking him with all the voice that was left to her whether it were not piteous but of words she still uttered none  and then he took from his pocket a silver coin or two and tendered them to her these she did take muttering some word of thanks but they caused in her no emotion of joy she was there waiting she said till mike should return and there she would still wait even though she should die with the silver in her hand  i will send some one to you he said as he took his departure some one that shall take the poor child and bury it and who shall move you and the other one into the workhouse she thanked him once more with some low muttered words but the promise brought her no joy and when the succour came it was all too late for the mother and the two children never left the cabin till they left it together wrapped in their workhouse shrouds  herbert as he remounted his horse and rode quietly on forgot for a while both himself and clara desmond whatever might be the extent of his own calamity how could he think himself unhappy after what he had seen how could he repine at aught that the world had done for him having now witnessed to how low a state of misery a fellow human being might be brought could he after that dare to consider himself unfortunate  before he reached desmond court he did make some arrangements for the poor woman and directed that a cart might be sent for her so that she might be carried to the union workhouse at kanturk but his efforts in her service were of little avail people then did not think much of a dying woman and were in no special hurry to obey herberts behest  a woman to be carried to the union is it for mr fitzgerald eh what mr fitzgerald says must be done in course but sure av its done before dark wont that be time enough for the likes of her  but had they flown to the spot on the wings of love it would not have sufficed to prolong her life one day her doom had been spoken before herbert had entered the cabin     chapter xxxiv  farewell   he was two hours later than he had intended as he rode up the avenue to lady desmonds gate and his chief thought at the moment was how he should describe to the countess the scene he had just witnessed why describe it at all that is what we should all say he had come there to talk about other thingsabout other things which must be discussed and which would require all his wits let him keep that poor woman on his mind but not embarrass himself with any mention of her for the present this no doubt would have been wise if only it had been possible but out of the full heart the mouth speaks  but lady desmond had not witnessed the scene which i have attempted to describe and her heart therefore was not full of it and was not inclined to be so filled and so in answer to herberts exclamation oh lady desmond i have seen such a sight she gave him but little encouragement to describe it and by her coldness reserve and dignity soon quelled the expression of his feelings  the earl was present and shook hands very cordially with herbert when he entered the room and he being more susceptible as being younger and not having yet become habituated to the famine as his mother was did express some eager sympathy he would immediately go down or send fahy with the car and have her brought up and saved but his mother had other work to do and soon put a stop to all this  mr fitzgerald said she speaking with a smile upon her face and with much highbred dignity of demeanour as you and lady clara both wish to see each other before you leave the country and as you have known each other so intimately and considering all the circumstances i have not thought it well absolutely to forbid an interview but i do doubt its expediency i do indeed and lord desmond who feels for your late misfortune as we all do perfectly agrees with me he thinks that it would be much wiser for you both to have parted without the pain of a meeting seeing how impossible it is that you should ever be more to each other than you are now and then she appealed to her son who stood by looking not quite so wise nor even quite so decided as his mothers words would seem to make him  well yes upon my word i dont see how its to be said the young earl i am deuced sorry for it for one and i wish i was well off so that i could give clara a pot of money and then i should not care so much about your not being the baronet  i am sure you must see mr fitzgerald and i know that you do see it because you have very properly said so that a marriage between you and lady clara is now impossible for her such an engagement would be very badvery bad indeed but for you it would be utter ruin indeed it would be ruin for you both unencumbered as you will be and with the good connection which you will have and with your excellent talents it will be quite within your reach to win for yourself a high position but with you as with other gentlemen who have to work their way marriage must come late in life unless you marry an heiress this i think is thoroughly understood by all people in our position and i am sure that it is understood by your excellent mother for whom i always had and still have the most unfeigned respect as this is so undoubtedly the case and as i cannot of course consent that lady clara should remain hampered by an engagement which would in all human probability hang over the ten best years of her life i thought it wise that you should not see each other i have however allowed myself to be overruled and now i must only trust to your honour forbearance and prudence to protect my child from what might possibly be the ill effects of her own affectionate feelings that she is romanticenthusiastic to a fault i should perhaps rather call iti need not tell you she thinks that your misfortune demands from her a sacrifice of herself but you i know will feel that even were such a sacrifice available to you it would not become you to accept it because you have fallen you will not wish to drag her down more especially as you can rise againand she could not  so spoke the countess with much worldly wisdom and with considerable tact in adjusting her words to the object which she had in view herbert as he stood before her silent during the period of her oration did feel that it would be well for him to give up his love and go away in utter solitude of heart to those dingy studies which mr prendergast was preparing for him his love or rather the assurance of claras love had been his great consolation but what right had he with all the advantages of youth and health and friends and education to require consolation and then from moment to moment he thought of the woman whom he had left in the cabin and confessed that he did not dare to call himself unhappy  he had listened attentively although he did thus think of other eloquence besides that of the countessof the eloquence of that silent solitary dying woman but when she had done he hardly knew what to say for himself she did make him feel that it would be ungenerous in him to persist in his engagement but then again claras letters and his sisters arguments had made him feel that it was impossible to abandon it they pleaded of heartfeelings so well that he could not resist them and the countessshe pleaded so well as to worlds prudence that he could not resist her  i would not willingly do anything to injure lady clara he said  thats what we all knew said the young earl you see what is a girl to do like her love in a cottage is all very well and all that and as for riches i dont care about them it would be a pity if i did for i shall be about the poorest nobleman in the three kingdoms i suppose but a chap when he marries should have something shouldnt he now  to tell the truth the earl had been very much divided in his opinions since he had come home veering round a point or two this way or a point or two that in obedience to the blast of eloquence to which he might be last subjected but latterly the idea had grown upon him that clara might possibly marry owen fitzgerald there was about owen a strange fascination which all felt who had once loved him to the world he was rough and haughty imperious in his commands and exacting even in his fellowship but to the few whom he absolutely loved whom he had taken into his hearts core no man ever was more tender or more gracious clara though she had resolved to banish him from her heart had found it impossible to do so till herberts misfortunes had given him a charm in her eyes which was not all his own claras mother had loved himhad loved him as she never before had loved and now she loved him still though she had so strongly determined that her love should be that of a mother and not that of a wife and the young earl now that owens name was again rife in his ears remembered all the pleasantness of former days he had never again found such a companion as owen had been he had met no other friend to whom he could talk of sport and a mans outward pleasures when his mind was that way given and to whom he could also talk of soft inward thingsthe hearts feelings and aspirations and wants owen would be as tender with him as a woman allowing the young lads arm round his body listening to words which the outer world would have called boshand have derided as girlish so at least thought the young earl to himself and all boys long to be allowed utterance occasionally for these soft tender thingsas also do all men unless the devils share in the world has become altogether uppermost with them  and the young lads heart hankered after his old friend he had listened to his sister and for a while had taken her part but his mother had since whispered to him that owen would now be the better suitor the preferable brotherinlaw and that in fact clara loved owen the best though she felt herself bound by honour to his kinsman and then she reminded her son of claras former love for owena love which he himself had witnessed and he thought of the day when with so much regret he had told his friend that he was unsuited to wed with an earls penniless daughter of the subsequent pleasantness which had come with herberts arrival he had seen little or nothing he had been told by letter that herbert fitzgerald the prosperous heir of castle richmond was to be his future brotherinlaw and he had been satisfied but now if owen could returnhow pleasant it would be  but a chap when he marries should have something shouldnt he now so spoke the young earl reechoing his mothers prudence  herbert did not quite like this interference on the boys part was he to explain to a young lad from eton what his future intentions were with reference to his mode of living and period of marriage of course he said addressing himself to the countess i shall not insist on an engagement made under such different circumstances  nor will you allow her to do so through a romantic feeling of generosity said the countess  you should know your own daughter lady desmond better than i do he answered but i cannot say what i may do at her instance till i shall have seen her  do you mean to say that you will allow a girl of her age to talk you into a proceeding which you know to be wrong  i will allow no one he said to talk me into a proceeding which i know to be wrong nor will i allow any one to talk me out of a proceeding which i believe to be right and then having uttered these somewhat grandiloquent words he shut himself up as though there were no longer any need for discussing the subject  my poor child said the countess in a low tremulous voice as though she did not intend him to hear them my poor unfortunate child herbert as he did hear them thought of the woman in the cabin and of her misfortunes and of her children come patrick continued the countess it is perhaps useless for us to say anything further at present if you will remain here mr fitzgerald for a minute or two i will send lady clara to wait upon you and then curtsying with great dignity she withdrew and the young earl scuffled out after her mamma he said as he went he is determined that he will have her  my poor child answered the countess  and if i were in his place i should be determined also you may as well give it up not but that i like owen a thousand times the best  herbert did wait there for some five minutes and then the door was opened very gently was gently closed again and clara desmond was in the room he came towards her respectfully holding out his hand that he might take hers but before he had thought of how she would act she was in his arms hitherto of all betrothed maidens she had been the most retiring sometimes he had thought her cold when she had left the seat by his side to go and nestle closely by his sister she had avoided the touch of his hand and the pressure of his arm and had gone from him speechless if not with anger then with dismay when he had carried the warmth of his love beyond the touch of his hand or the pressure of his arm but now she rushed into his embrace and hid her face upon his shoulder as though she were over glad to return to the heart from which those around her had endeavoured to banish her was he or was he not to speak of his love that had been the question which he had asked himself when left alone there for those five minutes with the eloquence of the countess ringing in his ears now that question had in truth been answered for him  herbert she said herbert i have so sorrowed for you but i know that you have borne it like a man  she was thinking of what he had now half forgottenthe position which he had lost those hopes which had all been shipwrecked his title surrendered to another and his lost estates she was thinking of them as the loss affected him but he he had reconciled himself to all thatunless all that were to separate him from his promised bride  dearest clara he said with his arm close round her waist while neither anger nor dismay appeared to disturb the sweetness of that position the letter which you wrote me has been my chief comfort now if he had any intention of liberating clara from the bond of her engagementif he really had any feeling that it behoved him not to involve her in the worldly losses which had come upon himhe was taking a very bad way of carrying out his views in that respect instead of confessing the comfort which he had received from that letter and holding her close to his breast while he did confess it he should have stood away from herquite as far apart as he had done from the countess and he should have argued with her showing her how foolish and imprudent her letter had been explaining that it behoved her now to repress her feelings and teaching her that peers daughters as well as housemaids should look out for situations which would suit them guided by prudence and a view to the wagesnot follow the dictates of impulse and of the heart this is what he should have done according i believe to the views of most men and women instead of that he held her there as close as he could hold her and left her to do the most of the speaking i think he was right according to my ideas womans love should be regarded as fair prize of waras long as the war has been carried on with due adherence to the recognized law of nations when it has been fairly won let it be firmly held i have no opinion of that theory of giving up  you knew that i would not abandon you did you not know it say that you knew it said clara and then she insisted on having an answer  i could hardly dare to think that there was so much happiness left for me said herbert  then you were a traitor to your love sir a false traitor but deep as was the offence for which she arraigned him it was clear to see that the pardon came as quick as the conviction and was emmeline so untrue to me also as to believe that  emmeline said and then he told her what emmeline had said  dearest dearest emmeline give her a whole heartload of love from me now mind you doand to mary too and remember this sir that i love emmeline ten times better than i do you twenty times because she knew me oh if she had mistrusted me  and do you think that i mistrusted you  yes you did you know you did sir you wrote and told me soand now this very day you come here to act as though you mistrusted me still you know you have only you have not the courage to go on with the acting  and then he began to defend himself showing how ill it would have become him to have kept her bound to her engagements had she feared poverty as most girls in her position would have feared it but on this point she would not hear much from him lest the very fact of her hearing it should make it seem that such a line of conduct were possible to her  you know nothing about most girls sir or about any i am afraid not even about one and if most girls were frightfully heartless which they are not what right had you to liken me to most girls emmeline knew better and why could not you take her as a type of most girls you have behaved very badly master herbert and you know it and nothing on earth shall make me forgive you nothingbut your promise that you will not so misjudge me any more and then the tears came to his eyes and her face was again hidden on his shoulder  it was not very probable that after such a commencement the interview would terminate in a manner favourable to the wishes of the countess clara swore to her lover that she had given him all that she had to giveher heart and will and very self and swore also that she could not and would not take back the gift she would remain as she was now as long as he thought proper and would come to him whenever he should tell her that his home was large enough for them both and so that matter was settled between them  then she had much to say about his mother and sisters and a word too about his poor father and now that it was settled between them so fixedly that come what might they were to float together in the same boat down the river of life she had a question or two also to ask and her approbation to give or to withhold as to his future prospects he was not to think she told him of deciding on anything without at any rate telling her so he had to explain to her all the family plans making her know why he had decided on the law as his own path to fortune and asking for and obtaining her consent to all his proposed measures  in this way her view of the matter became more and more firmly adopted as that which should be the view resolutely to be taken by them both the countess had felt that that interview would be fatal to her and she had been right but how could she have prevented it twenty times she had resolved that she would prevent it but twenty times she had been forced to confess that she was powerless to do so in these days a mother even can only exercise such power over a child as public opinion permits her to use mother it was you who brought us together and you cannot separate us now that had always been claras argument leaving the countess helpless except as far as she could work on herberts generosity that she had triedand as we have seen been foiled there also if only she could have taken her daughter away while the castle richmond family were still mersed in the bitter depth of their sufferingat that moment when the blows were falling on them then indeed she might have done something but she was not like other titled mothers in such a step as this she was absolutely without the means  thus talking together they remained closeted for a most unconscionable time clara had had her purpose to carry out and to herbert the moments had been too precious to cause him any regret as they passed but now at last a knock was heard at the door and lady desmond without waiting for an answer to it entered the room clara immediately started from her seat not as though she were either guilty or tremulous but with a brave resolve to go on with her purposed plan  mamma she said it is fixed now it cannot be altered now  what is fixed clara  herbert and i have renewed our engagement and nothing must now break it unless we die  mr fitzgerald if this be true your conduct to my daughter has been unmanly as well as ungenerous  lady desmond it is true and i think that my conduct is neither unmanly nor ungenerous  your own relations are against you sir  what relations asked clara sharply  i am not speaking to you clara your absurdity and romance are so great that i cannot speak to you  what relations herbert again asked clara for she would not for the world have had lady fitzgerald against her  lady desmond has i believe seen my aunt letty two or three times lately i suppose she must mean her  oh said clara turning away as though she were now satisfied and then herbert escaping from the house as quickly as he could rode home with a renewal of that feeling of triumph which he had once enjoyed before when returning from desmond court to castle richmond  on the next day herbert started for london the parting was sad enough and the occasion of it was such that it could hardly be otherwise i am quite sure of one thing he said to his sister emmeline i shall never see castle richmond again and indeed one may say that small as might be his chance of doing so his wish to do so must be still less there could be no possible inducement to him to come back to a place which had so nearly been his own and the possession of which he had lost in so painful a manner every tree about the place every path across the wide park every hedge and ditch and hidden leafy corner had had for him a special interestfor they had all been his own but all that was now over they were not only not his own but they belonged to one who was mounting into his seat of power over his head  he had spent the long evening before his last dinner in going round the whole demesne alone so that no eye should witness what he felt none but those who have known the charms of a countryhouse early in life can conceive the intimacy to which a man attains with all the various trifling objects round his own locality how he knows the bark of every tree and the bend of every bough how he has marked where the rich grass grows in tufts and where the poorer soil is always dry and bare how he watches the nests of the rooks and the holes of the rabbits and has learned where the thrushes build and can show the branch on which the linnet sits all these things had been dear to herbert and they all required at his hand some last farewell every dog too he had to see and to lay his hand on the neck of every horse this making of his final adieu under such circumstances was melancholy enough  and then too later in the evening after dinner all the servants were called into the parlour that he might shake hands with them there was not one of them who had not hoped as lately as three months since that he or she would live to call herbert fitzgerald master indeed he had already been their mastertheir young master all irish servants especially love to pay respect to the young masther but herbert now was to be their master no longer and the probability was that he would never see one of them again  he schooled himself to go through the ordeal with a manly gait and with dry eyes and he did it but their eyes were not dry not even those of the men mrs jones and a favourite girl whom the young ladies patronized were not of the number for it had been decided that they should follow the fortunes of their mistress but richard was there standing a little apart from the others as being now on a different footing he was to go also but before the scene was over he also had taken to sobbing violently  i wish you all well and happy said herbert making his little speech and regret deeply that the intercourse between us should be thus suddenly severed you have served me and mine well and truly and it is hard upon you now that you should be bid to go and seek another home elsewhere  it isnt that we mind mr herbert it aint that as frets us said one of the men  it aint that at all at all said richard doing chorus but that yer honour should be robbed of what is yer honours own  but you all know that we cannot help it continued herbert a misfortune has come upon us which nobody could have foreseen and therefore we are obliged to part with our old friends and servants  at the word friends the maidservants all sobbed and deed we is your frinds and true frinds too wailed the cook  i know you are and it grieves me to feel that i shall see you no more but you must not be led to think by what richard says that anybody is depriving me of that which ought to be my own i am now leaving castle richmond because it is not my own but justly belongs to anotherto another who i must in justice tell you is in no hurry to claim his inheritance we none of us have any ground for displeasure against the present owner of this place my cousin sir owen fitzgerald  we dont know nothing about sir owen said one voice  and dont want said another convulsed with sobs  hes a very good sort of young gentlemanof his own kind no doubt said richard  but you can all of you understand continued herbert that as this place is no longer our own we are obliged to leave it and as we shall live in a very different way in the home to which we are going we are obliged to part with you though we have no reason to find fault with any one among you i am going tomorrow morning early and my mother and sisters will follow after me in a few weeks it will be a sad thing too for them to say goodbye to you all as it is for me now but it cannot be helped god bless you all and i hope that you will find good masters and kind mistresses with whom you may live comfortably as i hope you have done here  we cant find no other mistresses like her leddyship sobbed out the senior housemaid  there aint niver such a one in the county cork said the cook in a week of sundays you wouldnt hear the breath out of her above her own swait nathural voice  ive driv her since iver began richard but he was going to say since ever she was married but he remembered that this allusion would be unbecoming so he turned his face to the doorpost and began to wail bitterly  and then herbert shook hands with them all and it was pretty to see how the girls wiped their hands in their aprons before they gave them to him and how they afterwards left the room with their aprons up to their faces the women walked out first and then the men hanging down their heads and muttering as they went each some little prayer that fortune and prosperity might return to the house of fitzgerald the property might go but according to their views herbert was always and always would be the head of the house and then last of all richard went there aint one of em mr herbert as wouldnt guv his fist to go wid yer and think nothing about the wages  he was to start very early and his packing was all completed that night i do so wish we were going with you said emmeline sitting in his room on the top of a corded box which was to follow him by some slower conveyance  and i do so wish i was staying with you said he  what is the good of staying here now said she what pleasure can there be in it i hardly dare to go outside the house door for fear i should be seen  but why we have done nothing that we need be ashamed of  no i know that but herbert do you not find that the pity of the people is hard to bear it is written in their eyes and meets one at every turn  we shall get rid of that very soon in a few months we shall be clean forgotten  i do not know about being forgotten  you will be as clean forgottenas though you had never existed and all these servants who are now so fond of us in three months time will be just as fond of owen fitzgerald if he will let them stay here its the way of the world  that herbert should have indulged in a little morbid misanthropy on such an occasion was not surprising but i take leave to think that he was wrong in his philosophy we do make new friends when we lose our old friends and the heart is capable of cure as is the body were it not so how terrible would be our fate in this world but we are so apt to find fault with gods goodness to us in this respect arguing of others if not of ourselves that the heart once widowed should remain a widow through all time i for one think that the heart should receive its new spouses with what alacrity it may and always with thankfulness  i suppose lady desmond will let us see clara said emmeline  of course you must see her if you knew how much she talks about you you would not think of leaving ireland without seeing her  dear clara i am sure she does not love me better than i do her but suppose that lady desmond wont let us see her and i know that it will be so that grave old man with the bald head will come out and say that the lady clara is not at home and then we shall have to leave without seeing her but it does not matter with her as it might with others for i know that her heart will be with us  if you write beforehand to say that you are coming and explain that you are doing so to say goodbye then i think they will admit you  yes and the countess would take care to be there so that i could not say one word to clara about you oh herbert i would give anything if i could have her here for one dayonly for one day but when they talked it over they both of them decided that this would not be practicable clara could not stay away from her own house without her mothers leave and it was not probable that her mother would give her permission to stay at castle richmond     chapter xxxv  herbert fitzgerald in london   on the following morning the whole household was up and dressed very early lady fitzgeraldthe poor lady made many futile attempts to drop her title but hitherto without any shadow of successlady fitzgerald was down in the breakfast parlour at seven as also were aunt letty and mary and emmeline herbert had begged his mother not to allow herself to be disturbed alleging that there was no cause seeing that they all so soon would meet in london but she was determined that she would superintend his last meal at castle richmond the servants brought in the trays with melancholy silence and now that the absolute moment of parting had come the girls could not speak lest the tears should come and choke them it was not that they were about to part with him that parting would only be for a month but he was now about to part from all that ought to have been his own he sat down at the table in his accustomed place with a forced smile on his face but without a word and his sisters put before him his cup of tea and the slice of ham that had been cut for him and his portion of bread that he was making an effort they all saw he bowed his head down over the tea to sip it and took the knife in his hand and then he looked up at them for he knew that their eyes were on him he looked up at them to show that he could still endure it but alas he could not endure it the struggle was too much for him he pushed his plate violently from him into the middle of the table and dropping his head upon his hands he burst forth into audible lamentations  oh my friends be not hard on him in that he was thus weeping like a woman it was not for his lost wealth that he was wailing nor even for the name or splendour that could be no longer his nor was it for his fathers memory though he had truly loved his father nor for his mothers sorrow or the tragedy of her lifes history for none of these things were his tears flowing and his sobs coming so violently that it nearly choked him to repress them nor could he himself have said why he was weeping  it was the hundred small things from which he was parting for ever that thus disturbed him the chair on which he sat the carpet on the floor the table on which he leaned the dull old picture of his greatgrandfather over the fireplacethey were all his old familiar friends they were all part of castle richmondof that castle richmond which he might never be allowed to see again  his mother and sisters came to him hanging over him and they joined their tears together do not tell her that i was like this said he at last  she will love you the better for it if she has a true womans heart within her breast said his mother  as true a heart as ever breathed said emmeline through her sobs  and then they pressed him to eat but it was in vain he knew that the food would choke him if he attempted it so he gulped down the cup of tea and with one kiss to his mother he rushed from them refusing aunt lettys proffered embrace passing through the line of servants without another word to one of them and burying himself in the postchaise which was to carry him the first stage on his melancholy journey  it was a melancholy journey all through from the time that he left the door at castle richmond that was no longer his own till he reached the euston station in london he spoke no word to any one more than was absolutely necessary for the purposes of his travelling nothing could be more sad than the prospect of his residence in london not that he was without friends there for he belonged to a fashionable club to which he could still adhere if it so pleased him and had all his old oxford comrades to fall back upon if that were of any service to him but how is a man to walk into his club who yesterday was known as his fathers eldest son and the heir to a baronetcy and twelve thousand a year and who today is known as nobodys son and the heir to nothing men would feel so much for him and pity him so deeply that was the worst feature of his present position he could hardly dare to show himself more than was absolutely necessary till the newness of his tragedy was worn off  mr prendergast had taken lodgings for him in which he was to remain till he could settle himself in the same house with his mother and this house in which they were all to live had also been takenup in that cheerful locality near harrowonthehill called st johns wood road the cab fares to which from any central part of london are so very ruinous but that house was not yet ready and so he went into lodgings in lincolns inn fields mr prendergast had chosen this locality because it was near the chambers of that great chancery barrister mr die under whose beneficent wing herbert fitzgerald was destined to learn all the mysteries of the chancery bar the sanctuary of mr dies wig was in stone buildings immediately close to that milky way of vicechancellors whose separate courts cluster about the old chapel of lincolns inn and here was herbert to sit studious for the next three yearsto sit there instead of at the various relief committees in the vicinity of kanturk and why could he not be as happy at the one as at the other would not mr die be as amusing as mr townsend and the arguments of vicechancellor stuarts court quite as instructive as those heard in the committee room at gortnaclough  on the morning of his arrival in london he drove to his lodgings and found a note there from mr prendergast asking him to dinner on that day and promising to take him to mr die on the following morning mr prendergast kept a bachelors house in bloomsbury square not very far from lincolns innjust across holborn as all londoners know and there he would expect herbert at seven oclock i will not ask any one to meet you he said because you will be tired after your journey and perhaps more inclined to talk to me than to strangers  mr prendergast was one of those oldfashioned people who think that a spacious substantial house in bloomsbury square at a rent of a hundred and twenty pounds a year is better worth having than a narrow lath and plaster illbuilt tenement at nearly double the price out westward of the parks a quite new man is necessarily afraid of such a locality as bloomsbury square for he has no chance of getting any one into his house if he do not live westward who would dine with mr jones in woburn terrace unless he had known mr jones all his days or unless jones were known as a top sawyer in some walk of life but mr prendergast was well enough known to his old friends to be allowed to live where he pleased and he was not very anxious to add to their number by any new fashionable allurements  herbert sent over to bloomsbury square to say that he would be there at seven oclock and then sat himself down in his new lodgings it was but a dingy abode consisting of a narrow sittingroom looking out into the big square from over a covered archway and a narrower bedroom looking backwards into a dull dirtylooking crooked street nothing he thought could be more melancholy than such a home but then what did it signify his days would be passed in mr dies chambers and his evenings would be spent over his law books with closed windows and copious burnings of the midnight oil for herbert had wisely resolved that hard work and hard work alone could mitigate the misery of his present position  but he had no work for the present day he could not at once unpack his portmanteau and begin his law studies on the moment it was about noon when he had completed the former preparation and eaten such breakfast as his new london landlady had gotten for him and the breakfast had not of itself been bad for mrs whereas had been a daughter of themis all her life waiting upon scions of the law since first she had been able to run for a pennorth of milk she had been laundress on a stairs for ten years having married a law stationers apprentice and now she owned the dingy house over the covered way and let her own lodgings with her own furniture nor was she often without friends who would recommend her zeal and honesty and make excuse for the imperiousness of her ways and the too great fluency of her by no means servile tongue  oh mrs said herbert i beg your pardon but might i ask your name  no offence sir none in life my names whereas martha whereas and as been now for fiveandtwenty year there beant many of the genlemen about the courts here as dont know someat of me and i knew someat of them too before they carried their wigs so grandly my husband thats whereasyoull allays find him at the little stationers shop outside the gate in carey street youll know him some of these days ill go bail if youre going to mr die anyways youll know his handwrite tea to your liking sir i allays gets cream for gentlemen sir unless they tells me not milk a alfpenny sir cream tuppence three alfpence difference haint it sir so now you can do as you pleases and if you like bacon and heggs to your breakfastesses youve only to say the words but then the heggs haint heggs thats the truth and they haint chickens but someat betwixt the two  and so she went on during the whole time that he was eating moving about from place to place and putting back into the places which she had chosen for them anything which he had chanced to move now dusting a bit of furniture with her apron and then leaning on the back of a chair while she asked him some question as to his habits and future mode of living she also wore a bonnet apparently as a customary part of her house costume and herbert could not help thinking that she looked very like his aunt letty  but when she had gone and taken the breakfast things with her then began the tedium of the day it seemed to him as though he had no means of commencing his life in london until he had been with mr prendergast or mr die and so new did it all feel to him so strange and wonderful that he hardly dared to go out of the house by himself and wander about the premises of the inn he was not absolutely a stranger in london for he had been elected at a club before he had left oxford and had been up in town twice staying on each occasion some few weeks had he therefore been asked about the metropolis some four months since at castle richmond he would have professed that he knew it well starting from pall mall he could have gone to any of the central theatres or to the parks or to the houses of parliament or to the picture galleries in june but now in that dingy big square he felt himself to be absolutely a stranger and when he did venture out he watched the corners in order that he might find his way back without asking questions  and then he roamed round the squares and about the little courts and found out where were stone buildingsso called because they are so dull and dead and stonyhearted and as his courage increased he made his way into one of the courts and stood up for a while on an uncomfortable narrow step so that he might watch the proceedings as they went on and it all seemed to him to be dull and deadly there was no life and amusement such as he had seen at the assize court in county cork when he was sworn in as one of the grand jury there the gentlemen in wigsfor on the munster circuit they do wear wigs or at any rate did thenlaughed and winked and talked together joyously and when a roman catholic fisherman from berehaven was put into the dock for destroying the boat and nets of a protestant fisherman from dingle in county kerry who had chanced to come that way not fishing at all at all yer honour but just souping as the papist prisoner averred with great emphasis the gentlemen of the robe had gone to the fight with all the animation and courage of matadors and picadors in a bullring it was delightful to see the way in which roman catholic skill combated protestant fury with a substratum below of irish fun which showed to everybody that it was not all quite in earnestthat the great ofagan and the great fitzberesford could sit down together afterwards with all the pleasure in life over their modicum of claret in the barristers room at the imperial hotel and then the judge had added to the life of the meeting helping to bamboozle and make miserable a wretch of a witness who had been caught in the act of seeing the boat smashed with a fragment of rock and was now in consequence being impaled alive by his lordships assistance  what do you say your name is demanded his lordship angrily  rowland houghton said the miserable stray saxon tourist who had so unfortunately strayed that way on the occasion  what repeated the judge whose ears were sharper to such sounds as oshaughnessy macgillycuddy and ocallaghan  rowland houghton said the offender in his distress quicker louder and perhaps not more distinctly than before  what does the man say said the judge turning his head down towards a satellite who sat on a bench beneath his cushion  the gentleman appealed to pronounced the name for the judges hearing with a full rolling irish brogue that gave great delight through all the court rrowland houghhton me lorrd  whereupon his lordship threw up his hands in dismay oulan outan said he oulan outan i never heard such a name in my life and then having thoroughly impaled the wicked witness and added materially to the amusement of the day the judge wrote down the name in his book and there it is to this day no doubt oulan outan and when one thinks of it it was monstrous that an english witness should go into an irish law court with such a name as rowland houghton  but here in the dark dingy court to which herbert had penetrated in lincolns inn there was no such life as this here whatever skill there might be was of a dark subterranean nature quite unintelligible to any minds but those of experts and as for fury or fun there was no spark either of one or of the other the judge sat back in his seat a tall handsome speechless man not asleep for his eye from time to time moved slowly from the dingy barrister who was on his legs to another dingy barrister who was sitting with his hands in his pockets and with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling the gentleman who was in the act of pleading had a huge open paper in his hand from which he droned forth certain legal quiddities of the dullest and most uninteresting nature he was in earnest for there was a perpetual energy in his drone as a droning bee might drone who was known to drone louder than other drones but it was a continuous energy supported by perseverance and not by impulse and seemed to come of a fixed determination to continue the reading of that paper till all the world should be asleep a great part of the world around was asleep but the judges eye was still open and one might say that the barrister was resolved to go on till that eye should have become closed in token of his success  herbert remained there for an hour thinking that he might learn something that would be serviceable to him in his coming legal career but at the end of the hour the same thing was going onthe judges eye was still open and the lawyers drone was still sounding and so he came away having found himself absolutely dozing in the uncomfortable position in which he was standing  at last the day wore away and at seven oclock he found himself in mr prendergasts hall in bloomsbury square and his hat and umbrella were taken away from him by an old servant looking very much like mr prendergast himselfhaving about him the same look of the stiffness of years and the same look also of excellent preservation and care  mr prendergast is in the library sir if you please said the old servant and so saying he ushered herbert into the back downstairs room it was a spacious lofty apartment well fitted up for a library and furnished for that purpose with exceeding caresuch a room as one does not find in the flashy new houses in the west where the diningroom and drawingroom occupy all of the house that is visible but then how few of those who live in flashy new houses in the west require to have libraries in london  as he entered the room mr prendergast came forward to meet him and seemed heartily glad to see him there was a cordiality about him which herbert had never recognized at castle richmond and an appearance of enjoyment which had seemed to be almost foreign to the lawyers nature herbert perhaps had not calculated as he should have done that mr prendergasts mission in ireland had not admitted of much enjoyment mr prendergast had gone there to do a job of work and that he had done very thoroughly but he certainly had not enjoyed himself  there was time for only few words before the old man again entered the room announcing dinner and those few words had no reference whatever to the castle richmond sorrow he had spoken of herberts lodging and of his journey and a word or two of mr die and then they went in to dinner and at dinner too the conversation wholly turned upon indifferent matters upon reform at oxford the state of parties and of the peculiar idiosyncrasies of the irish low church clergymen on all of which subjects herbert found that mr prendergast had a tolerably strong opinion of his own the dinner was very good though by no means showyas might have been expected in a house in bloomsbury squareand the wine excellent as might have been expected in any house inhabited by mr prendergast  and then when the dinner was over and the old servant had slowly removed his last tray when they had each got into an armchair and were seated at properly comfortable distances from the fire mr prendergast began to talk freely not that he at once plunged into the middle of the old history or began with lugubrious force to recapitulate the horrors that were now partly over but gradually he veered round to those points as to which he thought it good that he should speak before setting herbert at work on his new london life  you drink claret i suppose said mr prendergast as he adjusted a portion of the table for their evening symposium  oh yes said herbert not caring very much at that moment what the wine was  youll find that pretty good a good deal better than what youll get in most houses in london nowadays but you know a man always likes his own wine and especially an old man  herbert said something about it being very good but did not give that attention to the matter which mr prendergast thought that it deserved indeed he was thinking more about mr die and stone buildings than about the wine  and how do you find my old friend mrs whereas asked the lawyer  she seems to be a very attentive sort of woman  yes rather too much so sometimes people do say that she never knows how to hold her tongue but she wont rob you nor yet poison you and in these days that is saying a very great deal for a woman in london and then there was a pause as mr prendergast sipped his wine with slow complacency and we are to go to mr die tomorrow i suppose he said beginning again to which herbert replied that he would be ready at any time in the morning that might be suitable  the sooner you get into harness the better it is not only that you have much to learn but you have much to forget also  yes said herbert i have much to forget indeed more than i can forget im afraid mr prendergast  there is i fancy no sorrow which a man cannot forget that is as far as the memory of it is likely to be painful to him you will not absolutely cease to remember castle richmond and all its circumstances you will still think of the place and all the people whom you knew there but you will learn to do so without the pain which of course you now suffer that is what i mean by forgetting  oh i dont complain sir  no i know you dont and that is the reason why i am so anxious to see you happy you have borne the whole matter so well that i am quite sure that you will be able to live happily in this new life that is what i mean when i say that you will forget castle richmond  herbert bethought himself of clara desmond and of the woman whom he had seen in the cabin and reflected that even at present he had no right to be unhappy  i suppose you have no thought of going back to ireland said mr prendergast  oh none in the least  on the whole i think you are right no doubt a family connection is a great assistance to a barrister and there would be reasons which would make attorneys in ireland throw business into your hands at an early period of your life your history would give you an √©clat there if you know what i mean  oh yes perfectly but i dont want that  no it is a kind of assistance which in my opinion a man should not desire in the first place it does not last a man so bouyed up is apt to trust to such support instead of his own steady exertions and the firmest of friends wont stick to a lawyer long if he can get better law for his money elsewhere  there should be no friendship in such matters i think  well i wont say that but the friendship should come of the service not the service of the friendship good hard steady and enduring workwork that does not demand immediate acknowledgment and reward but that can afford to look forward for its resultsit is that and that only which in my opinion will insure to a man permanent success  it is hard though for a poor man to work so many years without an income said herbert thinking of lady clara desmond  not hard if you get the price of your work at last but you can have your choice a moderate fixed income can now be had by any barrister early in lifeby any barrister of fair parts and sound acquirements there are more barristers now filling salaried places than practising in the courts  but those places are given by favour  no not so generallyor if by favour by that sort of favour which is as likely to come to you as to another such places are not given to incompetent young men because their fathers and mothers ask for them but wont you fill your glass  i am doing very well thank you  youll do better if youll fill your glass and let me have the bottle back but you are thinking of the good old historical days when you talk of barristers having to wait for their incomes there has been a great change in that respectfor the better as you of course will think nowadays a man is taken away from his boatracing and his skittleground to be made a judge a little law and a great fund of physical strengththat is the extent of the demand and mr prendergast plainly showed by the tone of his voice that he did not admire the wisdom of this new policy of which he spoke  but i suppose a man must work five years before he can earn anything said herbert still despondingly for five years is a long time to an expectant lover  fifteen years of unpaid labour used not to be thought too great a price to pay for ultimate success said mr prendergast almost sighing at the degeneracy of the age but men in those days were ambitious and patient  and now they are ambitious and impatient suggested herbert  covetous and impatient might perhaps be the truer epithets said mr prendergast with grim sarcasm  it is sad for a man to feel when he knows that he is fast going down the hill of life that the experience of old age is to be no longer valued nor its wisdom appreciated the elderly man of this day thinks that he has been robbed of his chance in life when he was in his full physical vigour he was not old enough for mental success he was still winning his spurs at forty but at fiftyso does the world changehe learns that he is past his work by some unconscious and unlucky leap he has passed from the unripeness of youth to the decay of age without even knowing what it was to be in his prime a man should always seize his opportunity but the changes of the times in which he has lived have never allowed him to have one there has been no period of flood in his tide which might lead him on to fortune while he has been waiting patiently for high water the ebb has come upon him mr prendergast himself had been a successful man and his regrets therefore were philosophical rather than practical as for herbert he did not look upon the question at all in the same light as his elderly friend and on the whole was rather exhilarated by the tone of mr prendergasts sarcasm perhaps mr prendergast had intended that such should be its effect  the long evening passed away cosily enough leaving on herberts mind an impression that in choosing to be a barrister he had certainly chosen the noblest walk of life in which a man could earn his bread mr prendergast did not promise him either fame or fortune nor did he speak by any means in high enthusiastic language he said much of the necessity of long hours of tedious work of amaryllis left by herself in the shade and of ne√¶ras locks unheeded but nevertheless he spoke in a manner to arouse the ambition and satisfy the longings of the young man who listened to him there were much wisdom in what he did and much benevolence also  and then at about eleven oclock herbert having sat out the second bottle of claret betook himself to his bed at the lodgings over the covered way     chapter xxxvi  how the earl was won   it was not quite at first that the countess could explain to her son how she now wished that owen fitzgerald might become her soninlaw she had been so steadfast in her opposition to owen when the earl had last spoken of the matter and had said so much of the wickedly dissipated life which owen was leading that she feared to shock the boy but by degrees she brought the matter round speaking of owens great good fortune pointing out how much better he was suited for riches than for poverty insisting warmly on all his good qualities and high feelings and then saying at last as it were without thought poor clara she has been unfortunate for at one time she loved owen fitzgerald much better than she will ever love his cousin herbert  do you think so mother  i am sure of it the truth is patrick you do not understand your sister and indeed it is hard to do so i have also always had an inward fear that she had now engaged herself to a man whom she did not love of course as things were then it was impossible that she should marry owen and i was glad to break her off from that feeling but she never loved herbert fitzgerald  why she is determined to have him even now  ah yes that is where you do not understand her now at this special moment her heart is touched by his misfortune and she thinks herself bound by her engagement to sacrifice herself with him but that is not love she has never loved any one but owenand who can wonder at it for he is a man made for a woman to love  the earl said nothing for a while but sat balancing himself on the back legs of his chair and then as though a new idea had struck him he exclaimed if i thought that mother i would find out what owen thinks of it himself  poor owen said the countess there is no doubt as to what he thinks and then she left the room not wishing to carry the conversation any further  two days after this and without any further hint from his mother he betook himself along the banks of the river to hap house in his course thither he never let his horse put a foot upon the road but kept low down upon the water meadows leaping over all the fences as he had so often done with the man whom he was now going to see it was here among these banks that he had received his earliest lessons in horsemanship and they had all been given by owen fitzgerald it had been a thousand pities he had thought that owen had been so poor as to make it necessary for them all to discourage that love affair with clara he would have been so delighted to welcome owen as his brotherinlaw and as he strode along over the ground and landed himself knowingly over the crabbed fences he began to think how much pleasanter the country would be for him if he had a downright good fellow and crack sportsman as his fast friend at castle richmond sir owen fitzgerald of castle richmond he would be the man to whom he would be delighted to give his sister clara  and then he hopped in from one of owens fields into a small paddock at the back of owens house and seeing one of the stableboys about the place asked him if his master was at home  shure an hes here thin yer honour and lord desmond could hear the boy whispering its the young lord hisself in a moment owen fitzgerald was standing by his horses side it was the first time that owen had seen one of the family since the news had been spread abroad concerning his right to the inheritance of castle richmond  desmond said he taking the lads hand with one of his and putting the other on the animals neck this is very good of you i am delighted to see you i had heard that you were in the country  yes i have been home for this week past but things are all so at sixes and sevens among us all that a fellow cant go and do just what he would like  owen well understood what he meant indeed they are at sixes and sevens you may well say that but get off your horse old fellow and come into the house why what a lather of heat the mares in  isnt she its quite dreadful that chap of ours has no more idea of condition than i have ofofofof an archbishop ive just trotted along the fields and put her over a ditch or two and you see the state shes in its a beastly shame  i know of old what your trottings are desmond and what a ditch or two means youve been at every bank between this and banteer as though you were going for a steeplechase plate  upon my honour owen  look here patsey walk that mare up and down here between this gate and that post till the big sweat has all dried on her and then stick to her with a whisp of straw till shes as soft as silk do you hear  patsey said that he did hear and then owen throwing his arm over the earls shoulder walked slowly towards the house  i cant tell you how glad i am to see you old boy said owen pressing his young friend with something almost like an embrace you will hardly believe how long it is since i have seen a face that i cared to look at  havent you said the young lord wondering he knew that fitzgerald had now become heir to a very large fortune or rather the possessor of that fortune and he could not understand why a man who had been so popular while he was poor should be deserted now that he was rich  no indeed have i not things are all at sixes and sevens as you say let me see donnellan was here when you last saw me and i was soon tired of him when things became serious  i dont wonder you were tired of him  but desmond hows your mother  oh shes very well these are bad times for poor people like us you know  and your sister  shes pretty well too thank you and then there was a pause youve had a great change in your fortune since i saw you have you not said the earl after a minute or two and there it occurred to him for the first time that having refused his sister to this man when he was poor he had now come to offer her to him when he was rich not that that was the reason he said to himself but it was impossible then and now it would be so pleasant  it is a sad history is it not said owen  very sad said the earl remembering however that he had ridden over there with his heart full of joyof joy occasioned by that very catastrophe which now following his friends words like a parrot he declared to be so very sad  and now they were in the diningroom in which owen usually lived and were both standing on the rug as two men always do stand when they first get into a room together and it was clear to see that neither of them knew how to break at once into the sort of loving genial talk which each was longing to have with the other it is so easy to speak when one has little or nothing to say but often so difficult when there is much that must be said and the same paradox is equally true of writing  then owen walked away to the window looking out among the shrubs into which aby mollett had been precipitated as though he could collect his thoughts there and in a moment or two the earl followed him and looked out also among the shrubs they killed a fox exactly there the other day didnt they asked the earl indicating the spot by a nod of his head  yes they did and then there was another pause ill tell you what it is desmond owen said at last going back to the rug and speaking with an effort as the people say a sight of you is good for sore eyes there is a positive joy to me in seeing you it is like a cup of cold water when a man is thirsty but i cannot put the drink to my lips till i know on what terms we are to meet when last we saw each other we were speaking of your sister and now that we meet again we must again speak of her desmond all my thoughts are of her i dream of her at night and find myself talking to her spirit when i wake in the morning i have much else that i ought to think of but i go about thinking of nothing but of her i am told that she is engaged to my cousin herbert nay she has told me so herself and i know that it is so but if she becomes his wifeany mans wife but minei cannot live in this country  he had not said one word of that state of things in his lifes history of which the country side was so full he had spoken of herbert but he had not alluded to herberts fall he had spoken of such hope as he still might have with reference to clara desmond but he did not make the slightest reference to that change in his fortunesin his fortunes and in those of his rivalwhich might have so strong a bias on those hopes and which ought so to have in the minds of all worldly prudent people it was to speak of this specially that lord desmond had come thither and then if opportunity should offer to lead away the subject to that other one but now owen had begun at the wrong end if called upon to speak about his sister at once what could the brother say except that she was engaged to herbert fitzgerald  tell me this desmond whom does your sister love said owen speaking almost fiercely in his earnestness i know so much of you at any rate that whatever may be your feelings you will not lie to methereby communicating to the young lord an accusation which he very well understood against the truth of the countess his mother  when i have spoken to her about this she declares that she is engaged to herbert fitzgerald  engaged to him yes i know that i do not doubt that it has been dinned into my ears now for the last six months till it is impossible to doubt it and she will marry him too if no one interferes to prevent it i do not doubt that either but desmond that is not the question that i have asked she did love me and then she was ordered by her mother to abandon that love and to give her heart to another that in words she has been obedient i know well but what i doubt is thisthat she has in truth been able so to chuck her heart about like a shuttlecock i can only say that i am not able to do it  how was the earl to answer him the very line of argument which owens mind was taking was exactly that which the young lord himself desired to promote he too was desirous that clara should go back to her first love he himself thought strongly that owen was a man more fitted than herbert for the worshipful adoration of such a girl as his sister clara but then he desmond had opposed the match while owen was poor and how was he to frame words by which he might encourage it now that owen was rich  i have been so little with her that i hardly know he said but owen  well  it is so difficult for me to talk to you about all this  is it  why yes you know that i have always liked youalways no chap was ever such a friend to me as you have been and he squeezed owens arm with strong boyish love  i know all about it said owen  well then all that happened about clara i was young then you knowhe was now sixteenand had not thought anything about it the idea of you and clara falling in love had never occurred to me boys are so blind you know but when it did happenyou remember that day old fellow when you and i met down at the gate  remember it said owen he would remember it as he thought when half an eternity should have passed over his head  and i told you then what i thought i dont think i am a particular fellow myself about money and rank and that sort of thing i am as poor as a church mouse and so i shall always remain and for myself i dont care about it but for ones sister owenyou never had a sister had you  never said owen hardly thinking of the question  one is obliged to think of such things for her we should all go to rack and ruin the whole family of us box and diceas indeed we have pretty well alreadyif some of us did not begin to look about us i dont suppose i shall ever marry and have a family i couldnt afford it you know and in that case claras son would be earl of desmond or if i died she would be countess of desmond in her own right and the young lord looked the personification of family prudence  i know all that said owen but you do not suppose that i was thinking of it  what as regards yourself no i am sure you never did but looking to all that it would never have done for her to marry a man as poor as you were it is not a comfortable thing to be a very poor nobleman i can tell you  owen again remained silent he wanted to talk the earl over into favouring his views but he wanted to do so as owen of hap house not as owen of castle richmond he perceived at once from the tone of the boys voice and even from his words that there was no longer anything to be feared from the brothers opposition and perceiving this he thought that the mothers opposition might now perhaps also be removed but it was quite manifest that this had come from what was supposed to be his altered position a man as poor as you were lord desmond had said urging that though now the marriage might be well enough in those former days it would have been madness the line of argument was very clear but as owen was as poor as ever and intended to remain so there was nothing in it to comfort him  i cannot say that i myself have so much worldly wisdom as you have said he at last with something like a sneer  ah that is just what i knew you would say you think that i am coming to you now and offering to make up matters between you and clara because you are rich  but can you make up matters between me and clara said owen eagerly  well i do not know the countess seems to think it might be so  and then again owen was silent walking about the room with his hands behind his back then after all the one thing of this world which his eye regarded as desirable was within his reach he had then been right in supposing that that face which had once looked up to his so full of love had been a true reflex of the girls heartthat it had indicated to him love which was not changeable it was true that clara having accepted a suitor at her mothers order might now be allowed to come back to him as he thought of this he wondered at the endurance and obedience of a womans heart which could thus give up all that it held as sacred at the instance of another but even this though it was but little flattering to clara by no means lessened the transport which he felt he had had that pride in himself that he had never ceased to believe that she loved him full of that thought of which he had not dared to speak he had gone about gloomily miserable since the news of her engagement with herbert had reached him and now he learned as he thought with certainty that his belief had been well grounded through all that had passed clara desmond did love him still  but as to this overture of reconciliation that was now made to him how was he to accept it or reject it it was made to him because he was believed to be sir owen fitzgerald of castle richmond a baronet of twelve thousand a year instead of a poor squire whose wife would have to look narrowly to the kitchen in order that food in sufficiency might be forthcoming for the parlour that he would become sir owen he thought probable but that he would be sir owen of hap house and not of castle richmond he had firmly resolved he had thought of this for long hours and hours together and felt that he could never again be happy were he to put his foot into that house as its owner every tenant would scorn him every servant would hate him every neighbour would condemn him but this would be as nothing to his hatred of himself to his own scorn and his own condemnation and yet how great was the temptation to him now if he would consent to call himself master of castle richmond claras hand might still be his  so he thought but those who know clara desmond better than he did will know how false were his hopes she was hardly the girl to have gone back to a lover when he was rich whom she had rejected when he was poor  desmond said he come here and sit down and both sat leaning on the table together with their arms touching i understand it all now i think and remember this my boy that whomever i may blame i do not blame you that you are true and honest i am sure and indeed there is only one person whom i do blame he did not say that this one person was the countess but the earl knew just as well as though he had been told  i understand all this now he repeated and before we go any further i must tell you one thing i shall never be owner of castle richmond  why i thought it was all settled said the earl looking up with surprise  nothing at all is settled to every bargain there must be two parties and i have never yet become a party to the bargain which shall make me owner of castle richmond  but is it not yours of right  i do not know what you call right  right of inheritance said the earl who having succeeded to his own rank by the strength of the same right enduring through many ages looked upon it as the one substantial palladium of the country  look here old fellow and ill tell you my views about this sir thomas fitzgerald when he married that poor lady who is still staying at castle richmond did so in the face of the world with the full assurance that he made her his legal wife whether such a case as this ever occurred before i dont know but i am sure of this that in the eye of god she is his widow herbert fitzgerald was brought up as the heir to all that estate and i cannot see that he can fairly be robbed of that right because another man has been a villain the title he cannot have i suppose because the law wont give it him but the property can be made over to him and as far as i am concerned it shall be made over no earthly consideration shall induce me to put my hand upon it for in doing so i should look upon myself as a thief and a scoundrel  and you mean then that herbert will have it all just the same as it was before  just the same as regards the estate  then why has he gone away  i cannot answer for him i can only tell you what i shall do i dare say it may take months before it is all settled but now desmond you know how i stand i am owen fitzgerald of hap house now as i have ever been that and nothing morefor as to the handle to my name it is not worth talking about  they were still sitting at the table and now they both sat silent not looking at each other but with their eyes fixed on the wood owen had in his hand a pen which he had taken from the mantelpiece and unconsciously began to trace signs on the polished surface before him the earl sat with his forehead leaning on his two hands thinking what he was to say next he felt that he himself loved the man better than ever but when his mother should come to hear all this what would she say  you know it all now my boy said owen looking up at last and as he did so there was an expression about his face to which the young earl thought that he had never seen the like there was a gleam in his eye which though not of joy was so bright and a smile round his mouth which was so sweet though full of sadness how can she not love him said he to himself thinking of his sister and now desmond go back to your mother and tell her all she has sent you here  no she did not send me said the boy stoutlyalmost angrily she does not even know that i have come  go back then to your sister  nor does she know it  nevertheless go back to them and tell them both what i have told you and tell them this also that i owen fitzgerald of hap house still love her better than all that the world else can give me indeed there is nothing else that i do loveexcept you desmond but tell them also that i am owen of hap house stillthat and nothing more  owen said the lad looking up at him and fitzgerald as he glanced into the boys face could see that there was that arising within his breast which almost prevented him from speaking  and look desmond continued fitzgerald do not think that i shall blame you because you turn from me or call you mercenary do you do what you think right what you said just now of your sisters well of the possibility of our marriage you said under the idea that i was a rich man you now find that i am a poor man and you may consider that the words were never spoken  owen said the boy again and now that which was before rising in his breast had risen to his brow and cheeks and was telling its tale plainly in his eyes and then he rose from his chair turning away his face and walking towards the window but before he had gone two steps he turned again and throwing himself on fitzgeralds breast he burst out into a passion of tears  come old fellow what is this this will never do said owen but his own eyes were full of tears also and he too was nearly past speaking  i know you will thinki am a boy and afool said the earl through his sobs as soon as he could speak but i canthelp it  i think you are the dearest finest best fellow that ever lived said fitzgerald pressing him with his arm  and ill tell you what owen you should have her tomorrow if it were in my power for by heaven there is not another man so worthy of a girl in all the world and ill tell her so and i dont care what the countess says and owen come what come may you shall always have my word and then he stood apart and rubbing his eyes with his arm tried to look like a man who was giving this pledge from his judgment not from his impulse  it all depends on this desmond whom does she love see her alone desmond and talk softly to her and find out that this he said thoughtfully for in his mind love should still be lord of all  by heavens if i were her i know whom i should love said the brother  i would not have her as a gift if she did not love me said owen proudly but if she do i have a right to claim her as my own  and then they parted and the earl rode back home with a quieter pace than that which had brought him there and in a different mood he had pledged himself now to owennot to owen of castle richmond but to owen of hap houseand he intended to redeem his pledge if it were possible he had been so conquered by the nobleness of his friend that he had forgotten his solicitude for his family and his sister     chapter xxxvii  a tale of a turbot   it would have been owen fitzgeralds desire to disclaim the inheritance which chance had put in his way in absolute silence had such a course been possible to him and indeed not being very well conversant with matters of business he had thought for a while that this might be doneor at any rate something not far different from this to those who had hitherto spoken to him upon the subject to mr prendergast mr somers and his cousin he had disclaimed the inheritance and that he had thought would have sufficed that sir thomas should die so quickly after the discovery had not of course been expected by anybody and much therefore had not been thought at the moment of these disclaimersneither at the moment nor indeed afterwards when sir thomas did die  even mr somers was prepared to admit that as the game had been given upas his branch of the fitzgeralds acting under the advice of their friend and lawyer admitted that the property must go from themeven he much as he contested within his own breast the propriety of mr prendergasts decisions was fain to admit now that it was owens business to walk in upon the property any words which he may have spoken on the impulse of the moment were empty words when a man becomes heir to twelve thousand a year he does not give it up in a freak of benevolence and therefore when sir thomas had been dead some four or five weeks and when herbert had gone away from the scene which was no longer one of interest to him it was necessary that something should be done  during the last two or three days of his life sir thomas had executed a new will in which he admitted that his son was not the heir to his estates and so disposed of such moneys as it was in his power to leave as he would have done had herbert been a younger son early in his life he himself had added something to the property some two or three hundred a year and this also he left of course to his own family such having been done there would have been no opposition made to owen had he immediately claimed the inheritance but as he made no claim and took no step whateveras he appeared neither by himself nor by letter nor by lawyer nor by agentas no rumour ever got about as to what he intended to do mr somers found it necessary to write to him this he did on the day of herberts departure merely asking him perhaps with scant courtesy who was his man of business in order that he mr somers as agent to the late proprietor might confer with him with but scant courtesyfor mr somers had made one visit to hap house since the news had been known with some intention of ingratiating himself with the future heir but his tenders had not been graciously received mr somers was a proud man and though his position in life depended on the income he received from the castle richmond estate he would not make any further overture so his letter was somewhat of the shortest and merely contained the request above named  owens reply was sharp immediate and equally short and was carried back by the messenger from castle richmond who had brought the letter to which it was an answer it was as follows      hap house thursday morning two oclock  there was no other date and owen probably was unaware that his letter being written at two pm was not written on thursday morning     dear sir     i have got no lawyer and no man of business nor do i    mean to employ any if i can help it i intend to make no    claim to mr herbert fitzgeralds property of castle    richmond and if it be necessary that i should sign any    legal document making over to him any claim that i may    have i am prepared to do so at any moment as he has got    a lawyer he can get this arranged and i suppose mr    prendergast had better do it     i am dear sir    your faithful servant     owen fitzgerald of hap house   and with those four or five lines he thought it would be practicable for him to close the whole affair  this happened on the day of herberts departure and on the day preceding lord desmonds visit to hap house so that on the occasion of that visit owen looked upon the deed as fully done he had put it quite beyond his own power to recede now even had he so wished and then came the tidings to himtrue tidings as he thoughtthat clara was still within his reach if only he were master of castle richmond that this view of his position did for a moment shake him i will not deny but it was only for a moment and then it was that he had looked up at claras brother and bade him go back to his mother and sister and tell them that owen of hap house was owen of hap house stillthat and nothing more clara desmond might be bought at a price which would be too costly even for such a prize as her it was well for him that he so resolved for at no price could she have been bought  mr somers when he received that letter was much inclined to doubt whether or no it might not be well to take owen at his word after all what just right had he to the estate according to the eternal and unalterable laws of right and wrong ought it not to belong to herbert fitzgerald mr somers allowed his wish on this occasion to be father to many thoughts much at variance from that line of thinking which was customary to him as a man of business in his ordinary moods law with him was law and a legal claim a legal claim had he been all his life agent to the hap house property instead of to that of castle richmond a thought so romantic would never have entered his head he would have scouted a man as nearly a maniac who should suggest to him that his client ought to surrender an undoubted inheritance of twelve thousand a year on a point of feeling he would have rejected it as a proposed crime and talked much of the indefeasible rights of the coming heirs of the new heir he would have been as firm as a rock and as trenchant as a sword in defence of his patrons claims but now having in his hands that short pithy letter from owen fitzgerald he could not but look at the matter in a more christian light after all was not justice immutable justice better than law and would not the property be enough for both of them might not law and justice make a compromise let owen be the baronet and take a slice of four or five thousand and add that to hap house and then if these things were well arranged might not mr somers still be agent to them both  meditating all this in his newly tuned romantic frame of mind mr somers sat down and wrote a long letter to mr prendergast enclosing the short letter from owen and saying all that he as a man of business with a new dash of romance could say on such a subject this letter not having slept on the road as herbert did in dublin and having been conveyed with that lightning rapidity for which the british postoffice has ever been remarkableand especially that portion of it which has reference to the sister islandwas in mr prendergasts pocket when herbert dined with him that letter and another to which we shall have to refer more specially but so much at variance were mr prendergasts ideas from those entertained by mr somers that he would not even speak to herbert on the subject perhaps also that other more important letter which if we live we shall read at length might also have had some effect in keeping him silent  but in truth mr somers mind and that of mr prendergast did not work in harmony on this subject judging of the two men together by their usual deeds and ascertained character we may say that there was much more romance about mr prendergast than there was about mr somers but then it was a general romance and not one with an individual object or perhaps we may say without injury to mr somers that it was a true feeling and not a false one mr prendergast also was much more anxious for the welfare of herbert fitzgerald than that of his cousin but then he could feel on behalf of the man for whom he was interested that it did not behove him to take a present of an estate from the hands of the true owner  for more than a week mr somers waited but got no reply to his letter and heard nothing from mr prendergast and during this time he was really puzzled as to what he should do as regarded himself he did not know at what moment his income might end or how long he and his family might be allowed to inhabit the house which he now held and then he could take no steps as to the tenants could neither receive money nor pay it away and was altogether at his wits ends lady fitzgerald looked to him for counsel in everything and he did not know how to counsel her arrangements were to be made for an auction in the house as soon as she should be able to move but would it not be a thousand pities to sell all the furniture if there was a prospect of the family returning and so he waited for mr prendergasts letter with an uneasy heart and vexation of spirit  but still he attended the relief committees and worked at the soupkitchens attached to the estate as though he were still the agent to castle richmond and still debated warmly with father barney on one side and mr townsend on the other on that vexatious question of outdoor relief and now the famine was in full swing and strange to say men had ceased to be uncomfortable about itsuch men that is as mr somers and mr townsend the cutting off of maimed limbs and wrenching out from their sockets of smashed bones is by no means shocking to the skilled practitioner and dying paupers with the drag in their facethat certain sign of coming death of which i have spokenno longer struck men to the heart like the skilled surgeon they worked hard enough at what good they could do and worked the better in that they could treat the cases without express compassion for the individuals that met their eyes in administering relief one may rob five unseen sufferers of what would keep them in life if one is moved to bestow all that is comfortable on one sufferer that is seen was it wise to spend money in alleviating the last hours of those whose doom was already spoken which money if duly used might save the lives of others not yet so far gone in misery and so in one sense those who were the best in the county who worked the hardest for the poor and spent their time most completely among them became the hardest of heart and most obdurate in their denials it was strange to see devoted women neglecting the wants of the dying so that they might husband their strength and time and means for the wants of those who might still be kept among the living  at this time there came over to the parish of drumbarrow a young english clergyman who might be said to be in many respects the very opposite to mr townsend two men could hardly be found in the same profession more opposite in their ideas lives purposes and pursuitswith this similarity however that each was a sincere and on the whole an honest man the rev mr carter was much the junior being at that time under thirty he had now visited ireland with the sole object of working among the poor and distributing according to his own judgment certain funds which had been collected for this purpose in england  and indeed there did often exist in england at this time a misapprehension as to irish wants which led to some misuses of the funds which england so liberally sent it came at that time to be the duty of a certain public officer to inquire into a charge made against a seemingly respectable man in the far west of ireland purporting that he had appropriated to his own use a sum of twelve pounds sent to him for the relief of the poor of his parish it had been sent by three english maiden ladies to the relieving officer of the parish of kilcoutymorrow and had come to his hands he then filling that position he so the charge saidand unfortunately said so with only too much truthhad put the twelve pounds into his own private pocket the officers duty in the matter took him to the chairman of the relief committee a stanch old roman catholic gentleman nearly eighty years of age with a hoary head and white beard and a milesian name that had come down to him through centuries of catholic ancestorsa man urbane in his manner of the old school an irishman such as one does meet still here and there through the country but now not oftenone who above all things was true to the old religion  then the officer of the government told his story to the old irish gentlemanwith many words for there were all manner of small collateral proofs to all of which the old irish gentleman listened with a courtesy and patience which were admirable and when the officer of the government had done the old irish gentleman thus replied  my neighbour hobbssuch was the culprits namehas undoubtedly done this thing he has certainly spent upon his own uses the generous offering made to our poor parish by those nobleminded ladies the three miss walkers but he has acted with perfect honesty in the matter  what said the government officer robbing the poor and at such a time as this  no robbery at all dear sir said the good old irish gentleman with the blandest of all possible smiles the excellent miss walkers sent their money for the protestant poor of the parish of kilcoutymorrow and mr hobbs is the only protestant within it and from the twinkle in the old mans eye it was clear to see that his triumph consisted in thisthat not only he had but one protestant in the parish but that that protestant should have learned so little from his religion  but this is an episode and nowadays no episodes are allowed  and now mr carter had come over to see that if possible certain english funds were distributed according to the wishes of the generous english hearts by whom they had been sent for as some english such as the three miss walkers feared on the one hand that the babylonish woman so rampant in ireland might swallow up their money for babylonish purposes so on the other hand did others dread that the too stanch protestantism of the church militant in that country might expend the funds collected for undoubted bodily wants in administering to the supposed wants of the soul no such faults did in truth at that time prevail the indomitable force of the famine had absolutely knocked down all that but there had been things done in ireland before the famine came upon them which gave reasonable suspicion for such fears  mr townsend among others had been very active in soliciting aid from england and hence had arisen a correspondence between him and mr carter and now mr carter had arrived at drumbarrow with a respectable sum to his credit at the provincial bank and an intense desire to make himself useful in this time of sore need mr carter was a tall thin austerelooking man one seemingly who had macerated himself inwardly and outwardly by hard living he had a high narrow forehead a sparse amount of animal development thin lips and a piercing sharp gray eye he was a man too of few words and would have been altogether harsh in his appearance had there not been that in the twinkle of his eye which seemed to say that in spite of all that his gait said to the contrary the cockles of his heart might yet be reached by some play of witif only the wit were to his taste  mr carter was a man of personal means so that he not only was not dependent on his profession but was ableas he also was willingto aid that profession by his liberality in one thing only was he personally expensive as to his eating and drinking it was or might have been for any solicitude of his own little more than bread and water as for the comforts of home he had none for since his ordination his missions had ever been migrating but he always dressed with care and consequently with expense for careful dressing is ever expensive he always wore new black gloves and a very long black coat which never degenerated to rust black cloth trousers a high black silk waistcoat and a new black hat everything about him was black except his neck and that was always scrupulously white  mr carter was a good manone may say a very good manfor he gave up himself and his money to carry out high views of charity and religion in which he was sincere with the sincerity of his whole heart and from which he looked for no reward save such as the godly ever seek but yet there was about him too much of the pharisee he was greatly inclined to condemn other men and to think none righteous who differed from him and now he had come to ireland with a certain conviction that the clergy of his own church there were men not to be trusted that they were mere irish and little better in their habits and doctrines than underbred dissenters he had been elsewhere in the country before he visited drumbarrow and had shown this too plainly but then mr carter was a very young man and it is not perhaps fair to expect zeal and discretion also from those who are very young  mrs townsend had heard of him and was in dismay when she found that he was to stay with them at drumbarrow parsonage for three days if mr carter did not like clerical characters of her stamp neither did she like them of the stamp of mr carter she had heard of him of his austerity of his look of his habits and in her heart she believed him to be a jesuit had she possessed full sway herself in the parish of drumbarrow no bodies should have been saved at such terrible peril to the souls of the whole parish but this mr carter came with such recommendationwith such assurances of money given and to be given of service done and to be donethat there was no refusing him and so the husband more worldly wise than his wife had invited the jesuit to his parsonage  youll find √Üneas hell have mass in his room in the morning instead of coming to family prayers said the wife  but what on earth shall we give him for dinner said the husband whose soul at the present moment was among the fleshpots and indeed mrs townsend had also turned over that question in her prudent mind  hell not eat meat in lent you may be sure said mrs townsend remembering that that was the present period of the year  and if he would there is none for him to eat said mr townsend calling to mind the way in which the larder had of late been emptied  protestant clergymen in ireland in those days had very frequently other reasons for fasting than those prescribed by ecclesiastical canons a wellnurtured lady the wife of a parish rector in the county cork showed me her larder one day about that time it contained two large loaves of bread and a pan full of stuff which i should have called paste but which she called porridge it was all that she had for herself her husband her children and her charity her servants had left her before she came to that pass and she was a wellnurtured handsome educated woman born to such comforts as you and i enjoy every dayoh my reader perhaps without much giving of thanks for them poor lady the struggle was too much for her and she died under it  mr townsend was as i have said the very opposite to mr carter but he also was a man who could do without the comforts of life if the comforts of life did not come readily in his way he liked his glass of whisky punch dearly and had an idea that it was good for him not caring much about personal debts he would go in debt for whisky but if the whisky and credit were at an end the loss did not make him miserable he was a man with a large appetite and who took great advantage of a good dinner when it was before him nay he would go a long distance to insure a good dinner but nevertheless he would leave himself without the means of getting a mutton chop and then not be unhappy now mr carter would have been very unhappy had he been left without his superfine long black coat  in tendering his invitation to mr carter mr townsend had explained that with him the res angusta domi which was always a prevailing disease had been heightened by the circumstances of the time but that of such crust and cup as he had his brother english clergyman would be made most welcome to partake in answer to this mr carter had explained that in these days good men thought but little of crusts and cups and that as regarded himself nature had so made him that he had but few concupiscences of that sort and then all this having been so far explained and settled mr carter came  the first day the two clergymen spent together at berryhill and found plenty to employ them they were now like enough to be in want of funds at that berryhill soupkitchen seeing that the great fount of supplies the house namely of castle richmond would soon have stopped running altogether and mr carter was ready to provide funds to some moderate extent if all his questions were answered satisfactorily there was to be no making of protestants he said by giving away of soup purchased with his money mr townsend thought that this might have been spared him i regret to say replied he with some touch of sarcasm that we have no time for that now and so better said mr carter with a sarcasm of a blunter sort so better let us not clog our alms with impossible conditions which will only create falsehood any conditions are out of the question when one has to feed a whole parish answered mr townsend  and then mr carter would teach them how to boil their yellow meal on which subject he had a theory totally opposite to the practice of the woman employed at the soupkitchen av we war to hocus it that yer riverence said mrs daly turning to mr townsend the crathurs couldnt ate a bit of it it wouldnt bile at all at all not like that  try it woman said mr carter when he had uttered his receipt oracularly for the third time  deed an i wont said mrs daly whose presence there was pretty nearly a labour of love and who was therefore independent itd be a sin an a shame to spile christian vittels in them times an i wont do it and then there was some hard work that day and though mr townsend kept his temper with his visitor seeing that he had much to get and nothing to give he did not on this occasion learn to alter his general opinion of his brethren of the english high church  and then when they got home very hungry after their toil mr townsend made another apology for the poorness of his table i am almost ashamed said he to ask an english gentleman to sit down to such a dinner as mrs townsend will put before you  and indeed then it isnt much said mrs townsend just a bit of fish i found going the road  my dear madam anything will suffice said mr carter somewhat pretentiously and anything would have sufficed had they put before him a mess of that paste of which i have spoken he would have ate it and said nothingate enough of it at least to sustain him till the morrow  but things had not come to so bad a pass as this at drumbarrow parsonage and indeed that day fortune had been propitiousfortune which ever favours the daring mrs townsend knowing that she had really nothing in the house had sent jerry to waylay the lent fishmonger who twice a week was known to make his way from kanturk to mallow with a donkey and panniers and jerry had returned with a prize  and now they sat down to dinner and lo and behold to the great surprise of mr carter and perhaps also to the surprise of the host a magnificent turbot smoked upon the board the fins no doubt had been cut off to render possible the insertion of the animal into the largest of the drumbarrow parsonage kitchenpotsan injury against which mr townsend immediately exclaimed angrily my goodness they have cut off the fins said he holding up both hands in deep dismay according to his philosophy if he did have a turbot why should he not have it with all its perfections about itfins and all  my dear √Üneas said mrs townsend looking at him with that agony of domestic distress which all wives so well know how to assume  mr carter said nothing he said not a word but he thought much this then was their pretended poorness of living with all their mock humility these false irishmen could not resist the opportunity of showing off before the english stranger and of putting on their table before him a dish which an english dean could afford only on gala days and then this clergyman who was so loudly anxious for the poor could not repress the sorrow of his heart because the rich delicacy was somewhat marred in the cooking it was too bad thought mr carter to himself too bad  none thank you said he drawing himself up with gloomy reprobation of countenance i will not take any fish i am much obliged to you  then the face of mrs townsend was one on which neither christian nor heathen could have looked without horror and grief what the man whom in her heart she believed to be a jesuit and for whom nevertheless jesuit though he was she had condescended to cater with all her womans witthis man i say would not eat fish in lent and it was horrible to her warm irish heart to think that after that fish now upon the table there was nothing to come but two or three square inches of cold bacon not eat turbot in lent had he been one of her own sort she might have given him credit for true antagonism to popery but every inch of his coat gave the lie to such a supposition as that  do take a bit said mr townsend hospitably the fins should not have been cut off otherwise i never saw a finer fish in my life  none i am very much obliged to you said mr carter with sternest reprobation of feature  it was too much for mrs townsend oh √Üneas said she what are we to do mr townsend merely shrugged his shoulders while he helped himself his feelings were less acute perhaps than those of his wife and he no doubt was much more hungry mr carter the while sat by saying nothing but looking daggers he also was hungry but under such circumstances he would rather starve than eat  dont you ever eat fish mr carter said mr townsend proceeding to help himself for a second time and poking about round the edges of the delicate creature before him for some relics of the glutinous morsels which he loved so well he was not however enjoying it as he should have done for seeing that his guest ate none and that his wifes appetite was thoroughly marred he was alone in his occupation no one but a glutton could have feasted well under such circumstances and mr townsend was not a glutton  thank you i will eat none today said mr carter sitting bolt upright and fixing his keen gray eyes on the wall opposite  then you may take away biddy ive done with it but its a thousand pities such a fish should have been so wasted  the female heart of mrs townsend could stand these wrongs no longer and with a tear in one corner of her eye and a gleam of anger in the other she at length thus spoke out i am sure then i dont know what you will eat mr carter and i did think that all you english clergymen always ate fish in lentand indeed nothing else for indeed people do say that you are much the same as the papists in that respect  hush my dear said mr townsend  well but i cant hush when theres nothing for the gentleman to eat  my dear madam such a matter does not signify in the least said mr carter not unbending an inch  but it does signify it signifies a great deal and so youd know if you were a family manas you ought to be mrs townsend would have been delighted to add and im sure i sent jerry five miles and he was gone four hours to get that bit of fish from paddy magrath as he stops always at ballygibblin gate and indeed i thought myself so lucky for i only gave jerry one and sixpence but they had an uncommon take of fish yesterday at skibbereen and  one and sixpence said mr carter now slightly relaxing his brow for the first time  id have got it for one and three said mr townsend upon whose mind an inkling of the truth was beginning to dawn  indeed and you wouldnt √Üneas and jerry was forced to promise the man a glass of whisky the first time he comes this road which he does sometimes that fish weighed over nine pounds every ounce of it  nine fiddlesticks said mr townsend  i weighed it myself √Üneas with my own hands and it was nine pounds four ounces before we were obliged to cut it and as firm as a rock the flesh was  for one and sixpence said mr carter relaxing still a little further and condescending to look his hostess in the face  yes for one and six and now  im sure id have bought it for one and four fins and all said the parson determined to interrupt his wife in her pathos  im sure you would not then said his wife taking his assertion in earnest you could never market against jerry in your life i will say that for him  if youll allow me to change my mind i think i will have a little bit of it said mr carter almost humbly  by all means said mr townsend biddy bring that fish back now i think of it i have not half dined myself yet  and then they all three forgot their ill humours and enjoyed their dinner thoroughlyin spite of the acknowledged fault as touching the lost fins of the animal     chapter xxxviii  condemned   i have said that lord desmond rode home from hap house that day in a quieter mood and at a slower pace than that which had brought him thither and in truth it was so he had things to think of now much more serious than any that had filled his mind as he had cantered along joyously hoping that after all he might have for his brother the man that he loved and the owner of castle richmond also this was now impossible but he felt that he loved owen better than ever he had done and he was pledged to fight owens battle let owen be ever so poor  and what does it signify after all he said to himself as he rode along we shall all be poor together and then we shant mind it so much and if i dont marry hap house itself will be something to add to the property and then he made up his mind that he could be happy enough living at desmond court all his life so long as he could have owen fitzgerald near him to make life palatable  that night he spoke to no one on the subject at least to no one of his own accord when they were alone his mother asked him where he had been and when she learned that he had been at hap house she questioned him much as to what had passed between him and owen but he would tell her nothing merely saying that owen had spoken of clara with his usual ecstasy of love but declining to go into the subject at any length the countess however gathered from him that he and owen were on kindly terms together and so far she felt satisfied  on the following morning he made up his mind to have it out as he called it with clara but when the hour came his courage failed him it was a difficult taskthat which he was now to undertakeof explaining to her his wish that she should go back to her old lover not because he was no longer poor but as it were in spite of his poverty and as a reward to him for consenting to remain poor as he had thought about it while riding home it had seemed feasible enough he would tell her how nobly owen was going to behave to herbert and would put it to her whether as he intended willingly to abandon the estate he ought not to be put into possession of the wife there was a romantic justice about this which he thought would touch claras heart but on the following morning when he came to think what words he would use for making his little proposition the picture did not seem to him to be so beautiful if clara really loved herbertand she had declared that she did twenty times overit would be absurd to expect her to give him up merely because he was not a ruined man but then which did she love his mother declared that she loved owen thats the real question said the earl to himself as on the second morning he made up his mind that he would have it out with clara without any further delay he must be true to owen that was his first great duty at the present moment  clara i want to talk to you he said breaking suddenly into the room where she usually sat alone o mornings i was at hap house the day before yesterday with owen fitzgerald and to tell you the truth at once we were talking about you the whole time we were there and now what i want is that something should be settled so that we may all understand one another  these words he spoke to her quite abruptly when he first said that he wished to speak to her she had got up from her chair to welcome him for she dearly loved to have him there there was nothing she liked better than having him to herself when he was in a soft brotherly humour and then she would interest herself about his horse and his dogs and his gun and predict his life for him sending him up as a peer to parliament and giving him a noble wife and promising him that he should be such a desmond as would redeem all the family from their distresses but now as he rapidly brought out his words she found that on this day her prophecies must regard herself chiefly  surely patrick it is easy enough to understand me she said  well i dont know i dont in the least mean to find fault with you  i am glad of that dearest she said laying her hand upon his arm  but my mother says one thing and you another and owen another and i myself i hardly know what to say  look here patrick it is simply this i became engaged to herbert with my mothers sanction and yours and now  stop a moment said the impetuous boy and do not pledge yourself to anything till you have heard me i know that you are cut to the heart about herbert fitzgerald losing his property  no indeed not at all cut to the heart that is as regards myself  i dont mean as regards yourself i mean as regards him i have heard you say over and over again that it is a piteous thing that he should be so treated have i not  yes i have said that and i think so  and i think that most of your greatgreatgreat love for him if you will comes from that sort of feeling  but patrick it came long before  dear clara do listen to me will you you may at any rate do as much as that for me and then clara stood perfectly mute looking into his handsome face as he continued to rattle out his words at her  now if you please clara you may have the means of giving back to him all his property every shilling that he ever had or expected to have owen fitzgeraldwho certainly is the finest fellow that ever i came across in all my life or ever shall if i live to five hundredsays that he will make over every acre of castle richmond back to his cousin herbert if oh my lord my lord what a scheme is this you are concocting to entrap your sister owen fitzgerald inserted no if as you are well aware if he continued with some little qualm of conscience if you will consent to be his wife  patrick  listen now listen he thinks and clara by the heavens above me i think also that you did love him better than you ever loved herbert fitzgerald clara as she heard these words blushed ruby red up to her very hair but she said never a word and i think and he thinks that you are bound now to herbert by his misfortunesthat you feel that you cannot desert him because he has fallen so low by george clara i am proud of you for sticking to him through thick and thin now that he is down but the matter will be very difficult if you have the means of giving back to him all that he has lost as you have owen will be poor but he is a prince among men by heaven clara if you will only say that he is your choice herbert shall have back all castle richmond and ii shall never marry and you may give to the man that i love as my brother all that there is left to us of desmond  there was something grand about the lads eager tone of voice as he made his wild proposal and something grand also about his heart he meant what he said foolish as he was either to mean or to say it clara burst into tears and threw herself into his arms you dont understand she said through her sobs my own own brother you do not understand  but by jove i think i do understand as sure as you are a living girl he will give back castle richmond to herbert fitzgerald  she recovered herself and leaving her brothers arms walked away to the window and from thence looked down to that path beneath the elms which was the spot in the world which she thought of the oftenest but as she gazed there was no lack of loyalty in her heart to the man to whom she was betrothed it seemed to her as though those childish days had been in another life as though owen had been her lover in another worlda sweet childish innocent happy world which she remembered well but which was now dissevered from her by an impassable gulf she thought of his few words of loveso few that she remembered every word that he had then spoken and thought of them with a singular mixture of pain and pleasure and now she heard of his noble selfdenial with a thrill which was in no degree enhanced by the fact that she or even herbert was to be the gainer by it she rejoiced at his nobility merely because it was a joy to her to know that he was so noble and yet all through this she was true to herbert another workaday world had come upon her in her womanhood and as that came she had learned to love a man of another stamp with a love that was quieter more subdued and perhaps as she thought more enduring whatever might be herberts lot in life that lot she would share her love for owen should never be more to her than a dream  did he send you to me she said at last without turning her face away from the window  yes then he did he did send me to you and he told me to say that as owen of hap house he loved you still and i i promised to do his bidding and i promised moreover that as far as my good word could go with you he should have it and now you know it all if you care for my pleasure in the matter you will take owen and let herbert have his property by jove if he is treated in that way he cannot complain  patrick said she returning to him and again laying her hand on him you must now take my message also you must go to him and bid him come here that i may see him  who owen  yes owen fitzgerald  very well i have no objection in life and the earl thought that the difficulty was really about to be overcome and about my mother  i will tell mamma  and what shall i say to owen  say nothing to him but bid him come here but wait patrick yes he must not misunderstand me i can never never never marry him  clara  never never it is impossible dear patrick i am so sorry to make you unhappy and i love you so very dearlybetter than ever i think for speaking as you do now but that can never be let him come here however and i myself will tell him all at last disgusted and unhappy though he was the earl did accept the commission and again on that afternoon rode across the fields to hap house  i will tell him nothing but that he is to come said the earl to himself as he went thither and he did tell owen nothing else fitzgerald questioned him much but learned but little from him by heavens owen he said you must settle the matter between you for i dont understand it she has bid me ask you to come to her and now you must fight your own battle fitzgerald of course said that he would obey and so lord desmond left him  in the evening clara told her mother owen fitzgerald is to be here tomorrow she said  owen fitzgerald is he said the countess she hardly knew how to bear herself or how to interfere so as to assist her own object or how not to interfere lest she should mar it  yes mamma patrick saw him the other day and i think it is better that i should see him also  very well my dear but you must be aware clara that you have been so veryi dont wish to say headstrong exactlyso very ent√™t√©e about your own affairs that i hardly know how to speak of them if your brother is in your confidence i shall be satisfied  he is in my confidence and so may you be also mamma if you please  but the countess thought it better not to have any conversation forced upon her at that moment and so she asked her daughter for no further show of confidence then it would probably be as well that owen should come and plead his own cause  and owen did come all that night and on the next morning the poor girl remained alone in a state of terrible doubt she had sent for her old lover thinking at the moment that no one could explain to him in language so clear as her own what was her fixed resolve and she had too been so moved by the splendour of his offer that she longed to tell him what she thought of it the grandeur of that offer was enhanced tenfold in her mind by the fact that it had been so framed as to include her in this comparative poverty with which owen himself was prepared to rest contented he had known that she was not to be bought by wealth and had given her credit for a nobility that was akin to his own  but yet now that the moment was coming how was she to talk to him how was she to speak the words which would rob him of his hope and tell him that he did not could not never could possess that one treasure which he desired more than houses and lands or station and rank alas alas if it could have been otherwise if it could have been otherwise she also was in love with povertybut at any rate no one could accuse her now of sacrificing a poor lover for a rich one herbert fitzgerald would be poor enough  and then he came they had hitherto met but once since that afternoon now so long agothat afternoon to which she looked back as to another former worldand that meeting had been in the very room in which she was now prepared to receive him but her feelings towards him had been very different then then he had almost forced himself upon her and for months previously she had heard nothing of him but what was evil he had come complaining loudly and her heart had been somewhat hardened against him now he was there at her bidding and her heart and very soul were full of tenderness she rose rapidly and sat down again and then again rose as she heard his footsteps but when he entered the room she was standing in the middle of it  clara he said taking the hand which she mechanically held out i have come here now at your brothers request  her name sounded so sweet upon his lips no idea occurred to her that she ought to be angry with him for using it angry with him could it be possible that she should ever be angry with himthat she ever had been so  yes she said patrick said something to me which made me think that it would be better that we should meet  well yes it is better if people are honest they had always better say to each others faces that which they have to say  i mean to be honest mr fitzgerald  yes i am sure you do and so do i also and if this is so why cannot we say each to the other that which we have to say my tale will be a very short one but it will be true if it is short  but mr fitzgerald  well clara  will you not sit down and she herself sat upon the sofa and he drew a chair for himself near to her but he was too impetuous to remain seated on it long during the interview between them he was sometimes standing and sometimes walking quickly about the room and then for a moment he would sit down or lean down over her on the sofa arm  but mr fitzgerald it is my tale that i wish you to hear  well i will listen to it but he did not listen for before she had spoken a dozen words he had interrupted her and poured out upon her his own wild plans and generous schemes she poor girl had thought to tell him that she loved herbert and herbert onlyas a lover but that if she could love him him owen as a brother and a friend that love she would so willingly give him and then she would have gone on to say how impossible it would have been for herbert under any circumstances to have availed himself of such generosity as that which had been offered but her eloquence was all cut short in the bud how could she speak with such a storm of impulse raging before her as that which was now strong within owen fitzgeralds bosom  he interrupted her before she had spoken a dozen words in order that he might exhibit before her eyes the project with which his bosom was filled this he did standing for the most part before her looking down upon her as she sat beneath him with her eyes fixed upon the floor while his were riveted on her downturned face she knew it all beforeall this that he had to say to her or she would hardly have understood it from his words they were so rapid and vehement and yet they were tender too spoken in a loving tone and containing ever and anon assurances of respect and a resolve to be guided now and for ever by her wisheseven though those wishes should be utterly subversive of his happiness  and now you know it all he said at last and as for my cousins property that is safe enough no earthly consideration would induce me to put a hand upon that seeing that by all justice it is his but in this she hardly yet quite understood him let him have what luck he may in other respects he shall still be master of castle richmond if it were that that you wantedas i know it is notthat i cannot give you i cannot tell you with what scorn i should regard myself if i were to take advantage of such an accident as this to rob any man of his estate  her brother had been right so clara felt when he declared that owen fitzgerald was the finest fellow that ever he had come across she made another such declaration within her own heart only with words that were more natural to her he was the noblest gentleman of whom she had ever heard or read or thought  but continued owen as i will not interfere with him in that which should be his neither should he interfere with me in that which should be mine clara the only estate that i claim is your heart  and that estate she could not give him on that at any rate she was fixed she could not barter herself about from one to the other either as a makeweight or a counterpoise all his pleading was in vain all his generosity would fail in securing to him this one reward that he desired and now she had to tell him so  your brother seems to think he continued that you still but now it was her turn to interrupt him  patrick is mistaken she said with her eyes still fixed upon the ground  what you will tell me then that i am utterly indifferent to you  no no no i did not say so and now she got up and took hold of his arm and looked into his face imploringly i did not say so but oh mr fitzgerald be kind to me be forbearing with me be good to me and she almost embraced his arm as she appealed to him with her eyes all swimming with tears  good to you he said and a strong passion came upon him urging him to throw his arm round her slender body and press her to his bosom good to her would he not protect her with his lifes blood against all the world if she would only come to him good to you clara can you not trust me that i will be good to you if you will let me  but not so owen it was the first time she had ever called him by his name and she blushed again as she remembered that it was so not good as you mean for now i must trust to another for that goodness herbert must be my husband owen but will not you be our friend  herbert must be your husband  yes yes yes it is so do not look at me in that way pray do not what would you have me do you would not have me false to my troth and false to my own heart because you are generous be generous to meto me also  he turned away from her and walked the whole length of the long room away and back before he answered her and even then when he had returned to her he stood looking at her before he spoke and she now looked full into his face hoping but yet fearing hoping that he might yield to her and fearing his terrible displeasure should he not yield  clara he said and he spoke solemnly slowly and in a mood unlike his owni cannot as yet read your heart clearly nor do i know whether you can quite so read it yourself  i can i can she answered quickly and you shall know it allall if you wish  i want to know but one thing whom is it that you love and clara and this he said interrupting her as she was about to speak i do not ask you to whom you are engaged you have engaged yourself both to him and to me  oh mr fitzgerald  i do not blame you not in the least but is it not so as to that i will ask no question and say nothing only this that so far we are equal but now ask of your own heart and then answer me whom is it then you love  herbert fitzgerald she said the words hardly formed themselves into a whisper but nevertheless they were audible enough to him  then i have no further business here he said and turned about as though to leave the room  but she ran forward and stopped him standing between him and the door oh mr fitzgerald do not leave me like that say one word of kindness to me before you go tell me that you forgive me for the injury i have done you  yes i forgive you  and is that all oh i will love you so if you will let meas your friend as your sister you shall be our dearest best and nearest friend you do not know how good he is owen will you not tell me that you will love me as a brother loves  no and the sternness of his face was such that it was dreadful to look on it i will tell you nothing that is false  and would that be false  yes false as hell what sit by at his hearthstone and see you leaning on his bosom sleep under his roof while you were in his arms no lady clara that would not be possible that virtue if it be virtue i cannot possess  and you must go from me in anger if you knew what i am suffering you would not speak to me so cruelly  cruel i would not wish to be cruel to you certainly not now for we shall not meet again if ever not for many years i do not think that i have been cruel to you  then say one word of kindness before you go  a word of kindness well what shall i say every night as i have lain in my bed i have said words of kindness to you sincesincesince longer than you will remember since i first knew you as a child do you ever think of the day when you walked with me round by the bridge  it is bootless thinking of that now  bootless yes and words of kindness are bootless between you and me such words should be full of love or they would have no meaning what can i say to you that shall be both kind and true  bid god bless me before you leave me  well i will say that may god bless you in this world and in the next and now lady clara desmond goodbye and he tendered to her his hand  she took it and pressed it between both of hers and looked up into his face and stood so while the fast tears ran down her face he must have been more or less than man had he not relented then and owen she said dear owen may god in his mercy bless you also and make you happy and give you some one that you can love andandteach you in your heart to forgive the injury i have done you and then she stooped down her head and pressed her lips upon the hand which she held within her own  forgive you welli do forgive you perhaps it may be right that we should both forgive though i have not wittingly brought unhappiness upon you but what there is to be forgiven on my side i do forgive andand i hope that you may be happy they were the last words that he spoke and then leading her back to her seat he placed her there and without turning to look at her again he left the room  he hurried down into the court and called for his horse as he stood there when his foot was in the stirrup and his hand on the animals neck lord desmond came up to him goodbye desmond he said it is all over god knows when you and i may meet again and without waiting for a word of reply he rode out under the porch and putting spurs to his horse galloped fast across the park the earl when he spoke of it afterwards to his mother said that owens face had been as it were a thundercloud     chapter xxxix  foxhunting in spinny lane   i think it will be acknowledged that mr prendergast had said no word throughout the conversation recorded in a late chapter as having taken place between him and herbert fitzgerald over their wine which could lead herbert to think it possible that he might yet recover his lost inheritance but nevertheless during the whole of that evening he held in his pocket a letter received by him only that afternoon which did encourage him to think that such an event might at any rate be possible and indeed he held in his pocket two letters having a tendency to the same effect but we shall have nothing now to say as to that letter from mr somers of which we have spoken before  it must be understood that up to this time certain inquiries had been going on with reference to the life of mr matthew mollett and that these inquiries were being made by agents employed by mr prendergast he had found that molletts identity with talbot had been so fully proved as to make it in his opinion absolutely necessary that herbert and his mother should openly give up castle richmond but nevertheless without a hope and in obedience solely to what he felt that prudence demanded in so momentous a matter he did prosecute all manner of inquiriesbut prosecuted them altogether in vain and now o thou most acute of lawyers this new twinkling spark of hope has come to thee from a source whence thou least expectedst it  quod minime reris grai√¢ pandetur ab urbe  and then as soon as herbert was gone from him crossing one leg over the other as he sat in his easy chair he took it from his pocket and read it for the third time the signature at the end of it was very plain and legible being that of a scholar no less accomplished than mr abraham mollett this letter we will have entire though it was not perhaps as short as it might have been it ran as follows

respictit sir    your umbel servant to command     abm mollett   i cannot say that mr prendergast believed much of this terribly long epistle when he first received it or felt himself imbued with any great hope that his old friends wife might be restored to her name and rank and his old friends son to his estate and fortune but nevertheless he knew that it was worth inquiry that aby mollett had been kicked out of hap house in a manner that must have been mortifying to his feelings mr prendergast had himself seen and that he would therefore do anything in his power to injure owen fitzgerald mr prendergast was quite sure that he was a viler wretch even than his father mr prendergast suspectedhaving been led to think so by words which had fallen from sir thomas and being further confirmed in that opinion by the letter now in his hand he was not therefore led into any strong opinion that these new tidings were of value and indeed he was prone to disbelieve them because they ran counter to a conviction which had already been made in his own heart and had been extensively acted on by him nevertheless he resolved that even abys letter deserved attention and that it should receive that attention early on the following morning  and thus he had sat for the three hours after dinner chatting comfortably with his young friend and holding this letter in his pocket had he shown it to herbert or spoken of it he would have utterly disturbed the equilibrium of the embryo law student and rendered his entrance in mr dies chambers absolutely futile ten will not be too early for you he had said mr die is always in his room by that hour herbert had of course declared that ten would not be at all too early for him and mr prendergast had observed that after leaving mr dies chambers he himself would go on to the city he might have said beyond the city for his intended expedition was to spinny lane at st botolphs in the east  when herbert was gone he sat musing over his fire with abys letter still in his hand a lawyer has always a sort of affection for a scoundrelsuch affection as a hunting man has for a fox he loves to watch the skill and dodges of the animal to study the wiles by which he lives and to circumvent them by wiles of his own still more wily it is his glory to run the beast down but then he would not for worlds run him down except in conformity with certain laws fixed by old custom for the guidance of men in such sports and the twolegged vermin is adapted for pursuit as is the fox with four legs he is an unclean animal leaving a scent upon his trail which the nose of your acute law hound can pick up over almost any ground and the more wily the beast is the longer he can run the more trouble he can give in the pursuit the longer he can stand up before a pack of legal hounds the better does the forensic sportsman love and value him there are foxes of so excellent a nature so keen in their dodges so perfect in their cunning so skilful in evasion that a sportsman cannot find it in his heart to push them to their destruction unless the field be very large so that many eyes are looking on and the feeling is i think the same with lawyers  mr prendergast had always felt a tenderness towards the molletts father and sona tenderness which would by no means have prevented him from sending them both to the halter had that been necessary and had they put themselves so far in his power much as the sportsman loves the fox it is a moment to him of keen enjoyment when he puts his heavy boot on the beasts bodythe expectant dogs standing round demanding their preyand there both beheads and betails him a grand old dog he says to those around him i know him well it was he who took us that day from poulnarer through castlecor and right away to drumcollogher and then he throws the heavy carcass to the hungry hounds and so could mr prendergast have delivered up either of the molletts to be devoured by the dogs of the law but he did not the less love them tenderly while they were yet running  and so he sat with the letter in his hand smiling to think that the father and son had come to grief among themselves smiling also at the dodge by which as he thought most probable aby mollett was striving to injure the man who had kicked him and raise a little money for his own private needs there was too much earnestness in that prayer for cash to leave mr prendergast in any doubt as to abys trust that money would be forthcoming there must be something in the dodge or aby would not have had such trust  and the lawyer felt that he might perhaps be inclined to give some little assistance to poor aby in the soreness of his needs foxes will not do well in any country which is not provided with their natural food rats they eat and if rats be plentiful it is so far good but one should not begrudge them occasional geese and turkeys or even break ones heart if they like a lamb in season a fox will always run well when he has come far from home seeking his breakfast  poor aby when he had been so cruelly treated by the gent of appy ouse whose side in the family dispute he had latterly been so anxious to take had remained crouching for some hour or two in owens kitchen absolutely mute the servants there for a while felt sure that he was dying but in their masters present mood they did not dare to go near him with any such tidings and then when the hounds were gone and the place was again quiet aby gradually roused himself allowed them to wash the blood from his hands and face to restore him to life by whisky and scraps of food and gradually got himself into his car and so back to the kanturk hotel in south main street cork  but alas his state there was more wretched by far than it had been in the hap house kitchen that his father had fled was no more than he expected each had known that the other would now play some separate secret game but not the less did he complain loudly when he heard that his guvnor had not paid the bill and had left neither money nor message for him how fanny had scorned and upbraided him and ordered tom to turn him out of the house neck and crop how he had squared at tom and ultimately had been turned out of the house neck and cropwhatever that may meanby fannys father needs not here to be particularly narrated with much suffering and many privationssuch as foxes in their solitary wanderings so often knowhe did find his way to london and did moreover by means of such wiles as foxes have find out something as to his guvnors whereabouts and some secrets also as to his guvnor which his guvnor would fain have kept to himself had it been possible and then also he again found for himself a sort of homeor hole ratherin his old original gorse covert of london somewhere among the jews we may surmise from the name of the row from which he dated and here setting to work once more with his usual cunning industryfor your fox is very industrioushe once more attempted to build up a slender fortune by means of the fitsjerral family the grand days in which he could look for the hand of the fair emmeline were all gone by but still the property had been too good not to leave something for which he might grasp properly worked by himself alone as he said to himself it might still yield him some comfortable returns especially as he should be able to throw over that confouned old guvnor of his  he remained at home the whole of the day after his letter was written indeed for the next three days thinking that mr prendergast would come to him or send for him but mr prendergast did neither the one nor the other mr prendergast took his advice instead and putting himself into a hansom cab had himself driven to centbotollfs intheheast  spinny lane st botolphs in the east when at last it was found was not exactly the sort of place that mr prendergast had expected it must be known that he did not allow the cabman to drive him up to the very door indicated nor even to the lane itself but contented himself with leaving the cab at st botolphs church the huntsman in looking after his game is as wily as the fox himself men do not talk at the covert sideor at any rate they ought not and they should stand together discreetly at the nonrunning side all manner of wiles and silences and discretions are necessary though too often broken through by the uninstructedmuch to their own discomfort and so in hunting his fox mr prendergast did not dash up loudly into the covert but discreetly left his cab at the church of st botolphs  spinny lane when at last found by intelligence given to him at the bakersnever in such unknown regions ask a lad in the street for he invariably will accompany you talking of your whereabouts very loudly so that people stare at you and ask each other what can possibly be your business in those parts spinny lane i say was not the sort of locality that he had expected he knew the look of the halfprotected halfcondemned alsatias of the presentday rascals and spinny lane did not at all bear their character it was a street of small new tenements built as yet only on one side of the way with the pavement only one third finished and the stones in the road as yet unbroken and untrodden of such streets there are thousands now round london they are to be found in every suburb creating wonder in all thoughtful minds as to who can be their tens of thousands of occupants the houses are a little too good for artisans too small and too silent to be the abode of various lodgers and too mean for clerks who live on salaries they are as dulllooking as lethe itself dull and silent dingy and repulsive but they are not discreditable in appearance and never have that mohawk look which by some unknown sympathy in bricks and mortar attaches itself to the residences of professional ruffians  number seven he found to be as quiet and decent a house as any in the row and having inspected it from a little distance he walked up briskly to the door and rang the bell he walked up briskly in order that his advance might not be seen unless indeed as he began to think not impossible abys statement was altogether a hoax  does a woman named mrs mary swan live here he asked of a decentlooking young woman of some seven or eight and twenty who opened the door for him she was decent looking but poverty stricken and wan with work and care and with that heaviness about her which perpetual sorrow always gives otherwise she would not have been ill featured and even as it was she was feminine and soft in her gait and manner does mrs mary swan live here asked mr prendergast in a mild voice  she at once said mrs mary swan did live there but she stood with the door in her hand by no means fully opened as though she did not wish to ask him to enter and yet there was nothing in her tone to repel him mr prendergast at once felt that he was on the right scent and that it behoved him at any rate to make his way into that house for if ever a modestlooking daughter was like an immodestlooking father that young woman was like mr mollett senior  then i will see her if you please said mr prendergast entering the passage without her invitation not that he pushed in with roughness but she receded before the authority of his tone and obeyed the command which she read in his eye the poor young woman hesitated as though it had been her intention to declare that mrs swan was not within but if so she had not strength to carry out her purpose for in the next moment mr prendergast found himself in the presence of the woman he had come to seek  mrs mary swan said mr prendergast asking a question as to her identity  yes sir that is my name said a sicklylooking elderly woman rising from her chair  the room in which the two had been sitting was very poor but nevertheless it was neat and arranged with some attention to appearance it was not carpeted but there was a piece of drugget some three yards long spread before the fireplace the wall had been papered from time to time with scraps of different coloured paper as opportunity offered the table on which the work of the two women was lying was very old and somewhat rickety but it was of mahogany and mrs mary swan herself was accommodated with a highbacked armchair which gave some appearance of comfort to her position it was now spring but they had a small very small fire in the small grate on which a pot had been placed in hopes that it might be induced to boil all these things did the eye of mr prendergast take in but the fact which his eye took in with its keenest glance was thisthat on the other side of the fire to that on which sat mrs mary swan there was a second armchair standing close over the fender an ordinary old mahogany chair in which it was evident that the younger woman had not been sitting her place had been close to the tableside where her needles and thread were still lying but the armchair was placed idly away from any accommodation for work and had as mr prendergast thought been recently filled by some idle person  the woman who rose from her chair as she declared herself to be mary swan was old and sickly looking but nevertheless there was that about her which was prepossessing her face was thin and delicate and pale and not hard and coarse her voice was low as a womans should be and her hands were white and small her clothes though very poor were neat and worn as a poor lady might have worn them though there was in her face an aspect almost of terror as she owned to her name in the strangers presence yet there was also about her a certain amount of female dignity which made mr prendergast feel that it behoved him to treat her not only with gentleness but also with respect  i want to say a few words to you said he in consequence of a letter i have received perhaps you will allow me to sit down for a minute or two  certainly sir certainly this is my daughter mary swan do you wish that she should leave the room sir and mary swan as her mother spoke got up and prepared to depart quietly  by no means by no means said mr prendergast putting his hand out so as to detain her i would much rather that she should remain as it may be very likely that she may assist me in my inquiries you will know who i am no doubt when i mention my name mr mollett will have mentioned me to youi am mr prendergast  no sir he never did said mrs swan  oh said mr prendergast having ascertained that mr mollett was at any rate well known at no 7 spinny lane i thought that he might probably have done so he is at home at present i believe  sir said mary swan senior  your father is at home i believe said mr prendergast turning to the younger woman  sir said mary swan junior it was clear at any rate that the women were not practised liars for they could not bring themselves on the spur of the moment to deny that he was in the house  mr prendergast did not wish to be confronted at present with matthew mollett such a step might or might not be desirable before the termination of the interview but at the present moment he thought that he might probably learn more from the two women as they were than he would do if mollett were with them  it had been acknowledged to him that mollett was living in that house that he was now at home and also that the younger woman present before him was the child of mollett and of mary swan the elder that the young woman was older than herbert fitzgerald and that therefore the connection between mollett and her mother must have been prior to that marriage down in dorsetshire he was sure but then it might still be possible that there had been no marriage between mollett and mary swan if he could show that they had been man and wife when that child was born then would his old friend mr die lose his new pupil  i have a letter in my pocket mrs swan from abraham mollett mr prendergast commenced pulling out the letter in question  he is nothing to me sir said the woman almost in a tone of anger i know nothing whatever about him  so i should have supposed from the respectability of your appearance if i may be allowed to say so  nothing at all sir and as for that we do try to keep ourselves respectable but this is a very hard world for some people to live in it has been very hard to me and this poor girl here  it is a hard world to some people and to some honest people toowhich is harder still  weve always tried to be honest said mary swan the elder  i am sure you have and permit me to say madam that you will find it at the last to be the best policyat the last even as far as this world is concerned but about this letteri can assure you that i have never thought of identifying you with abraham mollett  his mother was dead sir before ever i set eyes on him or his father and though i tried to do my and then she stopped herself suddenly honesty might be the best policy but nevertheless was it necessary that she should tell everything to this stranger  ah yes abrahams mother was dead before you were married said mr prendergast hunting his fox ever so craftilyhis fox whom he knew to be lying in ambush up stairs it was of course possible that old mollett should slip away out of the back door and over a wall if foxes did not do those sort of things they would not be worth half the attention that is paid to them but mr prendergast was well on the scent all that a sportsman wants is good scent he would rather not have a view till the run comes to its close but continued mr prendergast it is necessary that i should say a few words to you about this letter abrahams mother was i suppose not exactly anan educated woman  i never saw her sir  she died when he was very young  four years old sir  and her son hardly seems to have had much education  it was his own fault sir i sent him to school when he came to me though goodness knows sir i was short enough of means of doing so he had better opportunities than my own daughter there and though i say it myself who ought not to say it she is a good scholar  im sure she isand a very good young woman too if i can judge by her appearance but about this letter i am afraid your husband has not been so particular in his way of living as he should have been  what could i do sir a poor weak woman  nothing what you could do im sure you did do  ive always kept a house over my head though its very humble as you see sir and he has had a morsel to eat and a cup to drink of when he has come here it is not often that he has troubled me this many years past  mother said mary swan the younger the gentleman wont care to know about about all that between you and father  ah but it is just what i do care to know  but sir father perhaps mightnt choose it the obedience of women to mento those men to whom they are legally boundis i think the most remarkable trait in human nature nothing equals it but the instinctive loyalty of a dog of course we hear of gray mares and of garments worn by the wrong persons xanthippe doubtless did live and the character from time to time is repeated but the rule i think is as i have said  mrs swan said mr prendergast i should think myself dishonest were i to worm your secrets out of you seeing that you are yourself so truthful and so respectable perhaps it may be thought that mr prendergast was a little late in looking at the matter in this light but it behoves me to learn much of the early history of your husband who is now living with you here and whose name as i take it is not swan but mollett your maiden name probably was swan  but i was honestly married sir in the parish church at putney and that young woman was honestly born  i am quite sure of it i have never doubted it but as i was saying i have come here for information about your husband and i do not like to ask you questions off your guardoh mr prendergastand therefore i think it right to tell you that neither i nor those for whom i am concerned have any wish to bear more heavily than we can help upon your husband if he will only come forward with willingness to do that which we can make him do either willingly or unwillingly  but what was it about abrahams letter sir  well it does not so much signify now  it was he sent you here was it sir how has he learned where we are mary and the poor woman turned to her daughter the truth is sir he has never known anything of us for these twenty years nor we of him i have not set eyes on him for more than twenty yearsnot that i know of and he never knew me by any other name than swan and when he was a child he took me for his aunt  he hasnt known then that you and his father were husband and wife  i have always thought he didnt sir but how  then after all the young fox had not been so full of craft as the elder one thought mr prendergast to himself but nevertheless he still liked the old fox best there are foxes that run so uncommonly short that you can never get a burst after them  i suppose mrs swan continued mr prendergast that you have heard the name of fitzgerald  the poor woman sat silent and amazed but after a moment the daughter answered him my mother sir would rather that you should ask her no questions  but my good girl your mother i suppose would wish to protect your father and she would not wish to answer these questions in a court of law  heaven forbid said the poor woman  your father has behaved very badly to an unfortunate lady whose friend i am and on her behalf i must learn the truth  he has behaved badly sir to a great many ladies said mrs swan or mrs mollett as we may now call her  you are aware are you not that he went through a form of marriage with this lady many years ago said mr prendergast almost severely  let him answer for himself said the true wife mary go up stairs and ask your father to come down     chapter xl  the fox in his earth   mary swan the younger hesitated a moment before she executed her mothers order not saying anything but looking doubtfully up into her mothers face go my dear said the old woman and ask your father to come down it is no use denying him  none in the least said mr prendergast and then the daughter went  for ten minutes the lawyer and the old woman sat alone during which time the ear of the former was keenly alive to any steps that might be heard on the stairs or above head not that he would himself have taken any active measures to prevent mr molletts escape had such an attempt been made the woman could be a better witness for him than the man and there would be no fear of her running nevertheless he was anxious that mollett should of his own accord come into his presence  i am sorry to keep you so long waiting sir said mrs swan  it does not signify i can easily understand that your husband should wish to reflect a little before he speaks to me i can forgive that  and sir  well mrs mollett  are you going to do anything to punish him sir if a poor woman may venture to speak a word i would beg you on my bended knees to be merciful to him if you would forgive him now i think he would live honest and be sorry for what he has done  he has worked terrible evil said mr prendergast solemnly do you know that he has harassed a poor gentleman into his grave  heaven be merciful to him said the poor woman but sir was not that his son was it not abraham mollett who did that oh sir if you will let a poor wife speak it is he that has been worse than his father  before mr prendergast had made up his mind how he would answer her he heard the sound of footsteps slowly descending upon the stairs they were those of a person who stepped heavily and feebly and it was still a minute before the door was opened  sir said the woman sir and as she spoke she looked eagerly into his faceforgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us we should all remember that sir  true mrs mollett quite true and mr prendergast rose from his chair as the door opened  it will be remembered that mr prendergast and matthew mollett had met once before in the room usually occupied by sir thomas fitzgerald on that occasion mr mollett had at any rate entered the chamber with some of the prestige of power about him he had come to castle richmond as the man having the whip hand and though his courage had certainly fallen somewhat before he left it nevertheless he had not been so beaten down but what he was able to say a word or two for himself he had been well in health and decent in appearance and even as he left the room had hardly realized the absolute ruin which had fallen upon him  but now he looked as though he had realized it with sufficient clearness he was lean and sick and pale and seemed to be ten years older than when mr prendergast had last seen him he was wrapped in an old dressinggown and had a nightcap on his head and coughed violently before he got himself into his chair it is hard for any tame domestic animal to know through what fire and water a poor fox is driven as it is hunted from hole to hole and covert to covert it is a wonderful fact but no less a fact that no men work so hard and work for so little pay as scoundrels who strive to live without any work at all and to feed on the sweat of other mens brows poor matthew mollett had suffered dire misfortune had encountered very hard lines betwixt that day on which he stole away from the kanturk hotel in south main street cork and that other day on which he presented himself cold and hungry and almost sick to death at the door of his wifes house in spinny lane st botolphs in the east  he never showed himself there unless when hard pressed indeed and then he would skulk in seeking for shelter and food and pleading with bated voice his husband right to assistance and comfort nor was his plea ever denied him  on this occasion he had arrived in very bad plight indeed he had brought away from cork nothing but what he could carry on his body and had been forced to pawn what he could pawn in order that he might subsist and then he had been taken with ague and with the fit strong on him had crawled away to spinny lane and had there been nursed by the mother and daughter whom he had ill used deserted and betrayed when the devil was sick the devil a monk would be and now his wife credulous as all women are in such matters believed the devils protestations a time may perhaps come when even but stopor i may chance to tread on the corns of orthodoxy what i mean to insinuate is this that it was on the cards that mr mollett would now at last turn over a new leaf  how do you do mr mollett said mr prendergast i am sorry to see you looking so poorly  yes sir i am poorly enough certainly i have been very ill since i last had the pleasure of seeing you sir  ah yes that was at castle richmond was it not well you have done the best thing that a man can do you have come home to your wife and family now that you are ill and require their attendance  mr mollett looked up at him with a countenance full of unutterable woe and weakness what was he to say on such a subject in such a company there sat his wife and daughter his veritable wife and trueborn daughter on whom he was now dependent and in whose hands he lay as a sick man does lie in the hands of women could he deny them and there sat the awful mr prendergast the representative of all that fitzgerald interest which he had so wronged and who up to this morning had at any rate believed the story with which he mollett had pushed his fortunes in county cork could he in his presence acknowledge that lady fitzgerald had never been his wife it must be confessed that he was in a sore plight and then remember his ague  you feel yourself tolerably comfortable i suppose now that you are with your wife and daughter continued mr prendergast most inhumanly  mr mollett continued to look at him so piteously from beneath his nightcap i am better than i was thank you sir said he  there is nothing like the bosom of ones family for restoring one to health is there mrs mollettor for keeping one in health  i wish you gentlemen would think so said she drily  as for me i never was blessed with a wife when i am sick i have to trust to hired attendance in that respect i am not so fortunate as your husband i am only an old bachelor  oh aint you sir said mrs mollett and perhaps its best so it aint all married people that are the happiest  the daughter during this time was sitting intent on her work not lifting her face from the shirt she was sewing but an observer might have seen from her forehead and eye that she was not only listening to what was said but thinking and meditating on the scene before her  well mr mollett said mr prendergast you at any rate are not an old bachelor mr mollett still looked piteously at him but said nothing it may be thought that in all this mr prendergast was more cruel than necessary but it must be remembered that it was incumbent on him to bring the poor wretch before him down absolutely on his marrowbones mollett must be made to confess his sin and own that this woman before him was his real wife and the time for mercy had not commenced till that had been done  and then his daughter spoke seeing how things were going with him father said she this gentleman has called because he has had a letter from abraham mollett and he was speaking about what abraham has been doing in ireland  oh dear oh dear said poor mollett the unfortunate young man that wretched unfortunate young man he will bring me to the grave at lastto the grave at last  come mr mollett said mr prendergast now getting up and standing with his back to the fire i do not know that you and i need beat about the bush much longer i suppose i may speak openly before these ladies as to what has been taking place in county cork  sir said mr mollett with a look of deprecation about his mouth that ought to have moved the lawyers heart  i know nothing about it said mrs mollett very stiffly  yes mother we do know something about it and the gentleman may speak out if it so pleases him it will be better father for you that he should do so  very well my dear said mr mollett in the lowest possible voice whatever the gentleman likesonly i do hope and he uttered a deep sigh and gave no further expression to his hopes or wishes  i presume in the first place began mr prendergast that this lady here is your legal wife and this younger lady your legitimate daughter there is no doubt i take it as to that  notanydoubtin the world sir said the mrs mollett who claimed to be so de jure i have got my marriage lines to show sir abrahams mother was dead just six months before we came together and then we were married just six months after that  well mr mollett i suppose you do not wish to contradict that  he cant sir whether he wish it or not said mrs mollett  could you show me thatthat marriage certificate asked mr prendergast  mrs mollett looked rather doubtful as to this it may be that much as she trusted in her husbands reform she did not wish to let him know where she kept this important palladium of her rights  it can be forthcoming sir whenever it may be wanted said mary mollett the younger and then mr prendergast seeing what was passing through the minds of the two women did not press that matter any further  but i should be glad to hear from your own lips mr mollett that you acknowledge the marriage which took place atat fulham i think you said maam  at putney sir at putney parish church in the year of our lord eighteen hundred and fourteen  ah that was the year before mr mollett went into dorsetshire  yes sir he didnt stay with me long not at that time he went away and left me and then all that happened that you know ofdown in dorsetshire as they told me and afterwards when he went away on his keeping leaving aby behind i took the child and said that i was his aunt there were reasons then and i feared but never mind about that sir for anything that i was wrong enough to say then to the contrary i am his lawful wedded wife and before my face he wont deny it and then when he was sore pressed and in trouble he came back to me and after that mary here was born and one other a boy who god rest him has gone from these troubles and since that it is not often that he has been with me but now now that he is here you should have pity on us and give him another chance  but still mr mollett had said nothing himself he sat during all this time wearily moving his head to and fro as though the conversation were anything but comfortable to him and indeed it cannot be presumed to have been very pleasant he moved his head slowly and wearily to and fro every now and then lifting up one hand weakly as though deprecating any recurrence to circumstances so decidedly unpleasant but mr prendergast was determined that he should speak  mr mollett said he i must beg you to say in so many words whether the statement of this lady is correct or is incorrect do you acknowledge her for your lawful wife  he darent deny me sir said the woman who was perhaps a little too eager in the matter  father why dont you behave like a man and speak said his daughter now turning upon him you have done ill to all of usto so many but now  and are you going to turn against me mary he whined out almost crying  turn against you no i have never done that but look at mother would you let that gentleman think that she iswhat i wont name before him will you say that i am not your honestborn child you have done very wickedly and you must now make what amends is in your power if you do not answer him here he will make you answer in some worse place than this  what is it i am to say sir he whined out again  is this lady here your legal wife  yes sir said the poor man whimpering  and that marriage ceremony which you went through in dorsetshire with miss wainwright was not a legal marriage  i suppose not sir  you were well aware at the time that you were committing bigamy  sir  you knew i say that you were committing bigamy that the child whom you were professing to marry would not become your wife through that ceremony i say that you knew all this at the time come mr mollett answer me if you do not wish me to have you dragged out of this by a policeman and taken at once before a magistrate  oh sir be merciful to us pray be merciful to us said mrs mollett holding up her apron to her eyes  father why dont you speak out plainly to the gentleman he will forgive you if you do that  am i to criminate myself sir said mr mollett still in the humblest voice in the world and hardly above his breath  after all this fox had still some running left in him mr prendergast thought to himself he was not even yet so thoroughly beaten but what he had a dodge or two remaining at his service am i to criminate myself sir he asked as innocently as a child might ask whether or no she were to stand longer in the corner  you may do as you like about that mr mollett said the lawyer i am neither a magistrate nor a policeman and at the present moment i am not acting even as a lawyer i am the friend of a family whom you have misused and defrauded most outrageously you have killed the father of that family  oh gracious said mrs mollett  yes madam he has done so and nearly broken the heart of that poor lady and driven her son from the house which is his own you have done all this in order that you might swindle them out of money for your vile indulgences while you left your own wife and your own child to starve at home in the whole course of my life i never came across so mean a scoundrel and now you chaffer with me as to whether or no you shall criminate yourself scoundrel and villain as you area doubledyed scoundrel still there are reasons why i shall not wish to have you gibbeted as you deserve  oh sir he has done nothing that would come to that said the poor wife  you had better let the gentleman finish said the daughter he doesnt mean that father will be hung  it would be too good for him said mr prendergast who was now absolutely almost out of temper but i do not wish to be his executioner for the peace of that family which you have so brutally plundered and ill used i shall remain quietif i can attain my object without a public prosecution but remember that i guarantee nothing to you for aught i know you may be in gaol before the night is come all i have to tell you is this that if by obtaining a confession from you i am able to restore my friends to their property without a prosecution i shall do so now you may answer me or not as you like  trust him father said the daughter it will be best for you  but i have told him everything said mollett what more does he want of me  i want you to give your written acknowledgment that when you went through that ceremony of marriage with miss wainwright in dorsetshire you committed bigamy and that you knew at that time that you were doing so  mr mollett as a matter of course gave him the written document and then mr prendergast took his leave bowing graciously to the two women and not deigning to cast his eyes again on the abject wretch who crouched by the fire  dont be hard on a poor creature who has fallen so low said mrs mollett as he left the room but mary mollett junior followed him to the door and opened it for him sir she said addressing him with some hesitation as he was preparing to depart  well miss mollett if i could do anything for you it would gratify me for i sincerely feel for youboth for you and for your mother  thank you sir i dont know that there is anything you can do for usexcept to spare him the thief on the cross was forgiven sir  but the thief on the cross repented  and who shall say that he does not repent you cannot tell of his heart by scripture word as you can of that other one but our lord has taught us that it is good to forgive the worst of sinners tell that poor lady to think of this when she remembers him in her prayers  i will miss mollett indeed indeed i will and then as he left her he gave her his hand in token of respect and so he walked away out of spinny lane     chapter xli  the lobby of the house of commons   mr prendergast as he walked out of spinny lane and back to st botolphs church and as he returned thence again to bloomsbury square in his cab had a good deal of which to think in the first place it must be explained that he was not altogether selfsatisfied with the manner in which things had gone that he would have made almost any sacrifice to recover the property for herbert fitzgerald is certainly true and it is as true that he would have omitted no possible effort to discover all that which he had now discovered almost without necessity for any effort but nevertheless he was not altogether pleased he had made up his mind a month or two ago that lady fitzgerald was not the lawful wife of her husband and had come to this conclusion on as he still thought sufficient evidence but now he was proved to have been wrong his character for shrewdness and discernment would be damaged and his great ally and chum mr die the chancery barrister would be down on him with unmitigated sarcasm a man who has been right so frequently as mr prendergast does not like to find that he is ever in the wrong and then had his decision not have been sudden might not the life of that old baronet have been saved  mr prendergast could not help feeling this in some degree as he drove away to bloomsbury square but nevertheless he had also the feeling of having achieved a great triumph it was with him as with a man who has made a fortune when he has declared to his friends that he should infallibly be ruined it piques him to think how wrong he has been in his prophecy but still it is very pleasant to have made ones fortune  when he found himself at the top of chancery lane in holborn he stopped his cab and got out of it he had by that time made up his mind as to what he would do so he walked briskly down to stone buildings and nodding to the old clerk with whom he was very intimate asked if he could see mr die it was his second visit to those chambers that morning seeing that he had been there early in the day introducing herbert to his new gamaliel yes mr die is in said the clerk smiling and so mr prendergast passed on into the wellknown dingy temple of the chancery god himself  there he remained for full an hour a message in the meanwhile having been sent out to herbert fitzgerald begging him not to leave the chambers till he should have seen mr die and your friend mr prendergast is with him said the clerk a very nice gentleman is mr prendergast uncommon clever too but it seems to me that he never can hold his own when he comes across our mr die  at the end of the hour herbert was summoned into the sanctum and there he found mr die sitting in his accustomed chair with his body much bent nursing the calf of his leg which was always enveloped in a black wellfitting close pantaloon and smiling very blandly mr prendergast had in his countenance not quite so sweet an aspect mr die had repeated to him perhaps once too often a very wellknown motto of his one by the aid of which he professed to have steered himself safely through the shoals of lifehimself and perhaps some others it was a motto which he would have loved to see inscribed over the great gates of the noble inn to which he belonged and which indeed a few years since might have been inscribed there with much justice festin√¢ lent√® mr die would say to all those who came to him in any sort of hurry and then when men accused him of being dilatory by premeditation he would say no he had always recommended despatch festin√¢ he would say festin√¢ by all means but festin√¢ lent√® the doctrine had at any rate thriven with the teacher for mr die had amassed a large fortune  herbert at once saw that mr prendergast was a little fluttered judging from what he had seen of the lawyer in ireland he would have said that it was impossible to flutter mr prendergast but in truth greatness is great only till it encounters greater greatness mars and apollo are terrible and magnificent gods till one is enabled to see them seated at the foot of joves great throne that apollo mr prendergast though greatly in favour with the old chancery jupiter had now been reminded that he had also on this occasion driven his team too fast and been nearly as indiscreet in his own rash offering  we are very sorry to keep you waiting here mr fitzgerald said mr die giving his hand to the young man without however rising from his chair especially sorry seeing that it is your first day in harness but your friend mr prendergast thinks it as well that we should talk over together a piece of business which does not seem as yet to be quite settled  herbert of course declared that he had been in no hurry to go away he was he said quite ready to talk over anything but to his mind at that moment nothing occurred more momentous than the nature of the agreement between himself and mr die there was an honorarium which it was presumed mr die would expect and which herbert fitzgerald had ready for the occasion  i hardly know how to describe what has taken place this morning since i saw you said mr prendergast whose features told plainly that something more important than the honorarium was now on the tapis  what has taken place said herbert whose mind now flew off to castle richmond  gently gently said mr die in the whole course of my legal experienceand that now has been a very long experiencei have never come across soso singular a family history as this of yours mr fitzgerald when our friend mr prendergast here on his return from ireland first told me the whole of it i was inclined to think that he had formed a right and just decision  there can be no doubt about that said herbert  stop a moment my dear sir wait half a momenta just decision i sayregarding the evidence of the facts as conclusive but i was not quite so certain that he might not have been a littlepremature perhaps may be too strong a worda little too assured in taking those facts as proved  but they were proved said herbert  i shall always maintain that there was ample ground to induce me to recommend your poor father so to regard them said mr prendergast stoutly you must remember that those men would instantly have been at work on the other side indeed one of them did attempt it  without any signal success i believe said mr die  my father thought you were quite right mr prendergast said herbert with a tear forming in his eye and though it may be possible that the affair hurried him to his death there was no alternative but that he should know the whole at this mr prendergast seemed to wince as he sat in his chair and i am sure of this continued herbert that had he been left to the villanies of those two men his last days would have been much less comfortable than they were my mother feels that quite as strongly as i do and then mr prendergast looked as though he were somewhat reassured  it was a difficult crisis in which to act said mr prendergast and i can only say that i did so to the best of my poor judgment  it was a difficult crisis in which to act said mr die assenting  but why is all this brought up now asked herbert  festin√¢ lent√® said mr die lent√® lent√® lent√® always lent√® the more haste we make in trying to understand each other with the less speed shall we arrive at that object  what is it mr prendergast again demanded herbert who was now too greatly excited to care much for the chancery wisdom of the great barrister has anything new turned up aboutabout those molletts  yes herbert something has turned up  remember prendergast that your evidence is again incomplete  upon my word sir i do not think it is it would be sufficient for any intellectual jury in a common law court said mr prendergast who sometimes behind his back gave to mr die the surname of cunctator  but juries in common law courts are not always intelligent and you may be sure prendergast that any gentleman taking up the case on the other side would have as much to say for his client as your counsel would have for yours remember you have not even been to putney yet  been to putney said herbert who was becoming uneasy  the onus probandi would lie with them said mr prendergast we take possession of that which is our own till it is proved to belong to others  you have already abandoned the possession  no we have done nothing already we have taken no legal step when we believed  having by your own act put yourself in your present position i think you ought to be very careful before you take up another  certainly we ought to be careful but i do maintain that we may be too punctilious as a matter of course i shall go to putney  to putney said herbert fitzgerald  yes herbert and now if mr die will permit i will tell you what has happened on yesterday afternoon before you came to dine with me i received that letter no that is from your cousin owen fitzgerald you must see that also byandby it was this onefrom the younger mollett the man whom you saw that day in your poor fathers room  herbert anxiously put out his hand for the letter but he was again interrupted by mr die i beg your pardon mr fitzgerald for a moment prendergast let me see that letter again will you and taking hold of it he proceeded to read it very carefully still nursing his leg with his left hand while he held the letter with his right  whats it all about said herbert appealing to prendergast almost in a whisper  lent√® lent√® lent√® my dear mr fitzgerald said mr die while his eyes were still intent upon the paper if you will take advantage of the experience of gray hairs and bald headshis own was as bald all round as a big white stoneyou must put up with some of the disadvantages of a momentary delay suppose now prendergast that he is acting in concert with those people inwhat do you call the street  in spinny lane  yes with his father and the two women there  what could they gain by that  share with him whatever he might be able to get out of you  the man would never accuse himself of bigamy for that besides you should have seen the women die  seen the women tshtshtsh i have seen enough of them young and old to know that a clean apron and a humble tone and a downturned eye dont always go with a true tongue and an honest heart women are now the most successful swindlers of the age that profession at any rate is not closed against them  you will not find these women to be swindlers at least i think not  ah but we want to be sure prendergast and then mr die finished the letter very leisurely as herbert thought  when he had finished it he folded it up and gave it back to mr prendergast i dont think but what youve a strong prim√¢ facie case so strong that perhaps you are right to explain the whole matter to our young friend here who is so deeply concerned in it but at the same time i should caution him that the matter is still enveloped in doubt  herbert eagerly put out his hand for the letter you may trust me with it said he i am not of a sanguine temperament nor easily excited and you may be sure that i will not take it for more than it is worth so saying he at last got hold of the letter and managed to read it through much more quickly than mr die had done as he did so he became very red in the face and too plainly showed that he had made a false boast in speaking of the coolness of his temperament indeed the stakes were so high that it was difficult for a young man to be cool while he was playing the game he had made up his mind to lose and to that he had been reconciled but now again every pulse of his heart and every nerve of his body was disturbed was never his wife he said out loud when he got to that part of the letter his real wife living now in spinny lane do you believe that mr prendergast  yes i do said the attorney  lent√® lent√® lent√® said the barrister quite oppressed by his friends unprofessional abruptness  but i do believe it said mr prendergast you must always understand herbert that this new story may possibly not be true  quite possible said mr die with something almost approaching to a slight laugh  but the evidence is so strong continued the other that i do believe it heartily i have been to that house and seen the man old mollett and the woman whom i believe to be his wife and a daughter who lives with them as far as my poor judgment goes and he made a bow of deference towards the barrister whose face however seemed to say that in his opinion the judgment of his friend mr prendergast did not always go very faras far as my poor judgment goes the women are honest and respectable the man is as great a villain as there is unhungunless his son be a greater one but he is now so driven into a corner that the truth may be more serviceable to him than a lie  people of that sort are never driven into a corner said mr die they may sometimes be crushed to death  well i believe the matter is as i tell you there at any rate is molletts assurance that it is so the woman has been residing in the same place for years and will come forward at any time to prove that she was married to this man before he ever sawbefore he went to dorsetshire she has her marriage certificate and as far as i can learn there is no one able or willing to raise the question against you your cousin owen certainly will not do so  it will hardly do to depend upon that said mr die with another sneer twelve thousand a year is a great provocative to litigation  if he does we must fight him thats all of course steps will be taken at once to get together in the proper legal form all evidence of every description which may bear on the subject so that should the question ever be raised again the whole matter may be in a nutshell  youll find it a nutshell very difficult to crack in fiveandtwenty years time said mr die  and what would you advise me to do asked herbert  that after all was now the main question and it was discussed between them for a long time till the shades of evening came upon them and the dull dingy chambers became almost dark as they sat there mr die at first conceived that it would be well that herbert should still stick to the law what indeed could be more conducive to salutary equanimity in the mind of a young man so singularly circumstanced than the study of blackstone of coke and of chitty as long as he remained there at work in those chambers amusing himself occasionally with the eloquence of the neighbouring courts there might be reasonable hope that he would be able to keep his mind equally poised so that neither success nor failure as regarded his irish inheritance should affect him injuriously thus at least argued mr die but at this point herbert seemed to have views of his own he said that in the first place he must be with his mother and then in the next place as it was now clear that he was not to throw up castle richmondas it would not now behove him to allow any one else to call himself master thereit would be his duty to reassume the place of master the onus probandi will now rest with them he said repeating mr prendergasts words and then he was ultimately successful in persuading even mr die to agree that it would be better for him to go to ireland than to remain in london sipping the delicious honey of chancery buttercups  and you will assume the title i suppose said mr die  not at any rate till i get to castle richmond he said blushing he had so completely abandoned all thought of being sir herbert fitzgerald that he had now almost felt ashamed of saying that he should so far presume as to call himself by that name  and then he and mr prendergast went away and dined together leaving mr die to complete his legal work for the day at this he would often sit till nine or ten or even eleven in the evening without any apparent ill results from such effects and then go home to his dinner and port wine he was already nearly seventy and work seemed to have no effect on him in what medeas caldron is it that the great lawyers so cook themselves that they are able to achieve half an immortality even while the body still clings to the soul mr die though he would talk of his bald head had no idea of giving way to time superannuated the men who think of superannuation at sixty are those whose lives have been idle not they who have really buckled themselves to work it is my opinion that nothing seasons the mind for endurance like hard work port wine should perhaps be added  it was not till herbert once more found himself alone that he fully realized this new change in his position he had dined with mr prendergast at that gentlemans club and had been specially called upon to enjoy himself drinking as it were to his own restoration in large glasses of some special claret which mr prendergast assured him was very extraordinary  you may be as satisfied as that you are sitting there that thats 34 said he and i hardly know anywhere else that youll get it  this assertion herbert was not in the least inclined to dispute in the first place he was not quite clear what 34 meant and then any other number 32 or 36 would have suited his palate as well but he drank the 34 and tried to look as though he appreciated it  our wines here are wonderfully cheap said mr prendergast becoming confidential but nevertheless we have raised the price of that to twelve shillings well have another bottle  during all this herbert could hardly think of his own fate and fortune though indeed he could hardly think of anything else he was eager to be alone that he might think and was nearly brokenhearted when the second bottle of 34 made its appearance something however was arranged in those intercalary moments between the raising of the glasses mr prendergast said that he would write both to owen fitzgerald and to mr somers and it was agreed that herbert should immediately return to castle richmond merely giving his mother time to have notice of his coming  and then at last he got away and started by himself for a night walk through the streets of london it seemed to him now to be a month since he had arrived there but in truth it was only on the yesterday that he had got out of the train at the euston station he had come up looking forward to live in london all his life and now his london life was overunless indeed those other hopes should come back to him unless he should appear again not as a student in mr dies chamber but as one of the council of the legislature assembled to make laws for the governance of mr die and of others it was singular how greatly this episode in his life had humbled him in his own esteem six months ago he had thought himself almost too good for castle richmond and had regarded a seat in parliament as the only place which he could fitly fill without violation to his nature but now he felt as though he should hardly dare to show himself within the walls of that assembly he had been so knocked about by circumstances so rudely toppled from his high placehe had found it necessary to put himself so completely into the hands of other people that his selfpride had all left him that it would in fact return might be held as certain but the lesson which he had learned would not altogether be thrown away upon him  at this moment as i was saying he felt himself to be completely humbled a lie spoken by one of the meanest of gods creatures had turned him away from all his pursuits and broken all his hopes and now another word from this man was to restore himif only that other word should not appear to be the greater lie and then that there should be such question as to his mothers name and fameas to the very name by which she should now be called that it should depend on the amount of infamy of which that wretch had been guilty whether or no the woman whom in the world he most honoured was entitled to any share of respect from the world around her that she was entitled to the respect of all good men let the truth in these matters be where it might herbert knew and all who heard the story would acknowledge but respect is of two sorts and the outer respect of the world cannot be parted with conveniently  he did acknowledge himself to be a humbled manmore so than he had ever yet done or had been like to do while conscious of the loss which had fallen on him it was at this moment when he began to perceive that his fortune would return to him when he became aware that he was knocked about like a shuttlecock from a battledore that his pride came by its first fall mollett was in truth the great manthe warwick who was to make and unmake the kings of castle richmond a month ago and it had pleased earl mollett to say that owen fitzgerald should reign but there had been a turn upon the cards and now he king herbert was to be again installed  he walked down all alone through st jamess street and by pall mall and charing cross feeling rather than thinking of all this those doubts of mr die did not trouble him much he fully believed that he should regain his title and property or rather that he should never lose them but he thought that he could never show himself about the country again as he had done before all this was known in spite of his good fortune he was sad at heart little conscious of the good that all this would do him  he went on by the horse guards and treasury chambers into parliament street and so up to the new houses of parliament and sauntered into westminster hall and there at the privileged door between the lamps on his left hand he saw busy men going in and out some slow and dignified others hot hasty and anxious and he felt as though the regions to and from which they passed must be far out of his reach could he aspire to pass those august lampposts he whose very name depended on what in truth might have been the early doings of a low scoundrel who was now skulking from the law  and then he went on and mounting by the public stairs and anterooms found his way to the lobby of the house there he stood with his back to the gingerbeer stall moody and melancholy looking on as men in the crowd pushed forward to speak to members whom they knew or as it sometimes appeared to members whom they did not know there was somewhat of interest going on in the house for the throng was thick and ordinary men sometimes jostled themselves on into the middle of the hallwith impious steps for on those centre stones none but legislators should presume to stand  stand back gentlemen stand back back a little if you please sir said a very courteous but peremptory policeman so moving the throng that herbert who had been behind in no way anxious for a forward place or for distinguishing nods from passing members found himself suddenly in the front rank in the immediate neighbourhood of a cluster of young senators who were cooling themselves in the lobby after the ardour of the debate  it was as pretty a thing as ever i saw in my life said one and beautifully ridden surely it must have been the spring meeting and not the debate that they were discussing  i dont know much about that said another and the voice sounded on herberts ears as it might almost be the voice of a brother i know i lost the odds but ill have a bottle of sodawater hallo fitzgerald why and then the young member stopped himself for herbert fitzgeralds story was rife about london at this time  how do you do moulsey said herbert very glumly for he did not at all like being recognized this was lord moulsey the eldest son of the earl of hampton court who was now member for the river regions and had been one of herberts most intimate friends at oxford  i did not exactly expect to see you here said lord moulsey drawing him apart and upon my soul i was never so cut up in my life as when i heard all that is it true  true why noit was true but i dont think it is that is to sayupon my word i dont know its all unsettledgood evening to you and again nodding his head at his old friend in a very sombre manner he skulked off and made his way out of westminster hall  do you know who that was said lord moulsey going back to his ally that was young fitzgerald the poor fellow who has been done out of his title and all his property you have heard about his mother havent you  was that young fitzgerald said the other senator apparently more interested in this subject than he had even been about the pretty riding i wish id looked at him poor fellow how does he bear it  upon my word then i never saw a fellow so changed in my life he and i were like brothers but he would hardly speak to me perhaps i ought to have written to him but he says its not settled  oh thats all gammon its settled enough why theyve given up the place i heard all about it the other day from sullivan oleary they are not even making any fight sullivan oleary says they are the greatest fools in the world  upon my word i think young fitzgerald was mad just now his manner was so very odd  i shouldnt wonder i know i should go mad if my mother turned out to be somebody elses wife and then they both sauntered away  herbert was doubly angry with himself as he made his way down into the noble old hallangry that he had gone where there was a possibility of his being recognized and angry also that he had behaved himself with so little presence of mind when he was recognized he felt that he had been taken aback that he had been beside himself and unable to maintain his own dignity he had run away from his old intimate friend because he had been unable to bear being looked on as the hero of a family tragedy he would go back to ireland he said to himself and he would never leave it again perhaps he might teach himself there to endure the eyes and voices of men around him nothing at any rate should induce him to come again to london and so he went home to bed in a mood by no means so happy as might have been expected from the result of the days doings and yet he had been cheerful enough when he went to mr dies chambers in the morning     chapter xlii  another journey   on the following day he did go back to ireland stopping a night in dublin on the road so that his mother might receive his letter and that his cousin and somers might receive those written by mr prendergast he spent one night in dublin and then went on so that he might arrive at castle richmond after dark in his present mood he dreaded to be seen returning even by his own people about the place  at buttevant he was met by his own car and by richard as he had desired but he found that he was utterly frustrated as to that method of seating himself in his vehicle which he had promised to himself he was still glum and gloomy enough when the coach stopped for he had been all alone thinking over many thingsthinking of his fathers death and his mothers early lifeof all that he had suffered and might yet have to suffer and above all things dreading the consciousness that men were talking of him and staring at him in this mood he was preparing to leave the coach when he found himself approaching near to that buttevant stage but he had more to go through at present than he expected  theres his honourhurrah god bless his sweet face thats come among us agin this day hurrah for sir herbert boys hurrah the rail ould fitzgerald ll be back agin among us glory be to god and the blessed virgin hurrah for sir herbert and then there was a shout that seemed to be repeated all down the street of buttevant  but that was nothing to what was coming herbert when he first heard this retreated for a moment back into the coach but there was little use in that it was necessary that he should descend and had he not done so he would have been dragged out he put his foot on the steps and then found himself seized in the arms of a man outside and pressed and embraced as though he had been a baby  ugh ugh ugh exclaimed a voice the owner of which intended to send forth notes of joy but so overcome was he by the intensity of his own feelings that he was in nowise able to moderate his voice either for joy or sorrow ugh ugh ugh eh sir herbert but its i that am proud to see yer honour this daywid yer ouwn name wid yer ouwn name glory be to god oh dear oh dear and i knew the lordd niver forgit us that way and let the warld go intirely wrong like that for av you werent the masther sir herbert as you are the lord presarve you to us divil a mastherd iver be able to hould a foot in castle richmond and thats gods ouwn thruth  and thats thrue for you richard said another whom herbert in the confusion could not recognize though his voice was familiar to him deed and the boys had it all made out but what matthers now sir herberts back  and god bless the day and the hour that he came to us and then leaving his masters arm and coat to which he had still stuck he began to busy himself loudly about the travelling gear coachman wheres sir herberts portmantel yes thats sir herberts hatbox deed an i ought to know it well and the black bag yes thatll be sir herberts to be sure and so on  nor was this all the name seemed to run like wildfire through all the buttevantians there assembled and no sound seemed to reach our heros name but that of sir herbert sir herbert everybody took hold of him and kissed his hand and pulled his skirts and stroked his face his hat was knocked off and put on again amid thousands of blessings it was nearly dark and his eyes were dazed by the coach lanterns which were carried about so that he could hardly see his friends but the one sound which was dinned into his ears was that of sir herbert sir herbert  had he thought about it when starting from dublin early that morning he would have said that it would have killed him to have heard himself so greeted in the public street but as it was he found that he got over it very easily before he was well seated on his car it may be questioned whether he was not so used to his name that he would have been startled to hear himself designated as mr fitzgerald for half a minute he had been wretched and had felt a disgust at poor richard which he thought at the moment would be insuperable but when he was on the car and the poor fellow came round to tuck the apron in under his feet he could not help giving him his hand and fraternizing with him  and how is my mother richard  deed then sir herbert me lady is surprisingvery quietlike but her leddyship was always that and as sweet to them as comes nigh her as flowers in may but sure thats nathural to her leddyship  and richard  yes sir herbert  was mr owen over at castle richmond since i left  sorrow a foot sir herbert nor no one aint heard on him nor seen him and i will say this on him  dont say anything against him richard  no surely not seeing he is yer honours faraway cousin sir herbert but what i war going to say warnt agin mr owen at all at all for they do say that cartropes wouldnt have dragged him to castle richmond and that only yer honour has come back to yer ownand why notthere wouldnt have been any masther in castle richmond at all at all thats what they do say  theres no knowing how it will go yet richard  deed an i know how it ll go very well sir herbert and so does mr somers god bless him twas only this morning he tould me an faix its he has the right to be glad  he is a very old friend  so is we all ould frinds an were all gladout of our skins wid gladness sir herbert deed an i thought the eend of the warld had come when i heerd it for my head went round and round and round as i stood in the stable and only for the fork i had a hould of id have been down among the crathurs legs  and then it struck herbert that as they were going on he heard the footsteps of some one running after the car always at an equal distance behind them whos that running richard  sure an thats just larry carson yer honours own boy that minds yer honours own nag sir herbert but faix i suppose yell be having a dozen of em now  stop and take him up youve room there  room enough sir herbert an yer honours so good here larry yer born fool sir herbert says yere to get up he would come over sir herbert just to say hed been the first to see yer honour  godblessyer honoursir herbert exclaimed the poor fellow out of breath as he took his seat it was his voice that sir herbert had recognized among the crowd angry enough at that moment but in future days it was remembered in larry carsons favour that he had come over to castle richmond to see his master contented to run the whole road back to castle richmond behind the car a better fate however was his for he made one in the triumphal entry up the avenue  when they got to the lodge it was quite darkso dark that even richard who was experienced in nightdriving declared that a cat could not see however they turned in at the great gates without any accident the accustomed woman coming out to open them  an is his honour there thin said the woman and may god bless you sir herbert and yere welcome back to yer own so ye are  and then a warm large hand was laid upon his leg and a warm voice sounded greeting in his ear herbert my boy how are you this is well is it not it was mr somers who had been waiting there for him at the lodge gate  upon the whole he could not but acknowledge to himself that it was well mr somers got up beside him on the car so that by this time it was well laden and how does my mother take it herbert asked  very quietly your aunt letty told me that she had spent most of her time in prayer since she heard it but miss letty seems to think that on your account she is very full of joy  and the girls  oh the girlswhat girls well they must answer for themselves i left them about half an hour ago and now you hear their voices in the porch  he did hear the voices in the porch plainly though he could not distinguish them as the horses feet and the car wheels rattled over the gravel but as the car stopped at the door with somewhat of a crash he heard emmeline say theres herbert and then as he got down they all retreated in among the lights in the hall  god bless your honour sir herbert an its you that are welcome back this blessed night to castle richmond such and such like were the greetings which met him from twenty different voices as he essayed to enter the house every servant and groom about the place was there and some few of the nearest tenantsof those who had lived near enough to hear the glad tidings since the morning a dozen at any rate took his hands as he strove to make his way through them and though he was never quite sure about it he believed that one or two had kissed him in the dark at last he found himself in the hall and even then the first person who got hold of him was mrs jones  and so youve come back to us after all mr herbertsir herbert i should say begging your pardon sir and its all right about my lady i never thought to be so happy again nevernevernever and then she retreated with her apron up to her eyes leaving him in the arms of aunt letty  the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord oh herbert my darling boy i hope this may be a lesson and a warning to you so that you may flee from the wrath to come aunt letty had time been allowed to her would certainly have shown that the evil had all come from tampering with papistical abominations and that the returning prosperity of the house of castle richmond was due to protestant energy and truth but much time was not allowed to aunt letty as herbert hurried on after his sisters  as he had advanced they had retreated and now he heard them in the drawingroom he began to be conscious that they were not alonethat they had some visitor with them and began to be conscious also who that visitor was and when he got himself at last into the room sure enough there were three girls there two running forward to meet him from the fireplace to which they had retreated and the other lingering a little in their rear  oh herbert and oh herbert and then their arms were thrown about his neck and their warm kisses were on his cheekskisses not unmixed with tears for of course they began to cry immediately that he was with them though their eyes had been dry enough for the two or three hours before their arms were about his neck and their kisses on his cheeks i have saidmeaning thereby the arms and kisses of his sisters for the third young lady still lingered a little in the rear  was it not lucky clara was here when the news came to us this morning said mary  such difficulty as we have had to get her said emmeline it was to have been her farewell visit to us but we will have no more farewells now will we clara  and now at last he had his arm round her waist or as near to that position as he was destined to get it on the present occasion she gave him her hand and let him hold that fast and smiled on him through her soft tears and was gracious to him with her sweet words and pleasant looks but she would not come forward and kiss him boldly as she had done when last they had met at desmond court he attempted it now but he could get his lips no nearer to hers than her forehead and when he tried to hold her she slipped away from him and he continually found himself in the embraces of his sisterswhich was not the same thing at all never mind he said to himself his day would soon come round  you did not expect to find clara here did you asked emmeline  i hardly know what i have expected or not expected for the last two days no certainly i had no hope of seeing her tonight  i trust i am not in the way said clara  whereupon he made another attempt with his arm but when he thought he had caught his prize emmeline was again within his grasp  and my mother he then said it must be remembered that he had only yet been in the room for three minutes though his little efforts have taken longer than that in the telling  she is up stairs and you are to go to her but i told her that we should keep you for a quarter of an hour and you have not been here half that time yet  and how has she borne all this  why well on the whole when first she heard it this morning which she did before any of us you know  oh yes i wrote to her  but your letter told her nothing mr somers came down almost as soon as your letter was here he had heard alsofrom mr prendergast i think it was and mr prendergast said a great deal more than you did  well  we thought she was going to be ill at first for she became so very paleflushing up sometimes for half a minute or so but after an hour or two she became quite calm she has seen nobody since but us and aunt letty  she saw me said clara  oh yes you you are one of us nowjust the same as ourselves isnt she herbert  not exactly the same herbert thought and then he went up stairs to his mother  this interview i will not attempt to describe lady fitzgerald had become a stricken woman from the first moment that she had heard that that man had returned to life who in her early girlhood had come to her as a suitor nay this had been so from the first moment that she had expected his return and these misfortunes had come upon her so quickly that though they had not shattered her in body and mind as they had shattered her husband nevertheless they had told terribly on her heart the coming of those men the agony of sir thomas the telling of the story as it had been told to her by mr prendergast the resolve to abandon everythingeven a name by which she might be called as far as she herself was concerned the death of her husband and then the departure of her ruined son had one may say been enough to destroy the spirit of any woman her spirit they had not utterly destroyed her powers of endurance were greatand she had endured still hoping but as the uttermost malice of adversity had not been able altogether to depress her so neither did returning prosperity exalt heras far as she herself was concerned she rejoiced for her children greatly thanking god that she had not entailed on them an existence without a name but for herself as she now told herbert outside life was all over her children and the poor she might still have with her but beyond nothing in this worldto them would be confined all her wishes on this side the grave  but nevertheless she could be warm in her greetings to her son she could understand that though she were dead to the world he need not be sonor indeed ought to be so things that were now all ending with her were but beginning with him she had no feeling that taught her to think that it was bad for him to be a man of rank and fortune the head of his family and the privileged one of his race it had been perhaps her greatest misery that she by her doing had placed him in the terrible position which he had lately been called upon to fill  dearest mother it did not make me unhappy he said caressing her  you bore it like a man herbert as i shall ever remember but it did make me unhappymore unhappy than it should have done when we remember how very short is our time here below  he remained with his mother for more than an hour and then returned to the drawingroom where the girls were waiting for him with the teathings arranged before them  i was very nearly coming up to fetch you said mary only that we knew how much mamma must have to say to you  we dined early because we are all so upset said emmeline and clara must be dying for her tea  and why should clara die for tea any more than any one else asked lady clara herself  i will not venture to say what hour it was before they separated for bed they sat there with their feet over the fender talking about things gone and things comingand there were so many of such things for them to discuss even yet as one of the girls remarked lady desmond had not heard of the last change or if she had so heard had had no time to communicate with her daughter upon the subject  and then owen was spoken of with the warmest praise by them all and clara explained openly what had been the full tenor of his intended conduct  that would have been impossible said herbert  but it was not the less noble in him was it said clara eagerly but she did not tell how owen fitzgerald had prayed that her love might be given back to him as his reward for what he wished to do on behalf of his cousin now at least at this moment it was not told yet the day did come when all that was describeda day when owen in his absence was regarded by them both among the dearest of their friends  but even on that night clara resolved that he should have some meed of praise has he not been noble she said appealing to him who was to be her husband has he not been very noble  herbert too happy to be jealous acknowledged that it was so     chapter xliii  playing rounders   my story is nearly at its close and all readers will now know how it is to end those difficulties raised by mr die were all made to vanish and though he implored mr prendergast over and over again to go about this business with a moderated eagerness that gentleman would not consent to let any grass grow under his heels till he had made assurance doubly sure and had seen herbert fitzgerald firmly seated on his throne all that the women in spinny lane had told him was quite true the register was found in the archives of the parish of putney and mr prendergast was able to prove that mr matthew mollett now of spinny lane and the mr matthew mollett then designated as of newmarket in cambridgeshire were one and the same person therefore mr molletts marriage with miss wainwright was no marriage and therefore also the marriage between sir thomas fitzgerald and that lady was a true marriage all which things will now be plain to any novelreading capacity mean as such capacity may be in respect to legal law  and i have only further to tell in respect to this part of my story that the molletts both father and son escaped all punishment for the frauds and villanies related in these pagesexcept such punishment as these frauds and villanies acting by their own innate destructive forces and poisons brought down upon their unfortunate heads for so allowing them to escape i shall be held by many to have been deficient in sound teaching what men will say not punish your evil principle allow the prevailing evil genius of your book to escape scot free without administering any of that condign punishment which it would have been so easy for you to allot to them had you not treadmills to your hand and all manner of new prison disciplines should not matthew have repented in the sackcloth of solitary confinement and aby have munched and crunched between his teeth the bitter ashes of prison bread and water nay for such offences as those did you wot of no penal settlements were not portland and spike islands gaping for them had you no memory of dartmoor and the bermudas  gentle readers no not in this instance shall spike island or the bermudas be asked to give us their assistance there is a sackcloth harsher to the skin than that of the penal settlement and ashes more bitter in the crunching than convict rations it would be sad indeed if we thought that those rascals who escape the law escape also the just reward of their rascality may it not rather be believed that the whole life of the professional rascal is one long wretched punishment to which if he could but know it the rations and comparative innocence of bermuda would be so preferable is he not always rolling the stone of sysiphus gyrating on the wheel of ixion hankering after the waters of tantalus filling the sieves of the daughters of dana√ºs he pours into his sieve stolen corn beyond measure but no grain will stay there he lifts to his lips rich cups but rhadamanthus the policeman allows him no moment for a draught the wheel of justice is ever going while his poor hanging head is in a whirl the stone which he rolls never perches for a moment at the top of the hill for the trade which he follows admits of no rest have i not said truly that he is hunted like a fox driven from covert to covert with his poor empty craving belly prowling about through the wet night he returns with his prey and finds that he is shut out from his lair his bloodshot eye is ever over his shoulder and his advanced foot is ever ready for a start he stinks in the nostrils of the hounds of the law and is held by all men to be vermin  one would say that the rascal if he but knew the truth would look forward to spike island and the bermudas with impatience and raptures the cold hungry friendless solitary doom of unconvicted rascaldom has ever seemed to me to be the most wretched phase of human existencethat phase of living in which the liver can trust no one and be trusted by none in which the heart is ever quailing at the policemans hat and the eye ever shrinking from the policemans gaze the convict does trust his gaoler at any rate his master gaoler and in so doing is not all wretched it is bill sikes before conviction that i have ever pitied any man can endure to be hanged but how can any man have taken that bill sikes walk and have lived through it  to such punishments will we leave the molletts hoping of the elder one that under the care of those ministering angels in spinny lane his heart may yet be softened hoping also for the younger one that some ministering angel may be appointed also for his aid tis a grievous piece of work though that of a ministering angel to such a soul as his and now having seen them so far on their mortal career we will take our leave of both of them  mr prendergasts object in sparing them was of course that of saving lady fitzgerald from the terrible pain of having her name brought forward at any trial she never spoke of this even to herbert allowing those in whom she trusted to manage those things for her without an expression of anxiety on her own part but she was not the less thankful when she found that no public notice was to be taken of the matter  very shortly after herberts return to castle richmond it was notified to him that he need have no fear as to his inheritance and it was so notified with the great additional comfort of an assuring opinion from mr die he then openly called himself sir herbert took upon himself the property which became his by right of the entail and issued orders for the preparation of his marriage settlement during this period he saw owen fitzgerald but he did so in the presence of mr somers and not a word was then said about lady clara desmond both the gentlemen herbert and mr somers cordially thanked the master of hap house for the way in which he had behaved to the castle richmond family and in reference to the castle richmond property during the terrible events of the last two months but owen took their thanks somewhat haughtily he shook hands warmly enough with his cousin wishing him joy on the arrangement of his affairs and was at first less distant than usual with mr somers but when they alluded to his own conduct and expressed their gratitude he declared that he had done nothing for which thanks were due and that he begged it to be understood that he laid claim to no gratitude had he acted otherwise he said he would have deserved to be kicked out of the presence of all honest men and to be thanked for the ordinary conduct of a gentleman was almost an insult this he said looking chiefly at mr somers and then turning to his cousin he asked him if he intended to remain in the country  oh certainly said herbert  i shall not said owen and if you know any one who will take a lease of hap house for ten or twelve years i shall be glad to find a tenant  and you where are you going  to africa in the first instance said he there seems to be some good hunting there and i think that i shall try it  the new tidings were not long in reaching desmond court and the countess was all alone when she first heard them with very great difficulty taking as it were the bit between her teeth clara had managed to get over to castle richmond that she might pay a last visit to the fitzgerald girls at this time lady desmonds mind was in a terribly distracted state the rumour was rife about the country that owen had refused to accept the property and the countess herself had of course been made aware that he had so refused but she was too keenly awake to the affairs of the world to suppose that such a refusal could continue long in force neither as she knew well could herbert accept of that which was offered to him it might be that for some years to come the property might be unenjoyed the rich fruit might fall rotten from the wall but what would that avail to her or to her child herbert would still be a nameless man and could never be master of castle richmond  nevertheless clara carried her point and went over to her friends leaving the countess all alone she had now permitted her son to return to eton finding that he was powerless to aid her the young earl was quite willing that his sister should marry owen fitzgerald but he was not willing to use any power of persuasion that he might have in what his mother considered a useful or legitimate manner he talked of rewarding owen for his generosity but clara would have nothing to do either with the generosity or with the reward and so lady desmond was left alone hearing that even owen owen himself had now given up the quest and feeling that it was useless to have any further hope she will make her own bed the countess said to herself and she must lie on it  and then came this rumour that after all herbert was to be the man it first reached her ears about the same time that herbert arrived at his own house but it did so in such a manner as to make but little impression at the moment lady desmond had but few gossips and in a general way heard but little of what was doing in the country on this occasion the caleb balderston of her house came in making stately bows to his mistress and with low voice and eyes wide open told her what a gossoon running over from castle richmond had reported in the kitchen of desmond court at any rate my lady mr herbert is expected this evening at the house and then caleb balderston bowing stately again left the room this did not make much impression but it made some  and then on the following day clara wrote to her this she did after deep consideration and much consultation with her friends it would be unkind they argued to leave lady desmond in ignorance on such a subject and therefore a note was written very guardedly the joint production of the three in which with the expression of many doubts it was told that perhaps after all herbert might yet be the man but even then the countess did not believe it  but during the next week the rumour became a fact through the country and everybody knew even the countess of desmond that all that family history was again changed lady fitzgerald whom they had all known was lady fitzgerald still and herbert was once more on his throne when rumours thus became a fact there was no longer any doubt about the matter the countryside did not say that perhaps after all so and so would go in such and such a way or that legal doubts having been entertained the gentlemen of the long robe were about to do this and that by the end of the first week the affair was as surely settled in county cork as though the line of the fitzgeralds had never been disturbed and sir herbert was fully seated on his throne  it was well then for poor owen that he had never assumed the regalia of royalty had he done so his fall would have been very dreadful as it was not only were all those pangs spared to him but he achieved at once an immense popularity through the whole country everybody called him poor owen and declared how well he had behaved some expressed almost a regret that his generosity should go unrewarded and others went so far as to give him his reward he was to marry emmeline fitzgerald they said at the clubs in cork and a considerable slice of the property was destined to give additional charms to the young ladys hand and heart for a month or so owen fitzgerald was the most popular man in the south of ireland that is as far as a man can be popular who never shows himself  and the countess had to answer her daughters letter if this be so she said of course i shall be well pleased my anxiety has been only for your welfare to further which i have been willing to make any possible sacrifice clara when she read this did not know what sacrifice had been made nor had the countess thought as she wrote the words what had been the sacrifice to which she had thus alluded though her heart was ever conscious of it unconsciously and the countess sent her love to them all at castle richmond she did not fear she said that they would misinterpret her lady fitzgerald she was sure would perfectly understand that she had endeavoured to do her duty by her child it was by no means a bad letter and which was better was in the main a true letter according to her light she had striven to do her duty and her conduct was not misjudged at any rate at castle richmond  you must not think harshly of mamma said clara to her future motherinlaw  oh no said lady fitzgerald i certainly do not think harshly of her in her position i should probably have acted as she has done the difference however between them was this that it was all but impossible that lady fitzgerald should not sympathize with her children while it was almost impossible that the countess of desmond should do so  and so lady desmond remained all alone at desmond court brooding over the things as they now were for the present it was better that clara should remain at castle richmond and nothing therefore was said of her return on either side she could not add to her mothers comfort at home and why should she not remain happy where she was she was already a fitzgerald in heart rather than a desmond and was it not well that she should be so if she could love herbert fitzgerald that was well also since the day on which he had appeared at desmond court wet and dirty and wretched with a broken spirit and fortunes as draggled as his dress he had lost all claim to be a hero in the estimation of lady desmond to her those only were heroes whose pride and spirit were never draggled and such a hero there still was in her close neighbourhood  lady desmond herself was a woman of a mercenary spirit so at least it will be said and thought of her but she was not altogether so although the two facts were strong against her that she had sold herself for a title and had been willing to sell her daughter for a fortune poverty she herself had endured upon the whole with patience and though she hated and scorned it from her very soul she would now have given herself in marriage to a poor man without rank or stationshe a countess and the mother of an earl and that she would have done with all the romantic love of a girl of sixteen though she was now a woman verging upon forty  men and women only know so much of themselves and others as circumstances and their destiny have allowed to appear had it perchance fallen to thy lot o my forensic friend heavy laden with the wisdom of the law to write tales such as this of mine how charmingly might not thy characters have come forth upon the canvashow much more charmingly than i can limn them while on the other hand ignorant as thou now tellest me that i am of the very alphabet of the courts had thy wig been allotted to me i might have gathered guineas thick as daisies in summer while to thee perhaps they come no faster than snowdrops in the early spring it is all in our destiny chance had thrown that terrible earl in the way of the poor girl in her early youth and she had married him she had married him and all idea of love had flown from her heart all idea of love but not all the capacityas now within this last year or two she had learned so much to her cost  long months had passed since she had first owned this to herself since she had dared to tell herself that it was possible even for her to begin the world again and to play the game which women love to play once at least before they die she could have worshipped this man and sat at his feet and endowed him in her heart with heroism and given him her soft brown hair to play with when it suited her hercules to rest from his labours she could have forgotten her years and have forgotten too the children who had now grown up to seize the world from beneath her feetto seize it before she herself had enjoyed it she could have forgotten all that was past and have been every whit as young as her own daughter if only  it is so i believe with most of us who have begun to turn the hill i myself could go on to that common that is at this moment before me and join that game of rounders with the most intense delight by george you fellow youve no eyes didnt you see that he hadnt put his foot in the hole hell get back now that longbacked hardhitting chap and your side is done for the next halfhour but then they would all be awestruck for a while and after that when they grew to be familiar with me they would laugh at me because i loomed large in my running and returned to my ground scant of breath alas alas i know that it would not do so i pass by imperious in my heavy manhood and one of the lads respectfully abstains from me though the ball is under my very feet  but then i have had my game of rounders no horrible old earl with gloating eyes carried me off in my childhood and robbed me of the pleasure of my youth that part of my cake has been eaten and in spite of some occasional headache has been digested not altogether unsatisfactorily lady desmond had as yet been allowed no slice of her cake she had never yet taken her side in any game of rounders but she too had looked on and seen how jocund was the play she also had acknowledged that that running in the ring that stout hitting of the ball that innocent craft that bringing back by her own skill and with her own hand of some longbacked fellow would be pleasant to her as well as to others if only she now could be chosen in at that game but what if the side that she cared for would not have her  but tempus edax rerum though it had hardly nibbled at her heart or wishes had been feeding on the freshness of her brow and the bloom of her lips the child with whom she would have loved to play kept aloof from her too and would not pick up the ball when it rolled to his feet all this if one thinks of it is hard to bear it is very hard to have had no period for rounders not to be able even to look back to ones games and to talk of them to ones old comrades but why then did she allow herself to be carried off by the wicked wrinkled earl with the gloating eyes asks of me the prettiest girl in the world just turned eighteen oh heavens is it not possible that one should have one more game of rounders quite impossible o my fat friend and therefore i answer the young lady somewhat grimly take care that thou also art not carried off by a wrinkled earl is thy heart free from all vanity of what nature is the heroism that thou worshippest a nice young man she says boldly though in words somewhat different if so it will be well for thee but did i not see thine eyes hankering the other day after the precious stones of ophir and thy mouth watering for the fleshpots of egypt was i not watching thee as thou sattest at that counter so frightfully intent beware the grumpy old fellow with the bald head she said shortly afterwards to her bosom friend not careful that her words should be duly inaudible  some idea that all was not yet over with her had come upon her poor heartupon lady desmonds heart soon after owen fitzgerald had made himself familiar in her old mansion we have read how that idea was banished and how she had ultimately resolved that that man whom she could have loved herself should be given up to her own child when she thought that he was no longer poor and of low rank she could not sympathize with her daughterlove with her love and rejoice with her joy but she could do her duty by her and according to her lights she endeavoured so to do  but now again all was turned and changed and altered owen of hap house was once more owen of hap house only but still in her eyes heroic as it behoved a man to be he would not creep about the country with moaning voice and melancholy eyes with draggled dress and outward signs of wretchedness he might be wretched but he would still be manly could it be possible that to her should yet be given the privilege of soothing that noble unbending wretchedness by no means possible poor heartladen countess thy years are all against thee girls whose mouths will water unduly for the fleshpots of egypt must in after life undergo such penalties as these art thou not a countess  but not so did she answer herself might it not be possible ah might it not be possible and as the question was even then being asked perhaps for the ten thousandth time owen fitzgerald stood before her she had not yet seen him since the new news had gone abroad and had hardly yet conceived how it might be possible that she should do so but now as she thought of him there he was they two were togetheralone together and the door by which he had entered had closed upon him before she was aware of his presence  owen fitzgerald she said starting up and giving him both her hands this she did not of judgment nor yet from passion but of impulse she had been thinking of him with such kindly thoughts and now he was there it became natural that her greeting should be kindly it was more so than it had ever been to any but her son since the wrinkled gloating earl had come and fetched her  yes owen fitzgerald said he taking the two hands that were offered to him and holding them awhile not pressing them as a man who loved her who could have loved her would have done after all that has gone and passed between us lady desmond i cannot leave the country without saying one word of farewell to you  leave the country she exclaimed and where are you going  as she looked into his face with her hands still in hisfor she did not on the moment withdraw them she felt that he had never before looked so noble so handsome so grand leave the country ah yes and why should not she leave it also what was there to bind her to those odious walls in which she had been immolated during the best half of her life  where are you going she asked looking almost wildly up at him  somewhere very far afield lady desmond he said and then the hands dropped from him you will understand at any rate that hap house will not be a fitting residence for me  i hate the whole country said she the whole place hereabouts i have never been happy here happy i have never been other than unhappy i have been wretched what would i not give to leave it also  to you it cannot be intolerable as it will be to me you have known so thoroughly where all my hopes were garnered that i need not tell you why i must go from hap house i think that i have been wronged but i do not desire that others should think so and as for you and me lady desmond though we have been enemies we have been friends also  enemies said she i hope not and she spoke so softly so unlike her usual self in the tones so suited to a loving clinging woman that though he did not understand it he was startled at her tenderness i have never felt that you were my enemy mr fitzgerald and certainly i never was an enemy to you  well we were opposed to each other i thought that you were robbing me of all i valued in life and you you thought  i thought that claras happiness demanded rank and wealth and position there i tell you my sins fairly you may say that i was mercenary if you willmercenary for her i thought that i knew what would be needful for her can you be angry with a mother for that  she had given me a promise but never mind it is all over now i did not come to upbraid you but to tell you that i now know how it must be and that i am going  had you won her owen said the countess looking intently into his face had you won her she would not have made you happy  as to that it was for me to judgefor me and her i thought it would and was willing to peril all in the trial and so was shewilling at one time but never mind it is useless to talk of that  quite useless now  i did thinkwhen it was as they said in my power to give him back his owni did thinkbut no it would have been mean to look for payment it is all over and i will say nothing further not a word i am not a girl to harp on such a thing day after day and to grow sick with love i shall be better away and therefore i am going and i have now come to say goodbye because we were friends in old days lady desmond  friends in old days they were old days to him but they were no more than the other day to her it was as yet hardly more than two years since she had first known him and yet he looked on the acquaintance as one that had run out its time and required to be ended she would so fain have been able to think that the beginning only had as yet come to them but there he was anxious to bid her adieu and what was she to say to him  yes we were friends you have been my only friend here i think you will hardly believe with how much true friendship i have thought of you when the feud between usif it was a feudwas at the strongest owen fitzgerald i have loved you through it all  loved him she was so handsome as she spoke so womanly so graceful there was still about her so much of the charm of beauty that he could hardly take the word when coming from her mouth as applicable to ordinary friendship and yet he did so take it they had all loved each otheras friends should loveand now that he was going she had chosen to say as much he felt the blood tingle his cheek at the sound of her words but he was not vain enough to take it in its usual sense then we will part as friends said hetamely enough  yes we will part she said and as she spoke the blood mantled deep on her neck and cheek and forehead and a spirit came out of her eye such as never had shone there before in his presence yes we will part and she took up his right hand and held it closely pressed between both her own and as we must part i will tell you all owen fitzgerald i have loved you with all my heartwith all the love that a woman has to give i have loved you and have never loved any other stop stop for he was going to interrupt her you shall hear me now to the lastand for the last time i have loved you with such lovesuch love as you perhaps felt for her but as she will never feel but you shall not say nay you shall not think that i have been selfish i would have kept you from her when you were poor as you are nownot because i loved you no you will never think that of me and when i thought that you were rich and the head of your family i did all that i could to bring her back for you did i not owen  yes i think you did he muttered between his teeth hardly knowing how to speak  indeed indeed i did so others may say that i was selfish for my child but you shall not think that i was selfish for myself i sent for patrick and bade him go to you i strove as mothers do strive for their children i taught myselfi strove to teach myself to forget that i had loved you i swore on my knees that i would love you only as my sonas my dear dear son nay owen i did on my knees before my god  he turned away from her to rub the tears from his eyes and in doing so he dragged his hand away from her but she followed him and again took it you will hear me to the end now she said will you not you will not begrudge me that and then came these other tidings and all that scheme was dashed to the ground it was better so owen you would not have been happy with the property  i should never have taken it  and she she would have clung closer to him as a poor man than ever she had done when he was rich she is her mothers daughter there and thenthen but i need not tell you more you will know it all now if you had become rich i would have ceased to love you but i shall never cease now that you are again poornow that you are owen of hap house again as you sent us word yourself that day  and then she ceased and bending down her head bathed his hand with her tears had any one asked him that morning he would have said that it was impossible that the countess of desmond should weep and now the tears were streaming from her eyes as though she were a brokenhearted girl and so she was her girlhood had been postponed and marrednot destroyed and made away with by the wrinkled earl with the gloating eyes  she had said all now and she stood there still holding his hand in hers but with her head turned from him it was his turn to speak now and how was he to answer her i know how most men would have answeredby the pressure of an arm by a warm kiss by a promise of love and by a feeling that such love was possible and then most men would have gone home leaving the woman triumphant and have repented bitterly as they sat moody over their own fires with their winebottles before them but it was not so with owen fitzgerald his heart was to him a reality he had loved with all his power and strength with all the vigour of his soulhaving chosen to love but he would not now be enticed by pity into a bastard feeling which would die away when the tenderness of the moment was no longer present to his eye and touch his love for clara had been such that he could not even say that he loved another  dear lady desmond he began  ah owen we are to part now part for ever she said speak to me once in your life as though we were equal friends cannot you forget for one minute that i am countess of desmond  mary countess of desmond such was her name and title but so little familiar had he been with the name by which he had never heard her called that in his confusion he could not remember it and had he done so he could not have brought himself to use it yes he said we must part it is impossible for me to remain here  doubly impossible now she replied half reproaching him  yes doubly impossible now is it not better that the truth should be spoken  oh yes i have spoken ittoo plainly  and so will i speak it plainly we cannot control our own hearts lady desmond it is as you say doubly impossible now all the love i have had to give she has hadand has such being so why should i stay here or could you wish that i should do so  i do not wish it that was true enough the wish would have been to wander away with him  i must go and shall start at once my very things are packed for my going i will not be here to have the sound of their marriage bells jangling in my ears i will not be pointed at as the man who has been duped on every side  ah me that i was a man toothat i could go away and make for myself a life  you have desmond with you  no no he will go too of course he will go he will go and i shall be utterly alone what a fool i amwhat an ass that by this time i have not learned to bear it  they will always be near you at castle richmond  ah owen how little you understand have we been friends while we lived under the same roof and now that she is there do you think that she will heed me i tell you that you do not know her she is excellent good devoted but cold as ice she will live among the poor and grace his table and he will have all that he wants in twelve months owen she would have turned your heart to a stone  it is that already i think said he at any rate it will be so to all others goodbye lady desmond  goodbye owen and god bless you my secret will be safe with you  safe yes it will be safe and then as she put her cheek up to him he kissed it and left her  he had been very stern she had laid bare to him her whole heart and he had answered her love by never a word he had made no reply in any shapegiven her no thanks for her hearts treasure he had responded to her affection by no tenderness he had not even said that this might have been so had that other not have come to pass by no word had he alluded to her confessionbut had regarded her delusion as monstrous a thing of which no word was to be spoken  so at least said the countess to herself sitting there all alone where he had left her he regards me as old and worn in his eyes i am wrinkled and ugly twas thus that her thoughts expressed themselves and then she walked across the room towards the mirror but when there she could not look in it she turned her back upon it without a glance and returned to her seat by the window what mattered it now it was her doom to live there alone for the term of life with which it might still please god to afflict her  and then looking out from the window her eyes fell upon owen as he rode slowly down across the park his horse was walking very slowly and it seemed as though he himself were unconscious of the pace as long as he remained in sight she did not take her eyes from his figure gazing at him painfully as he grew dimmer and more dim in the distance then at last he turned behind the bushes near the lodge and she felt that she was all alone it was the last that she ever saw of owen fitzgerald  unfortunate girl marred in thy childhood by that wrinkled earl with the gloating eyes or marred rather by thine own vanity those fleshpots of egypt are they not always thus bitter in the eating     chapter xliv  conclusion   and now my story is told and were it not for the fashion of the thing this last short chapter might be spared it shall at any rate be very short  were it not that i eschew the fashion of double names for a book thinking that no amount of ingenuity in this respect will make a bad book pass muster whereas a good book will turn out as such though no such ingenuity be displayed i might have called this a tale of the famine year in ireland at the period of the year to which the story has brought usand at which it will leave usthe famine was at its very worst people were beginning to believe that there would never be a bit more to eat in the land and that the time for hope and energy was gone land was becoming of no value and the only thing regarded was a sufficiency of food to keep body and soul together under such circumstances it was difficult to hope  but energy without hope is impossible and therefore was there such an apathy and deadness through the country it was not that they did not work who were most concerned to work the amount of conscientious work then done was most praiseworthy but it was done almost without hope of success and done chiefly as a matter of conscience there was a feeling which was not often expressed but which seemed to prevail everywhere that ginger would not again be hot in the mouth and that in very truth the time for cakes and ale in this world was all over it was this feeling that made a residence in ireland at that period so very sad  ah me how little do we know what is coming to us irish cakes and ale were done and over for this world we all thought but in truth the irish cakes were only then abaking and the irish ale was being brewed i am not sure that these good things are yet quite fit for the palates of the guestnot as fit as a little more time will make them the cake is still too newcakes often are and the ale is not sufficiently mellowed but of this i am sure that the cakes and ale are thereand the ginger too very hot in the mouth let a committee of irish landlords say how the rents are paid now and what amount of arrears was due through the country when the famine came among them rents paid to the day that is the ginger hot in the mouth which best pleases the palate of a country gentleman  but if one did in truth write a tale of the famine after that it would behove the author to write a tale of the pestilence and then another a tale of the exodus these three wonderful events following each other were the blessings coming from omniscience and omnipotence by which the black clouds were driven from the irish firmament if one through it all could have dared to hope and have had from the first that wisdom which has learned to acknowledge that his mercy endureth for ever and then the same author going on with his series would give in his last setireland in her prosperity  of all those who did true good conscientious work at this time none exceeded in energy our friend herbert fitzgerald after his return to castle richmond it seemed to him as though some thankoffering were due from him for all the good things that providence had showered upon him and the best thankoffering that he could give was a devoted attention to the interest of the poor around him mr somers soon resigned to him the chair at those committee meetings at berryhill and gortnaclough and it was acknowledged that the castle richmond arrangements for soupkitchens outdoor relief and labourgangs might be taken as a model for the south of ireland few other men were able to go to the work with means so ample and with hands so perfectly free mr carter even who by this time had become cemented in a warm trilateral friendship with father barney and the rev √Üneas townsend was obliged to own that many a young english country gentleman might take a lesson from sir herbert fitzgerald in the duties peculiar to his position  his marriage did not take place till full six months after the period to which our story has brought us baronets with twelve thousand a year cannot be married off the hooks as may be done with ordinary mortals settlements of a grandiose nature were required and were duly concocted perhaps mr die had something to say to them so that the great maxim of the law was brought into play perhaps also though of this herbert heard no word it was thought inexpedient to hurry matters while any further inquiry was possible in that affair of the mollett connection mr die and mr prendergast were certainly going about still drawing all coverts far and near lest their fox might not have been fairly run to his last earth but as i have said no tidings as to this reached castle richmond there in ireland no man troubled himself further with any doubt upon the subject and sir herbert took his title and received his rents by the hands of mr somers exactly as though the molletts father and son had never appeared in those parts  it was six months before the marriage was celebrated but during a considerable part of that time clara remained a visitor at castle richmond to lady fitzgerald she was now the same as a daughter and to aunt letty the same as a niece by the girls she had for months been regarded as a sister so she remained in the house of which she was to be the mistress learning to know their ways and ingratiating herself with those who were to be dependent on her  but i had rather stay with you mamma if you will allow me clara had said to her mother when the countess was making some arrangement with her that she should return to castle richmond i shall be leaving you altogether so soon now and she got up close to her mothers side caressingly and would fain have pressed into her arms and kissed her and have talked to her of what was coming as a daughter loves to talk to a loving mother but lady desmonds heart was sore and sad and harsh and she preferred to be alone  you will be better at castle richmond my dear you will be much happier there of course there can be no reason why you should come again into the gloom of this prison  but i should be with you dearest mamma  it is better that you should be with the fitzgeralds now and as for mei must learn to live alone indeed i have learned it so you need not mind for me clara was rebuffed by the tone rather than the words but she still looked up into her mothers face wistfully go my dear said the countessi would sooner be alone at present and so clara went it was hard upon her that even now her mother would not accept her love  but lady desmond could not be cordial with her daughter she made more than one struggle to do so but always failed she couldshe thought that she could have watched her childs happiness with contentment had clara married owen fitzgeraldsir owen as he would then have been but now she could only remember that owen was lost to them both lost through her childs fault she did not hate clara nay she would have made any sacrifice for her daughters welfare but she could not take her lovingly to her bosom so she shut herself up alone in her prison as she called it and then looked back upon the errors of her life it was as well for her to look back as to look forward for what joy was there for which she could dare to hope  in the days that were coming however she did relax something of her sternness clara was of course married from desmond court and the very necessity of making some preparations for this festivity was in itself salutary but indeed it could hardly be called a festivityit was so quiet and sombre clara had but two bridesmaids and they were mary and emmeline fitzgerald the young earl gave away his sister and aunt letty was there and mr prendergast who had come over about the settlements mr somers also attended and the ceremony was performed by our old friend mr townsend beyond these there were no guests at the wedding of sir herbert fitzgerald  the young earl was there and at the last the wedding had been postponed a week for his coming he had left eton at midsummer in order that he might travel for a couple of years with owen fitzgerald before he went to oxford it had been the lads own request and had been for a while refused by owen but fitzgerald had at last given way to the earls love and they had started together for norway  they want me to be home he had said one morning to his friend  ah yes i suppose so  do you know why they had never spoken a word about clara since they had left england together and the earl now dreaded to mention her name  know why replied owen of course i do it is to give away your sister go home desmond my boy when you have returned we will talk about her i shall bear it better when i know that she is his wife  and so it was with them for two years lord desmond travelled with him and after that owen fitzgerald went on upon his wanderings alone many a long year has run by since that and yet he has never come back to hap house men of the county cork now talk of him as one whom they knew long since he who took his house as a stranger is a stranger no longer in the country and the place that owen left vacant has been filled the hounds of duhallow would not recognize his voice nor would the steed in the stable follow gently at his heels but there is yet one left who thinks of him hoping that she may yet see him before she dies
