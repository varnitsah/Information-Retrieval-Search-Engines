bookbinding company  new york     book first     the wings of the dove    i    she waited kate croy for her father to come in but he kept her unconscionably and there were moments at which she showed herself in the glass over the mantel a face positively pale with the irritation that had brought her to the point of going away without sight of him it was at this point however that she remained changing her place moving from the shabby sofa to the armchair upholstered in a glazed cloth that gave at onceshe had tried itthe sense of the slippery and of the sticky she had looked at the sallow prints on the walls and at the lonely magazine a year old that combined with a small lamp in coloured glass and a knitted white centrepiece wanting in freshness to enhance the effect of the purplish cloth on the principal table she had above all from time to time taken a brief stand on the small balcony to which the pair of long windows gave access the vulgar little street in this view offered scant relief from the vulgar little room its main office was to suggest to her that the narrow black housefronts adjusted to a standard that would have been low even for backs constituted quite the publicity implied by such privacies one felt them in the room exactly as one felt the roomthe hundred like it or worsein the street each time she turned in again each time in her impatience she gave him up it was to sound to a deeper depth while she tasted the faint flat emanation of things the failure of fortune and of honour if she continued to wait it was really in a manner that she might not add the shame of fear of individual personal collapse to all the other shames to feel the street to feel the room to feel the tablecloth and the centrepiece and the lamp gave her a small salutary sense at least of neither shirking nor lying this whole vision was the worst thing yetas including in particular the interview for which she had prepared herself and for what had she come but for the worst she tried to be sad so as not to be angry but it made her angry that she couldnt be sad and yet where was misery misery too beaten for blame and chalkmarked by fate like a lot at a common auction if not in these merciless signs of mere mean stale feelings  her fathers life her sisters her own that of her two lost brothersthe whole history of their house had the effect of some fine florid voluminous phrase say even a musical that dropped first into words into notes without sense and then hanging unfinished into no words no notes at all why should a set of people have been put in motion on such a scale and with such an air of being equipped for a profitable journey only to break down without an accident to stretch themselves in the wayside dust without a reason the answer to these questions was not in chirk street but the questions themselves bristled there and the girls repeated pause before the mirror and the chimneyplace might have represented her nearest approach to an escape from them was it not in fact the partial escape from this worst in which she was steeped to be able to make herself out again as agreeable to see she stared into the tarnished glass too hard indeed to be staring at her beauty alone she readjusted the poise of her black closelyfeathered hat retouched beneath it the thick fall of her dusky hair kept her eyes aslant no less on her beautiful averted than on her beautiful presented oval she was dressed altogether in black which gave an even tone by contrast to her clear face and made her hair more harmoniously dark outside on the balcony her eyes showed as blue within at the mirror they showed almost as black she was handsome but the degree of it was not sustained by items and aids a circumstance moreover playing its part at almost any time in the impression she produced the impression was one that remained but as regards the sources of it no sum in addition would have made up the total she had stature without height grace without motion presence without mass slender and simple frequently soundless she was somehow always in the line of the eyeshe counted singularly for its pleasure more dressed often with fewer accessories than other women or less dressed should occasion require with more she probably could not have given the key to these felicities they were mysteries of which her friends were consciousthose friends whose general explanation was to say that she was clever whether or no it were taken by the world as the cause or as the effect of her charm if she saw more things than her fine face in the dull glass of her fathers lodgings she might have seen that after all she was not herself a fact in the collapse she didnt judge herself cheap she didnt make for misery personally at least she was not chalkmarked for the auction she hadnt given up yet and the broken sentence if she was the last word would end with a sort of meaning there was a minute during which though her eyes were fixed she quite visibly lost herself in the thought of the way she might still pull things round had she only been a man it was the name above all she would take in handthe precious name she so liked and that in spite of the harm her wretched father had done it was not yet past praying for she loved it in fact the more tenderly for that bleeding wound but what could a penniless girl do with it but let it go  when her father at last appeared she became as usual instantly aware of the futility of any effort to hold him to anything he had written her that he was ill too ill to leave his room and that he must see her without delay and if this had been as was probable the sketch of a design he was indifferent even to the moderate finish required for deception he had clearly wanted for perversities that he called reasons to see her just as she herself had sharpened for a talk but she now again felt in the inevitability of the freedom he used with her all the old ache her poor mothers very own that he couldnt touch you ever so lightly without setting up no relation with him could be so short or so superficial as not to be somehow to your hurt and this in the strangest way in the world not because he desired it to befeeling often as he surely must the profit for him of its not beingbut because there was never a mistake for you that he could leave unmade or a conviction of his impossibility in you that he could approach you without strengthening he might have awaited her on the sofa in his sittingroom or might have stayed in bed and received her in that situation she was glad to be spared the sight of such penetralia but it would have reminded her a little less that there was no truth in him this was the weariness of every fresh meeting he dealt out lies as he might the cards from the greasy old pack for the game of diplomacy to which you were to sit down with him the inconvenienceas always happens in such caseswas not that you minded what was false but that you missed what was true he might be ill and it might suit you to know it but no contact with him for this could ever be straight enough just so he even might die but kate fairly wondered on what evidence of his own she would some day have to believe it  he had not at present come down from his room which she knew to be above the one they were in he had already been out of the house though he would either should she challenge him deny it or present it as a proof of his extremity she had however by this time quite ceased to challenge him not only face to face with him vain irritation dropped but he breathed upon the tragic consciousness in such a way that after a moment nothing of it was left the difficulty was not less that he breathed in the same way upon the comic she almost believed that with this latter she might still have found a foothold for clinging to him he had ceased to be amusinghe was really too inhuman his perfect look which had floated him so long was practically perfect still but one had long since for every occasion taken it for granted nothing could have better shown than the actual how right one had been he looked exactly as much as usualall pink and silver as to skin and hair all straitness and starch as to figure and dressthe man in the world least connected with anything unpleasant he was so particularly the english gentleman and the fortunate settled normal person seen at a foreign table dh√¥te he suggested but one thing in what perfection england produces them he had kind safe eyes and a voice which for all its clean fulness told in a manner the happy history of its having never had once to raise itself life had met him so halfway and had turned round so to walk with him placing a hand in his arm and fondly leaving him to choose the pace those who knew him a little said how he does dressthose who knew him better said how does he the one stray gleam of comedy just now in his daughters eyes was the funny feeling he momentarily made her have of being herself looked up by him in sordid lodgings for a minute after he came in it was as if the place were her own and he the visitor with susceptibilities he gave you funny feelings he had indescribable arts that quite turned the tables that had been always how he came to see her mother so long as her mother would see him he came from places they had often not known about but he patronised lexham gardens kates only actual expression of impatience however was im glad youre so much better  im not so much better my dearim exceedingly unwell the proof of which is precisely that ive been out to the chemiststhat beastly fellow at the corner so mr croy showed he could qualify the humble hand that assuaged him im taking something he has made up for me its just why ive sent for youthat you may see me as i really am  oh papa its long since ive ceased to see you otherwise than as you really are i think weve all arrived by this time at the right word for that youre beautifulnen parlons plus youre as beautiful as everyou look lovely he judged meanwhile her own appearance as she knew she could always trust him to do recognising estimating sometimes disapproving what she wore showing her the interest he continued to take in her he might really take none at all yet she virtually knew herself the creature in the world to whom he was least indifferent she had often enough wondered what on earth at the pass he had reached could give him pleasure and she had come back on these occasions to that it gave him pleasure that she was handsome that she was in her way a sensible value it was at least as marked nevertheless that he derived none from similar conditions so far as they were similar in his other child poor marian might be handsome but he certainly didnt care the hitch here of course was that with whatever beauty her sister widowed and almost in want with four bouncing children was not a sensible value she asked him the next thing how long he had been in his actual quarters though aware of how little it mattered how little any answer he might make would probably have in common with the truth she failed in fact to notice his answer truthful or not already occupied as she was with what she had on her own side to say to him this was really what had made her waitwhat superseded the small remainder of her resentment at his constant practical impertinence the result of all of which was that within a minute she had brought it out yeseven now im willing to go with you i dont know what you may have wished to say to me and even if you hadnt written you would within a day or two have heard from me things have happened and ive only waited for seeing you till i should be quite sure i am quite sure ill go with you  it produced an effect go with me where  anywhere ill stay with you even here she had taken off her gloves and as if she had arrived with her plan she sat down  lionel croy hung about in his disengaged wayhovered there as if in consequence of her words looking for a pretext to back out easily on which she immediately saw she had discounted as it might be called what he had himself been preparing he wished her not to come to him still less to settle with him and had sent for her to give her up with some style and state a part of the beauty of which however was to have been his sacrifice to her own detachment there was no style no state unless she wished to forsake him his idea had accordingly been to surrender her to her wish with all nobleness it had by no means been to have positively to keep her off she cared however not a straw for his embarrassmentfeeling how little on her own part she was moved by charity she had seen him first and last in so many attitudes that she could now deprive him quite without compunction of the luxury of a new one yet she felt the disconcerted gasp in his tone as he said oh my child i can never consent to that  what then are you going to do  im turning it over said lionel croy you may imagine if im not thinking  havent you thought then his daughter asked of what i speak of i mean of my being ready  standing before her with his hands behind him and his legs a little apart he swayed slightly to and fro inclined toward her as if rising on his toes it had an effect of conscientious deliberation no i havent i couldnt i wouldnt it was so respectable a show that she felt afresh and with the memory of their old despair the despair at home how little his appearance ever by any chance told about him his plausibility had been the heaviest of her mothers crosses inevitably so much more present to the world than whatever it was that was horridthank god they didnt really knowthat he had done he had positively been in his way by the force of his particular type a terrible husband not to live with his type reflecting so invidiously on the woman who had found him distasteful had this thereby not kept directly present to kate herself that it might on some sides prove no light thing for her to leave uncompanioned a parent with such a face and such a manner yet if there was much she neither knew nor dreamed of it passed between them at this very moment that he was quite familiar with himself as the subject of such quandaries if he recognised his younger daughters happy aspect as a sensible value he had from the first still more exactly appraised his own the great wonder was not that in spite of everything his own had helped him the great wonder was that it hadnt helped him more however it was to its old eternal recurrent tune helping him all the while her drop into patience with him showed how it was helping him at this moment she saw the next instant precisely the line he would take do you really ask me to believe youve been making up your mind to that  she had to consider her own line i dont think i care papa what you believe i never for that matter think of you as believing anything hardly more she permitted herself to add than i ever think of you as yourself believed i dont know you father you see  and its your idea that you may make that up  oh dear no not at all thats no part of the question if i havent understood you by this time i never shall and it doesnt matter it has seemed to me that you may be lived with but not that you may be understood of course ive not the least idea how you get on  i dont get on mr croy almost gaily replied  his daughter took in the place again and it might well have seemed odd that in so little to meet the eye there should be so much to show what showed was the uglinessso positive and palpable that it was somehow sustaining it was a medium a setting and to that extent after all a dreadful sign of life so that it fairly put a point into her answer oh i beg your pardon you flourish  do you throw it up at me again he pleasantly inquired that ive not made away with myself  she treated the question as needing no reply she sat there for real things you know how all our anxieties under mammas will have come out she had still less to leave than she feared we dont know how we lived it all makes up about two hundred a year for marian and two for me but i give up a hundred to marian  oh you weak thing her father kindly sighed  for you and me together she went on the other hundred would do something  and what would do the rest  can you yourself do nothing he gave her a look then slipping his hands into his pockets and turning away stood for a little at the window she had left open she said nothing moreshe had placed him there with that question and the silence lasted a minute broken by the call of an appealing costermonger which came in with the mild march air with the shabby sunshine fearfully unbecoming to the room and with the small homely hum of chirk street presently he moved nearer but as if her question had quite dropped i dont see what has so suddenly wound you up  i should have thought you might perhaps guess let me at any rate tell you aunt maud has made me a proposal but she has also made me a condition she wants to keep me  and what in the world else could she possibly want  oh i dont knowmany things im not so precious a capture the girl a little dryly explained no one has ever wanted to keep me before  looking always what was proper her father looked now still more surprised than interested youve not had proposals he spoke as if that were incredible of lionel croys daughter as if indeed such an admission scarce consorted even in filial intimacy with her high spirit and general form  not from rich relations shes extremely kind to me but its time she says that we should understand each other  mr croy fully assented of course it ishigh time and i can quite imagine what she means by it  are you very sure  oh perfectly she means that shell do for you handsomely if youll break off all relations with me you speak of her condition her conditions of course that  well then said kate its what has wound me up here i am  he showed with a gesture how thoroughly he had taken it in after which within a few seconds he had quite congruously turned the situation about do you really suppose me in a position to justify your throwing yourself upon me  she waited a little but when she spoke it was clear yes  well then youre a bigger fool than i should have ventured to suppose you  why so you live you flourish you bloom  ah how youve all always hated me he murmured with a pensive gaze again at the window  no one could be less of a mere cherished memory she declared as if she had not heard him youre an actual person if there ever was one we agreed just now that youre beautiful you strike me you know asin your own waymuch more firm on your feet than i am dont put it to me therefore as monstrous that the fact that we are after all parent and child should at present in some manner count for us my idea has been that it should have some effect for each of us i dont at all as i told you just now she pursued make out your life but whatever it is i hereby offer you to accept it and on my side ill do everything i can for you  i see said lionel croy then with the sound of extreme relevance and what can you she only at this hesitated and he took up her silence you can describe yourselfto yourselfas in a fine flight giving up your aunt for me but what good i should like to know would your fine flight do me as she still said nothing he developed a little were not possessed of so much at this charming pass please to remember as that we can afford not to take hold of any perch held out to us i like the way you talk my dear about giving up one doesnt give up the use of a spoon because ones reduced to living on broth and your spoon that is your aunt please consider is partly mine as well she rose now as if in sight of the term of her effort in sight of the futility and the weariness of many things and moved back to the poor little glass with which she had communed before she retouched here again the poise of her hat and this brought to her fathers lips another remark in which impatience however had already been replaced by a funny flare of appreciation oh youre all right dont muddle yourself up with me  his daughter turned round to him the condition aunt maud makes is that i shall have absolutely nothing to do with you never see you nor speak nor write to you never go near you nor make you a sign nor hold any sort of communication with you what she requires is that you shall simply cease to exist for me  he had always seemedit was one of the marks of what they called the unspeakable in himto walk a little more on his toes as if for jauntiness in the presence of offence nothing however was more wonderful than what he sometimes would take for offence unless it might be what he sometimes wouldnt he walked at any rate on his toes now a very proper requirement of your aunt maud my deari dont hesitate to say it yet as this much as she had seen left her silent at first from what might have been a sense of sickness he had time to go on thats her condition then but what are her promises just what does she engage to do you must work it you know  you mean make her feel kate asked after a moment how much im attached to you  well what a cruel invidious treaty it is for you to sign im a poor old dad to make a stand about giving upi quite agree but im not after all quite the old dad not to get something for giving up  oh i think her idea said kate almost gaily now is that i shall get a great deal  he met her with his inimitable amenity but does she give you the items  the girl went through the show more or less i think but many of them are things i dare say i may take for grantedthings women can do for each other and that you wouldnt understand  theres nothing i understand so well always as the things i neednt but what i want to do you see he went on is to put it to your conscience that youve an admirable opportunity and that its moreover one for which after all damn you youve really to thank me  i confess i dont see kate observed what my conscience has to do with it  then my dear girl you ought simply to be ashamed of yourself do you know what youre a proof of all you hard hollow people together he put the question with a charming air of sudden spiritual heat of the deplorably superficial morality of the age the family sentiment in our vulgarised brutalised life has gone utterly to pot there was a day when a man like meby which i mean a parent like mewould have been for a daughter like you a quite distinct value whats called in the business world i believe an asset he continued sociably to make it out im not talking only of what you might with the right feeling do for me but of what you mightits what i call your opportunitydo with me unless indeed he the next moment imperturbably threw off they come a good deal to the same thing your duty as well as your chance if youre capable of seeing it is to use me show family feeling by seeing what im good for if you had it as i have it youd see im still goodwell for a lot of things theres in fact my dear mr croy wound up a coachandfour to be got out of me his drop or rather his climax failed a little of effect indeed through an undue precipitation of memory something his daughter had said came back to him youve settled to give away half your little inheritance  her hesitation broke into laughter noi havent settled anything  but you mean practically to let marian collar it they stood there face to face but she so denied herself to his challenge that he could only go on youve a view of three hundred a year for her in addition to what her husband left her with is that the remote progenitor of such wantonness audibly wondered your morality  kate found her answer without trouble is it your idea that i should give you everything  the everything clearly struck himto the point even of determining the tone of his reply far from it how can you ask that when i refuse what you tell me you came to offer make of my idea what you can i think ive sufficiently expressed it and its at any rate to take or to leave its the only one i may nevertheless add its the basket with all my eggs its my conception in short of your duty  the girls tired smile watched the word as if it had taken on a small grotesque visibility youre wonderful on such subjects i think i should leave you in no doubt she pursued that if i were to sign my aunts agreement i should carry it out in honour to the letter  rather my own love its just your honour that i appeal to the only way to play the game is to play it theres no limit to what your aunt can do for you  do you mean in the way of marrying me  what else should i mean marry properly  and then kate asked as he hung fire  and thenwell i will talk with you ill resume relations  she looked about her and picked up her parasol because youre not so afraid of any one else in the world as you are of her my husband if i should marry would be at the worst less of a terror if thats what you mean there may be something in it but doesnt it depend a little also on what you mean by my getting a proper one however kate added as she picked out the frill of her little umbrella i dont suppose your idea of him is quite that he should persuade you to live with us  dear nonot a bit he spoke as not resenting either the fear or the hope she imputed met both imputations in fact with a sort of intellectual relief i place the case for you wholly in your aunts hands i take her view with my eyes shut i accept in all confidence any man she selects if hes good enough for herelephantine snob as she ishes good enough for me and quite in spite of the fact that shell be sure to select one who can be trusted to be nasty to me my only interest is in your doing what she wants you shant be so beastly poor my darling mr croy declared if i can help it  well then goodbye papa the girl said after a reflection on this that had perceptibly ended for her in a renunciation of further debate of course you understand that it may be for long  her companion hereupon had one of his finest inspirations why not frankly for ever you must do me the justice to see that i dont do things that ive never done them by halvesthat if i offer you to efface myself its for the final fatal sponge that i ask well saturated and well applied  she turned her handsome quiet face upon him at such length that it might well have been for the last time i dont know what youre like  no more do i my dear ive spent my life in trying in vain to discover like nothingmores the pity if there had been many of us and we could have found each other out theres no knowing what we mightnt have done but it doesnt matter now goodbye love he looked even not sure of what she would wish him to suppose on the subject of a kiss yet also not embarrassed by his uncertainty  she forbore in fact for a moment longer to clear it up i wish there were some one here who might servefor any contingencyas a witness that i have put it to you that im ready to come  would you like me her father asked to call the landlady  you may not believe me she pursued but i came really hoping you might have found some way im very sorry at all events to leave you unwell he turned away from her on this and as he had done before took refuge by the window in a stare at the street let me put itunfortunately without a witness she added after a moment that theres only one word you really need speak  when he took this up it was still with his back to her if i dont strike you as having already spoken it our time has been singularly wasted  ill engage with you in respect to my aunt exactly to what she wants of me in respect to you she wants me to choose very well i will choose ill wash my hands of her for you to just that tune  he at last brought himself round do you know dear you make me sick ive tried to be clear and it isnt fair  but she passed this over she was too visibly sincere father  i dont quite see whats the matter with you he said and if you cant pull yourself together illupon my honourtake you in hand put you into a cab and deliver you again safe at lancaster gate  she was really absent distant father  it was too much and he met it sharply well  strange as it may be to you to hear me say it theres a good you can do me and a help you can render  isnt it then exactly what ive been trying to make you feel  yes she answered patiently but so in the wrong way im perfectly honest in what i say and i know what im talking about it isnt that ill pretend i could have believed a month ago in anything to call aid or support from you the case is changedthats what has happened my difficultys a new one but even now its not a question of anything i should ask you in a way to do its simply a question of your not turning me awaytaking yourself out of my life its simply a question of your saying yes then since you will well stand together we wont worry in advance about how or where well have a faith and find a way thats allthat would be the good youd do me i should have you and it would be for my benefit do you see  if he didnt it was not for want of looking at her hard the matter with you is that youre in love and that your aunt knows andfor reasons im sure perfecthates and opposes it well she may its a matter in which i trust her with my eyes shut go please though he spoke not in angerrather in infinite sadnesshe fairly turned her out before she took it up he had as the fullest expression of what he felt opened the door of the room he had fairly in his deep disapproval a generous compassion to spare im sorry for her deluded woman if she builds on you  kate stood a moment in the draught shes not the person i pity most for deluded in many ways though she may be shes not the person whos most so i mean she explained if its a question of what you call building on me  he took it as if what she meant might be other than her description of it youre deceiving two persons then mrs lowder and somebody else  she shook her head with detachment ive no intention of that sort with respect to any one nowto mrs lowder least of all if you fail meshe seemed to make it out for herselfthat has the merit at least that it simplifies i shall go my wayas i see my way  your way you mean then will be to marry some blackguard without a penny  you ask a great deal of satisfaction she observed for the little you give  it brought him up again before her as with a sense that she was not to be hustled and though he glared at her a little this had long been the practical limit to his general power of objection if youre base enough to incur your aunts disgust youre base enough for my argument what if youre not thinking of an utterly improper person do your speeches to me signify who is the beggarly sneak he demanded as her response failed her response when it came was cold but distinct he has every disposition to make the best of you he only wants in fact to be kind to you  then he must be an ass and how in the world can you consider it to improve him for me her father pursued that hes also destitute and impossible there are asses and asses eventhe right and the wrongand you appear to have carefully picked out one of the wrong your aunt knows them by good fortune i perfectly trust as i tell you her judgment for them and you may take it from me once for all that i wont hear of any one of whom she wont which led up to his last word if you should really defy us both  well papa  well my sweet child i think thatreduced to insignificance as you may fondly believe mei should still not be quite without some way of making you regret it  she had a pause a grave one but not as appeared that she might measure this danger if i shouldnt do it you know it wouldnt be because im afraid of you  oh if you dont do it he retorted you may be as bold as you like  then you can do nothing at all for me  he showed her this time unmistakablyit was before her there on the landing at the top of the tortuous stairs and in the midst of the strange smell that seemed to cling to themhow vain her appeal remained ive never pretended to do more than my duty ive given you the best and the clearest advice and then came up the spring that moved him if it only displeases you you can go to marian to be consoled what he couldnt forgive was her dividing with marian her scant share of the provision their mother had been able to leave them she should have divided it with him   ii  she had gone to mrs lowder on her mothers deathgone with an effort the strain and pain of which made her at present as she recalled them reflect on the long way she had travelled since then there had been nothing else to donot a penny in the other house nothing but unpaid bills that had gathered thick while its mistress lay mortally ill and the admonition that there was nothing she must attempt to raise money on since everything belonged to the estate how the estate would turn out at best presented itself as a mystery altogether gruesome it had proved in fact since then a residuum a trifle less scant than with marian she had for some weeks feared but the girl had had at the beginning rather a wounded sense of its being watched on behalf of marian and her children what on earth was it supposed that she wanted to do to it she wanted in truth only to give upto abandon her own interest which she no doubt would already have done had not the point been subject to aunt mauds sharp intervention aunt mauds intervention was all sharp now and the other point the great one was that it was to be in this light either all put up with or all declined yet at the winters end nevertheless she could scarce have said what stand she conceived she had taken it wouldnt be the first time she had seen herself obliged to accept with smothered irony other peoples interpretation of her conduct she often ended by giving up to themit seemed really the way to livethe version that met their convenience  the tall rich heavy house at lancaster gate on the other side of the park and the long south kensington stretches had figured to her through childhood through girlhood as the remotest limit of her vague young world it was further off and more occasional than anything else in the comparatively compact circle in which she revolved and seemed by a rigour early marked to be reached through long straight discouraging vistas which kept lengthening and straightening whereas almost everything else in life was either at the worst round about cromwell road or at the furthest in the nearer parts of kensington gardens mrs lowder was her only real aunt not the wife of an uncle and had been thereby both in ancient days and when the greater trouble came the person of all persons properly to make some sign in accord with which our young womans feeling was founded on the impression quite cherished for years that the signs made across the interval just mentioned had never been really in the note of the situation the main office of this relative for the young croysapart from giving them their fixed measure of social greatnesshad struck them as being to form them to a conception of what they were not to expect when kate came to think matters over with the aid of knowledge she failed quite to see how aunt maud could have been differentshe had rather perceived by this time how many other things might have been yet she also made out that if they had all consciously lived under a liability to the chill breath of ultima thule they couldnt either on the facts very well have done less what in the event appeared established was that if mrs lowder had disliked them she had yet not disliked them so much as they supposed it had at any rate been for the purpose of showing how she struggled with her aversion that she sometimes came to see them that she at regular periods invited them to her house and in short as it now looked kept them along on the terms that would best give her sister the perennial luxury of a grievance this sister poor mrs croy the girl knew had always judged her resentfully and had brought them up marian the boys and herself to the idea of a particular attitude for signs of the practice of which they watched each other with awe the attitude was to make plain to aunt maud with the same regularity as her invitations that they sufficedthanks awfullyto themselves but the ground of it kate lived to discern was that this was only because she didnt suffice to them the little she offered was to be accepted under protest yet not really because it was excessive it wounded themthere was the rubbecause it fell short  the number of new things our young lady looked out on from the high south window that hung over the parkthis number was so great though some of the things were only old ones altered and as the phrase was of other matters done up that life at present turned to her view from week to week more and more the face of a striking and distinguished stranger she had reached a great agefor it quite seemed to her that at twentyfive it was late to reconsider and her most general sense was a shade of regret that she had not known earlier the world was differentwhether for worse or for betterfrom her rudimentary readings and it gave her the feeling of a wasted past if she had only known sooner she might have arranged herself more to meet it she made at all events discoveries every day some of which were about herself and others about other persons two of theseone under each headmore particularly engaged in alternation her anxiety she saw as she had never seen before how material things spoke to her she saw and she blushed to see that if in contrast with some of its old aspects life now affected her as a dress successfully done up this was exactly by reason of the trimmings and lace was a matter of ribbons and silk and velvet she had a dire accessibility to pleasure from such sources she liked the charming quarters her aunt had assigned herliked them literally more than she had in all her other days liked anything and nothing could have been more uneasy than her suspicion of her relatives view of this truth her relative was prodigiousshe had never done her relative justice these larger conditions all tasted of her from morning till night but she was a person in respect to whom the growth of acquaintance could onlystrange as it might seemkeep your heart in your mouth  the girls second great discovery was that so far from having been for mrs lowder a subject of superficial consideration the blighted home in lexham gardens had haunted her nights and her days kate had spent all winter hours of observation that were not less pointed for being spent alone recent events which her mourning explained assured her a measure of isolation and it was in the isolation above all that her neighbours influence worked sitting far downstairs aunt maud was yet a presence from which a sensitive niece could feel herself extremely under pressure she knew herself now the sensitive niece as having been marked from far back she knew more than she could have told you by the upstairs fire in a whole dark december afternoon she knew so much that her knowledge was what fairly kept her there making her at times more endlessly between the small silkcovered sofa that stood for her in the firelight and the great grey map of middlesex spread beneath her lookout to go down to forsake her refuge was to meet some of her discoveries halfway to have to face them or fly before them whereas they were at such a height only like the rumble of a faroff siege heard in the provisioned citadel she had almost liked in these weeks what had created her suspense and her stress the loss of her mother the submersion of her father the discomfort of her sister the confirmation of their shrunken prospects the certainty in especial of her having to recognise that should she behave as she called it decentlythat is still do something for othersshe would be herself wholly without supplies she held that she had a right to sadness and stillness she nursed them for their postponing power what they mainly postponed was the question of a surrenderthough she could not yet have said exactly of what a general surrender of everythingthat was at moments the way it presented itselfto aunt mauds looming personality it was by her personality that aunt maud was prodigious and the great mass of it loomed because in the thick the foglike air of her arranged existence there were parts doubtless magnified and parts certainly vague they represented at all events alike the dim and the distinct a strong will and a high hand it was perfectly present to kate that she might be devoured and she likened herself to a trembling kid kept apart a day or two till her turn should come but sure sooner or later to be introduced into the cage of the lioness  the cage was aunt mauds own room her office her countinghouse her battlefield her especial scene in fine of action situated on the groundfloor opening from the main hall and figuring rather to our young woman on exit and entrance as a guard house or a tollgate the lioness waitedthe kid had at least that consciousness was aware of the neighbourhood of a morsel she had reason to suppose tender she would have been meanwhile a wonderful lioness for a show an extraordinary figure in a cage or anywhere majestic magnificent highcoloured all brilliant gloss perpetual satin twinkling bugles and flashing gems with a lustre of agate eyes a sheen of raven hair a polish of complexion that was like that of wellkept china and thatas if the skin were too tighttold especially at curves and corners her niece had a quiet name for hershe kept it quiet thinking of her with a free fancy as somehow typically insular she talked to herself of britannia of the market placebritannia unmistakable but with a pen in her ear and felt she should not be happy till she might on some occasion add to the rest of the panoply a helmet a shield a trident and a ledger it was not in truth however that the forces with which as kate felt she would have to deal were those most suggested by an image simple and broad she was learning after all each day to know her companion and what she had already most perceived was the mistake of trusting to easy analogies there was a whole side of britannia the side of her florid philistinism her plumes and her train her fantastic furniture and heaving bosom the false gods of her taste and false notes of her talk the sole contemplation of which would be dangerously misleading she was a complex and subtle britannia as passionate as she was practical with a reticule for her prejudices as deep as that other pocket the pocket full of coins stamped in her image that the world best knew her by she carried on in short behind her aggressive and defensive front operations determined by her wisdom it was in fact we have hinted as a besieger that our young lady in the provisioned citadel had for the present most to think of her and what made her formidable in this character was that she was unscrupulous and immoral so at all events in silent sessions and a youthful offhand way kate conveniently pictured her what this sufficiently represented being that her weight was in the scale of certain dangersthose dangers that by our showing made the younger woman linger and lurk above while the elder below both militant and diplomatic covered as much of the ground as possible yet what were the dangers after all but just the dangers of life and of london mrs lowder was london was lifethe roar of the siege and the thick of the fray there were some things after all of which britannia was afraid but aunt maud was afraid of nothingnot even it would appear of arduous thought these impressions none the less kate kept so much to herself that she scarce shared them with poor marian the ostensible purpose of her frequent visits to whom yet continued to be to talk over everything one of her reasons for holding off from the last concession to aunt maud was that she might be the more free to commit herself to this so much nearer and so much less fortunate relative with whom aunt maud would have directly almost nothing to do the sharpest pinch of her state meanwhile was exactly that all intercourse with her sister had the effect of casting down her courage and tying her hands adding daily to her sense of the part not always either uplifting or sweetening that the bond of blood might play in ones life she was face to face with it now with the bond of blood the consciousness of it was what she seemed most clearly to have come into by the death of her mother much of that consciousness as her mother had absorbed and carried away her haunting harrassing father her menacing uncompromising aunt her portionless little nephews and nieces were figures that caused the chord of natural piety superabundantly to vibrate her manner of putting it to herselfbut more especially in respect to marianwas that she saw what you might be brought to by the cultivation of consanguinity she had taken in the old days as she supposed the measure of this liability those being the days when as the secondborn she had thought no one in the world so pretty as marian no one so charming so clever so assured in advance of happiness and success the view was different now but her attitude had been obliged for many reasons to show as the same the subject of this estimate was no longer pretty as the reason for thinking her clever was no longer plain yet bereaved disappointed demoralised querulous she was all the more sharply and insistently kates elder and kates own kates most constant feeling about her was that she would make her kate do things and always in comfortless chelsea at the door of the small house the small rent of which she couldnt help having on her mind she fatalistically asked herself before going in which thing it would probably be this time she noticed with profundity that disappointment made people selfish she marvelled at the serenityit was the poor womans only oneof what marian took for granted her own state of abasement as the secondborn her life reduced to mere inexhaustible sisterhood she existed in that view wholly for the small house in chelsea the moral of which moreover of course was that the more one gave oneself the less of one was left there were always people to snatch at one and it would never occur to them that they were eating one up they did that without tasting  there was no such misfortune or at any rate no such discomfort she further reasoned as to be formed at once for being and for seeing you always saw in this case something else than what you were and you got in consequence none of the peace of your condition however as she never really let marian see what she was marian might well not have been aware that she herself saw kate was accordingly to her own vision not a hypocrite of virtue for she gave herself up but she was a hypocrite of stupidity for she kept to herself everything that was not herself what she most kept was the particular sentiment with which she watched her sister instinctively neglect nothing that would make for her submission to their aunt a state of the spirit that perhaps marked most sharply how poor you might become when you minded so much the absence of wealth it was through kate that aunt maud should be worked and nothing mattered less than what might become of kate in the process kate was to burn her ships in short so that marian should profit and marians desire to profit was quite oblivious of a dignity that had after all its reasonsif it had only cared for themfor keeping itself a little stiff kate to be properly stiff for both of them would therefore have had to be selfish have had to prefer an ideal of behaviourthan which nothing ever was more selfishto the possibility of stray crumbs for the four small creatures the tale of mrs lowders disgust at her elder nieces marriage to mr condrip had lost little of its point the incredibly fatuous behaviour of mr condrip the parson of a dull suburban parish with a saintly profile which was always in evidence being so distinctly on record to keep criticism consistent he had presented his profile on system having goodness knew nothing else to presentnothing at all to fullface the world with no imagination of the propriety of living and minding his business criticism had remained on aunt mauds part consistent enough she was not a person to regard such proceedings as less of a mistake for having acquired more of the privilege of pathos she had not been forgiving and the only approach she made to overlooking them was by overlookingwith the surviving delinquentthe solid little phalanx that now represented them of the two sinister ceremonies that she lumped together the marriage and the interment she had been present at the former just as she had sent marian before it a liberal cheque but this had not been for her more than the shadow of an admitted link with mrs condrips course she disapproved of clamorous children for whom there was no prospect she disapproved of weeping widows who couldnt make their errors good and she had thus put within marians reach one of the few luxuries left when so much else had gone an easy pretext for a constant grievance kate croy remembered well what their mother in a different quarter had made of it and it was marians marked failure to pluck the fruit of resentment that committed them as sisters to an almost equal fellowship in abjection if the theory was that yes alas one of the pair had ceased to be noticed but that the other was noticed enough to make up for it who would fail to see that kate couldnt separate herself without a cruel pride that lesson became sharp for our young lady the day after her interview with her father  i cant imagine marian on this occasion said to her how you can think of anything else in the world but the horrid way were situated  and pray how do you know kate inquired in reply anything about my thoughts it seems to me i give you sufficient proof of how much i think of you i dont really my dear know what else youve to do with  marians retort on this was a stroke as to which she had supplied herself with several kinds of preparation but there was none the less something of an unexpected note in its promptitude she had foreseen her sisters general fear but here ominously was the special one well your own business is of course your own business and you may say theres no one less in a position than i to preach to you but all the same if you wash your hands of me for ever for it i wont for this once keep back that i dont consider youve a right as we all stand to throw yourself away  it was after the childrens dinner which was also their mothers but which their aunt mostly contrived to keep from ever becoming her own luncheon and the two young women were still in the presence of the crumpled tablecloth the dispersed pinafores the scraped dishes the lingering odour of boiled food kate had asked with ceremony if she might put up a window a little and mrs condrip had replied without it that she might do as she liked she often received such inquiries as if they reflected in a manner on the pure essence of her little ones the four had retired with much movement and noise under imperfect control of the small irish governess whom their aunt had hunted out for them and whose brooding resolve not to prolong so uncrowned a martyrdom she already more than suspected their mother had become for katewho took it just for the effect of being their motherquite a different thing from the mild marian of the past mr condrips widow expansively obscured that image she was little more than a ragged relic a plain prosaic result of him as if she had somehow been pulled through him as through an obstinate funnel only to be left crumpled and useless and with nothing in her but what he accounted for she had grown red and almost fat which were not happy signs of mourning less and less like any croy particularly a croy in trouble and sensibly like her husbands two unmarried sisters who came to see her in kates view much too often and stayed too long with the consequence of inroads upon the tea and breadandbuttermatters as to which kate not unconcerned with the tradesmens books had feelings about them moreover marian was touchy and her nearer relative who observed and weighed things noted as an oddity that she would have taken any reflection on them as a reflection on herself if that was what marriage necessarily did to you kate croy would have questioned marriage it was a grave example at any rate of what a manand such a manmight make of a woman she could see how the condrip pair pressed their brothers widow on the subject of aunt maudwho wasnt after all their aunt made her over their interminable cups chatter and even swagger about lancaster gate made her more vulgar than it had seemed written that any croy could possibly become on such a subject they laid it down they rubbed it in that lancaster gate was to be kept in sight and that she kate was to keep it so that curiously or at all events sadly our young woman was sure of being in her own person more permitted to them as an object of comment than they would in turn ever be permitted to herself the beauty of which too was that marian didnt love them but they were condripsthey had grown near the rose they were almost like bertie and maudie like kitty and guy they talked of the dead to her which kate never did it being a relation in which kate could but mutely listen she couldnt indeed too often say to herself that if that was what marriage did to you it may easily be guessed therefore that the ironic light of such reserves fell straight across the field of marians warning i dont quite see she answered where in particular it strikes you that my danger lies im not conscious i assure you of the least disposition to throw myself anywhere i feel as if for the present i have been quite sufficiently thrown  you dont feelmarian brought it all outas if you would like to marry merton densher  kate took a moment to meet this inquiry is it your idea that if i should feel so i would be bound to give you notice so that you might step in and head me off is that your idea the girl asked then as her sister also had a pause i dont know what makes you talk of mr densher she observed  i talk of him just because you dont that you never do in spite of what i knowthats what makes me think of him or rather perhaps its what makes me think of you if you dont know by this time what i hope for you what i dream ofmy attachment being what it isits no use my attempting to tell you but marian had in fact warmed to her work and kate was sure she had discussed mr densher with the miss condrips if i name that person i suppose its because im so afraid of him if you want really to know he fills me with terror if you want really to know in fact i dislike him as much as i dread him  and yet dont think it dangerous to abuse him to me  yes mrs condrip confessed i do think it dangerous but how can i speak of him otherwise i dare say i admit that i shouldnt speak of him at all only i do want you for once as i said just now to know  to know what my dear  that i should regard it marian promptly returned as far and away the worst thing that has happened to us yet  do you mean because he hasnt money  yes for one thing and because i dont believe in him  kate was civil but perfunctory what do you mean by not believing in him  well being sure hell never get it and you must have it you shall have it  to give it to you  marian met her with a readiness that was practically pert to have it first not at any rate to go on not having it then we should see  we should indeed said kate croy it was talk of a kind she loathed but if marian chose to be vulgar what was one to do it made her think of the miss condrips with renewed aversion i like the way you arrange thingsi like what you take for granted if its so easy for us to marry men who want us to scatter gold i wonder we any of us do anything else i dont see so many of them about nor what interest i might ever have for them you live my dear she presently added in a world of vain thoughts  not so much as you kate for i see what i see and you cant turn it off that way the elder sister paused long enough for the youngers face to show in spite of superiority an apprehension im not talking of any man but aunt mauds man nor of any money even if you like but aunt mauds money im not talking of anything but your doing what she wants youre wrong if you speak of anything that i want of you i want nothing but what she does thats good enough for meand marians tone struck her companion as dreadful if i dont believe in merton densher i do at least in mrs lowder  your ideas are the more striking kate returned that theyre the same as papas i had them from him you may be interested to knowand with all the brilliancy you may imagineyesterday  marian clearly was interested to know he has been to see you  no i went to him  really marian wondered for what purpose  to tell him im ready to go to him  marian stared to leave aunt maud  for my father yes  she had fairly flushed poor mrs condrip with horror youre ready  so i told him i couldnt tell him less  and pray could you tell him more marian gasped in her distress what in the world is he to us you bring out such a thing as that this way  they faced each otherthe tears were in marians eyes kate watched them there a moment and then said i had thought it well overover and over but you neednt feel injured im not going he wont have me  her companion still pantedit took time to subside well i wouldnt have youwouldnt receive you at all i can assure youif he had made you any other answer i do feel injuredat your having been willing if you were to go to papa my dear you would have to stop coming to me marian put it thus indefinably as a picture of privation from which her companion might shrink such were the threats she could complacently make could think herself masterful for making but if he wont take you she continued he shows at least his sharpness  marian had always her views of sharpness she was as her sister privately commented great on it but kate had her refuge from irritation he wont take me she simply repeated but he believes like you in aunt maud he threatens me with his curse if i leave her  so you wont as the girl at first said nothing her companion caught at it you wont of course i see you wont but i dont see why nevertheless i shouldnt insist to you once for all on the plain truth of the whole matter the truth my dear of your duty do you ever think about that its the greatest duty of all  there you are again kate laughed papas also immense on my duty  oh i dont pretend to be immense but i pretend to know more than you do of life more even perhaps than papa marian seemed to see that personage at this moment nevertheless in the light of a kinder irony poor old papa  she sighed it with as many condonations as her sisters ear had more than once caught in her dear old aunt maud these were things that made kate for the time turn sharply away and she gathered herself now to go they were the note again of the abject it was hard to say which of the persons in question had most shown how little they liked her the younger woman proposed at any rate to let discussion rest and she believed that for herself she had done so during the ten minutes that thanks to her wish not to break off short elapsed before she could gracefully withdraw it then appeared however that marian had been discussing still and there was something that at the last kate had to take up whom do you mean by aunt mauds young man  whom should i mean but lord mark  and where do you pick up such vulgar twaddle kate demanded with her clear face how does such stuff in this hole get to you  she had no sooner spoken than she asked herself what had become of the grace to which she had sacrificed marian certainly did little to save it and nothing indeed was so inconsequent as her ground of complaint she desired her to work lancaster gate as she believed that scene of abundance could be worked but she now didnt see why advantage should be taken of the bloated connection to put an affront on her own poor home she appeared in fact for the moment to take the position that kate kept her in her hole and then heartlessly reflected on her being in it yet she didnt explain how she had picked up the report on which her sister had challenged herso that it was thus left to her sister to see in it once more a sign of the creeping curiosity of the miss condrips they lived in a deeper hole than marian but they kept their ear to the ground they spent their days in prowling whereas marian in garments and shoes that seemed steadily to grow looser and larger never prowled there were times when kate wondered if the miss condrips were offered her by fate as a warning for her own futureto be taken as showing her what she herself might become at forty if she let things too recklessly go what was expected of her by othersand by so many of themcould all the same on occasion present itself as beyond a joke and this was just now the aspect it particularly wore she was not only to quarrel with merton densher to oblige her five spectatorswith the miss condrips there were five she was to set forth in pursuit of lord mark on some preposterous theory of the premium attached to success mrs lowders hand had attached it and it figured at the end of the course as a bell that would ring break out into public clamour as soon as touched kate reflected sharply enough on the weak points of this fond fiction with the result at last of a certain chill for her sisters confidence though mrs condrip still took refuge in the pleawhich was after all the great pointthat their aunt would be munificent when their aunt should be pleased the exact identity of her candidate was a detail what was of the essence was her conception of the kind of match it was open to her niece to make with her aid marian always spoke of marriages as matches but that was again a detail mrs lowders aid meanwhile awaited themif not to light the way to lord mark then to somebody better marian would put up in fine with somebody better she only wouldnt put up with somebody so much worse kate had once more to go through all this before a graceful issue was reached it was reached by her paying with the sacrifice of mr densher for her reduction of lord mark to the absurd so they separated softly enough she was to be let off hearing about lord mark so long as she made it good that she wasnt underhand about anybody else she had denied everything and every one she reflected as she went awayand that was a relief but it also made rather a clean sweep of the future the prospect put on a bareness that already gave her something in common with the miss condrips     book second  iii  merton densher who passed the best hours of each night at the office of his newspaper had at times during the day to make up for it a sense or at least an appearance of leisure in accordance with which he was not infrequently to be met in different parts of the town at moments when men of business are hidden from the public eye more than once during the present winters end he had deviated toward three oclock or toward four into kensington gardens where he might for a while on each occasion have been observed to demean himself as a person with nothing to do he made his way indeed for the most part with a certain directness over to the north side but once that ground was reached his behaviour was noticeably wanting in point he moved seemingly at random from alley to alley he stopped for no reason and remained idly agaze he sat down in a chair and then changed to a bench after which he walked about again only again to repeat both the vagueness and the vivacity distinctly he was a man either with nothing at all to do or with ever so much to think about and it was not to be denied that the impression he might often thus easily make had the effect of causing the burden of proof in certain directions to rest on him it was a little the fault of his aspect his personal marks which made it almost impossible to name his profession  he was a longish leanish fairish young englishman not unamenable on certain sides to classificationas for instance by being a gentleman by being rather specifically one of the educated one of the generally sound and generally pleasant yet though to that degree neither extraordinary nor abnormal he would have failed to play straight into an observers hands he was young for the house of commons he was loose for the army he was refined as might have been said for the city and quite apart from the cut of his cloth he was sceptical it might have been felt for the church on the other hand he was credulous for diplomacy or perhaps even for science while he was perhaps at the same time too much in his mere senses for poetry and yet too little in them for art you would have got fairly near him by making out in his eyes the potential recognition of ideas but you would have quite fallen away again on the question of the ideas themselves the difficulty with densher was that he looked vague without looking weakidle without looking empty it was the accident possibly of his long legs which were apt to stretch themselves of his straight hair and his wellshaped head never the latter neatly smooth and apt into the bargain at the time of quite other calls upon it to throw itself suddenly back and supported behind by his uplifted arms and interlocked hands place him for unconscionable periods in communion with the ceiling the treetops the sky he was in short visibly absentminded irregularly clever liable to drop what was near and to take up what was far he was more a respecter in general than a follower of custom he suggested above all however that wondrous state of youth in which the elements the metals more or less precious are so in fusion and fermentation that the question of the final stamp the pressure that fixes the value must wait for comparative coolness and it was a mark of his interesting mixture that if he was irritable it was by a law of considerable subtletya law that in intercourse with him it might be of profit though not easy to master one of the effects of it was that he had for you surprises of tolerance as well as of temper  he loitered on the best of the relenting days the several occasions we speak of along the part of the gardens nearest to lancaster gate and when always in due time kate croy came out of her aunts house crossed the road and arrived by the nearest entrance there was a general publicity in the proceeding which made it slightly anomalous if their meeting was to be bold and free it might have taken place within doors if it was to be shy or secret it might have taken place almost anywhere better than under mrs lowders windows they failed indeed to remain attached to that spot they wandered and strolled taking in the course of more than one of these interviews a considerable walk or else picked out a couple of chairs under one of the great trees and sat as much apartapart from every one elseas possible but kate had each time at first the air of wishing to expose herself to pursuit and capture if those things were in question she made the point that she was not underhand any more than she was vulgar that the gardens were charming in themselves and this use of them a matter of taste and that if her aunt chose to glare at her from the drawingroom or to cause her to be tracked and overtaken she could at least make it convenient that this should be easily done the fact was that the relation between these young persons abounded in such oddities as were not inaptly symbolised by assignations that had a good deal more appearance than motive of the strength of the tie that held them we shall sufficiently take the measure but it was meanwhile almost obvious that if the great possibility had come up for them it had done so to an exceptional degree under the protection of the famous law of contraries any deep harmony that might eventually govern them would not be the result of their having much in commonhaving anything in fact but their affection and would really find its explanation in some sense on the part of each of being poor where the other was rich it is nothing new indeed that generous young persons often admire most what nature hasnt given themfrom which it would appear after all that our friends were both generous  merton densher had repeatedly said to himselfand from far backthat he should be a fool not to marry a woman whose value would be in her differences and kate croy though without having quite so philosophised had quickly recognised in the young man a precious unlikeness he represented what her life had never given her and certainly without some such aid as his never would give her all the high dim things she lumped together as of the mind it was on the side of the mind that densher was rich for her and mysterious and strong and he had rendered her in especial the sovereign service of making that element real she had had all her days to take it terribly on trust no creature she had ever encountered having been able in any degree to testify for it directly vague rumours of its existence had made their precarious way to her but nothing had on the whole struck her as more likely than that she should live and die without the chance to verify them the chance had comeit was an extraordinary oneon the day she first met densher and it was to the girls lasting honour that she knew on the spot what she was in the presence of that occasion indeed for everything that straightway flowered in it would be worthy of high commemoration denshers perception went out to meet the young womans and quite kept pace with her own recognition having so often concluded on the fact of his weakness as he called it for lifehis strength merely for thoughtlife he logically opined was what he must somehow arrange to annex and possess this was so much a necessity that thought by itself only went on in the void it was from the immediate air of life that it must draw its breath so the young man ingenious but large critical but ardent too made out both his case and kate croys they had originally met before her mothers deathan occasion marked for her as the last pleasure permitted by the approach of that event after which the dark months had interposed a screen and for all kate knew made the end one with the beginning  the beginningto which she often went backhad been a scene for our young woman of supreme brilliancy a party given at a gallery hired by a hostess who fished with big nets a spanish dancer understood to be at that moment the delight of the town an american reciter the joy of a kindred people an hungarian fiddler the wonder of the world at largein the name of these and other attractions the company in which by a rare privilege kate found herself had been freely convoked she lived under her mothers roof as she considered obscurely and was acquainted with few persons who entertained on that scale but she had had dealings with two or three connected as appeared with suchtwo or three through whom the stream of hospitality filtered or diffused could thus now and then spread to outlying receptacles a goodnatured lady in fine a friend of her mother and a relative of the lady of the gallery had offered to take her to the party in question and had there fortified her further with two or three of those introductions that at large parties lead to other thingsthat had at any rate on this occasion culminated for her in conversation with a tall fair slightly unbrushed and rather awkward but on the whole not dreary young man the young man had affected her as detached asit was indeed what he called himselfawfully at sea as much more distinct from what surrounded them than any one else appeared to be and even as probably quite disposed to be making his escape when pulled up to be placed in relation with her he gave her his word for it indeed that same evening that only their meeting had prevented his flight but that now he saw how sorry he should have been to miss it this point they had reached by midnight and though in respect to such remarks everything was in the tone the tone was by midnight there too she had had originally her full apprehension of his coerced certainly of his vague conditionfull apprehensions often being with her immediate then she had had her equal consciousness that within five minutes something between them hadwell she couldnt call it anything but come it was nothing but it was somehow everythingit was that something for each of them had happened  they had found themselves looking at each other straight and for a longer time on end than was usual even at parties in galleries but that after all would have been a small affair if there hadnt been something else with it it wasnt in a word simply that their eyes had met other conscious organs faculties feelers had met as well and when kate afterwards imaged to herself the sharp deep fact she saw it in the oddest way as a particular performance she had observed a ladder against a garden wall and had trusted herself so to climb it as to be able to see over into the probable garden on the other side on reaching the top she had found herself face to face with a gentleman engaged in a like calculation at the same moment and the two inquirers had remained confronted on their ladders the great point was that for the rest of that evening they had been perchedthey had not climbed down and indeed during the time that followed kate at least had had the perched feelingit was as if she were there aloft without a retreat a simpler expression of all this is doubtless but that they had taken each other in with interest and without a happy hazard six months later the incident would have closed in that account of it the accident meanwhile had been as natural as anything in london ever is kate had one afternoon found herself opposite mr densher on the underground railway she had entered the train at sloane square to go to queens road and the carriage in which she had found a place was all but full densher was already in iton the other bench and at the furthest angle she was sure of him before they had again started the day and the hour were darkness there were six other persons and she had been busy placing herself but her consciousness had gone to him as straight as if they had come together in some bright level of the desert they had on neither part a seconds hesitation they looked across the choked compartment exactly as if she had known he would be there and he had expected her to come in so that though in the conditions they could only exchange the greeting of movements smiles silence it would have been quite in the key of these passages that they should have alighted for ease at the very next station kate was in fact sure that the very next station was the young mans true goalwhich made it clear that he was going on only from the wish to speak to her he had to go on for this purpose to high street kensington as it was not till then that the exit of a passenger gave him his chance  his chance put him however in quick possession of the seat facing her the alertness of his capture of which seemed to show her his impatience it helped them moreover with strangers on either side little to talk though this very restriction perhaps made such a mark for them as nothing else could have done if the fact that their opportunity had again come round for them could be so intensely expressed between them without a word they might very well feel on the spot that it had not come round for nothing the extraordinary part of the matter was that they were not in the least meeting where they had left off but ever so much further on and that these added links added still another between high street and notting hill gate and then between the latter station and queens road an extension really inordinate at notting hill gate kates righthand neighbour descended whereupon densher popped straight into that seat only there was not much gained when a lady the next instant popped into denshers he could say almost nothing to hershe scarce knew at least what he said she was so occupied with a certainty that one of the persons opposite a youngish man with a single eyeglass which he kept constantly in position had made her out from the first as visibly as strangely affected if such a person made her out what then did densher doa question in truth sufficiently answered when on their reaching her station he instantly followed her out of the train that had been the real beginningthe beginning of everything else the other time the time at the party had been but the beginning of that never in life before had she so let herself go for always beforeso far as small adventures could have been in question for herthere had been by the vulgar measure more to go upon he had walked with her to lancaster gate and then she had walked with him away from itfor all the world she said to herself like the housemaid giggling to the baker  this appearance she was afterwards to feel had been all in order for a relation that might precisely best be described in the terms of the baker and the housemaid she could say to herself that from that hour they had kept company that had come to represent technically speaking alike the range and the limit of their tie he had on the spot naturally asked leave to call upon herwhich as a young person who wasnt really young who didnt pretend to be a sheltered flower she as rationally gave thatshe was promptly clear about itwas now her only possible basis she was just the contemporary london female highly modern inevitably battered honourably free she had of course taken her aunt straight into her confidencehad gone through the form of asking her leave and she subsequently remembered that though on this occasion she had left the history of her new alliance as scant as the facts themselves mrs lowder had struck her at the time surprisingly mild it had been in every way the occasion full of the reminder that her hostess was deep it was definitely then that she had begun to ask herself what aunt maud was in vulgar parlance up to you may receive my dear whom you likethat was what aunt maud who in general objected to peoples doing as they liked had replied and it bore this unexpectedness a good deal of looking into there were many explanations and they were all amusingamusing that is in the line of the sombre and brooding amusement cultivated by kate in her actual high retreat merton densher came the very next sunday but mrs lowder was so consistently magnanimous as to make it possible to her niece to see him alone she saw him however on the sunday following in order to invite him to dinner and when after dining he came againwhich he did three times she found means to treat his visit as preponderantly to herself kates conviction that she didnt like him made that remarkable it added to the evidence by this time voluminous that she was remarkable all round if she had been in the way of energy merely usual she would have kept her dislike direct whereas it was now as if she were seeking to know him in order to see best where to have him that was one of the reflections made in our young womans high retreat she smiled from her lookout in the silence that was only the fact of hearing irrelevant sounds as she caught the truth that you could easily accept people when you wanted them so to be delivered to you when aunt maud wished them despatched it was not to be done by deputy it was clearly always a matter reserved for her own hand but what made the girl wonder most was the implications of so much diplomacy in respect to her own value what view might she take of her position in the light of this appearance that her companion feared so as yet to upset her it was as if densher were accepted partly under the dread that if he hadnt been she would act in resentment hadnt her aunt considered the danger that she would in that case have broken off have seceded the danger was exaggeratedshe would have done nothing so gross but that it seemed was the way mrs lowder saw her and believed her to be reckoned with what importance therefore did she really attach to her what strange interest could she take on their keeping on terms her father and her sister had their answer to thiseven without knowing how the question struck her they saw the lady of lancaster gate as panting to make her fortune and the explanation of that appetite was that on the accident of a nearer view than she had before enjoyed she had been charmed been dazzled they approved they admired in her one of the belated fancies of rich capricious violent old womenthe more marked moreover because the result of no plot and they piled up the possible results for the person concerned kate knew what to think of her own power thus to carry by storm she saw herself as handsome no doubt but as hard and felt herself as clever but as cold and as so much too imperfectly ambitious furthermore that it was a pity for a quiet life she couldnt settle to be either finely or stupidly indifferent her intelligence sometimes kept her stilltoo stillbut her want of it was restless so that she got the good it seemed to her of neither extreme she saw herself at present none the less in a situation and even her sad disillusioned mother dying but with aunt maud interviewing the nurse on the stairs had not failed to remind her that it was of the essence of situations to be under providence worked the dear woman had died in the belief that she was actually working the one then produced  kate took one of her walks with densher just after her visit to mr croy but most of it went as usual to their sitting in talk they had under the trees by the lake the air of old friendsphases of apparent earnestness in particular in which they might have been settling every question in their vast young world and periods of silence side by side perhaps even more when a long engagement would have been the final reading of the signs on the part of a passer struck with them as it was so easy to be they would have presented themselves thus as very old friends rather than as young persons who had met for the first time but a year before and had spent most of the interval without contact it was indeed for each already as if they were older friends and though the succession of their meetings might between them have been straightened out they only had a confused sense of a good many very much alike and a confused intention of a good many more as little different as possible the desire to keep them just as they were had perhaps to do with the fact that in spite of the presumed diagnosis of the stranger there had been for them as yet no formal no final understanding densher had at the very first pressed the question but that it had been easy to reply was too soon so that a singular thing had afterwards happened they had accepted their acquaintance as too short for an engagement but they had treated it as long enough for almost anything else and marriage was somehow before them like a temple without an avenue they belonged to the temple and they met in the grounds they were in the stage at which grounds in general offered much scattered refreshment but kate had meanwhile had so few confidants that she wondered at the source of her fathers suspicions the diffusion of rumour was of course in london remarkable and for marian not lessas aunt maud touched neither directlythe mystery had worked no doubt she had been seen of course she had been seen she had taken no trouble not to be seen and it was a thing clearly she was incapable of taking but she had been seen howand what was there to see she was in loveshe knew that but it was wholly her own business and she had the sense of having conducted herself of still so doing with almost violent conformity  ive an ideain fact i feel surethat aunt maud means to write to you and i think you had better know it so much as this she said to him as soon as they met but immediately adding to it so as to make up your mind how to take her i know pretty well what shell say to you  then will you kindly tell me  she thought a little i cant do that i should spoil it shell do the best for her own idea  her idea you mean that im a sort of a scoundrel or at the best not good enough for you  they were side by side again in their penny chairs and kate had another pause not good enough for her  oh i see and thats necessary  he put it as a truth rather more than as a question but there had been plenty of truths between them that each had contradicted kate however let this one sufficiently pass only saying the next moment she has behaved extraordinarily  and so have we densher declared i think you know weve been awfully decent  for ourselves for each other for people in general yes but not for her for her said kate weve been monstrous she has been giving us rope so if she does send for you the girl repeated you must know where you are  that i always know its where you are that concerns me  well said kate after an instant her idea of that is what youll have from her he gave her a long look and whatever else people who wouldnt let her alone might have wished for her advancement his long looks were the thing in the world she could never have enough of what she felt was that whatever might happen she must keep them must make them most completely her possession and it was already strange enough that she reasoned or at all events began to act as if she might work them in with other and alien things privately cherish them and yet as regards the rigour of it pay no price she looked it well in the face she took it intensely home that they were lovers she rejoiced to herself and frankly to him in their wearing of the name but distinguished creature that in her way she was she took a view of this character that scarce squared with the conventional the character itself she insisted on as their right taking that so for granted that it didnt seem even bold but densher though he agreed with her found himself moved to wonder at her simplifications her values life might prove difficultwas evidently going to but meanwhile they had each other and that was everything this was her reasoning but meanwhile for him each other was what they didnt have and it was just the point repeatedly however it was a point that in the face of strange and special things he judged it rather awkwardly gross to urge it was impossible to keep mrs lowder out of their scheme she stood there too close to it and too solidly it had to open a gate at a given point do what they would to take her in and she came in always while they sat together rather helplessly watching her as in a coachinfour she drove round their prospect as the principal lady at the circus drives round the ring and she stopped the coach in the middle to alight with majesty it was our young mans sense that she was magnificently vulgar but yet quite that this wasnt all it wasnt with her vulgarity that she felt his want of means though that might have helped her richly to embroider it nor was it with the same infirmity that she was strong original dangerous  his want of meansof means sufficient for anyone but himselfwas really the great ugliness and was moreover at no time more ugly for him than when it rose there as it did seem to rise shameless face to face with the elements in kates life colloquially and conveniently classed by both of them as funny he sometimes indeed for that matter asked himself if these elements were as funny as the innermost fact so often vivid to him of his own consciousnesshis private inability to believe he should ever be rich his conviction on this head was in truth quite positive and a thing by itself he failed after analysis to understand it though he had naturally more lights on it than any one else he knew how it subsisted in spite of an equal consciousness of his being neither mentally nor physically quite helpless neither a dunce nor a cripple he knew it to be absolute though secret and also strange to say about common undertakings not discouraging not prohibitive only now was he having to think if it were prohibitive in respect to marriage only now for the first time had he to weigh his case in scales the scales as he sat with kate often dangled in the line of his vision he saw them large and black while he talked or listened take in the bright air singular positions sometimes the right was down and sometimes the left never a happy equipoiseone or the other always kicking the beam thus was kept before him the question of whether it were more ignoble to ask a woman to take her chance with you or to accept it from ones conscience that her chance could be at the best but one of the degrees of privation whether too otherwise marrying for money mightnt after all be a smaller cause of shame than the mere dread of marrying without through these variations of mood and view all the same the mark on his forehead stood clear he saw himself remain without whether he married or not it was a line on which his fancy could be admirably active the innumerable ways of making money were beautifully present to him he could have handled them for his newspaper as easily as he handled everything he was quite aware how he handled everything it was another mark on his forehead the pair of smudges from the thumb of fortune the brand on the passive fleece dated from the primal hour and kept each other company he wrote as for print with deplorable ease since there had been nothing to stop him even at the age of ten so there was as little at twenty it was part of his fate in the first place and part of the wretched publics in the second the innumerable ways of making money were no doubt at all events what his imagination often was busy with after he had tilted his chair and thrown back his head with his hands clasped behind it what would most have prolonged that attitude moreover was the reflection that the ways were ways only for others within the minute nowhowever this might behe was aware of a nearer view than he had yet quite had of those circumstances on his companions part that made least for simplicity of relation he saw above all how she saw them herself for she spoke of them at present with the last frankness telling him of her visit to her father and giving him in an account of her subsequent scene with her sister an instance of how she was perpetually reduced to patching up in one way or another that unfortunate womans hopes  the tune she exclaimed to which were a failure as a family with which he had it again all from herand this time as it seemed to him more than all the dishonour her father had brought them his folly and cruelty and wickedness the wounded state of her mother abandoned despoiled and helpless yet for the management of such a home as remained to them dreadfully unreasonable too the extinction of her two young brothersone at nineteen the eldest of the house by typhoid fever contracted at a poisonous little place as they had afterwards found out that they had taken for a summer the other the flower of the flock a middy on the britannia dreadfully drowned and not even by an accident at sea but by cramp unrescued while bathing too late in the autumn in a wretched little river during a holiday visit to the home of a shipmate then marians unnatural marriage in itself a kind of spiritless turning of the other cheek to fortune her actual wretchedness and plaintiveness her greasy children her impossible claims her odious visitorsthese things completed the proof of the heaviness for them all of the hand of fate kate confessedly described them with an excess of impatience it was much of her charm for densher that she gave in general that turn to her descriptions partly as if to amuse him by free and humorous colour partlyand that charm was the greatestas if to work off for her own relief her constant perception of the incongruity of things she had seen the general show too early and too sharply and she was so intelligent that she knew it and allowed for that misfortune therefore when in talk with him she was violent and almost unfeminine it was almost as if they had settled for intercourse on the short cut of the fantastic and the happy language of exaggeration it had come to be definite between them at a primary stage that if they could have no other straight way the realm of thought at least was open to them they could think whatever they liked about whatever they wouldor in other words they could say it saying it for each other for each other alone only of course added to the taste the implication was thereby constant that what they said when not together had no taste for them at all and nothing could have served more to launch them at special hours on their small floating island than such an assumption that they were only making believe everywhere else our young man it must be added was conscious enough that it was kate who profited most by this particular play of the fact of intimacy it always seemed to him that she had more life than he to react from and when she recounted the dark disasters of her house and glanced at the hard odd offset of her present exaltationsince as exaltation it was apparently to be consideredhe felt his own grey domestic annals to make little show it was naturally in all such reference the question of her fathers character that engaged him most but her picture of her adventure in chirk street gave him a sense of how little as yet that character was clear to him what was it to speak plainly that mr croy had originally done  i dont knowand i dont want to i only know that years and years agowhen i was about fifteensomething or other happened that made him impossible i mean impossible for the world at large first and then little by little for mother we of course didnt know it at the time kate explained but we knew it later and it was oddly enough my sister who first made out that he had done something i can hear her nowthe way one cold black sunday morning when on account of an extraordinary fog we had not gone to church she broke it to me by the schoolroom fire i was reading a historybook by the lampwhen we didnt go to church we had to read historybooksand i suddenly heard her say out of the fog which was in the room and apropos of nothing papa has done something wicked and the curious thing was that i believed it on the spot and have believed it ever since though she could tell me nothing moreneither what was the wickedness nor how she knew nor what would happen to him nor anything else about it we had our sense always that all sorts of things had happened were all the while happening to him so that when marian only said she was sure tremendously sure that she had made it out for herself but that that was enough i took her word for itit seemed somehow so natural we were not however to ask motherwhich made it more natural still and i said never a word but mother strangely enough spoke of it to me in time of her own accord very much later on he hadnt been with us for ever so long but we were used to that she must have had some fear some conviction that i had an idea some idea of her own that it was the best thing to do she came out as abruptly as marian had done if you hear anything against your fatheranything i mean except that hes odious and vileremember its perfectly false that was the way i knewit was true though i recall that i said to her then that i of course knew it wasnt she might have told me it was true and yet have trusted me to contradict fiercely enough any accusation of him that i should meetto contradict it much more fiercely and effectively i think than she would have done herself as it happens however the girl went on ive never had occasion and ive been conscious of it with a sort of surprise it has made the world at times seem more decent no one has so much as breathed to me that has been a part of the silence the silence that surrounds him the silence that for the world has washed him out he doesnt exist for people and yet im as sure as ever in fact though i know no more than i did then im more sure and that she wound up is what i sit here and tell you about my own father if you dont call it a proof of confidence i dont know what will satisfy you  it satisfies me beautifully densher declared but it doesnt my dear child very greatly enlighten me you dont you know really tell me anything its so vague that what am i to think but that you may very well be mistaken what has he done if no one can name it  he has done everything  oheverything everythings nothing  well then said kate he has done some particular thing its knownonly thank god not to us but it has been the end of him you could doubtless find out with a little trouble you can ask about  densher for a moment said nothing but the next moment he made it up i wouldnt find out for the world and id rather lose my tongue than put a question  and yet its a part of me said kate  a part of you  my fathers dishonour then she sounded for him but more deeply than ever yet her note of proud still pessimism how can such a thing as that not be the great thing in ones life  she had to take from him again on this one of his long looks and she took it to its deepest its headiest dregs i shall ask you for the great thing in your life he said to depend on me a little more after which just hesitating doesnt he belong to some club he inquired  she had a grave headshake he used toto many  but he has dropped them  theyve dropped him of that im sure it ought to do for you i offered him the girl immediately continuedand it was for that i went to himto come and be with him make a home for him so far as is possible but he wont hear of it  densher took this in with visible but generous wonder you offered himimpossible as you describe him to meto live with him and share his disadvantages the young man saw for the moment but the high beauty of it you are gallant  because it strikes you as being brave for him she wouldnt in the least have this it wasnt courageit was the opposite i did it to save myselfto escape  he had his air so constant at this stage as of her giving him finer things than any one to think about escape from what  from everything  do you by any chance mean from me  no i spoke to him of you told himor what amounted to itthat i would bring you if he would allow it with me  but he wont allow it said densher  wont hear of it on any terms he wont help me wont save me wont hold out a finger to me kate went on he simply wriggles away in his inimitable manner and throws me back  back then after all thank goodness densher concurred on me  but she spoke again as with the sole vision of the whole scene she had evoked its a pity because youd like him hes wonderfulhes charming her companion gave one of the laughs that marked in him again his feeling in her tone inveterately something that banished the talk of other women so far as he knew other women to the dull desert of the conventional and she had already continued he would make himself delightful to you  even while objecting to me  well he likes to please the girl explainedpersonally he would appreciate you and be clever with you its to me he objectsthat is as to my liking you  heaven be praised then densher exclaimed that you like me enough for the objection  but she met it after an instant with some inconsequence i dont i offered to give you up if necessary to go to him but it made no difference and thats what i mean she pursued by his declining me on any terms the point is you see that i dont escape  densher wondered but if you didnt wish to escape me  i wished to escape aunt maud but he insists that its through her and through her only that i may help him just as marian insists that its through her and through her only that i can help her thats what i mean she again explained by their turning me back  the young man thought your sister turns you back too  oh with a push  but have you offered to live with your sister  i would in a moment if shed have me thats all my virtuea narrow little family feeling ive a small stupid pietyi dont know what to call it kate bravely sustained it she made it out sometimes alone ive to smother my shrieks when i think of my poor mother she went through thingsthey pulled her down i know what they were nowi didnt then for i was a pig and my position compared with hers is an insolence of success thats what marian keeps before me thats what papa himself as i say so inimitably does my positions a value a great value for them bothshe followed and followed lucid and ironic she knew no merciful muddle its the valuethe only one they have  everything between our young couple moved today in spite of their pauses their margin to a quicker measurethe quickness and anxiety playing lightninglike in the sultriness densher watched decidedly as he had never done before and the fact you speak of holds you  of course it holds me its a perpetual sound in my ears it makes me ask myself if ive any right to personal happiness any right to anything but to be as rich and overflowing as smart and shining as i can be made  densher had a pause oh you might with good luck have the personal happiness too  her immediate answer to this was a silence like his own after which she gave him straight in the face but quite simply and quietly darling  it took him another moment then he was also quiet and simple will you settle it by our being married tomorrowas we can with perfect ease civilly  let us wait to arrange it kate presently replied till after youve seen her  do you call that adoring me densher demanded  they were talking for the time with the strangest mixture of deliberation and directness and nothing could have been more in the tone of it than the way she at last said youre afraid of her yourself  he gave a smile a trifle glassy for young persons of a great distinction and a very high spirit were a caution  yes she took it straight up were hideously intelligent but theres fun in it too we must get our fun where we can i think she added and for that matter not without courage our relations beautiful its not a bit vulgar i cling to some saving romance in things  it made him break into a laugh which had more freedom than his smile how you must be afraid youll chuck me  no no that would be vulgar but of course i do see my danger she admitted of doing something base  then what can be so base as sacrificing me  i shant sacrifice you dont cry out till youre hurt i shall sacrifice nobody and nothing and thats just my situation that i want and that i shall try for everything that she wound up is how i see myself and how i see you quite as much acting for them  for them and the young man strongly extravagantly marked his coldness thank you  dont you care for them  why should i what are they to me but a serious nuisance  as soon as he had permitted himself this qualification of the unfortunate persons she so perversely cherished he repented of his roughnessand partly because he expected a flash from her but it was one of her finest sides that she sometimes flashed with a mere mild glow i dont see why you dont make out a little more that if we avoid stupidity we may do all we may keep her  he stared make her pension us  well wait at least till we have seen  he thought seen what can be got out of her  kate for a moment said nothing after all i never asked her never when our troubles were at the worst appealed to her nor went near her she fixed upon me herself settled on me with her wonderful gilded claws  you speak densher observed as if she were a vulture  call it an eaglewith a gilded beak as well and with wings for great flights if shes a thing of the air in shortsay at once a ballooni never myself got into her car i was her choice  it had really her sketch of the affair a high colour and a great style at all of which he gazed a minute as at a picture by a master what she must see in you  wonders and speaking it loud she stood straight up everything there it is  yes there it was and as she remained before him he continued to face it so that what you mean is that im to do my part in somehow squaring her  see her see her kate said with impatience  and grovel to her  ah do what you like and she walked in her impatience away   iv  his eyes had followed her at this time quite long enough before he overtook her to make out more than ever in the poise of her head the pride of her stephe didnt know what best to call ita part at least of mrs lowders reasons he consciously winced while he figured his presenting himself as a reason opposed to these though at the same moment with the source of aunt mauds inspiration thus before him he was prepared to conform by almost any abject attitude or profitable compromise to his companions easy injunction he would do as she likedhis own liking might come off as it would he would help her to the utmost of his power for all the rest of that day and the next her easy injunction tossed off that way as she turned her beautiful back was like the crack of a great whip in the blue air the high element in which mrs lowder hung he wouldnt grovel perhapshe wasnt quite ready for that but he would be patient ridiculous reasonable unreasonable and above all deeply diplomatic he would be clever with all his clevernesswhich he now shook hard as he sometimes shook his poor dear shabby old watch to start it up again it wasnt thank goodness as if there werent plenty of that and with what they could muster between them it would be little to the credit of their star however pale that defeat and surrendersurrender so early so immediateshould have to ensue it was not indeed that he thought of that disaster as at the worst a direct sacrifice of their possibilities he imagedit which was enough as some proved vanity some exposed fatuity in the idea of bringing mrs lowder round when shortly afterwards in this ladys vast drawingroomthe apartments at lancaster gate had struck him from the first as of prodigious extenthe awaited her at her request conveyed in a replypaid telegram his theory was that of their still clinging to their idea though with a sense of the difficulty of it really enlarged to the scale of the place  he had the place for a long timeit seemed to him a quarter of an hourto himself and while aunt maud kept him and kept him while observation and reflection crowded on him he asked himself what was to be expected of a person who could treat one like that the visit the hour were of her own proposing so that her delay no doubt was but part of a general plan of putting him to inconvenience as he walked to and fro however taking in the message of her massive florid furniture the immense expression of her signs and symbols he had as little doubt of the inconvenience he was prepared to suffer he found himself even facing the thought that he had nothing to fall back on and that that was as great a humiliation in a good cause as a proud man could desire it had not yet been so distinct to him that he made no showliterally not the smallest so complete a show seemed made there all about him so almost abnormally affirmative so aggressively erect were the huge heavy objects that syllabled his hostess story when alls said and done you know shes colossally vulgarhe had once all but said that of mrs lowder to her niece only just keeping it back at the last keeping it to himself with all its danger about it it mattered because it bore so directly and he at all events quite felt it a thing that kate herself would some day bring out to him it bore directly at present and really all the more that somehow strangely it didnt in the least imply that aunt maud was dull or stale she was vulgar with freshness almost with beauty since there was beauty to a degree in the play of so big and bold a temperament she was in fine quite the largest possible quantity to deal with and he was in the cage of the lioness without his whipthe whip in a word of a supply of proper retorts he had no retort but that he loved the girlwhich in such a house as that was painfully cheap kate had mentioned to him more than once that her aunt was passionate speaking of it as a kind of offset and uttering it as with a capital p marking it as something that he might that he in fact ought to turn about in some way to their advantage he wondered at this hour to what advantage he could turn it but the case grew less simple the longer he waited decidedly there was something he hadnt enough of he stood as one fast  his slow march to and fro seemed to give him the very measure as he paced and paced the distance it became the desert of his poverty at the sight of which expanse moreover he could pretend to himself as little as before that the desert looked redeemable lancaster gate looked richthat was all the effect which it was unthinkable that any state of his own should ever remotely resemble he read more vividly more critically as has been hinted the appearances about him and they did nothing so much as make him wonder at his aesthetic reaction he hadnt knownand in spite of kates repeated reference to her own rebellions of tastethat he should mind so much how an independent lady might decorate her house it was the language of the house itself that spoke to him writing out for him with surpassing breadth and freedom the associations and conceptions the ideals and possibilities of the mistress never he flattered himself had he seen anything so gregariously uglyoperatively ominously so cruel he was glad to have found this last name for the whole character cruel somehow played into the subject for an articlethat his impression put straight into his mind he would write about the heavy horrors that could still flourish that lifted their undiminished heads in an age so proud of its short way with false gods and it would be funny if what he should have got from mrs lowder were to prove after all but a small amount of copy yet the great thing really the dark thing was that even while he thought of the quick column he might add up he felt it less easy to laugh at the heavy horrors than to quail before them he couldnt describe and dismiss them collectively call them either midvictorian or early not being at all sure they were rangeable under one rubric it was only manifest they were splendid and were furthermore conclusively british they constituted an order and they abounded in rare materialprecious woods metals stuffs stones he had never dreamed of anything so fringed and scalloped so buttoned and corded drawn everywhere so tight and curled everywhere so thick he had never dreamed of so much gilt and glass so much satin and plush so much rosewood and marble and malachite but it was above all the solid forms the wasted finish the misguided cost the general attestation of morality and money a good conscience and a big balance these things finally represented for him a portentous negation of his own world of thoughtof which for that matter in the presence of them he became as for the first time hopelessly aware they revealed it to him by their merciless difference his interview with aunt maud none the less took by no means the turn he had expected passionate though her nature no doubt mrs lowder on this occasion neither threatened nor appealed her arms of aggression her weapons of defence were presumably close at hand but she left them untouched and unmentioned and was in fact so bland that he properly perceived only afterwards how adroit she had been he properly perceived something else as well which complicated his case he shouldnt have known what to call it if he hadnt called it her really imprudent goodnature her blandness in other words was not mere policyhe wasnt dangerous enough for policy it was the result he could see of her fairly liking him a little from the moment she did that she herself became more interesting and who knew what might happen should he take to liking her well it was a risk he naturally must face she fought him at any rate but with one hand with a few loose grains of stray powder he recognised at the end of ten minutes and even without her explaining it that if she had made him wait it had not been to wound him they had by that time almost directly met on the fact of her intention she had wanted him to think for himself of what she proposed to say to himnot having otherwise announced it wanted to let it come home to him on the spot as she had shrewdly believed it would her first question on appearing had practically been as to whether he hadnt taken her hint and this inquiry assumed so many things that it made discussion immediately frank and large he knew with the question put that the hint was just what he had taken knew that she had made him quickly forgive her the display of her power knew that if he didnt take care he should understand her and the strength of her purpose to say nothing of that of her imagination nothing of the length of her purse only too well yet he pulled himself up with the thought too that he was not going to be afraid of understanding her he was just going to understand and understand without detriment to the feeblest even of his passions the play of ones mind let one in at the best dreadfully in action in the need of action where simplicity was all but when one couldnt prevent it the thing was to make it complete there would never be mistakes but for the original fun of mistakes what he must use his fatal intelligence for was to resist mrs lowder meanwhile might use it for whatever she liked  it was after she had begun her statement of her own idea about kate that he began on his side to reflect thatwith her manner of offering it as really sufficient if he would take the trouble to embraceit she couldnt half hate him that was all positively she seemed to show herself for the time as attempting clearly if she did her intention justice she would have nothing more disagreeable to do if i hadnt been ready to go very much further you understand i wouldnt have gone so far i dont care what you repeat to herthe more you repeat to her perhaps the better and at any rate theres nothing she doesnt already know i dont say it for her i say it for youwhen i want to reach my niece i know how to do it straight so aunt maud delivered herselfas with homely benevolence in the simplest but the clearest terms virtually conveying that though a word to the wise was doubtless in spite of the advantage not always enough a word to the good could never fail to be the sense our young man read into her words was that she liked him because he was goodwas really by her measure good enough good enough that is to give up her niece for her and go his way in peace but was he good enoughby his own measure he fairly wondered while she more fully expressed herself if it might be his doom to prove so shes the finest possible creatureof course you flatter yourself that you know it but i know it quite as well as you possibly canby which i mean a good deal better yet and the tune to which im ready to prove my faith compares favourably enough i think with anything you can do i dont say it because shes my niecethats nothing to me i might have had fifty nieces and i wouldnt have brought one of them to this place if i hadnt found her to my taste i dont say i wouldnt have done something else but i wouldnt have put up with her presence kates presence by good fortune i marked early kates presenceunluckily for youis everything i could possibly wish kates presence is in short as fine as you know and ive been keeping it for the comfort of my declining years ive watched it long ive been saving it up and letting it as you say of investments appreciate and you may judge whether now it has begun to pay so im likely to consent to treat for it with any but a high bidder i can do the best with her and ive my idea of the best  oh i quite conceive said densher that your idea of the best isnt me  it was an oddity of mrs lowders that her face in speech was like a lighted window at night but that silence immediately drew the curtain the occasion for reply allowed by her silence was never easy to take yet she was still less easy to interrupt the great glaze of her surface at all events gave her visitor no present help i didnt ask you to come to hear what it isnti asked you to come to hear what it is  of course densher laughed its very great indeed  his hostess went on as if his contribution to the subject were barely relevant i want to see her high high uphigh up and in the light  ah you naturally want to marry her to a duke and are eager to smooth away any hitch  she gave him so on this the mere effect of the drawn blind that it quite forced him at first into the sense possibly just of having affected her as flip pant perhaps even as low he had been looked at so in blighted moments of presumptuous youth by big cold public men but never so far as he could recall by any private lady more than anything yet it gave him the measure of his companions subtlety and thereby of kates possible career dont be too impossiblehe feared from his friend for a moment some such answer as that and then felt as she spoke otherwise as if she were letting him off easily i want her to marry a great man that was all but more and more it was enough and if it hadnt been her next words would have made it so and i think of her what i think there you are  they sat for a little face to face upon it and he was conscious of something deeper still of something she wished him to understand if he only would to that extent she did appealappealed to the intelligence she desired to show she believed him to possess he was meanwhile at all events not the man wholly to fail of comprehension of course im aware how little i can answer to any fond proud dream youve a viewa magnificent one into which i perfectly enter i thoroughly understand what im not and im much obliged to you for not reminding me of it in any rougher way she said nothingshe kept that up it might even have been to let him go further if he was capable of it in the way of poorness of spirit it was one of those cases in which a man couldnt show if he showed at all save for poor unless indeed he preferred to show for asinine it was the plain truth he wason mrs lowders basis the only one in questiona very small quantity and he did know damnably what made quantities large he desired to be perfectly simple yet in the midst of that effort a deeper apprehension throbbed aunt maud clearly conveyed it though he couldnt later on have said how you dont really matter i believe so much as you think and im not going to make you a martyr by banishing you your performances with kate in the park are ridiculous so far as theyre meant as consideration for me and i had much rather see you myselfsince youre in your way my dear young man delightfuland arrange with you count with you as i easily as i perfectly should do you suppose me so stupid as to quarrel with you if its not really necessary it wontit would be too absurdbe necessary i can bite your head off any day any day i really open my mouth and im dealing with you now seeand successfully judgewithout opening it i do things handsomely all roundi place you in the presence of the plan with which from the moment its a case of taking you seriously youre incompatible come then as near it as you like walk all round itdont be afraid youll hurt itand live on with it before you  he afterwards felt that if she hadnt absolutely phrased all this it was because she so soon made him out as going with her far enough he was so pleasantly affected by her asking no promise of him her not proposing he should pay for her indulgence by his word of honour not to interfere that he gave her a kind of general assurance of esteem immediately afterwards then he spoke of these things to kate and what then came back to him first of all was the way he had said to herhe mentioned it to the girlvery much as one of a pair of lovers says in a rupture by mutual consent i hope immensely of course that youll always regard me as a friend this had perhaps been going farhe submitted it all to kate but really there had been so much in it that it was to be looked at as they might say wholly in its own light other things than those we have presented had come up before the close of his scene with aunt maud but this matter of her not treating him as a peril of the first order easily predominated there was moreover plenty to talk about on the occasion of his subsequent passage with our young woman it having been put to him abruptly the night before that he might give himself a lift and do his newspaper a serviceso flatteringly was the case expressedby going for fifteen or twenty weeks to america the idea of a series of letters from the united states from the strictly social point of view had for some time been nursed in the inner sanctuary at whose door he sat and the moment was now deemed happy for letting it loose the imprisoned thought had in a word on the opening of the door flown straight out into denshers face or perched at least on his shoulder making him look up in surprise from his mere inky officetable his account of the matter to kate was that he couldnt refusenot being in a position as yet to refuse anything but that his being chosen for such an errand confounded his sense of proportion he was definite as to his scarce knowing how to measure the honour which struck him as equivocal he had not quite supposed himself the man for the class of job this confused consciousness he intimated he had promptly enough betrayed to his manager with the effect however of seeing the question surprisingly clear up what it came to was that the sort of twaddle that was not in his chords was unexpectedly just what they happened this time not to want they wanted his letters for queer reasons about as good as he could let them come he was to play his own little tune and not be afraid that was the whole point  it would have been the whole that is had there not been a sharper one still in the circumstance that he was to start at once his mission as they called it at the office would probably be over by the end of june which was desirable but to bring that about he must now not lose a week his inquiries he understood were to cover the whole ground and there were reasons of statereasons operating at the seat of empire in fleet streetwhy the nail should be struck on the head densher made no secret to kate of his having asked for a day to decide and his account of that matter was that he felt he owed it to her to speak to her first she assured him on this that nothing so much as that scruple had yet shown her how they were bound together she was clearly proud of his letting a thing of such importance depend on her but she was clearer still as to his instant duty she rejoiced in his prospect and urged him to his task she should miss him intenselyof course she should miss him but she made so little of it that she spoke with jubilation of what he would see and would do she made so much of this last quantity that he laughed at her innocence though also with scarce the heart to give her the real size of his drop in the daily bucket he was struck at the same time with her happy grasp of what had really occurred in fleet streetall the more that it was his own final reading he was to pull the subject upthat was just what they wanted and it would take more than all the united states together visit them each as he might to let him down it was just because he didnt nose about and wasnt the usual gossipmonger that they had picked him out it was a branch of their correspondence with which they evidently wished a new tone associated such a tone as from now on it would have always to take from his example  how you ought indeed when you understand so well to be a journalists wife densher exclaimed in admiration even while she struck him as fairly hurrying him off  but she was almost impatient of the praise what do you expect one not to understand when one cares for you  ah then ill put it otherwise and say how much you care for me  yes she assented it fairly redeems my stupidity i shall with a chance to show it she added have some imagination for you  she spoke of the future this time as so little contingent that he felt a queerness of conscience in making her the report that he presently arrived at on what had passed for him with the real arbiter of their destiny the way for that had been blocked a little by his news from fleet street but in the crucible of their happy discussion this element soon melted into the other and in the mixture that ensued the parts were not to be distinguished the young man moreover before taking his leave was to see why kate had just spoken of the future as if they now really possessed it and was to come to the vision by a devious way that deepened the final cheer their faces were turned to the illumined quarter as soon as he had answered her question in respect to the appearance of their being able to play a waiting game with success it was for the possibility of that appearance that she had a few days before so earnestly pressed him to see her aunt and if after his hour with that lady it had not struck densher that he had seen her to the happiest purpose the poor facts flushed with a better meaning as kate one by one took them up  if she consents to your coming why isnt that everything  it is everything everything she thinks it its the probabilityi mean as mrs lowder measures probabilitythat i may be prevented from becoming a complication for her by some arrangement any arrangement through which you shall see me often and easily shes sure of my want of money and that gives her time she believes in my having a certain amount of delicacy in my wishing to better my state before i put the pistol to your head in respect to sharing it the time that will take figures for her as the time that will help her if she doesnt spoil her chance by treating me badly she doesnt at all wish moreover densher went on to treat me badly for i believe upon my honour funny as it may sound to you that she personally rather likes me and that if you werent in question i might almost become her pet young man she doesnt disparage intellect and culturequite the contrary she wants them to adorn her board and be named in her programme and im sure it has sometimes cost her a real pang that i should be so desirable at once and so impossible he paused a moment and his companion then saw that a strange smile was in his facea smile as strange even as the adjunct in her own of this informing vision i quite suspect her of believing that if the truth were known she likes me literally better thandeep downyou yourself do wherefore she does me the honour to think that i may be safely left to kill my own cause there as i say comes in her margin im not the sort of stuff of romance that wears that washes that survives use that resists familiarity once in any degree admit that and your pride and prejudice will take care of the rest the pride fed full meanwhile by the system she means to practise with you and the prejudice excited by the comparison shell enable you to make from which i shall come off badly she likes me but shell never like me so much as when she succeeded a little better in making me look wretched for then youll like me less  kate showed for this evocation a due interest but no alarm and it was a little as if to pay his tender cynicism back in kind that she after an instant replied i see i see what an immense affair she must think me one was aware but you deepen the impression  i think youll make no mistake said densher in letting it go as deep as it will  he had given her indeed she made no scruple of showing plenty to consider her facing the music her making you boldly as welcome as you saythats an awfully big theory you know and worthy of all the other big things that in ones acquaintance with people give her a place so apart  oh shes grand the young man conceded shes on the scale altogether of the car of juggernaut which was a kind of image that came to me yesterday while i waited for her at lancaster gate the things in your drawingroom there were like the forms of the strange idols the mystic excrescences with which one may suppose the front of the car to bristle  yes arent they the girl returned and they had over all that aspect of their wonderful lady one of those deep and free interchanges that made everything but confidence a false note for them there were complications there were questions but they were so much more together than they were anything else kate uttered for a while no word of refutation of aunt mauds big diplomacy and they left it there as they would have left any other fine product for a monument to her powers but densher related further he had had in other respects too the car of juggernaut to face he omitted nothing from his account of his visit least of all the way aunt maud had frankly at lastthough indeed only under artful pressurefallen foul of his very type his want of the right marks his foreign accidents his queer antecedents she had told him he was but half a briton which he granted kate would have been dreadful if he hadnt so let himself in for it  i was really curious you see he explained to find out from her what sort of queer creature what sort of social anomaly in the light of such conventions as hers such an education as mine makes one pass for  kate said nothing for a little but then why should you care she asked  oh he laughed i like her so much and then for a man of my trade her views her spirit are essentially a thing to get hold of they belong to the great public mind that we meet at every turn and that we must keep setting up codes with besides he added i want to please her personally  ah yes we must please her personally his companion echoed and the words may represent all their definite recognition at the time of denshers politic gain they had in fact between this and his start for new york many matters to handle and the question he now touched upon came up for kate above all she looked at him as if he had really told her aunt more of his immediate personal story than he had ever told herself that if it were so was an accident and it put him for half an hour on as much of the picture of his early years abroad his migratory parents his swiss schools his german university as she had easy attention for a man he intimated a man of their world would have spotted him straight as to many of these points a man of their world so far as they had a world would have been through the english mill but it was none the less charming to make his confession to a woman women had in fact for such differences so much more imagination kate showed at present all his case could require when she had had it from beginning to end she declared that she now made out more than ever yet of what she loved him for she had herself as a child lived with some continuity in the world across the channel coming home again still a child and had participated after that in her teens in her mothers brief but repeated retreats to dresden to florence to biarritz weak and expensive attempts at economy from which there stuck to herthough in general coldly expressed through the instinctive avoidance of cheap rapturesthe religion of foreign things when it was revealed to her how many more foreign things were in merton densher than he had hitherto taken the trouble to catalogue she almost faced him as if he were a map of the continent or a handsome present of a delightful new murray he hadnt meant to swagger he had rather meant to plead though with mrs lowder he had meant also a little to explain his father had been in strange countries in twenty settlements of the english british chaplain resident or occasional and had had for years the unusual luck of never wanting a billet his career abroad had therefore been unbroken and as his stipend had never been great he had educated his children at the smallest cost in the schools nearest which was also a saving of railway fares denshers mother it further appeared had practised on her side a distinguished industry to the success of whichso far as success ever crowned itthis period of exile had much contributed she copied patient lady famous pictures in great museums having begun with a happy natural gift and taking in betimes the scale of her opportunity copyists abroad of course swarmed but mrs densher had had a sense and a hand of her own had arrived at a perfection that persuaded that even deceived and that made the disposal of her work blissfully usual her son who had lost her held her image sacred and the effect of his telling kate all about her as well as about other matters until then mixed and dim was to render his history rich his sources full his outline anything but common he had come round he had come back he insisted abundantly to being a briton his cambridge years his happy connection as it had proved with his fathers college amply certified to that to say nothing of his subsequent plunge into london which filled up the measure but brave enough though his descent to english earth he had passed by the way through zones of air that had left their ruffle on his wings had been exposed to initiations ineffaceable something had happened to him that could never be undone  when kate croy said to him as much he besought her not to insist declaring that this indeed was what was too much the matter with him that he had been but too probably spoiled for native for insular use on which not unnaturally she insisted the more assuring him without mitigation that if he was complicated and brilliant she wouldnt for the world have had him any thing less so that he was reduced in the end to accusing her of putting the dreadful truth to him in the hollow guise of flattery she was making out how abnormal he was in order that she might eventually find him impossible and as she could fully make it out but with his aid she had to bribe him by feigned delight to help her if her last word for him in the connection was that the way he saw himself was just a precious proof the more of his having tasted of the tree and being thereby prepared to assist her to eat this gives the happy tone of their whole talk the measure of the flight of time in the near presence of his settled departure kate showed however that she was to be more literally taken when she spoke of the relief aunt maud would draw from the prospect of his absence  yet one can scarcely see why he replied when she fears me so little  his friend weighed his objection your idea is that she likes you so much that shell even go so far as to regret losing you  well he saw it in their constant comprehensive way since what she builds on is the gradual process of your alienation she may take the view that the process constantly requires me mustnt i be there to keep it going its in my exile that it may languish  he went on with that fantasy but at this point kate ceased to attend he saw after a little that she had been following some thought of her own and he had been feeling the growth of something determinant even through the extravagance of much of the pleasantry the warm transparent irony into which their livelier intimacy kept plunging like a confident swimmer suddenly she said to him with extraordinary beauty i engage myself to you for ever  the beauty was in everything and he could have separated nothingcouldnt have thought of her face as distinct from the whole joy yet her face had a new light and i pledge youi call god to witnessevery spark of my faith i give you every drop of my life that was all for the moment but it was enough and it was almost as quiet as if it were nothing they were in the open air in an alley of the gardens the great space which seemed to arch just then higher and spread wider for them threw them back into deep concentration they moved by a common instinct to a spot within sight that struck them as fairly sequestered and there before their time together was spent they had extorted from concentration every advance it could make them they had exchanged vows and tokens sealed their rich compact solemnized so far as breathed words and murmured sounds and lighted eyes and clasped hands could do it their agreement to belong only and to belong tremendously to each other they were to leave the place accordingly an affianced couple but before they left it other things still had passed densher had declared his horror of bringing to a premature end her happy relation with her aunt and they had worked round together to a high level of wisdom and patience kates free profession was that she wished not to deprive him of mrs lowders countenance which in the long run she was convinced he would continue to enjoy and as by a blessed turn aunt maud had demanded of him no promise that would tie his hands they should be able to cultivate their destiny in their own way and yet remain loyal one difficulty alone stood out which densher named  of course it will never dowe must remember thatfrom the moment you allow her to found hopes of you for any one else in particular so long as her view is content to remain as general as at present appears i dont see that we deceive her at a given moment you see she must be undeceived the only thing therefore is to be ready for the moment and to face it only after all in that case the young man observed one doesnt quite make out what we shall have got from her  what shell have got from us kate inquired with a smile what shell have got from us the girl went on is her own affairits for her to measure i asked her for nothing she added i never put myself upon her she must take her risks and she surely understands them what we shall have got from her is what weve already spoken of kate further explained its that we shall have gained time and so for that matter will she  densher gazed a little at all this clearness his gaze was not at the present hour into romantic obscurity yes no doubt in our particular situation times everything and then theres the joy of it  she hesitated of our secret  not so much perhaps of our secret in itself but of whats represented and as we must somehow feel protected and made deeper and closer by it and his fine face relaxed into happiness covered her with all his meaning our being as we are  it was as if for a moment she let the meaning sink into her so gone  so gone so extremely gone however he smiled we shall go a good deal further her answer to which was only the softness of her silencea silence that looked out for them both at the far reach of their prospect this was immense and they thus took final possession of it they were practically united and they were splendidly strong but there were other thingsthings they were precisely strong enough to be able successfully to count with and safely to allow for in consequence of which they would for the present subject to some better reason keep their understanding to themselves it was not indeed however till after one more observation of denshers that they felt the question completely straightened out the only thing of course is that she may any day absolutely put it to you  kate considered ask me where on my honour we are she may naturally but i doubt if in fact she will while youre away shell make the most of it shell leave me alone  but therell be my letters  the girl faced his letters very very many  very very very manymore than ever and you know what that is and then densher added therell be yours  oh i shant leave mine on the halltable i shall post them myself  he looked at her a moment do you think then i had best address you elsewhere after which before she could quite answer he added with some emphasis id rather not you know its straighter  she might again have just waited of course its straighter dont be afraid i shant be straight address me she continued where you like i shall be proud enough of its being known you write to me  he turned it over for the last clearness even at the risk of its really bringing down the inquisition  well the last clearness now filled her im not afraid of the inquisition if she asks if theres anything definite between us i know perfectly what i shall say  that i am of course gone for you  that i love you as i shall never in my life love any one else and that she can make what she likes of that she said it out so splendidly that it was like a new profession of faith the fulness of a tide breaking through and the effect of that in turn was to make her companion meet her with such eyes that she had time again before he could otherwise speak besides shes just as likely to ask you  not while im away  then when you come back  well then said densher we shall have had our particular joy but what i feel is he candidly added that by an idea of her own her superior policy she wont ask me shell let me off i shant have to lie to her  it will be left all to me asked kate  all to you he tenderly laughed  but it was oddly the very next moment as if he had perhaps been a shade too candid his discrimination seemed to mark a possible a natural reality a reality not wholly disallowed by the account the girl had just given of her own intention there was a difference in the aireven if none other than the supposedly usual difference in truth between man and woman and it was almost as if the sense of this provoked her she seemed to cast about an instant and then she went back a little resentfully to something she had suffered to pass a minute before she appeared to take up rather more seriously than she need the joke about her freedom to deceive yet she did this too in a beautiful way men are too stupideven you you didnt understand just now why if i post my letters myself it wont be for any thing so vulgar as to hide them  oh you saidfor the pleasure  yes but you didnt you dont understand what the pleasure may be there are refinements she more patiently dropped i mean of consciousness of sensation of appreciation she went on no she sadly insistedmen dont know they know in such matters almost nothing but what women show them  this was one of the speeches frequent in her that liberally joyfully intensely adopted and in itself as might be embraced drew him again as close to her and held him as long as their conditions permitted then thats exactly why weve such an abysmal need of you     book third  v   the two ladies who in advance of the swiss season had been warned that their design was unconsidered that the passes would not be clear nor the air mild nor the inns openthe two ladies who characteristically had braved a good deal of possibly interested remonstrance were finding themselves as their adventure turned out wonderfully sustained it was the judgment of the headwaiters and other functionaries on the italian lakes that approved itself now as interested they themselves had been conscious of impatiences of bolder dreamsat least the younger had so that one of the things they made out togethermaking out as they did an endless varietywas that in those operatic palaces of the villa deste of cadenabbia of pallanza and stresa lone women however reinforced by a travellinglibrary of instructive volumes were apt to be beguiled and undone their flights of fancy moreover had been modest they had for instance risked nothing vital in hoping to make their way by the br√ºnig they were making it in fact happily enough as we meet them and were only wishing that for the wondrous beauty of the early highclimbing spring it might have been longer and the places to pause and rest more numerous  such at least had been the intimated attitude of mrs stringham the elder of the companions who had her own view of the impatiences of the younger to which however she offered an opposition but of the most circuitous she moved the admirable mrs stringham in a fine cloud of observation and suspicion she was in the position as she believed of knowing much more about milly theale than milly herself knew and yet of having to darken her knowledge as well as make it active the woman in the world least formed by nature as she was quite aware for duplicities and labyrinths she found herself dedicated to personal subtlety by a new set of circumstances above all by a new personal relation had now in fact to recognise that an education in the occultshe could scarce say what to call ithad begun for her the day she left new york with mildred she had come on from boston for that purpose had seen little of the girlor rather had seen her but briefly for mrs stringham when she saw anything at all saw much saw everythingbefore accepting her proposal and had accordingly placed herself by her act in a boat that she more and more estimated as humanly speaking of the biggest though likewise no doubt in many ways by reason of its size of the safest in boston the winter before the young lady in whom we are interested had on the spot deeply yet almost tacitly appealed to her dropped into her mind the shy conceit of some assistance some devotion to render mrs stringhams little life had often been visited by shy conceitssecret dreams that had fluttered their hour between its narrow walls without for any great part so much as mustering courage to look out of its rather dim windows but this imaginationthe fancy of a possible link with the remarkable young thing from new yorkhad mustered courage had perched on the instant at the clearest lookout it could find and might be said to have remained there till only a few months later it had caught in surprise and joy the unmistakable flash of a signal  milly theale had boston friends such as they were and of recent making and it was understood that her visit to thema visit that was not to be meagrehad been undertaken after a series of bereavements in the interest of the particular peace that new york could not give it was recognised liberally enough that there were many thingsperhaps even too manynew york could give but this was felt to make no difference in the constant fact that what you had most to do under the discipline of life or of death was really to feel your situation as grave boston could help you to that as nothing else could and it had extended to milly by every presumption some such measure of assistance mrs stringham was never to forgetfor the moment had not faded nor the infinitely fine vibration it set up in any degree ceasedher own first sight of the striking apparition then unheralded and unexplained the slim constantly pale delicately haggard anomalously agreeably angular young person of not more than twoandtwenty in spite of her marks whose hair was some how exceptionally red even for the real thing which it innocently confessed to being and whose clothes were remarkably black even for robes of mourning which was the meaning they expressed it was new york mourning it was new york hair it was a new york history confused as yet but multitudinous of the loss of parents brothers sisters almost every human appendage all on a scale and with a sweep that had required the greater stage it was a new york legend of affecting of romantic isolation and beyond everything it was by most accounts in respect to the mass of money so piled on the girls back a set of new york possibilities she was alone she was stricken she was rich and in particular she was strangea combination in itself of a nature to engage mrs stringhams attention but it was the strangeness that most determined our good ladys sympathy convinced as she was that it was much greater than any one elseany one but the sole susan stringhamsupposed susan privately settled it that boston was not in the least seeing her was only occupied with her seeing boston and that any assumed affinity between the two characters was delusive and vain she was seeing her and she had quite the deepest moment of her life in now obeying the instinct to conceal the vision she couldnt explain itno one would understand they would say clever boston thingsmrs stringham was from burlington vermont which she boldly upheld as the real heart of new england boston being too far southbut they would only darken counsel  there could be no better proof than this quick intellectual split of the impression made on our friend who shone herself she was well aware with but the reflected light of the admirable city she too had had her discipline but it had not made her striking it had been prosaically usual though doubtless a decent dose and had only made her usual to match itusual that is as boston went she had lost first her husband and then her mother with whom on her husbands death she had lived again so that now childless she was but more sharply single than before but she sat rather coldly light having as she called it enough to live onso far that is as she lived by bread alone how little indeed she was regularly content with that diet appeared from the name she had madesusan shepherd stringhamas a contributor to the best magazines she wrote short stories and she fondly believed she had her note the art of showing new england without showing it wholly in the kitchen she had not herself been brought up in the kitchen she knew others who had not and to speak for them had thus become with her a literary mission to be in truth literary had ever been her dearest thought the thought that kept her bright little nippers perpetually in position there were masters models celebrities mainly foreign whom she finely accounted so and in whose light she ingeniously laboured there were others whom however chattered about she ranked with the inane for she was full of discrimination but all categories failed herthey ceased at least to signifyas soon as she found herself in presence of the real thing the romantic life itself that was what she saw in mildredwhat positively made her hand a while tremble too much for the pen she had had it seemed to her a revelationsuch as even new england refined and grammatical couldnt give and all made up as she was of small neat memories and ingenuities little industries and ambitions mixed with something moral personal that was still more intensely responsive she felt her new friend would have done her an ill turn if their friendship shouldnt develop and yet that nothing would be left of anything else if it should it was for the surrender of everything else that she was however quite prepared and while she went about her usual boston business with her usual boston probity she was really all the while holding herself she wore her handsome felt hat so tyrolese yet some how though feathered from the eagles wing so truly domestic with the same straightness and security she attached her fur boa with the same honest precautions she preserved her balance on the iceslopes with the same practised skill she opened each evening her transcript with the same interfusion of suspense and resignation she attended her almost daily concert with the same expenditure of patience and the same economy of passion she flitted in and out of the public library with the air of conscientiously returning or bravely carrying off in her pocket the key of knowledge itself and finallyit was what she most didshe watched the thin trickle of a fictive loveinterest through that somewhat serpentine channel in the magazines which she mainly managed to keep clear for it but the real thing all the while was elsewhere the real thing had gone back to new york leaving behind it the two unsolved questions quite distinct of why it was real and whether she should ever be so near it again  for the figure to which these questions attached themselves she had found a convenient descriptionshe thought of it for herself always as that of a girl with a background the great reality was in the fact that very soon after but two or three meetings the girl with the background the girl with the crown of old gold and the mourning that was not as the mourning of boston but at once more rebellious in its gloom and more frivolous in its frills had told her she had never seen any one like her they had met thus as opposed curiosities and that simple remark of millysif simple it wasbecame the most important thing that had ever happened to her it deprived the loveinterest for the time of actuality and even of pertinence it moved her first in short in a high degree to gratitude and then to no small compassion yet in respect to this relation at least it was what did prove the key of knowledge it lighted up as nothing else could do the poor young womans history that the potential heiress of all the ages should never have seen any one like a mere typical subscriber after all to the transcript was a truth thatin especial as announced with modesty with humility with regretdescribed a situation it laid upon the elder woman as to the void to be filled a weight of responsibility but in particular it led her to ask whom poor mildred had then seen and what range of contacts it had taken to produce such queer surprises that was really the inquiry that had ended by clearing the air the key of knowledge was felt to click in the lock from the moment it flashed upon mrs stringham that her friend had been starved for culture culture was what she herself represented for her and it was living up to that principle that would surely prove the great business she knew the clever lady what the principle itself represented and the limits of her own store and a certain alarm would have grown upon her if something else hadnt grown faster  this was fortunately for herand we give it in her own wordsthe sense of a harrowing pathos that primarily was what appealed to her what seemed to open the door of romance for her still wider than any than a still more reckless connection with the picturepapers for such was essentially the point it was rich romantic abysmal to have as was evident thousands and thousands a year to have youth and intelligence and if not beauty at least in equal measure a high dim charming ambiguous oddity which was even better and then on top of all to enjoy boundless freedom the freedom of the wind in the desertit was unspeakably touching to be so equipped and yet to have been reduced by fortune to little humbleminded mistakes  it brought our friends imagination back again to new york where aberrations were so possible in the intellectual sphere and it in fact caused a visit she presently paid there to overflow with interest as milly had beautifully invited her so she would hold out if she could against the strain of so much confidence in her mind and the remarkable thing was that even at the end of three weeks she had held out but by this time her mind had grown comparatively bold and free it was dealing with new quantities a different proportion altogetherand that had made for refreshment she had accordingly gone home in convenient possession of her subject new york was vast new york was startling with strange histories with wild cosmopolite backward generations that accounted for anything and to have got nearer the luxuriant tribe of which the rare creature was the final flower the immense extravagant unregulated cluster with freeliving ancestors handsome dead cousins lurid uncles beautiful vanished aunts persons all busts and curls preserved though so exposed in the marble of famous french chiselsall this to say nothing of the effect of closer growths of the stem was to have had ones small worldspace both crowded and enlarged our couple had at all events effected an exchange the elder friend had been as consciously intellectual as possible and the younger abounding in personal revelation had been as unconsciously distinguished this was poetryit was also historymrs stringham thought to a finer tune even than maeterlink and pater than marbot and gregorovius she appointed occasions for the reading of these authors with her hostess rather perhaps than actually achieved great spans but what they managed and what they missed speedily sank for her into the dim depths of the merely relative so quickly so strongly had she clutched her central clue all her scruples and hesitations all her anxious enthusiasms had reduced themselves to a single alarmthe fear that she really might act on her companion clumsily and coarsely she was positively afraid of what she might do to her and to avoid that to avoid it with piety and passion to do rather nothing at all to leave her untouched because no touch one could apply however light however just however earnest and anxious would be half good enough would be anything but an ugly smutch upon perfectionthis now imposed itself as a consistent an inspiring thought  less than a month after the event that had so determined mrs stringhams attitudeclose upon the heels that is of her return from new yorkshe was reached by a proposal that brought up for her the kind of question her delicacy might have to contend with would she start for europe with her young friend at the earliest possible date and should she be willing to do so without making conditions the inquiry was launched by wire explanations in sufficiency were promised extreme urgency was suggested and a general surrender invited it was to the honour of her sincerity that she made the surrender on the spot though it was not perhaps altogether to that of her logic she had wanted very consciously from the first to give something up for her new acquaintance but she had now no doubt that she was practically giving up all what settled this was the fulness of a particular impression the impression that had throughout more and more supported her and which she would have uttered so far as she might by saying that the charm of the creature was positively in the creatures greatness she would have been content so to leave it unless indeed she had said more familiarly that mildred was the biggest impression of her life that was at all events the biggest account of her and none but a big clearly would do her situation as such things were called was on the grand scale but it still was not that it was her nature once for alla nature that reminded mrs stringham of the term always used in the newspapers about the great new steamers the inordinate number of feet of water they drew so that if in your little boat you had chosen to hover and approach you had but yourself to thank when once motion was started for the way the draught pulled you milly drew the feet of water and odd though it might seem that a lonely girl who was not robust and who hated sound and show should stir the stream like a leviathan her companion floated off with the sense of rocking violently at her side more than prepared however for that excitement mrs stringham mainly failed of ease in respect to her own consistency to attach herself for an indefinite time seemed a roundabout way of holding her hands off if she wished to be sure of neither touching nor smutching the straighter plan would doubtless have been not to keep her friend within reach this in fact she fully recognised and with it the degree to which she desired that the girl should lead her life a life certain to be so much finer than that of anybody else the difficulty however by good fortune cleared away as soon as she had further recognised as she was speedily able to do that she susan shepherdthe name with which milly for the most part amused herselfwas not anybody else she had renounced that character she had now no life to lead and she honestly believed that she was thus supremely equipped for leading millys own no other person whatever she was sure had to an equal degree this qualification and it was really to assert it that she fondly embarked  many things though not in many weeks had come and gone since then and one of the best of them doubtless had been the voyage itself by the happy southern course to the succession of mediterranean ports with the dazzled windup at naples two or three others had preceded this incidents indeed rather lively marks of their last fortnight at home and one of which had determined on mrs stringhams part a rush to new york fortyeight breathless hours there previous to her final rally but the great sustained sealight had drunk up the rest of the picture so that for many days other questions and other possibilities sounded with as little effect as a trio of penny whistles might sound in a wagner overture it was the wagner overture that practically prevailed up through italy where milly had already been still further up and across the alps which were also partly known to mrs stringham only perhaps taken to a time not wholly congruous hurried in fact on account of the girls high restlessness she had been expected she had frankly promised to be restlessthat was partly why she was greator was a consequence at any rate if not a cause yet she had not perhaps altogether announced herself as straining so hard at the cord it was familiar it was beautiful to mrs stringham that she had arrears to make up the chances that had lapsed for her through the wanton ways of forefathers fond of paris but not of its higher sides and fond almost of nothing else but the vagueness the openness the eagerness without point and the interest without pauseall a part of the charm of her oddity as at first presentedhad become more striking in proportion as they triumphed over movement and change she had arts and idiosyncrasies of which no great account could have been given but which were a daily grace if you lived with them such as the art of being almost tragically impatient and yet making it as light as air of being inexplicably sad and yet making it as clear as noon of being unmistakably gay and yet making it as soft as dusk mrs stringham by this time understood everything was more than ever confirmed in wonder and admiration in her view that it was life enough simply to feel her companions feelings but there were special keys she had not yet added to her bunch impressions that of a sudden were apt to affect her as new  this particular day on the great swiss road had been for some reason full of them and they referred themselves provisionally to some deeper depth than she had touchedthough into two or three such depths it must be added she had peeped long enough to find herself suddenly draw back it was not millys unpacified state in short that now troubled herthough certainly as europe was the great american sedative the failure was to some extent to be noted it was the suspected presence of something behind itwhich however could scarcely have taken its place there since their departure what any fresh motive of unrest could suddenly have sprung from was in short not to be divined it was but half an explanation to say that excitement for each of them had naturally dropped and that what they had left behind or tried tothe great serious facts of life as mrs stringham liked to call themwas once more coming into sight as objects loom through smoke when smoke begins to clear for these were general appearances from which the girls own aspect her really larger vagueness seemed rather to disconnect itself the nearest approach to a personal anxiety indulged in as yet by the elder lady was on her taking occasion to wonder if what she had more than anything else got hold of mightnt be one of the finer one of the finest one of the rarestas she called it so that she might call it nothing worsecases of american intensity she had just had a moment of alarmasked herself if her young friend were merely going to treat her to some complicated drama of nerves at the end of a week however with their further progress her young friend had effectively answered the question and given her the impression indistinct indeed as yet of something that had a reality compared with which the nervous explanation would have been coarse mrs stringham found herself from that hour in other words in presence of an explanation that remained a muffled and intangible form but that assuredly should it take on sharpness would explain everything and more than everything would become instantly the light in which milly was to be read  such a matter as this may at all events speak of the style in which our young woman could affect those who were near her may testify to the sort of interest she could inspire she workedand seemingly quite without designupon the sympathy the curiosity the fancy of her associates and we shall really ourselves scarce otherwise come closer to her than by feeling their impression and sharing if need be their confusion she reduced them mrs stringham would have said reduced them to a consenting bewilderment which was precisely for that good lady on a last analysis what was most in harmony with her greatness she exceeded escaped measure was surprising only because they were so far from great thus it was that on this wondrous day on the br√ºnig the spell of watching her had grown more than ever irresistible a proof of whator of a part of whatmrs stringham had with all the rest been reduced to she had almost the sense of tracking her young friend as if at a given moment to pounce she knew she shouldnt pounce she hadnt come out to pounce yet she felt her attention secretive all the same and her observation scientific she struck herself as hovering like a spy applying tests laying traps concealing signs this would last however only till she should fairly know what was the matter and to watch was after all meanwhile a way of clinging to the girl not less than an occupation a satisfaction in itself the pleasure of watching moreover if a reason were needed came from a sense of her beauty her beauty hadnt at all originally seemed a part of the situation and mrs stringham had even in the first flush of friendship not named it grossly to any one having seen early that for stupid peopleand who she sometimes secretly asked herself wasnt stupidit would take a great deal of explaining she had learned not to mention it till it was mentioned firstwhich occasionally happened but not too often and then she was there in force then she both warmed to the perception that met her own perception and disputed it suspiciously as to special items while in general she had learned to refine even to the point of herself employing the word that most people employed she employed it to pretend that she was also stupid and so have done with the matter spoke of her friend as plain as ugly even in a case of especially dense insistence but as in appearance so awfully full of things this was her own way of describing a face that thanks doubtless to rather too much forehead too much nose and too much mouth together with too little mere conventional colour and conventional line was expressive irregular exquisite both for speech and for silence when milly smiled it was a public eventwhen she didnt it was a chapter of history they had stopped on the br√ºnig for luncheon and there had come up for them under the charm of the place the question of a longer stay  mrs stringham was now on the ground of thrilled recognitions small sharp echoes of a past which she kept in a wellthumbed case but which on pressure of a spring and exposure to the air still showed itself ticking as hard as an honest old watch the embalmed europe of her younger time had partly stood for three years of switzerland a term of continuous school at vevey with rewards of merit in the form of silver medals tied by blue ribbons and mild mountainpasses attacked with alpenstocks it was the good girls who in the holidays were taken highest and our friend could now judge from what she supposed her familiarity with the minor peaks that she had been one of the best these reminiscences sacred today because prepared in the hushed chambers of the past had been part of the general train laid for the pair of sisters daughters early fatherless by their brave vermont mother who struck her at present as having apparently almost like columbus worked out all unassisted a conception of the other side of the globe she had focussed vevey by the light of nature and with extraordinary completeness at burlington after which she had embarked sailed landed explored and above all made good her presence she had given her daughters the five years in switzerland and germany that were to leave them ever afterwards a standard of comparison for all cycles of cathay and to stamp the younger in especialsusan was the youngerwith a character that as mrs stringham had often had occasion through life to say to herself made all the difference it made all the difference for mrs stringham over and over again and in the most remote connections that thanks to her parents lonely thrifty hardy faith she was a woman of the world there were plenty of women who were all sorts of things that she wasnt but who on the other hand were not that and who didnt know she was which she likedit relegated them still further and didnt know either how it enabled her to judge them she had never seen herself so much in this light as during the actual phase of her associated if slightly undirected pilgrimage and the consciousness gave perhaps to her plea for a pause more intensity than she knew the irrecoverable days had come back to her from far off they were part of the sense of the cool upper air and of everything else that hung like an indestructible scent to the torn garment of youththe taste of honey and the luxury of milk the sound of cattlebells and the rush of streams the fragrance of trodden balms and the dizziness of deep gorges  milly clearly felt these things too but they affected her companion at momentsthat was quite the way mrs stringham would have expressed itas the princess in a conventional tragedy might have affected the confidant if a personal emotion had ever been permitted to the latter that a princess could only be a princess was a truth with which essentially a confidant however responsive had to live mrs stringham was a woman of the world but milly theale was a princess the only one she had yet had to deal with and this in its way too made all the difference it was a perfectly definite doom for the wearerit was for every one else a perfectly palpable quality it might have been possibly with its involved loneliness and other mysteries the weight under which she fancied her companions admirable head occasionally and ever so submissively bowed milly had quite assented at luncheon to their staying over and had left her to look at rooms settle questions arrange about their keeping on their carriage and horses cares that had now moreover fallen to mrs stringham as a matter of course and that yet for some reason on this occasion particularly brought home to herall agreeably richly almost grandlywhat it was to live with the great her young friend had in a sublime degree a sense closed to the general question of difficulty which she got rid of furthermore not in the least as one had seen many charming persons do by merely passing it on to others she kept it completely at a distance it never entered the circle the most plaintive confidant couldnt have dragged it in and to tread the path of a confidant was accordingly to live exempt service was in other words so easy to render that the whole thing was like court life without the hardships it came back of course to the question of money and our observant lady had by this time repeatedly reflected that if one were talking of the difference it was just this this incomparably and nothing else that when all was said and done most made it a less vulgarly a less obviously purchasing or parading person she couldnt have imagined but it was all the same the truth of truths that the girl couldnt get away from her wealth she might leave her conscientious companion as freely alone with it as possible and never ask a question scarce even tolerate a reference but it was in the fine folds of the helplessly expensive little black frock that she drew over the grass as she now strolled vaguely off it was in the curious and splendid coils of hair done with no eye whatever to the mode du jour that peeped from under the corresponding indifference of her hat the merely personal tradition that suggested a sort of noble inelegance it lurked between the leaves of the uncut but antiquated tauchnitz volume of which before going out she had mechanically possessed herself she couldnt dress it away nor walk it away nor read it away nor think it away she could neither smile it away in any dreamy absence nor blow it away in any softened sigh she couldnt have lost it if she had triedthat was what it was to be really rich it had to be the thing you were when at the end of an hour she had not returned to the house mrs stringham though the bright afternoon was yet young took with precautions the same direction went to join her in case of her caring for a walk but the purpose of joining her was in truth less distinct than that of a due regard for a possibly preferred detachment so that once more the good lady proceeded with a quietness that made her slightly underhand even in her own eyes she couldnt help that however and she didnt care sure as she was that what she really wanted was not to overstep but to stop in time it was to be able to stop in time that she went softly but she had on this occasion further to go than ever yet for she followed in vain and at last with some anxiety the footpath she believed milly to have taken it wound up a hillside and into the higher alpine meadows in which all these last days they had so often wanted as they passed above or below to stray and then it obscured itself in a wood but always going up up and with a small cluster of brown old highperched chalets evidently for its goal mrs stringham reached in due course the chalets and there received from a bewildered old woman a very fearful person to behold an indication that sufficiently guided her the young lady had been seen not long before passing further on over a crest and to a place where the way would drop again as our unappeased inquirer found it in fact a quarter of an hour later markedly and almost alarmingly to do it led somewhere yet apparently quite into space for the great side of the mountain appeared from where she pulled up to fall away altogether though probably but to some issue below and out of sight her uncertainty moreover was brief for she next became aware of the presence on a fragment of rock twenty yards off of the tauchnitz volume that the girl had brought out and that therefore pointed to her shortly previous passage she had rid herself of the book which was an encumbrance and meant of course to pick it up on her return but as she hadnt yet picked it up what on earth had become of her mrs stringham i hasten to add was within a few moments to see but it was quite an accident that she had not before they were over betrayed by her deeper agitation the fact of her own nearness  the whole place with the descent of the path and as a sequel to a sharp turn that was masked by rocks and shrubs appeared to fall precipitously and to become a view pure and simple a view of great extent and beauty but thrown forward and vertiginous milly with the promise of it from just above had gone straight down to it not stopping till it was all before her and here on what struck her friend as the dizzy edge of it she was seated at her ease the path somehow took care of itself and its final business but the girls seat was a slab of rock at the end of a short promontory or excrescence that merely pointed off to the right into gulfs of air and that was so placed by good fortune if not by the worst as to be at last completely visible for mrs stringham stifled a cry on taking in what she believed to be the danger of such a perch for a mere maiden her liability to slip to slide to leap to be precipitated by a single false movement by a turn of the headhow could one tell into whatever was beneath a thousand thoughts for the minute roared in the poor ladys ears but without reaching as happened millys it was a commotion that left our observer intensely still and holding her breath what had first been offered her was the possibility of a latent intentionhowever wild the ideain such a posture of some betrayed accordance of millys caprice with a horrible hidden obsession but since mrs stringham stood as motionless as if a sound a syllable must have produced the start that would be fatal so even the lapse of a few seconds had a partly reassuring effect it gave her time to receive the impression which when she some minutes later softly retraced her steps was to be the sharpest she carried away this was the impression that if the girl was deeply and recklessly meditating there she was not meditating a jump she was on the contrary as she sat much more in a state of uplifted and unlimited possession that had nothing to gain from violence she was looking down on the kingdoms of the earth and though indeed that of itself might well go to the brain it wouldnt be with a view of renouncing them was she choosing among them or did she want them all this question before mrs stringham had decided what to do made others vain in accordance with which she saw or believed she did that if it might be dangerous to call out to sound in any way a surprise it would probably be safe enough to withdraw as she had come she watched a while longer she held her breath and she never knew afterwards what time had elapsed  not many minutes probably yet they had not seemed few and they had given her so much to think of not only while creeping home but while waiting afterwards at the inn that she was still busy with them when late in the afternoon milly reappeared she had stopped at the point of the path where the tauchnitz lay had taken it up and with the pencil attached to her watchguard had scrawled a word√† bient√¥tacross the cover then even under the girls continued delay had measured time without a return of alarm for she now saw that the great thing she had brought away was precisely a conviction that the future was not to exist for her princess in the form of any sharp or simple release from the human predicament it wouldnt be for her a question of a flying leap and thereby of a quick escape it would be a question of taking full in the face the whole assault of life to the general muster of which indeed her face might have been directly presented as she sat there on her rock mrs stringham was thus able to say to herself even after another interval of some length that if her young friend still continued absent it wouldnt be becausewhatever the opportunityshe had cut short the thread she wouldnt have committed suicide she knew herself unmistakably reserved for some more complicated passage this was the very vision in which she had with no little awe been discovered the image that thus remained with the elder lady kept the character of revelation during the breathless minutes of her watch she had seen her companion afresh the latters type aspect marks her history her state her beauty her mystery all unconsciously betrayed themselves to the alpine air and all had been gathered in again to feed mrs stringhams flame they are things that will more distinctly appear for us and they are meanwhile briefly represented by the enthusiasm that was stronger on our friends part than any doubt it was a consciousness she was scarce yet used to carrying but she had as beneath her feet a mine of something precious she seemed to herself to stand near the mouth not yet quite cleared the mine but needed working and would certainly yield a treasure she was not thinking either of millys gold   vi  the girl said nothing when they met about the words scrawled on the tauchnitz and mrs stringham then noticed that she had not the book with her she had left it lying and probably would never remember it at all her comrades decision was therefore quickly made not to speak of having followed her and within five minutes of her return wonderfully enough the preoccupation denoted by her forgetfulness further declared itself should you think me quite abominable if i were to say that after all  mrs stringham had already thought with the first sound of the question everything she was capable of thinking and had immediately made such a sign that millys words gave place to visible relief at her assent you dont care for our stop hereyoud rather go straight on well start then with the peep of tomorrows dawnor as early as you like its only rather late now to take the road again and she smiled to show how she meant it for a joke that an instant onward rush was what the girl would have wished i bullied you into stopping she added so it serves me right  milly made in general the most of her good friends jokes but she humoured this one a little absently oh yes you do bully me and it was thus arranged between them with no discussion at all that they would resume their journey in the morning the younger tourists interest in the detail of the matterin spite of a declaration from the elder that she would consent to be dragged anywhereappeared almost immediately afterwards quite to lose itself she promised however to think till supper of where with the world all before them they might gosupper having been ordered for such time as permitted of lighted candles it had been agreed between them that lighted candles at wayside inns in strange countries amid mountain scenery gave the evening meal a peculiar poetrysuch being the mild adventures the refinements of impression that they as they would have said went in for it was now as if before this repast milly had designed to lie down but at the end of three minutes more she was not lying down she was saying instead abruptly with a transition that was like a jump of four thousand miles what was it that in new york on the ninth when you saw him alone dr finch said to you  it was not till later that mrs stringham fully knew why the question had startled her still more than its suddenness explained though the effect of it even at the moment was almost to frighten her into a false answer she had to think to remember the occasion the ninth in new york the time she had seen dr finch alone and to recall what he had then said to her and when everything had come back it was quite at first for a moment as if he had said something that immensely mattered he hadnt however in fact it was only as if he might perhaps after all have been going to it was on the sixthwithin ten days of their sailingthat she had hurried from boston under the alarm a small but a sufficient shock of hearing that mildred had suddenly been taken ill had had from some obscure cause such an upset as threatened to stay their journey the bearing of the accident had happily soon announced itself as slight and there had been in the event but a few hours of anxiety the journey had been pronounced again not only possible but as representing change highly advisable and if the zealous guest had had five minutes by herself with the doctor that was clearly no more at his instance than at her own almost nothing had passed between them but an easy exchange of enthusiasms in respect to the remedial properties of europe and this assurance as the facts came back to her she was now able to give nothing whatever on my word of honour that you maynt know or mightnt then have known ive no secret with him about you what makes you suspect it i dont quite make out how you know i did see him alone  noyou never told me said milly and i dont mean she went on during the twentyfour hours while i was bad when your putting your heads together was natural enough i mean after i was betterthe last thing before you went home  mrs stringham continued to wonder who told you i saw him then  he didnt himselfnor did you write me it afterwards we speak of it now for the first time thats exactly why milly declaredwith something in her face and voice that the next moment betrayed for her companion that she had really known nothing had only conjectured and chancing her charge made a hit yet why had her mind been busy with the question but if youre not as you now assure me in his confidence she smiled its no matter  im not in his confidence and he had nothing to confide but are you feeling unwell  the elder woman was earnest for the truth though the possibility she named was not at all the one that seemed to fitwitness the long climb milly had just indulged in the girl showed her constant white face but that her friends had all learned to discount and it was often brightest when superficially not bravest she continued for a little mysteriously to smile i dont knowhavent really the least idea but it might be well to find out  mrs stringham at this flared into sympathy are you in troublein pain  not the least little bit but i sometimes wonder  yesshe pressed wonder what  well if i shall have much of it  mrs stringham stared much of what not of pain  of everything of everything i have  anxiously again tenderly our friend cast about you have everything so that when you say much of it  i only mean the girl broke in shall i have it for long that is if i have got it  she had at present the effect a little of confounding or at least of perplexing her comrade who was touched who was always touched by something helpless in her grace and abrupt in her turns and yet actually half made out in her a sort of mocking light if youve got an ailment  if ive got everything milly laughed  ah thatlike almost nobody else  then for how long  mrs stringhams eyes entreated her she had gone close to her half enclosed her with urgent arms do you want to see some one and then as the girl only met it with a slow headshake though looking perhaps a shade more conscious well go straight to the best near doctor this too however produced but a gaze of qualified assent and a silence sweet and vague that left everything open our friend decidedly lost herself tell me for gods sake if youre in distress  i dont think ive really everything milly said as if to explainand as if also to put it pleasantly  but what on earth can i do for you the girl hesitated then seemed on the point of being able to say but suddenly changed and expressed herself otherwise dear dear thingim only too happy  it brought them closer but it rather confirmed mrs stringhams doubt then whats the matter  thats the matterthat i can scarcely bear it  but what is it you think you havent got  milly waited another moment then she found it and found for it a dim show of joy the power to resist the bliss of what i have  mrs stringham took it inher sense of being put off with it the possible probable irony of itand her tenderness renewed itself in the positive grimness of a long murmur whom will you seefor it was as if they looked down from their height at a continent of doctors where will you first go  milly had for the third time her air of consideration but she came back with it to her plea of some minutes before ill tell you at suppergoodbye till then and she left the room with a lightness that testified for her companion to something that again particularly pleased her in the renewed promise of motion the odd passage just concluded mrs stringham mused as she once more sat alone with a hooked needle and a ball of silk the fine work with which she was always providedthis mystifying mood had simply been precipitated no doubt by their prolonged halt with which the girl hadnt really been in sympathy one had only to admit that her complaint was in fact but the excess of the joy of life and everything did then fit she couldnt stop for the joy but she could go on for it and with the sense of going on she floated again was restored to her great spaces there was no evasion of any truthso at least susan shepherd hopedin ones sitting there while the twilight deepened and feeling still more finely that the position of this young lady was magnificent the evening at that height had naturally turned to cold and the travellers had bespoken a fire with their meal the great alpine road asserted its brave presence through the small panes of the low clean windows with incidents at the inndoor the yellow diligence the great waggons the hurrying hooded private conveyances reminders for our fanciful friend of old stories old pictures historic flights escapes pursuits things that had happened things indeed that by a sort of strange congruity helped her to read the meanings of the greatest interest into the relation in which she was now so deeply involved it was natural that this record of the magnificence of her companions position should strike her as after all the best meaning she could extract for she herself was seated in the magnificence as in a courtcarriageshe came back to that and such a method of progression such a view from crimson cushions would evidently have a great deal more to give by the time the candles were lighted for supper and the short white curtains were drawn milly had reappeared and the little scenic room had then all its romance that charm moreover was far from broken by the words in which she without further loss of time satisfied her patient mate i want to go straight to london  it was unexpected corresponding with no view positively taken at their departure when england had appeared on the contrary rather relegated and postponedseen for the moment as who should say at the end of an avenue of preparations and introductions london in short might have been supposed to be the crown and to be achieved like a siege by gradual approaches millys actual fine stride was therefore the more exciting as any simplification almost always was to mrs stringham who besides was afterwards to recall as the very beginning of a drama the terms in which between their smoky candles the girl had put her preference and in which still other things had come up come while the clank of waggonchains in the sharp air reached their ears with the stamp of hoofs the rattle of buckets and the foreign questions foreign answers that were all alike a part of the cheery converse of the road the girl brought it out in truth as she might have brought a huge confession something she admitted herself shy about and that would seem to show her as frivolous it had rolled over her that what she wanted of europe was people so far as they were to be had and that if her friend really wished to know the vision of this same equivocal quantity was what had haunted her during their previous days in museums and churches and what was again spoiling for her the pure taste of scenery she was all for sceneryyes but she wanted it human and personal and all she could say was that there would be in londonwouldnt there more of that kind than anywhere else she came back to her idea that if it wasnt for longif nothing should happen to be so for herwhy the particular thing she spoke of would probably have most to give her in the time would probably be less than anything else a waste of her remainder she produced this last consideration indeed with such gaiety that mrs stringham was not again disconcerted by it was in fact quite readyif talk of early dying was in orderto match it from her own future good then they would eat and drink because of what might happen tomorrow and they would direct their course from that moment with a view to such eating and drinking they ate and drank that night in truth as if in the spirit of this decision whereby the air before they separated felt itself the clearer  it had cleared perhaps to a view only too extensiveextensive that is in proportion to the signs of life presented the idea of people was not so entertained on millys part as to connect itself with particular persons and the fact remained for each of the ladies that they would completely unknown disembark at dover amid the completely unknowing they had no relation already formed this plea mrs stringham put forward to see what it would produce it produced nothing at first but the observation on the girls side that what she had in mind was no thought of society nor of scraping acquaintance nothing was further from her than to desire the opportunities represented for the compatriot in general by a trunkful of letters it wasnt a question in short of the people the compatriot was after it was the human the english picture itself as they might see it in their own waythe world imagined always in what one had read and dreamed mrs stringham did every justice to this world but when later on an occasion chanced to present itself she made a point of not omitting to remark that it might be a comfort to know in advance even an individual this still however failed in vulgar parlance to fetch milly so that she had presently to go all the way havent i understood from you for that matter that you gave mr densher something of a promise  there was a moment on this when millys look had to be taken as representing one of two thingseither that she was completely vague about the promise or that mr denshers name itself started no train but she really couldnt be so vague about the promise her interlocutress quickly saw without attaching it to something it had to be a promise to somebody in particular to be so repudiated in the event accordingly she acknowledged mr merton densher the so unusually clever young englishman who had made his appearance in new york on some special literary businesswasnt itshortly before their departure and who had been three or four times in her house during the brief period between her visit to boston and her companions subsequent stay with her but she required much reminding before it came back to her that she had mentioned to this companion just afterwards the confidence expressed by the personage in question in her never doing so dire a thing as to come to london without as the phrase was looking a fellow up she had left him the enjoyment of his confidence the form of which might have appeared a trifle freethat she now reasserted she had done nothing either to impair or to enhance it but she had also left mrs stringham in the connection and at the time rather sorry to have missed mr densher she had thought of him again after that the elder woman she had likewise gone so far as to notice that milly appeared not to have done sowhich the girl might easily have betrayed and interested as she was in everything that concerned her she had made out for herself for herself only and rather idly that but for interruptions the young englishman might have become a better acquaintance his being an acquaintance at all was one of the signs that in the first days had helped to place milly as a young person with the world before her for sympathy and wonder isolated unmothered unguarded but with her other strong marks her big house her big fortune her big freedom she had lately begun to receive for all her few years as an older woman might have doneas was done precisely by princesses who had public considerations to observe and who came of age very early if it was thus distinct to mrs stringham then that mr densher had gone off somewhere else in connection with his errand before her visit to new york it had been also not undiscoverable that he had come back for a day or two later on that is after her own second excursionthat he had in fine reappeared on a single occasion on his way to the west his way from washington as she believed though he was out of sight at the time of her joining her friend for their departure it had not occurred to her before to exaggerateit had not occurred to her that she could but she seemed to become aware tonight that there had been just enough in this relation to meet to provoke the free conception of a little more  she presently put it that at any rate promise or no promise milly would at a pinch be able in london to act on his permission to make him a sign to which milly replied with readiness that her ability though evident would be none the less quite wasted inasmuch as the gentleman would to a certainty be still in america he had a great deal to do therewhich he would scarce have begun and in fact she might very well not have thought of london at all if she hadnt been sure he wasnt yet near coming back it was perceptible to her companion that the moment our young woman had so far committed herself she had a sense of having overstepped which was not quite patched up by her saying the next minute possibly with a certain failure of presence of mind that the last thing she desired was the air of running after him mrs stringham wondered privately what question there could be of any such appearancethe danger of which thus suddenly came up but she said for the time nothing of itshe only said other things one of which was for instance that if mr densher was away he was away and that this was the end of it also that of course they must be discreet at any price but what was the measure of discretion and how was one to be sure so it was that as they sat there she produced her own case she had a possible tie with london which she desired as little to disown as she might wish to risk presuming on it she treated her companion in short for their evenings end to the story of maud manningham the odd but interesting english girl who had formed her special affinity in the old days at the vevey school whom she had written to after their separation with a regularity that had at first faltered and then altogether failed yet that had been for the time quite a fine case of crude constancy so that it had in fact flickered up again of itself on the occasion of the marriage of each they had then once more fondly scrupulously writtenmrs lowder first and even another letter or two had afterwards passed this however had been the endthough with no rupture only a gentle drop maud manningham had made she believed a great marriage while she herself had made a small on top of which moreover distance difference diminished community and impossible reunion had done the rest of the work it was but after all these years that reunion had begun to show as possibleif the other party to it that is should be still in existence that was exactly what it now struck our friend as interesting to ascertain as with one aid and another she believed she might it was an experiment she would at all events now make if milly didnt object  milly in general objected to nothing and though she asked a question or two she raised no present plea her questionsor at least her own answers to themkindled on mrs stringhams part a backward train she hadnt known till tonight how much she remembered or how fine it might be to see what had become of large highcoloured maud florid exotic and alienwhich had been just the spelleven to the perceptions of youth there was the dangershe frankly touched itthat such a temperament mightnt have matured with the years all in the sense of fineness it was the sort of danger that in renewing relations after long breaks one had always to look in the face to gather in strayed threads was to take a riskfor which however she was prepared if milly was the possible fun she confessed was by itself rather tempting and she fairly sounded with thiswound up a little as she wasthe note of fun as the harmless final right of fifty years of mere new england virtue among the things she was afterwards to recall was the indescribable look dropped on her at this by her companion she was still seated there between the candles and before the finished supper while milly moved about and the look was long to figure for her as an inscrutable comment on her notion of freedom challenged at any rate as for the last wise word milly showed perhaps musingly charmingly that though her attention had been mainly soundless her friends storyproduced as a resource unsuspected a card from up the sleevehalf surprised half beguiled her since the matter such as it was depended on that she brought out before she went to bed an easy a light risk everything  this quality in it seemed possibly a little to deny weight to maud lowders evoked presenceas susan stringham still sitting up became in excited reflection a trifle more conscious something determinant when the girl had left her took place in hernameless but as soon as she had given way coercive it was as if she knew again in this fulness of time that she had been after mauds marriage just sensibly outlived or as people nowadays said shunted mrs lowder had left her behind and on the occasion subsequently of the corresponding date in her own lifenot the second the sad one with its dignity of sadness but the first with the meagreness of its supposed felicityshe had been in the same spirit almost patronisingly pitied if that suspicion even when it had ceased to matter had never quite died out for her there was doubtless some oddity in its now offering itself as a link rather than as another break in the chain and indeed there might well have been for her a mood in which the notion of the development of patronage in her quondam schoolmate would have settled her question in another sense it was actually settledif the case be worth our analysisby the happy consummation the poetic justice the generous revenge of her having at last something to show maud on their parting company had appeared to have so much and would nowfor wasnt it also in general quite the rich law of english lifehave with accretions promotions expansions ever so much more very good such things might be she rose to the sense of being ready for them whatever mrs lowder might have to showand one hoped one did the presumptions all justiceshe would have nothing like milly theale who constituted the trophy producible by poor susan poor susan lingered latetill the candles were low and as soon as the table was cleared she opened her neat portfolio she had not lost the old clue there were connections she remembered addresses she could try so the thing was to begin she wrote on the spot     book fourth  vii  it had all gone so fast after this that milly uttered but the truth nearest to hand in saying to the gentleman on her rightwho was by the same token the gentleman on her hostesss leftthat she scarce even then knew where she was the words marking her first full sense of a situation really romantic they were already dining she and her friend at lancaster gate and surrounded as it seemed to her with every english accessory though her consciousness of mrs lowders existence and still more of her remarkable identity had been of so recent and so sudden a birth susie as she was apt to call her companion for a lighter change had only had to wave a neat little wand for the fairytale to begin at once in consequence of which susie now glitteredfor with mrs stringhams new sense of success it came to thatin the character of a fairy godmother milly had almost insisted on dressing her for the present occasion as one and it was no fault of the girls if the good lady had not now appeared in a peaked hat a short petticoat and diamond shoebuckles brandishing the magic crutch the good lady in truth bore herself not less contentedly than if these insignia had marked her work and millys observation to lord mark had just been doubtless the result of such a light exchange of looks with her as even the great length of the table had not baffled there were twenty persons between them but this sustained passage was the sharpest sequel yet to that other comparison of views during the pause on the swiss pass it almost appeared to milly that their fortune had been unduly precipitatedas if properly they were in the position of having ventured on a small joke and found the answer out of proportion grave she could not at this moment for instance have said whether with her quickened perceptions she were more enlivened or oppressed and the case might in fact have been serious had she not by good fortune from the moment the picture loomed quickly made up her mind that what finally most concerned her was neither to seek nor to shirk was not even to wonder too much but was to let things come as they would since there was little enough doubt of how they would go  lord mark had been brought to her before dinnernot by mrs lowder but by the handsome girl that ladys niece who was now at the other end and on the same side as susie he had taken her in and she meant presently to ask him about miss croy the handsome girl actually offered to her sightthough now in a splendid waybut for the second time the first time had been the occasiononly three days beforeof her calling at their hotel with her aunt and then making for our other two heroines a great impression of beauty and eminence this impression had remained so with milly that at present and although her attention was aware at the same time of everything else her eyes were mainly engaged with kate croy when not engaged with susie that wonderful creatures eyes moreover readily met themshe ranked now as a wonderful creature and it seemed a part of the swift prosperity of the american visitors that so little in the original reckoning she should yet appear conscious charmingly frankly conscious of possibilities of friendship for them milly had easily and as a guest gracefully generalised english girls had a special strong beauty and it particularly showed in evening dressabove all when as was strikingly the case with this one the dress itself was what it should be that observation she had all ready for lord mark when they should after a little get round to it she seemed even now to see that there might be a good deal they would get round to the indication being that taken up once for all with her other neighbour their hostess would leave them much to themselves mrs lowders other neighbour was the bishop of murruma real bishop such as milly had never seen with a complicated costume a voice like an oldfashioned wind instrument and a face all the portrait of a prelate while the gentleman on our young ladys left a gentleman thicknecked large and literal who looked straight before him and as if he were not to be diverted by vain words from that pursuit clearly counted as an offset to the possession of lord mark as milly made out these thingswith a shade of exhilaration at the way she already fell inshe saw how she was justified of her plea for people and her love of life it wasnt then as the prospect seemed to show so difficult to get into the current or to stand at any rate on the bank it was easy to get nearif they were near and yet the elements were different enough from any of her old elements and positively rich and strange  she asked herself if her righthand neighbour would understand what she meant by such a description of them should she throw it off but another of the things to which precisely her sense was awakened was that no decidedly he wouldnt it was nevertheless by this time open to her that his line would be to be clever and indeed evidently no little of the interest was going to be in the fresh reference and fresh effect both of peoples cleverness and of their simplicity she thrilled she consciously flushed and turned pale with the certitudeit had never been so presentthat she should find herself completely involved the very air of the place the pitch of the occasion had for her so positive a taste and so deep an undertone the smallest things the faces the hands the jewels of the women the sound of words especially of names across the table the shape of the forks the arrangement of the flowers the attitude of the servants the walls of the room were all touches in a picture and denotements in a play and they marked for her moreover her alertness of vision she had never she might well believe been in such a state of vibration her sensibility was almost too sharp for her comfort there were for example more indications than she could reduce to order in the manner of the friendly niece who struck her as distinguished and interesting as in fact surprisingly genial this young womans type had visibly other possibilities yet here of its own free movement it had already sketched a relation were they miss croy and she to take up the tale where their two elders had left it off so many years beforewere they to find they liked each other and to try for themselves if a scheme of constancy on more modern lines could be worked she had doubted as they came to england of maud manningham had believed her a broken reed and a vague resource had seen their dependence on her as a state of mind that would have been shamefully sillyso far as it was dependencehad they wished to do any thing so inane as get into society to have made their pilgrimage all for the sake of such society as mrs lowder might have in reserve for themthat didnt bear thinking of at all and she herself had quite chosen her course for curiosity about other matters she would have described this curiosity as a desire to see the places she had read about and that description of her motive she was prepared to give her neighboureven though as a consequence of it he should find how little she had read it was almost at present as if her poor prevision had been rebuked by the majestyshe could scarcely call it lessof the event or at all events by the commanding character of the two figuresshe could scarcely call that less eithermainly presented mrs lowder and her niece however dissimilar had at least in common that each was a great reality that was true primarily of the auntso true that milly wondered how her own companion had arrived in other days at so odd an alliance yet she none the less felt mrs lowder as a person of whom the mind might in two or three days roughly make the circuit she would sit there massive at least while one attempted it whereas miss croy the handsome girl would indulge in incalculable movements that might interfere with ones tour she was real none the less and everything and everybody were real and it served them right no doubt the pair of them for having rushed into their adventure  lord marks intelligence meanwhile however had met her own quite sufficiently to enable him to tell her how little he could clear up her situation he explained for that matteror at least he hintedthat there was no such thing today in london as saying where any one was every one was everywherenobody was anywhere he should be put to ityes franklyto give a name of any sort or kind to their hostesss set was it a set at all or wasnt it and were there not really no such things as sets in the place any morewas there any thing but the senseless shifting tumble like that of some great greasy sea in midchannel of an overwhelming melted mixture he threw out the question which seemed large milly felt that at the end of five minutes he had thrown out a great many though he followed none more than a step or two perhaps he would prove suggestive but he helped her as yet to no discriminations he spoke as if he had given them up from too much knowledge he was thus at the opposite extreme from herself but as a consequence of it also wandering and lost and he was furthermore for all his temporary incoherence to which she guessed there would be some key as great a reality as either mrs lowder or kate the only light in which he placed the former of these ladies was that of an extraordinary womana most extraordinary woman and the more extraordinary the more one knows her while of the latter he said nothing for the moment but that she was tremendously yes quite tremendously goodlooking it was some time she thought before his talk showed his cleverness and yet each minute she believed in it more quite apart from what her hostess had told her on first naming him perhaps he was one of the cases she had heard of at homethose characteristic cases of people in england who concealed their play of mind so much more than they showed it even mr densher a little did that and what made lord mark at any rate so real either when this was a thing he so definitely insisted on his type some how as by a life a need an intention of its own insisted for him but that was all it was difficult to guess his agewhether he were a young man who looked old or an old man who looked young it seemed to prove nothing as against other things that he was bald and as might have been said slightly stale or more delicately perhaps dry there was such a fine little fidget of preoccupied life in him and his eyes at momentsthough it was an appearance they could suddenly losewere as candid and clear as those of a pleasant boy very neat very light and so fair that there was little other indication of his moustache than his constantly feeling itwhich was again boyishhe would have affected her as the most intellectual person present if he had not affected her as the most frivolous the latter quality was rather in his look than in anything else though he constantly wore his double eyeglass which was much more bostonian and thoughtful  the idea of his frivolity had no doubt to do with his personal designation which representedas yet for our young woman a little confusedlya connection with an historic patriciate a class that in turn also confusedly represented an affinity with a social element that she had never heard otherwise described than as fashion the supreme social element in new york had never known itself but as reduced to that category and though milly was aware that as applied to a territorial and political aristocracy the label was probably too simple she had for the time none other at hand she presently it is true enriched her idea with the perception that her interlocutor was indifferent yet this indifferent as aristocracies notoriously were saw her but little further inasmuch as she felt that in the first place he would much rather get on with her than not and in the second was only thinking of too many matters of his own if he kept her in view on the one hand and kept so much else on the otherthe way he crumbed up his bread was a proofwhy did he hover before her as a potentially insolent noble she couldnt have answered the question and it was precisely one of those that swarmed they were complicated she might fairly have said by his visibly knowing having known from afar off that she was a stranger and an american and by his none the less making no more of it than if she and her like were the chief of his diet he took her kindly enough but imperturbably irreclaimably for granted and it wouldnt in the least help that she herself knew him as quickly for having been in her country and threshed it out there would be nothing for her to explain or attenuate or brag about she could neither escape nor prevail by her strangeness he would have for that matter on such a subject more to tell her than to learn from her she might learn from him why she was so different from the handsome girlwhich she didnt know being merely able to feel it or at any rate might learn from him why the handsome girl was so different from her  on these lines however they would move later the lines immediately laid down were in spite of his vagueness for his own convenience definite enough she was already he observed to her thinking what she should say on her other sidewhich was what americans were always doing she neednt in conscience say anything at all but americans never knew that nor ever poor creatures yes she had interposed the poor creatures what not to do the burdens they took onthe things positively they made an affair of this easy and after all friendly jibe at her race was really for her on her new friends part the note of personal recognition so far as she required it and she gave him a prompt and conscious example of morbid anxiety by insisting that her desire to be herself lovely all round was justly founded on the lovely way mrs lowder had met her he was directly interested in that and it was not till afterwards that she fully knew how much more information about their friend he had taken than given here again for instance was a pertinent note for her she had on the spot with her first plunge into the obscure depths of a society constituted from far back encountered the interesting phenomenon of complicated of possibly sinister motive however maud manningham her name even in her presence somehow still fed the fancy had all the same been lovely and one was going to meet her now quite as far on as one had ones self been met she had been with them at their hotelthey were a pairbefore even they had supposed she could have got their letter of course indeed they had written in advance but they had followed that up very fast she had thus engaged them to dine but two days later and on the morrow again without waiting for a return visit waiting for anything she had called with her niece it was as if she really cared for them and it was magnificent fidelityfidelity to mrs stringham her own companion and mrs lowders former schoolmate the lady with the charming face and the rather high dress down there at the end  lord mark took in through his nippers these balanced attributes of susie but isnt mrs stringhams fidelity then equally magnificent  well its a beautiful sentiment but it isnt as if she had anything to give  hasnt she got you lord mark presently asked  meto give mrs lowder milly had clearly not yet seen herself in the light of such an offering oh im rather a poor present and i dont feel as if even at that ive as yet quite been given  youve been shown and if our friend has jumped at you it comes to the same thing he made his jokes lord mark without amusement for himself yet it wasnt that he was grim to be seen you must recognise is for you to be jumped at and if its a question of being shown here you are again only it has now been taken out of your friends hands its mrs lowder already whos getting the benefit look round the table and youll make out i think that youre being from top to bottom jumped at  well then said milly i seem also to feel that i like it better than being made fun of  it was one of the things she afterwards sawmilly was for ever seeing things afterwardsthat her companion had here had some way of his own quite unlike any ones else of assuring her of his consideration she wondered how he had done it for he had neither apologised nor protested she said to herself at any rate that he had led her on and what was most odd was the question by which he had done so does she know much about you  no she just likes us  even for this his travelled lordship seasoned and saturated had no laugh i mean you particularly has that lady with the charming face which is charming told her  milly hesitated told her what  everything  this with the way he dropped it again considerably moved hermade her feel for a moment that as a matter of course she was a subject for disclosures but she quickly found her answer oh as for that you must ask her  your clever companion  mrs lowder  he replied to this that their hostess was a person with whom there were certain liberties one never took but that he was none the less fairly upheld inasmuch as she was for the most part kind to him and as should he be very good for a while she would probably herself tell him and i shall have at any rate in the meantime the interest of seeing what she does with you that will teach me more or less you see how much she knows  milly followed thisit was lucid but it suggested something apart how much does she know about you  nothing said lord mark serenely but that doesnt matterfor what she does with me and then as to anticipate millys question about the nature of such doing this for instanceturning me straight on for you  the girl thought and you mean she wouldnt if she did know  he met it as if it were really a point no i believe to do her justice she still would so you can be easy  milly had the next instant then acted on the permission because youre even at the worst the best thing she has  with this he was at last amused i was till you came youre the best now  it was strange his words should have given her the sense of his knowing but it was positive that they did so and to the extent of making her believe them though still with wonder that really from this first of their meetings was what was most to abide with her she accepted almost helplessly she surrendered to the inevitability of being the sort of thing as he might have said that he at least thoroughly believed he had in going about seen here enough of for all practical purposes her submission was naturally moreover not to be impaired by her learning later on that he had paid at short intervals though at a time apparently just previous to her own emergence from the obscurity of extreme youth three separate visits to new york where his nameable friends and his contrasted contacts had been numerous his impression his recollection of the whole mixed quantity was still visibly rich it had helped him to place her and she was more and more sharply conscious of havingas with the door sharply slammed upon her and the guards hand raised in signal to the trainbeen popped into the compartment in which she was to travel for him it was a use of her that many a girl would have been doubtless quick to resent and the kind of mind that thus in our young lady made all for mere seeing and taking is precisely one of the charms of our subject milly had practically just learned from him had made out as it were from her rumbling compartment that he gave her the highest place among their friends actual properties she was a success that was what it came to he presently assured her and that was what it was to be a success it always happened before one could know it ones ignorance was in fact often the greatest part of it you havent had time yet he said this is nothing but youll see youll see everything you can you knoweverything you dream of  he made her more and more wonder she almost felt as if he were showing her visions while he spoke and strangely enough though it was visions that had drawn her on she hadnt seen them in connectionthat is in such preliminary and necessary connectionwith such a face as lord marks such eyes and such a voice such a tone and such a manner he had for an instant the effect of making her ask herself if she were after all going to be afraid so distinct was it for fifty seconds that a fear passed over her there they were againyes certainly susies overture to mrs lowder had been their joke but they had pressed in that gaiety an electric bell that continued to sound positively while she sat there she had the loud rattle in her ears and she wondered during these moments why the others didnt hear it they didnt stare they didnt smile and the fear in her that i speak of was but her own desire to stop it that dropped however as if the alarm itself had ceased she seemed to have seen in a quick though tempered glare that there were two courses for her one to leave london again the first thing in the morning the other to do nothing at all well she would do nothing at all she was already doing it more than that she had already done it and her chance was gone she gave herself upshe had the strangest sense on the spot of so deciding for she had turned a corner before she went on again with lord mark inexpressive but intensely significant he met as no one else could have done the very question she had suddenly put to mrs stringham on the br√ºnig should she have it whatever she did have that question had been for long ah so possibly not her neighbour appeared to reply therefore dont you see im the way it was vivid that he might be in spite of his absence of flourish the way being doubtless just in that absence the handsome girl whom she didnt lose sight of and who she felt kept her also in viewmrs lowders striking niece would perhaps be the way as well for in her too was the absence of flourish though she had little else so far as one could tell in common with lord mark yet how indeed could one tell what did one understand and of what was one for that matter provisionally conscious but of their being somehow together in what they represented kate croy fine but friendly looked over at her as really with a guess at lord marks effect on her if she could guess this effect what then did she know about it and in what degree had she felt it herself did that represent as between them anything particular and should she have to count with them as duplicating as intensifying by a mutual intelligence the relation into which she was sinking nothing was so odd as that she should have to recognise so quickly in each of these glimpses of an instant the various signs of a relation and this anomaly itself had she had more time to give to it might well might almost terribly have suggested to her that her doom was to live fast it was queerly a question of the short run and the consciousness proportionately crowded  these were immense excursions for the spirit of a young person at mrs lowders mere dinnerparty but what was so significant and so admonitory as the fact of their being possible what could they have been but just a part already of the crowded consciousness and it was just a part likewise that while plates were changed and dishes presented and periods in the banquet marked while appearances insisted and phenomena multiplied and words reached her from here and there like plashes of a slow thick tide while mrs lowder grew somehow more stout and more instituted and susie at her distance and in comparison more thinly improvised and more differentdifferent that is from every one and everything it was just a part that while this process went forward our young lady alighted came back taking up her destiny again as if she had been able by a wave or two of her wings to place herself briefly in sight of an alternative to it whatever it was it had showed in this brief interval as better than the alternative and it now presented itself altogether in the image and in the place in which she had left it the image was that of her being as lord mark had declared a success this depended more or less of course on his idea of the thinginto which at present however she wouldnt go but renewing soon she had asked him what he meant then that mrs lowder would do with her and he had replied that this might safely be left shell get back he pleasantly said her money he could say it toowhich was singularwithout affecting her either as vulgar or as nasty  and he had soon explained himself by adding nobody here you know does anything for nothing  ah if you mean that we shall reward her as hard as ever we can nothing is more certain but shes an idealist milly continued and idealists in the long run i think dont feel that they lose  lord mark seemed within the limits of his enthusiasm to find this charming ah she strikes you as an idealist  she idealises us my friend and me absolutely she sees us in a light said milly thats all ive got to hold on by so dont deprive me of it  i wouldnt for the world but do you think he continued as if it were suddenly important for himdo you think she sees me in a light  she neglected his question for a little partly because her attention attached itself more and more to the handsome girl partly because placed so near their hostess she wished not to show as discussing her too freely mrs lowder it was true steering in the other quarter a course in which she called at subjects as if they were islets in an archipelago continued to allow them their ease and kate croy at the same time steadily revealed herself as interesting milly in fact found of a sudden her easefound it allas she bethought herself that what mrs lowder was really arranging for was a report on her quality and as perhaps might be said her value from lord mark she wished him the wonderful lady to have no pretext for not knowing what he thought of miss theale why his judgment so mattered remained to be seen but it was this divination in any case that now determined millys rejoinder no she knows you she has probably reason to and you all here know each otheri see thatso far as you know anything you know what youre used to and its your being used to itthat and that onlythat makes you but there are things you dont know  he took it in as if it might fairly to do him justice be a point things that i dontwith all the pains i take and the way ive run about the world to leave nothing unlearned  milly thought and it was perhaps the very truth of his claimits not being negligiblethat sharpened her impatience and thereby her wit youre blas√© but youre not enlightened youre familiar with everything but conscious really of nothing what i mean is that youve no imagination  lord mark at this threw back his head ranging with his eyes the opposite side of the room and showing himself at last so much more completely as diverted that it fairly attracted their hostesss notice mrs lowder however only smiled on milly for a sign that something racy was what she had expected and resumed with a splash of her screw her cruise among the islands oh ive heard that the young man replied before  there it is then youve heard everything before youve heard me of course before in my country often enough  oh never too often he protested im sure i hope i shall still hear you again and again  but what good then has it done you the girl went on as if now frankly to amuse him  oh youll see when you know me  but most assuredly i shall never know you  then that will be exactly he laughed the good  if it established thus that they couldnt or wouldnt mix why none the less did milly feel through it a perverse quickening of the relation to which she had been in spite of herself appointed  what queerer consequence of their not mixing than their talkingfor it was what they had arrived atalmost intimately she wished to get away from him or indeed much rather away from herself so far as she was present to him she saw alreadywonderful creature after all herself toothat there would be a good deal more of him to come for her and that the special sign of their intercourse would be to keep herself out of the question everything else might come inonly never that and with such an arrangement they might even go far this in fact might quite have begun on the spot with her returning again to the topic of the handsome girl if she was to keep herself out she could naturally best do so by putting in somebody else she accordingly put in kate croy being ready to that extentas she was not at all afraid for herto sacrifice her if necessary lord mark himself for that matter had made it easy by saying a little while before that no one among them did anything for nothing what thenshe was aware of being abruptdoes miss croy if shes so interested do it for what has she to gain by her lovely welcome look at her now milly broke out with characteristic freedom of praise though pulling herself up also with a compunctious oh as the direction thus given to their eyes happened to coincide with a turn of kates face to them all she had meant to do was to insist that this face was fine but what she had in fact done was to renew again her effect of showing herself to its possessor as conjoined with lord mark for some interested view of it he had however promptly met her question  to gain why your acquaintance  well whats my acquaintance to her she can care for meshe must feel thatonly by being sorry for me and thats why shes lovely to be already willing to take the trouble to be its the height of the disinterested  there were more things in this than one that lord mark might have taken up but in a minute he had made his choice ah then im nowhere for im afraid im not sorry for you in the least what do you make then he asked of your success  why just the great reason of all its just because our friend there sees it that she pities me she understands milly said shes better than any of you shes beautiful  he appeared struck with this at lastwith the point the girl made of it to which she came back even after a diversion created by a dish presented between them beautiful in character i see is she so you must tell me about her  milly wondered but havent you known her longer than i havent you seen her for yourself  noive failed with her its no use i dont make her out and i assure you i really should like to his assurance had in fact for his companion a positive suggestion of sincerity he affected her as now saying something that he felt and she was the more struck with it as she was still conscious of the failure even of curiosity he had just shown in respect to herself she had meant somethingthough indeed for herself almost onlyin speaking of their friends natural pity it had been a note doubtless of questionable taste but it had quavered out in spite of her and he had not so much as cared to inquire why natural not that it wasnt really much better for her that he shouldnt explanations would in truth have taken her much too far only she now perceived that in comparison her word about this other person really drew him and there were things in that probably many things as to which she would learn more and which glimmered there already as part and parcel of that larger real with which in her new situation she was to be beguiled it was in fact at the very moment this element not absent from what lord mark was further saying so youre wrong you see as to our knowing all about each other there are cases where we break down i at any rate give her upup that is to you you must do her for metell me i mean when you know more youll notice he pleasantly wound up that ive confidence in you  why shouldnt you have milly asked observing in this as she thought a fine though for such a man a surprisingly artless fatuity it was as if there might have been a question of her falsifying for the sake of her own showthat is of her honesty not being proof against her desire to keep well with him herself she didnt none the less otherwise protest against his remark there was something else she was occupied in seeing it was the handsome girl alone one of his own species and his own society who had made him feel uncertain of his certainties about a mere little american a cheap exotic imported almost wholesale and whose habitat with its conditions of climate growth and cultivation its immense profusion but its few varieties and thin development he was perfectly satisfied the marvel was too that milly understood his satisfactionfeeling that she expressed the truth in presently saying of course i make out that she must be difficult just as i see that i myself must be easy and that was what for all the rest of this occasion remained with heras the most interesting thing that could remain she was more and more content herself to be easy she would have been resigned even had it been brought straighter home to her to passing for a cheap exotic provisionally at any rate that protected her wish to keep herself with lord mark in abeyance they had all affected her as inevitably knowing each other and if the handsome girls place among them was something even their initiation couldnt deal withwhy then she would indeed be a quantity   viii  that sense of quantities separate or mixed was indeed doubtless what most prevailed at first for our slightly gasping american pair it found utterance for them in their frequent remark to each other that they had no one but themselves to thank it dropped from milly more than once that if she had ever known it was so easy though her exclamation mostly ended without completing her idea this however was a trifle to mrs stringham who cared little whether she meant that in this case she would have come sooner she couldnt have come sooner and she perhaps on the contrary meantfor it would have been like herthat she wouldnt have come at all why it was so easy being at any rate a matter as to which her companion had begun quickly to pick up views susie kept some of these lights for the present to herself since freely communicated they might have been a little disturbing with which moreover the quantities that we speak of as surrounding the two ladies were in many cases quantities of thingsand of other thingsto talk about their immediate lesson accordingly was that they just had been caught up by the incalculable strength of a wave that was actually holding them aloft and that would naturally dash them wherever it liked they meanwhile we hasten to add make the best of their precarious position and if milly had had no other help for it she would have found not a little in the sight of susan shepherds state the girl had had nothing to say to her for three days about the success announced by lord markwhich they saw besides otherwise established she was too taken up too touched by susies own exaltation susie glowed in the light of her justified faith everything had happened that she had been acute enough to think least probable she had appealed to a possible delicacy in maud manninghama delicacy mind you but barely possibleand her appeal had been met in a way that was an honour to human nature this proved sensibility of the lady of lancaster gate performed verily for both our friends during these first days the office of a fine floating golddust something that threw over the prospect a harmonising blur the forms the colours behind it were strong and deepwe have seen how they already stood out for milly but nothing comparatively had had so much of the dignity of truth as the fact of mauds fidelity to a sentiment that was what susie was proud of much more than of her great place in the world which she was moreover conscious of not as yet wholly measuring that was what was more vivid even than her beingin senses more worldly and in fact almost in the degree of a revelationenglish and distinct and positive with almost no inward but with the finest outward resonance  susan shepherds word for her again and again was that she was large yet it was not exactly a case as to the soul of echoing chambers she might have been likened rather to a capacious receptacle originally perhaps loose but now drawn as tightly as possible over its accumulated contentsa packed mass for her american admirer of curious detail when the latter good lady at home had handsomely figured her friends as not smallwhich was the way she mostly figured themthere was a certain implication that they were spacious because they were empty mrs lowder by a different law was spacious because she was full because she had something in common even in repose with a projectile of great size loaded and ready for use that indeed to susies romantic mind announced itself as half the charm of their renewala charm as of sitting in springtime during a long peace on the daisied grassy bank of some great slumbering fortress true to her psychological instincts certainly mrs stringham had noted that the sentiment she rejoiced in on her old schoolmates part was all a matter of action and movement was not save for the interweaving of a more frequent plump dearest than she would herself perhaps have used a matter of much other embroidery she brooded with interest on this further remark of race feeling in her own spirit a different economy the joy for her was to know why she actedthe reason was half the business whereas with mrs lowder there might have been no reason why was the trivial seasoningsubstance the vanilla or the nutmeg omittable from the nutritive pudding without spoiling it mrs lowders desire was clearly sharp that their young companions should also prosper together and mrs stringhams account of it all to milly during the first days was that when at lancaster gate she was not occupied in telling as it were about her she was occupied in hearing much of the history of her hostesss brilliant niece  they had plenty on these lines the two elder women to give and to take and it was even not quite clear to the pilgrim from boston that what she should mainly have arranged for in london was not a series of thrills for herself she had a bad conscience indeed almost a sense of immorality in having to recognise that she was as she said carried away she laughed to milly when she also said that she didnt know where it would end and the principal of her uneasiness was that mrs lowders life bristled for her with elements that she was really having to look at for the first time they represented she believed the world the world that as a consequence of the cold shoulder turned to it by the pilgrim fathers had never yet boldly crossed to bostonit would surely have sunk the stoutest cunarderand she couldnt pretend that she faced the prospect simply because milly had had a caprice she was in the act herself of having one directed precisely to their present spectacle she could but seek strength in the thought that she had never had oneor had never yielded to one which came to the same thingbefore the sustaining sense of it all moreover as literary materialthat quite dropped from her she must wait at any rate she should see it struck her so far as she had got as vast obscure lurid she reflected in the watches of the night that she was probably just going to love it for itselfthat is for itself and milly the odd thing was that she could think of millys loving it without dreador with dread at least not on the score of conscience only on the score of peace it was a mercy at all events for the hour that their fancies jumped together  while for this first week that followed their dinner she drank deep at lancaster gate her companion was no less happily appeared to be indeed on the whole quite as romantically provided for the handsome english girl from the heavy english house had been as a figure in a picture stepping by magic out of its frame it was a case in truth for which mrs stringham presently found the perfect image she had lost none of her grasp but quite the contrary of that other conceit in virtue of which milly was the wandering princess so what could be more in harmony now than to see the princess waited upon at the city gate by the worthiest maiden the chosen daughter of the burgesses it was the real again evidently the amusement of the meeting for the princess too princesses living for the most part in such an appeased way on the plane of mere elegant representation that was why they pounced at city gates on deputed flowerstrewing damsels that was why after effigies processions and other stately games frank human company was pleasant to them kate croy really presented herself to millythe latter abounded for mrs stringham in accounts of itas the wondrous london girl in person by what she had conceived from far back of the london girl conceived from the tales of travellers and the anecdotes of new york from old porings over punch and a liberal acquaintance with the fiction of the day the only thing was that she was nicer for the creature in question had rather been to our young woman an image of dread she had thought of her at her best as handsome just as kate was with turns of head and tones of voice felicities of stature and attitude things put on and for that matter put off all the marks of the product of a packed society who should be at the same time the heroine of a strong story she placed this striking young person from the first in a story saw her by a necessity of the imagination for a heroine felt it the only character in which she wouldnt be wasted and this in spite of the heroines pleasant abruptness her forbearance from gush her umbrellas and jackets and shoesas these things sketched themselves to millyand something rather of a breezy boy in the carriage of her arms and the occasional freedom of her slang  when milly had settled that the extent of her goodwill itself made her shy she had found for the moment quite a sufficient key and they were by that time thoroughly afloat together this might well have been the happiest hour they were to know attacking in friendly independence their great londonthe london of shops and streets and suburbs oddly interesting to milly as well as of museums monuments sights oddly unfamiliar to kate while their elders pursued a separate course both rejoicing in their intimacy and each thinking the others young woman a great acquisition for her own milly expressed to susan shepherd more than once that kate had some secret some smothered trouble besides all the rest of her history and that if she had so goodnaturedly helped mrs lowder to meet them this was exactly to create a diversion to give herself something else to think about but on the case thus postulated our young american had as yet had no light she only felt that when the light should come it would greatly deepen the colour and she liked to think she was prepared for anything what she already knew moreover was full to her vision of english of eccentric of thackerayan character kate croy having gradually become not a little explicit on the subject of her situation her past her present her general predicament her small success up to the present hour in contenting at the same time her father her sister her aunt and herself it was millys subtle guess imparted to her susie that the girl had somebody else as well as yet unnamed to content it being manifest that such a creature couldnt help having a creature not perhaps if one would exactly formed to inspire passions since that always implied a certain silliness but essentially seen by the admiring eye of friendship under the clear shadow of some probably eminent male interest the clear shadow from whatever source projected hung at any rate over millys companion the whole week and kate croys handsome face smiled out of it under bland skylights in the presence alike of old masters passive in their glory and of thoroughly new ones the newest who bristled restlessly with pins and brandished snipping shears  it was meanwhile a pretty part of the intercourse of these young ladies that each thought the other more remarkable than herselfthat each thought herself or assured the other she did a comparatively dusty object and the other a favourite of nature and of fortune kate was amused amazed at the way her friend insisted on taking her and milly wondered if kate were sincere in finding her the most extraordinaryquite apart from her being the most charmingperson she had come across they had talked in long drives and quantities of history had not been wantingin the light of which mrs lowders niece might superficially seem to have had the best of the argument her visitors american references with their bewildering immensities their confounding moneyed new york their excitements of high pressure their opportunities of wild freedom their record of usedup relatives parents clever eager fair slim brothersthese the most lovedall engaged as well as successive superseded guardians in a high extravagance of speculation and dissipation that had left this exquisite being her black dress her white face and her vivid hair as the mere last broken link such a picture quite threw into the shade the brief biography however sketchily amplified of a mere middleclass nobody in bayswater and though that indeed might be but a bayswater way of putting it in addition to which milly was in the stage of interest in bayswater ways this critic so far prevailed that like mrs stringham herself she fairly got her companion to accept from her that she was quite the nearest approach to a practical princess bayswater could hope ever to know it was a factit became one at the end of three daysthat milly actually began to borrow from the handsome girl a sort of view of her state the handsome girls impression of it was clearly so sincere this impression was a tribute a tribute positively to power power the source of which was the last thing kate treated as a mystery there were passages under all their skylights the succession of their shops being large in which the latters easy yet the least bit dry manner sufficiently gave out that if she had had so deep a pocket  it was not moreover by any means with not having the imagination of expenditure that she appeared to charge her friend but with not having the imagination of terror of thrift the imagination or in any degree the habit of a conscious dependence on others such moments when all wigmore street for instance seemed to rustle about and the pale girl herself to be facing the different rustlers usually so undiscriminated as individual britons too britons personal parties to a relation and perhaps even intrinsically remarkablesuch moments in especial determined in kate a perception of the high happiness of her companions liberty millys range was thus immense she had to ask nobody for anything to refer nothing to any one her freedom her fortune and her fancy were her law an obsequious world surrounded her she could sniff up at every step its fumes and kate in these days was altogether in the phase of forgiving her so much bliss in the phase moreover of believing that should they continue to go on together she would abide in that generosity she had at such a point as this no suspicion of a rift within the luteby which we mean not only none of anythings coming between them but none of any definite flaw in so much clearness of quality yet all the same if milly at mrs lowders banquet had described herself to lord mark as kindly used by the young woman on the other side because of some faintlyfelt special propriety in it so there really did match with this privately on the young womans part a feeling not analysed but divided a latent impression that mildred theale was not after all a person to change places to change even chances with kate verily would perhaps not quite have known what she meant by this reservation and she came near naming it only when she said to herself that rich as milly was one probably wouldntwhich was singularever hate her for it the handsome girl had with herself these felicities and crudities it wasnt obscure to her that without some very particular reason to help it might have proved a test of ones philosophy not to be irritated by a mistress of millions or whatever they were who as a girl so easily might have been like herself only vague and fatally female she was by no means sure of liking aunt maud as much as she deserved and aunt mauds command of funds was obviously inferior to millys there was thus clearly as pleading for the latter some influence that would later on become distinct and meanwhile decidedly it was enough that she was as charming as she was queer and as queer as she was charmingall of which was a rare amusement as well for that matter as further sufficient that there were objects of value she had already pressed on kates acceptance a week of her society in these conditionsconditions that milly chose to sum up as ministering immensely for a blind vague pilgrim to aid and comfortannounced itself from an early hour as likely to become a week of presents acknowledgments mementos pledges of gratitude and admiration that were all on one side kate as promptly embraced the propriety of making it clear that she must forswear shops till she should receive some guarantee that the contents of each one she entered as a humble companion should not be placed at her feet yet that was in truth not before she had found herself in possession under whatever protests of several precious ornaments and other minor conveniences  great was the absurdity too that there should have come a day by the end of the week when it appeared that all milly would have asked in definite return as might be said was to be told a little about lord mark and to be promised the privilege of a visit to mrs condrip far other amusements had been offered her but her eagerness was shamelessly human and she seemed really to count more on the revelation of the anxious lady of chelsea than on the best nights of the opera kate admired and showed it such an absence of fear to the fear of being bored in such a connection she would have been so obviously entitled millys answer to this was the plea of her curiositieswhich left her friend wondering as to their odd direction some among them no doubt were rather more intelligible and kate had heard without wonder that she was blank about lord mark this young ladys account of him at the same time professed itself as frankly imperfect for what they best knew him by at lancaster gate was a thing difficult to explain one knew people in general by something they had to show something that either for them or against could be touched or named or proved and she could think of no other case of a value taken as so great and yet flourishing untested his value was his future which had somehow got itself as accepted by aunt maud as if it had been his good cook or his steamlaunch she kate didnt mean she thought him a humbug he might do great thingsbut they were all as yet so to speak he had done on the other hand it was of course something of an achievement and not open to every one to have got ones self taken so seriously by aunt maud the best thing about him doubtless on the whole was that aunt maud believed in him she was often fantastic but she knew a humbug andno lord mark wasnt that he had been a short time in the house on the tory side but had lost his seat on the first opportunity and this was all he had to point to however he pointed to nothing which was very possibly just a sign of his real cleverness one of those that the really clever had in common with the really void even aunt maud frequently admitted that there was a good deal for her view of him to come up in the rear and he wasnt meanwhile himself indifferentindifferent to himselffor he was working lancaster gate for all it was worth just as it was no doubt working him and just as the working and the worked were in london as one might explain the parties to every relation  kate did explain for her listening friend every one who had anything to giveit was true they were the fewestmade the sharpest possible bargain for it got at least its value in return the strangest thing furthermore was that this might be in cases a happy understanding the worker in one connection was the worked in another it was as broad as it was longwith the wheels of the system as might be seen wonderfully oiled people could quite like each other in the midst of it as aunt maud by every appearance quite liked lord mark and as lord mark it was to be hoped liked mrs lowder since if he didnt he was a greater brute than one could believe she kate had not yet it was true made out what he was doing for herbesides which the dear woman needed him even at the most he could do much less than she imagined so far as all of which went moreover there were plenty of things on every side she had not yet made out she believed on the whole in any one aunt maud took up and she gave it to milly as worth thinking of that whatever wonderful people this young lady might meet in the land she would meet no more extraordinary woman there were greater celebrities by the million and of course greater swells but a bigger person by kates view and a larger natural handful every way would really be far to seek when milly inquired with interest if kates belief in her was primarily on the lines of what mrs lowder took up her interlocutress could handsomely say yes since by the same principle she believed in herself whom but aunt mauds niece preeminently had aunt maud taken up and who was thus more in the current with her of working and of being worked you may ask kate said what in the world i have to give and that indeed is just what im trying to learn there must be something for her to think she can get it out of me she will get ittrust her and then i shall see what it is which i beg you to believe i should never have found out for myself she declined to treat any question of millys own paying power as discussable that milly would pay a hundred per centand even to the end doubtless through the nosewas just the beautiful basis on which they found themselves  these were fine facilities pleasantries ironies all these luxuries of gossip and philosophies of london and of life and they became quickly between the pair the common form of talk milly professing herself delighted to know that something was to be done with her if the most remarkable woman in england was to do it so much the better and if the most remarkable woman in england had them both in hand together why what could be jollier for each when she reflected indeed a little on the oddity of her wanting two at once kate had the natural reply that it was exactly what showed her sincerity she invariably gave way to feeling and feeling had distinctly popped up in her on the advent of her girlhoods friend the way the cat would jump was always in presence of anything that moved her interesting to see visibly enough moreover for a long time it hadnt jumped anything like so far this in fact as we already know remained the marvel for milly theale who on sight of mrs lowder found fifty links in respect to susie absent from the chain of association she knew so herself what she thought of susie that she would have expected the lady of lancaster gate to think something quite different the failure of which endlessly mystified her but her mystification was the cause for her of another fine impression inasmuch as when she went so far as to observe to kate that susan shepherdand especially susan shepherd emerging so uninvited from an irrelevant pastought by all the proprieties simply to have bored aunt maud her confidant agreed with her without a protest and abounded in the sense of her wonder susan shepherd at least bored the niecethat was plain this young woman saw nothing in hernothing to account for anything not even for millys own indulgence which little fact became in turn to the latters mind a fact of significance it was a light on the handsome girlrepresenting more than merely showedthat poor susie was simply as nought to her this was in a manner too a general admonition to poor susies companion who seemed to see marked by it the direction in which she had best most look out  it just faintly rankled in her that a person who was good enough and to spare for milly theale shouldnt be good enough for another girl though oddly enough she could easily have forgiven mrs lowder herself the impatience mrs lowder didnt feel it and kate croy felt it with ease yet in the end be it added she grasped the reason and the reason enriched her mind wasnt it sufficiently the reason that the handsome girl was with twenty other splendid qualities the least bit brutal too and didnt she suggest as no one yet had ever done for her new friend that there might be a wild beauty in that and even a strange grace kate wasnt brutally brutalwhich milly had hitherto benightedly supposed the only way she wasnt even aggressively so but rather indifferently defensively and as might be said by the habit of anticipation she simplified in advance was beforehand with her doubts and knew with singular quickness what she wasnt as they said in new york going to like in that way at least people were clearly quicker in england than at home and milly could quite see after a little how such instincts might become usual in a world in which dangers abounded there were more dangers clearly round about lancaster gate than one suspected in new york or could dream of in boston at all events with more sense of them there were more precautions and it was a remarkable world altogether in which there could be precautions on whatever ground against susie   ix  she certainly made up with susie directly however for any allowance she might have had privately to extend to tepid appreciation since the late and long talks of these two embraced not only everything offered and suggested by the hours they spent apart but a good deal more besides she might be as detached as the occasion required at four oclock in the afternoon but she used no such freedom to any one about anything as she habitually used about everything to susan shepherd at midnight all the same it should with much less delay than this have been mentioned she had not yethad not that is at the end of six daysproduced any news for her comrade to compare with an announcement made her by the latter as a result of a drive with mrs lowder for a change in the remarkable battersea park the elder friends had sociably revolved there while the younger ones followed bolder fancies in the admirable equipage appointed to milly at the hotela heavier more emblazoned more amusing chariot than she had ever with stables notoriously mismanaged known at home whereby in the course of the circuit more than once repeated it had come out as mrs stringham said that the couple at lancaster gate were of all people acquainted with mildreds other english friendthe gentleman the one connected with the english newspaper susie hung fire a little over his name who had been with her in new york so shortly previous to present adventures he had been named of course in battersea parkelse he couldnt have been identified and susie had naturally before she could produce her own share in the matter as a kind of confession to make it plain that her allusion was to mr merton densher this was because milly had at first a little air of not knowing whom she meant and the girl really kept as well a certain control of herself while she remarked that the case was surprising the chance one in a thousand they knew him both maud and miss croy knew him she gathered too rather well though indeed it was not on any show of intimacy that he had happened to be mentioned it had not beensusie made the pointshe herself who brought him in he had in fact not been brought in at all but only referred to as a young journalist known to mrs lowder and who had lately gone to their wonderful countrymrs lowder always said your wonderful countryon behalf of his journal but mrs stringham had taken it upwith the tips of her fingers indeed and that was the confession she had without meaning any harm recognised mr densher as an acquaintance of millys though she had also pulled herself up before getting in too far mrs lowder had been struck clearlyit wasnt too much to say then she also it had rather seemed had pulled herself up and there had been a little moment during which each might have been keeping something from the other only said millys mate i luckily remembered in time that i had nothing whatever to keepwhich was much simpler and nicer i dont know what maud has but there it is she was interested distinctly in your knowing himin his having met you over there with so little loss of time but i ventured to tell her it hadnt been so long as to make you as yet great friends i dont know if i was right  whatever time this explanation might have taken there had been moments enough in the matter nowbefore the elder womans conscience had done itself justiceto enable milly to reply that although the fact in question doubtless had its importance she imagined they wouldnt find the importance overwhelming it was odd that their one englishman should so instantly fit it wasnt however miraculousthey surely all had often seen that as every one said the world was extraordinarily small undoubtedly too susie had done just the plain thing in not letting his name pass why in the world should there be a mysteryand what an immense one they would appear to have made if he should come back and find they had concealed their knowledge of him i dont know susie dear the girl observed what you think i have to conceal  it doesnt matter at a given moment mrs stringham returned what you know or dont know as to what i think for you always find out the very next moment and when you do find out dearest you never really care only she presently asked have you heard of him from miss croy  heard of mr densher never a word we havent mentioned him why should we  that you havent i understand but that she hasnt susie opined may mean something  may mean what  well mrs stringham presently brought out i tell you all when i tell you that maud asks me to suggest to you that it may perhaps be better for the present not to speak of him not to speak of him to her niece that is unless she herself speaks to you first but maud thinks she wont  milly was ready to engage for anything but in respect to the factsas they so far possessed themit all sounded a little complicated is it because theres anything between them  noi gather not but mauds state of mind is precautionary shes afraid of something or perhaps it would be more correct to say shes afraid of everything  shes afraid you mean milly asked of theiraliking each other  susie had an intense thought and then an effusion my dear child we move in a labyrinth  of course we do thats just the fun of it said milly with a strange gaiety then she added dont tell me thatin this for instancethere are not abysses i want abysses  her friend looked at herit was not unfrequently the casea little harder than the surface of the occasion seemed to require and another person present at such times might have wondered to what inner thought of her own the good lady was trying to fit the speech it was too much her disposition no doubt to treat her young companions words as symptoms of an imputed malady it was none the less however her highest law to be light when the girl was light she knew how to be quaint with the new quaintnessthe great boston gift it had been happily her note in the magazines and maud lowder to whom it was new indeed and who had never heard anything remotely like it quite cherished her as a social resource for it it should not therefore fail her now with it in fact one might face most things ah then let us hope we shall sound the depthsim prepared for the worstof sorrow and sin but she would like her niecewere not ignorant of that are weto marry lord mark hasnt she told you so  hasnt mrs lowder told me  no hasnt kate it isnt you know that she doesnt know it  milly had under her comrades eyes a minute of mute detachment she had lived with kate croy for several days in a state of intimacy as deep as it had been sudden and they had clearly in talk in many directions proceeded to various extremities yet it now came over her as in a clear cold way that there was a possible account of their relations in which the quantity her new friend had told her might have figured as small as smallest beside the quantity she hadnt she couldnt say at any rate whether or no she had made the point that her aunt designed her for lord mark it had only sufficiently come outwhich had been moreover eminently guessablethat she was involved in her aunts designs somehow for milly brush it over nervously as she might and with whatever simplifying hand this abrupt extrusion of mr densher altered all proportions had an effect on all values it was fantastic of her to let it make a difference that she couldnt in the least have definedand she was at least even during these instants rather proud of being able to hide on the spot the difference it did make yet all the same the effect for her was almost violently of mr denshers having been therehaving been where she had stood till now in her simplicitybefore her it would have taken but another free moment to make her see abyssessince abysses were what she wantedin the mere circumstance of his own silence in new york about his english friends there had really been in new york little time for anything but had she liked milly could have made it out for herself that he had avoided the subject of miss croy and that miss croy was yet a subject it could never be natural to avoid it was to be added at the same time that even if his silence had been labyrinthewhich was absurd in view of all the other things too he couldnt possibly have spoken ofthis was exactly what must suit her since it fell under the head of the plea she had just uttered to susie these things however came and went and it set itself up between the companions for the occasion in the oddest way both that their happening all to know mr densherexcept indeed that susie didnt but probably wouldwas a fact belonging in a world of rushing about to one of the common orders of chance and yet further that it was amusingoh awfully amusingto be able fondly to hope that there was something in its having been left to crop up with such suddenness there seemed somehow a possibility that the ground or as it were the air might in a manner have undergone some pleasing preparation though the question of this possibility would probably after all have taken some threshing out the truth moreoverand there they were already our pair talking about it the truthhad not in fact quite cropped out this obviously in view of mrs lowders request to her old friend  it was accordingly on mrs lowders recommendation that nothing should be said to kateit was on this rich attitude of aunt mauds that the idea of an interesting complication might best hope to perch and when in fact after the colloquy we have reported milly saw kate again without mentioning any name her silence succeeded in passing muster with her as the beginning of a new sort of fun the sort was all the newer by reason of its containing a small element of anxiety when she had gone in for fun before it had been with her hands a little more free yet it was none the less rather exciting to be conscious of a still sharper reason for interest in the handsome girl as kate continued even now preeminently to remain for her and a reasonthis was the great pointof which the young woman herself could have no suspicion twice over thus for two or three hours together milly found herself seeing kate quite fixing her in the light of the knowledge that it was a face on which mr denshers eyes had more or less familiarly rested and which by the same token had looked rather more beautifully than less into his own she pulled herself up indeed with the thought that it had inevitably looked as beautifully as one would into thousands of faces in which one might ones self never trace it but just the odd result of the thought was to intensify for the girl that side of her friend which she had doubtless already been more prepared than she quite knew to think of as the other the not wholly calculable it was fantastic and milly was aware of this but the other side was what had of a sudden been turned straight towards her by the show of mr denshers propinquity she hadnt the excuse of knowing it for kates own since nothing whatever as yet proved it particularly to be such never mind it was with this other side now fully presented that kate came and went kissed her for greeting and for parting talked as usual of everything butas it had so abruptly become for millythe thing our young woman it is true would doubtless not have tasted so sharply a difference in this pair of occasions had she not been tasting so peculiarly her own possible betrayals what happened was that afterwards on separation she wondered if the matter had not mainly been that she herself was so other so taken up with the unspoken the strangest thing of all being still subsequently that when she asked herself how kate could have failed to feel it she became conscious of being here on the edge of a great darkness she should never know how kate truly felt about anything such a one as milly theale should give her to feel kate would neverand not from illwill nor from duplicity but from a sort of failure of common termsreduce it to such a ones comprehension or put it within her convenience  it was as such a one therefore that for three or four days more milly watched kate as just such another and it was presently as such a one that she threw herself into their promised visit at last achieved to chelsea the quarter of the famous carlyle the field of exercise of his ghost his votaries and the residence of poor marian so often referred to and actually a somewhat incongruous spirit there with our young womans first view of poor marian everything gave way but the sense of how in england apparently the social situation of sisters could be opposed how common ground for a place in the world could quite fail them a state of things sagely perceived to be involved in an hierarchical an aristocratic order just whereabouts in the order mrs lowder had established her niece was a question not wholly void as yet no doubt of ambiguitythough milly was withal sure lord mark could exactly have fixed the point if he would fixing it at the same time for aunt maud herself but it was clear that mrs condrip was as might have been said in quite another geography she would not in short have been to be found on the same social map and it was as if her visitors had turned over page after page together before the final relief of their benevolent here the interval was bridged of course but the bridge verily was needed and the impression left milly to wonder whether in the general connection it were of bridges or of intervals that the spirit not locally disciplined would find itself most conscious it was as if at home by contrast there were neitherneither the difference itself from position to position nor on either side and particularly on one the awfully good manner the conscious sinking of a consciousness that made up for it the conscious sinking at all events and the awfully good manner the difference the bridge the interval the skipped leaves of the social atlasthese it was to be confessed had a little for our young lady in default of stouter stuff to work themselves into the light literary legenda mixed wandering echo of trollope of thackeray perhaps mostly of dickensunder favour of which her pilgrimage had so much appealed she could relate to susie later on late the same evening that the legend before she had done with it had run clear that the adored author of the newcomes in fine had been on the whole the note the picture lacking thus more than she had hoped or rather perhaps showing less than she had feared a certain possibility of pickwickian outline she explained how she meant by this that mrs condrip had not altogether proved another mrs nickleby nor evenfor she might have proved almost anything from the way poor worried kate had spokena widowed and aggravated mrs micawber  mrs stringham in the midnight conference intimated rather yearningly that however the event might have turned the side of english life such experiences opened to milly were just those she herself seemed bookedas they were all roundabout her now always sayingto miss she had begun to have a little for her fellowobserver these moments of fanciful reactionreaction in which she was once more all susan shepherdagainst the high sphere of colder conventions into which her overwhelming connection with maud manningham had rapt her milly never lost sight for long of the susan shepherd side of her and was always there to meet it when it came up and vaguely tenderly impatiently to pat it abounding in the assurance that they would still provide for it they had however tonight another matter in hand which proved to be presently on the girls part in respect to her hour of chelsea the revelation that mrs condrip taking a few minutes when kate was away with one of the children in bed upstairs for some small complaint had suddenly without its being in the least led up to broken ground on the subject of mr densher mentioned him with impatience as a person in love with her sister she wished me if i cared for kate to know milly saidfor it would be quite too dreadful and one might do something  susie wondered prevent anything coming of it thats easily said do what  milly had a dim smile i think that what she would like is that i should come a good deal to see her about it  and doesnt she suppose youve anything else to do  the girl had by this time clearly made it out nothing but to admire and make much of her sisterwhom she doesnt however herself in the least understandand give up ones time and everything else to it it struck the elder friend that she spoke with an almost unprecedented approach to sharpness as if mrs condrip had been rather specially disconcerting never yet so much as just of late had mrs stringham seen her companion as exalted and by the very play of something within into a vague golden air that left irritation below that was the great thing with millyit was her characteristic poetry or at least it was susan shepherds but she made a point the former continued of my keeping what she says from kate im not to mention that she has spoken  and why mrs stringham presently asked is mr densher so dreadful  milly had she thought an hesitationsomething that suggested a fuller talk with mrs condrip than she inclined perhaps to report it isnt so much he himself then the girl spoke a little as for the romance of it one could never tell with her where romance would come in its the state of his fortunes  and is that very bad  he has no private means and no prospect of any he has no income and no ability according to mrs condrip to make one hes as poor she calls it as poverty and she says she knows what that is  again mrs stringham considered and it presently produced something but isnt he brilliantly clever  milly had also then an instant that was not quite fruitless i havent the least idea  to which for the time susie only answered ohthough by the end of a minute she had followed it with a slightly musing i see and that in turn with its quite what maud lowder thinks  that hell never do anything  noquite the contrary that hes exceptionally able  oh yes i knowmilly had again in reference to what her friend had already told her of this her little tone of a moment before but mrs condrips own great point is that aunt maud herself wont hear of any such person mr densher she holds thats the way at any rate it was explained to mewont ever be either a public man or a rich man if he were public shed be willing as i understand to help him if he were richwithout being anything elseshed do her best to swallow him as it is she taboos him  in short said mrs stringham as with a private purpose she told you the sister all about it but mrs lowder likes him she added  mrs condrip didnt tell me that  well she does all the same my dear extremely  then there it is on which with a drop and one of those sudden slightly sighing surrenders to a vague reflux and a general fatigue that had recently more than once marked themselves for her companion milly turned away yet the matter was not left so that night between them albeit neither perhaps could afterwards have said which had first come back to it millys own nearest approach at least for a little to doing so was to remark that they appeared allevery one they sawto think tremendously of money this prompted in susie a laugh not untender the innocent meaning of which was that it came as a subject for indifference money did easier to some people than to others she made the point in fairness however that you couldnt have told by any too crude transparency of air what place it held for maud manningham she did her worldliness with grand proper silencesif it mightnt better be put perhaps that she did her detachment with grand occasional pushes however susie put it in truth she was really in justice to herself thinking of the difference as favourites of fortune between her old friend and her new aunt maud sat somehow in the midst of her money founded on it and surrounded by it even if with a clever high manner about it her manner of looking hard and bright as if it werent there milly about hers had no manner at allwhich was possibly from a point of view a fault she was at any rate far away on the edge of it and you hadnt as might be said in order to get at her nature to traverse by whatever avenue any piece of her property it was clear on the other hand that mrs lowder was keeping her wealth as for purposes imaginations ambitions that would figure as large as honourably unselfish on the day they should take effect she would impose her will but her will would be only that a person or two shouldnt lose a benefit by not submitting if they could be made to submit to milly as so much younger such far views couldnt be imputed there was nobody she was supposable as interested for it was too soon since she wasnt interested for herself even the richest woman at her age lacked motive and millys motive doubtless had plenty of time to arrive she was meanwhile beautiful simple sublime without itwhether missing it and vaguely reaching out for it or not and with it for that matter in the event would really be these things just as much only then she might very well have like aunt maud a manner such were the connections at all events in which the colloquy of our two ladies freshly flickered upin which it came round that the elder asked the younger if she had herself in the afternoon named mr densher as an acquaintance  oh noi said nothing of having seen him i remembered the girl explained mrs lowders wish  but that her friend observed after a moment was for silence to kate  yesbut mrs condrip would immediately have told kate  why sosince she must dislike to talk about him  mrs condrip must milly thought what she would like most is that her sister should be brought to think ill of him and if anything she can tell her will help that but milly dropped suddenly here as if her companion would see  her companions interest however was all for what she herself saw you mean shell immediately speak mrs stringham gathered that this was what milly meant but it left still a question how will it be against him that you know him  oh i dont know it wont be so much ones knowing him as ones having kept it out of sight  ah said mrs stringham as if for comfort you havent kept it out of sight isnt it much rather miss croy herself who has  it isnt my acquaintance with him milly smiled that she has dissimulated  she has dissimulated only her own well then the responsibilitys hers  ah but said the girl not perhaps with marked consequence she has a right to do as she likes  then so my dear have you smiled susan shepherd  milly looked at her as if she were almost venerably simple but also as if this were what one loved her for were not quarrelling about it kate and i yet  i only meant mrs stringham explained that i dont see what mrs condrip would gain  by her being able to tell kate milly thought i only meant that i dont see what i myself should gain  but it will have to come outthat he knows you bothsome time  milly scarce assented do you mean when he comes back  hell find you both here and he can hardly be looked to i take it to cut either of you for the sake of the other  this placed the question at last on a basis more distinctly cheerful i might get at him somehow beforehand the girl suggested i might give him what they call here the tipthat hes not to know me when we meet or better still i mightnt be here at all  do you want to run away from him  it was oddly enough an idea milly seemed half to accept i dont know what i want to run away from  it dispelled on the spotsomething to the elder womans ear in the sad sweet sound of itany ghost of any need of explaining the sense was constant for her that their relation was as if afloat like some island of the south in a great warm sea that made for every conceivable chance a margin an outer sphere of general emotion and the effect of the occurrence of anything in particular was to make the sea submerge the island the margin flood the text the great wave now for a moment swept over ill go anywhere else in the world you like  but milly came up through it dear old susiehow i do work you  oh this is nothing yet  no indeedto what it will be  youre notand its vain to pretend said dear old susie who had been taking her in as sound and strong as i insist on having you  insist insistthe more the better but the day i look as sound and strong as that you know milly went onon that day i shall be just sound and strong enough to take leave of you sweetly for ever thats where one is she continued thus agreeably to embroider when even ones most beaux moments arent such as to qualify so far as appearance goes for anything gayer than a handsome cemetery since ive lived all these years as if i were dead i shall die no doubt as if i were alivewhich will happen to be as you want me so you see she wound up youll never really know where i am except indeed when im gone and then youll only know where im not  id die for you said susan shepherd after a moment  thanks awfully then stay here for me  but we cant be in london for august nor for many of all these next weeks  then well go back  susie blenched back to america  no abroadto switzerland italy anywhere i mean by your staying here for me milly pursued your staying with me wherever i may be even though we may neither of us know at the time where it is no she insisted i dont know where i am and you never will and it doesnt matterand i dare say its quite true she broke off that everything will have to come out her friend would have felt of her that she joked about it now had not her scale from grave to gay been a thing of such unnamable shades that her contrasts were never sharp she made up for failures of gravity by failures of mirth if she hadnt that is been at times as earnest as might have been liked so she was certain not to be at other times as easy as she would like herself i must face the music it isnt at any rate its coming out she added its that mrs condrip would put the fact before her to his injury  her companion wondered but how to his  why if he pretends to love her  and does he only pretend  i mean if trusted by her in strange countries he forgets her so far as to make up to other people  the amendment however brought susie in as if with gaiety for a comfortable end did he make up the false creature to you  nobut the question isnt of that its of what kate might be made to believe  that given the fact that he evidently more or less followed up his acquaintance with you to say nothing of your obvious weird charm he must have been all ready if you had at all led him on  milly neither accepted nor qualified this she only said after a moment as with a conscious excess of the pensive no i dont think shed quite wish to suggest that i made up to him for that i should have had to do so would only bring out his constancy all i mean is she addedand now at last as with a supreme impatience that her being able to make him out a little a person who could give cause for jealousy would evidently help her since shes afraid of him to do him in her sisters mind a useful ill turn  susan shepherd perceived in this explanation such signs of an appetite for motive as would have sat gracefully even on one of her own new england heroines it was seeing round several corners but that was what new england heroines did and it was moreover interesting for the moment to make out how many really her young friend had undertaken to see round finally too werent they braving the deeps they got their amusement where they could isnt it only she asked rather probable shed see that kates knowing him as whats the pretty old word volage  well she hadnt filled out her idea but neither it seemed could milly  well might but do what that often doesby all our blessed little laws and arrangements at least excite kates own sentiment instead of depressing it  the idea was bright yet the girl but beautifully stared kates own sentiment oh she didnt speak of that i dont think she added as if she had been unconsciously giving a wrong impression i dont think mrs condrip imagines shes in love  it made mrs stringham stare in turn then whats her fear  well only the fact of mr denshers possibly himself keeping it upthe fear of some final result from that  oh said susie intellectually a little disconcertedshe looks far ahead  at this however milly threw off another of her sudden vague sports noits only we who do  well dont let us be more interested for them than they are for themselves  certainly notthe girl promptly assented a certain interest nevertheless remained she appeared to wish to be clear it wasnt of anything on kates own part she spoke  you mean she thinks her sister does not care for him  it was still as if for an instant milly had to be sure of what she meant but there it presently was if she did care mrs condrip would have told me  what susan shepherd seemed hereupon for a little to wonder was why then they had been talking so but did you ask her  ah no  oh said susan shepherd  milly however easily explained that she wouldnt have asked her for the world     book fifth  x  lord mark looked at her today in particular as if to wring from her a confession that she had originally done him injustice and he was entitled to whatever there might be in it of advantage or merit that his intention really in a manner took effect he cared about something that is after all sufficiently to make her feel absurdly as if she were confessingall the while it was quite the case that neither justice nor injustice was what had been in question between them he had presented himself at the hotel had found her and had found susan shepherd at home had been civil to susanit was just that shade and susans fancy had fondly caught it and then had come again and missed them and then had come and found them once more besides letting them easily see that if it hadnt by this time been the end of everythingwhich they could feel in the exhausted air that of the season at its last gaspthe places they might have liked to go to were such as they would have had only to mention their feeling wasor at any rate their modest general pleathat there was no place they would have liked to go to there was only the sense of finding they liked wherever they were the place to which they had been brought such was highly the case as to their current consciousnesswhich could be indeed in an equally eminent degree but a matter of course impressions this afternoon having by a happy turn of their wheel been gathered for them into a splendid cluster an offering like an armful of the rarest flowers they were in presence of the offeringthey had been led up to it and if it had been still their habit to look at each other across distances for increase of unanimity his hand would have been silently named between them as the hand applied to the wheel he had administered the touch that under light analysis made the differencethe difference of their not having lost as susie on the spot and at the hour phrased it again and again both for herself and for such others as the question might concern so beautiful and interesting an experience the difference also in fact of mrs lowders not having lost it either though it was with mrs lowder superficially they had come and though it was further with that lady that our young woman was directly engaged during the halfhour or so of her most agreeably inward response to the scene  the great historic house had for milly beyond terrace and garden as the centre of an almost extravagantly grand watteaucomposition a tone as of old gold kept down by the quality of the air summer fullflushed but attuned to the general perfect taste much by her measure for the previous hour appeared in connection with this revelation of it to have happened to hera quantity expressed in introductions of charming new people in walks through halls of armour of pictures of cabinets of tapestry of teatables in an assault of reminders that this largeness of style was the sign of appointed felicity the largeness of style was the great containing vessel while everything else the pleasant personal affluence the easy murmurous welcome the honoured age of illustrious host and hostess all at once so distinguished and so plain so public and so shy became but this or that element of the infusion the elements melted together and seasoned the draught the essence of which might have struck the girl as distilled into the small cup of iced coffee she had vaguely accepted from somebody while a fuller flood somehow kept bearing her upall the freshness of response of her young life the freshness of the first and only prime what had perhaps brought on just now a kind of climax was the fact of her appearing to make out through aunt maud what was really the matter it couldnt be less than a climax for a poor shaky maiden to find it put to her of a sudden that she herself was the matterfor that was positively what on mrs lowders part it came to everything was great of course in great pictures and it was doubtless precisely a part of the brilliant lifesince the brilliant life as one had faintly figured it clearly was humanly ledthat all impressions within its area partook of its brilliancy still letting that pass it fairly stamped an hour as with the official seal for one to be able to take in so comfortably ones companions broad blandness you must stay among usyou must stay anything else is impossible and ridiculous you dont know yet no doubtyou cant but you will soon enough you can stay in any position it had been as the murmurous consecration to follow the murmurous welcome and even if it were but part of aunt mauds own spiritual ebrietyfor the dear woman one could see was spiritually keeping the dayit served to milly then and afterwards as a highwater mark of the imagination  it was to be the end of the short parenthesis which had begun but the other day at lancaster gate with lord marks informing her that she was a successthe key thus again struck and though no distinct no numbered revelations had crowded in there had as we have seen been plenty of incident for the space and the time there had been thrice as much and all gratuitous and genialif in portions not exactly hitherto the revelationas three unprepared weeks could have been expected to produce mrs lowder had improvised a rush for them but out of elements as milly was now a little more freely aware somewhat roughly combined therefore if at this very instant she had her reasons for thinking of the parenthesis as about to closereasons completely personalshe had on behalf of her companion a divination almost as deep the parenthesis would close with this admirable picture but the admirable picture still would show aunt maud as not absolutely sure either if she herself were destined to remain in it what she was doing milly might even not have escaped seeming to see was to talk herself into a sublimer serenity while she ostensibly talked milly it was fine the girl fully felt the way she did talk her little as at bottom our young woman needed it or found other persuasions at fault it was in particular during the minutes of her grateful absorption of iced coffeequalified by a sharp doubt of her wisdomthat she most had in view lord marks relation to her being there or at least to the question of her being amused at it it wouldnt have taken much by the end of five minutes quite to make her feel that this relation was charming it might once more simply have been that everything anything was charming when one was so justly and completely charmed but frankly she had not supposed anything so serenely sociable could define itself between them as the friendly understanding that was at present somehow in the air they were many of them together near the marquee that had been erected on a stretch of sward as a temple of refreshment and that happened to have the propertywhich was all to the good of making milly think of a durbar her iced coffee had been a consequence of this connection in which further the bright company scattered about fell thoroughly into place certain of its members might have represented the contingent of native princesfamiliar but scarce the less grandly gregarious termand lord mark would have done for one of these even though for choice he but presented himself as a supervisory friend of the family the lancaster gate family he clearly intended in which he included its american recruits and included above all kate croya young person blessedly easy to take care of she knew people and people knew her and she was the handsomest thing therethis last a declaration made by milly in a sort of soft midsummer madness a straight skylarkflight of charity to aunt maud  kate had for her new friends eyes the extraordinary and attaching property of appearing at a given moment to show as a beautiful stranger to cut her connections and lose her identity letting the imagination for the time make what it would of themmake her merely a person striking from afar more and more pleasing as one watched but who was above all a subject for curiosity nothing could have given her as a party to a relation a greater freshness than this sensewhich sprang up at its own hoursof being as curious about her as if one hadnt known her it had sprung up we have gathered as soon as milly had seen her after hearing from mrs stringham of her knowledge of merton densher she had looked then other and as milly knew the real critical mind would call it more objective and our young woman had foreseen it of her on the spot that she would often look so again it was exactly what she was doing this afternoon and milly who had amusements of thought that were like the secrecies of a little girl playing with dolls when conventionally too big could almost settle to the game of what one would suppose her how one would place her if one didnt know her she became thus intermittently a figure conditioned only by the great facts of aspect a figure to be waited for named and fitted this was doubtless but a way of feeling that it was of her essence to be peculiarly what the occasion whatever it might be demanded when its demand was highest there were probably ways enough on these lines for such a consciousness another of them would be for instance to say that she was made for great social uses milly was not wholly sure that she herself knew what great social uses might beunless as a good example exerting just that sort of glamour in just that sort of frame were one of them she would have fallen back on knowing sufficiently that they existed at all events for her friend it imputed a primness all round to be reduced but to saying by way of a translation of ones amusement that she was always so rightsince that too often was what the insupportables themselves were yet it was in overflow to aunt maud what she had to content herself withalsave for the lame enhancement of saying she was lovely it served all the same the purpose strengthened the bond that for the time held the two ladies together distilled in short its drop of rosecolour for mrs lowders own view that was really the view milly had for most of the rest of the occasion to give herself to immediately taking in but it didnt prevent the continued play of those swift crosslights odd beguilements of the mind at which we have already glanced  mrs lowder herself found it enough simply to reply in respect to kate that she was indeed a luxury to take about the world she expressed no more surprise than that at her rightness today wasnt it by this time sufficiently manifest that it was precisely as the very luxury she was proving that she had from far back been appraised and waited for crude elation however might be kept at bay and the circumstance none the less demonstrated that they were all swimming together in the blue it came back to lord mark again as he seemed slowly to pass and repass and conveniently to linger before them he was personally the note of the bluelike a suspended skein of silk within reach of the broiderers hand aunt mauds freemoving shuttle took a length of him at rhythmic intervals and one of the intermixed truths that flickered across to milly was that he ever so consentingly knew he was being worked in this was almost like an understanding with her at mrs lowders expense which she would have none of she wouldnt for the world have had him make any such point as that he wouldnt have launched them at matchamor whatever it was he had doneonly for aunt mauds beaux yeux what he had done it would have been guessable was something he had for some time been desired in vain to do and what they were all now profiting by was a change comparatively sudden the cessation of hope delayed what had caused the cessation easily showed itself as none of millys business and she was luckily for that matter in no real danger of hearing from him directly that her individual weight had been felt in the scale why then indeed was it an effect of his diffused but subdued participation that he might absolutely have been saying to her yes let the dear woman take her own tone since shes here she may stay he might have been addingfor whatever she can make of it but you and i are different milly knew she was different in truthhis own difference was his own affair but also she knew that after all even at their distinctest lord marks tips in this line would be tacit he practically placed herit came round again to thatunder no obligation whatever it was a matter of equal ease moreover her letting mrs lowder take a tone she might have taken twentythey would have spoiled nothing  you must stay on with us you can you know in any position you like any any any my dear childand her emphasis went deep you must make your home with us and its really open to you to make the most beautiful one in the world you mustnt be under a mistakeunder any of any sort and you must let us all think for you a little take care of you and watch over you above all you must help me with kate and you must stay a little for her nothing for a long time has happened to me so good as that you and she should have become friends its beautiful its great its everything what makes it perfect is that it should have come about through our dear delightful susie restored to me after so many years by such a miracle nothats more charming to me than even your hitting it off with kate god has been good to onepositively for i couldnt at my age have made a new friendundertaken i mean out of whole cloth the real thing its like changing ones bankersafter fifty one doesnt do that thats why susie has been kept for me as you seem to keep people in your wonderful country in lavender and pink papercoming back at last as straight as out of a fairytale and with you as an attendant fairy milly hereupon replied appreciatively that such a description of herself made her feel as if pink paper were her dress and lavender its trimming but aunt maud was not to be deterred by a weak joke from keeping it up her interlocutress could feel besides that she kept it up in perfect sincerity she was somehow at this hour a very happy woman and a part of her happiness might precisely have been that her affections and her views were moving as never before in concert unquestionably she loved susie but she also loved kate and loved lord mark loved their funny old host and hostess loved every one within range down to the very servant who came to receive millys empty iceplatedown for that matter to milly herself who was while she talked really conscious of the enveloping flap of a protective mantle a shelter with the weight of an eastern carpet an eastern carpet for wishingpurposes of ones own was a thing to be on rather than under still however if the girl should fail of breath it wouldnt be she could feel by mrs lowders fault one of the last things she was afterwards to recall of this was aunt mauds going on to say that she and kate must stand together because together they could do anything it was for kate of course she was essentially planning but the plan enlarged and uplifted now somehow required millys prosperity too for its full operation just as millys prosperity at the same time involved kates it was nebulous yet it was slightly confused but it was unmistakably free and genial and it made our young woman understand things kate had said of her aunts possibilities as well as characterisations that had fallen from susan shepherd one of the most frequent on the lips of the latter had been that dear maud was a natural force   xi  a prime reason we must add why sundry impressions were not to be fully present to the girl till later on was that they yielded at this stage with an effect of sharp supersession to a detached quarter of an hourher only onewith lord mark have you seen the picture in the house the beautiful one thats so like youhe was asking that as he stood before her having come up at last with his smooth intimation that any wire he had pulled and yet wanted not to remind her of wasnt quite a reason for his having no joy at all  ive been through rooms and ive seen pictures but if im like anything so beautiful as most of them seemed to me it needed in short for milly some evidence which he only wanted to supply she was the image of the wonderful bronzino which she must have a look at on every ground he had thus called her off and led her away the more easily that the house within was above all what had already drawn round her its mystic circle their progress meanwhile was not of the straightest it was an advance without haste through innumerable natural pauses and soft concussions determined for the most part by the appearance before them of ladies and gentlemen singly in couples in groups who brought them to a stand with an inveterate i say mark what they said she never quite made out it was their all so domestically knowing him and his knowing them that mainly struck her while her impression for the rest was but of fellowstrollers more vaguely afloat than themselves supernumeraries mostly a little battered whether as jaunty males or as ostensibly elegant women they might have been moving a good deal by a momentum that had begun far back but they were still brave and personable still warranted for continuance as long again and they gave her in especial collectively a sense of pleasant voices pleasanter than those of actors of friendly empty words and kind lingering eyes the lingering eyes looked her over the lingering eyes were what went in almost confessed simplicity with the pointless i say mark  and what was really most sensible of all was that as a pleasant matter of course if she didnt mind he seemed to suggest their letting people poor dear things have the benefit of her  the odd part was that he made her herself believe for amusement in the benefit measured by him in mere mannerfor wonderful of a truth was as a means of expression his slightness of emphasisthat her present goodnature conferred it was as she could easily see a mild common carnival of goodnaturea mass of london people together of sorts and sorts but who mainly knew each other and who in their way did no doubt confess to curiosity it had gone round that she was there questions about her would be passing the easiest thing was to run the gauntlet with himjust as the easiest thing was in fact to trust him generally couldnt she know for herself passively how little harm they meant herto that extent that it made no difference whether or not he introduced them the strangest thing of all for milly was perhaps the uplifted assurance and indifference with which she could simply give back the particular bland stare that appeared in such cases to mark civilisation at its highest it was so little her fault this oddity of what had gone round about her that to accept it without question might be as good a way as another of feeling life it was inevitable to supply the probable descriptionthat of the awfully rich young american who was so queer to behold but nice by all accounts to know and she had really but one instant of speculation as to fables or fantasies perchance originally launched she asked herself once only if susie could inconceivably have been blatant about her for the question on the spot was really blown away for ever she knew in fact on the spot and with sharpness just why she had elected susan shepherd she had had from the first hour the conviction of her being precisely the person in the world least possibly a trumpeter so it wasnt their fault it wasnt their fault and anything might happen that would and everything now again melted together and kind eyes were always kind eyesif it were never to be worse than that she got with her companion into the house they brushed beneficently past all their accidents the bronzino was it appeared deep within and the long afternoon light lingered for them on patches of old colour and waylaid them as they went in nooks and opening vistas  it was all the while for milly as if lord mark had really had something other than this spoken pretext in view as if there were something he wanted to say to her and were onlyconsciously yet not awkwardly just delicatelyhanging fire at the same time it was as if the thing had practically been said by the moment they came in sight of the picture since what it appeared to amount to was do let a fellow who isnt a fool take care of you a little the thing somehow with the aid of the bronzino was done it hadnt seemed to matter to her before if he were a fool or no but now just where they were she liked his not being and it was all moreover none the worse for coming back to something of the same sound as mrs lowders so recent reminder she too wished to take care of herand wasnt it √† peu pr√®s what all the people with the kind eyes were wishing once more things melted togetherthe beauty and the history and the facility and the splendid midsummer glow it was a sort of magnificent maximum the pink dawn of an apotheosis coming so curiously soon what in fact befell was that as she afterwards made out it was lord mark who said nothing in particularit was she herself who said all she couldnt help thatit came and the reason it came was that she found herself for the first moment looking at the mysterious portrait through tears perhaps it was her tears that made it just then so strange and fairas wonderful as he had said the face of a young woman all magnificently drawn down to the hands and magnificently dressed a face almost livid in hue yet handsome in sadness and crowned with a mass of hair rolled back and high that must before fading with time have had a family resemblance to her own the lady in question at all events with her slightly michaelangelesque squareness her eyes of other days her full lips her long neck her recorded jewels her brocaded and wasted reds was a very great personageonly unaccompanied by a joy and she was dead dead dead milly recognised her exactly in words that had nothing to do with her i shall never be better than this  he smiled for her at the portrait than she youd scarce need to be better for surely thats well enough but you are one feels as it happens better because splendid as she is one doubts if she was good  he hadnt understood she was before the picture but she had turned to him and she didnt care if for the minute he noticed her tears it was probably as good a moment as she should ever have with him it was perhaps as good a moment as she should have with any one or have in any connection whatever i mean that everything this afternoon has been too beautiful and that perhaps everything together will never be so right again im very glad therefore youve been a part of it  though he still didnt understand her he was as nice as if he had he didnt ask for insistence and that was just a part of his looking after her he simply protected her now from herself and there was a world of practice in it oh we must talk about these things  ah they had already done that she knew as much as she ever would and she was shaking her head at her pale sister the next moment with a world on her side of slowness i wish i could see the resemblance of course her complexions green she laughed but mines several shades greener  its down to the very hands said lord mark  her hands are large milly went on but mine are larger mine are huge  oh you go her all round one betterwhich is just what i said but youre a pair you must surely catch it he added as if it were important to his character as a serious man not to appear to have invented his plea  i dont know one never knows ones self its a funny fancy and i dont imagine it would have occurred  i see it has occurredhe has already taken her up she had her back as she faced the picture to one of the doors of the room which was open and on her turning as he spoke she saw that they were in the presence of three other persons also as appeared interested inquirers kate croy was one of these lord mark had just become aware of her and she all arrested had immediately seen and made the best of it that she was far from being first in the field she had brought a lady and a gentleman to whom she wished to show what lord mark was showing milly and he took her straightway as a reinforcement kate herself had spoken however before he had had time to tell her so  you had noticed tooshe smiled at him without looking at milly then im not originalwhich one always hopes one has been but the likeness is so great and now she looked at millyfor whom again it was all round indeed kind kind eyes yes there you are my dear if you want to know and youre superb she took now but a glance at the picture though it was enough to make her question to her friends not too straight isnt she superb  i brought miss theale lord mark explained to the latter quite off my own bat  i wanted lady aldershaw kate continued to milly to see for herself  les grands esprits se rencontrent laughed her attendant gentleman a high but slightly stooping shambling and wavering person who represented urbanity by the liberal aid of certain prominent front teeth and whom milly vaguely took for some sort of great man  lady aldershaw meanwhile looked at milly quite as if milly had been the bronzino and the bronzino only milly superb superb of course i had noticed you it is wonderful she went on with her back to the picture but with some other eagerness which milly felt gathering directing her motions now it was enoughthey were introduced and she was saying i wonder if you could give us the pleasure of coming she was not fresh for she was not young even though she denied at every pore that she was old but she was vivid and much bejewelled for the midsummer daylight and she was all in the palest pinks and blues she didnt think at this pass that she could come anywheremilly didnt and she already knew that somehow lord mark was saving her from the question he had interposed taking the words out of the ladys mouth and not caring at all if the lady minded that was clearly the right way to treat herat least for him as she had only dropped smiling and then turned away with him she had been dealt withit would have done an enemy good the gentleman still stood a little helpless addressing himself to the intention of urbanity as if it were a large loud whistle he had been signing sympathy in his way while the lady made her overture and milly had in this light soon arrived at their identity they were lord and lady aldershaw and the wife was the clever one a minute or two later the situation had changed and she knew it afterwards to have been by the subtle operation of kate she was herself saying that she was afraid she must go now if susie could be found but she was sitting down on the nearest seat to say it the prospect through opened doors stretched before her into other rooms down the vista of which lord mark was strolling with lady aldershaw who close to him and much intent seemed to show from behind as peculiarly expert lord aldershaw for his part had been left in the middle of the room while kate with her back to him was standing before her with much sweetness of manner the sweetness was all for her she had the sense of the poor gentlemans having somehow been handled as lord mark had handled his wife he dangled there he shambled a little then he bethought himself of the bronzino before which with his eyeglass he hovered it drew from him an odd vague sound not wholly distinct from a grunt and a humphmost remarkable which lighted kates face with amusement the next moment he had creaked away over polished floors after the others and milly was feeling as if she had been rude but lord aldershaw was in every way a detail and kate was saying to her that she hoped she wasnt ill  thus it was that aloft there in the great gilded historic chamber and the presence of the pale personage on the wall whose eyes all the while seemed engaged with her own she found herself suddenly sunk in something quite intimate and humble and to which these grandeurs were strange enough witnesses it had come up in the form in which she had had to accept it all suddenly and nothing about it at the same time was more marked than that she had in a manner plunged into it to escape from something else something else from her first vision of her friends appearance three minutes before had been present to her even through the call made by the others on her attention something that was perversely there she was more and more uncomfortably finding at least for the first moments and by some spring of its own with every renewal of their meeting is it the way she looks to him she asked herselfthe perversity being that she kept in remembrance that kate was known to him it wasnt a fault in katenor in him assuredly and she had a horror being generous and tender of treating either of them as if it had been to densher himself she couldnt make it uphe was too far away but her secondary impulse was to make it up to kate she did so now with a strange soft energythe impulse immediately acting will you render me tomorrow a great service  any service dear child in the world  but its a secret onenobody must know i must be wicked and false about it  then im your woman kate smiled for thats the kind of thing i love do let us do something bad youre impossibly without sin you know  millys eyes on this remained a little with their companions ah i shant perhaps come up to your idea its only to deceive susan shepherd  oh said kate as if this were indeed mild  but thoroughlyas thoroughly as i can  and for cheating kate asked my powers will contribute well ill do my best for you in accordance with which it was presently settled between them that milly should have the aid and comfort of her presence for a visit to sir luke strett kate had needed a minute for enlightenment and it was quite grand for her comrade that this name should have said nothing to her to milly herself it had for some days been secretly saying much the personage in question was as she explained the greatest of medical lights if she had got hold as she believed and she had used to this end the wisdom of the serpent of the right the special man she had written to him three days before and he had named her an hour eleventwenty only it had come to her on the eve that she couldnt go alone her maid on the other hand wasnt good enough and susie was too good kate had listened above all with high indulgence and im betwixt and between happy thought too good for what  milly thought why to be worried if its nothing and to be still more worriedi mean before she need beif it isnt  kate fixed her with deep eyes what in the world is the matter with you it had inevitably a sound of impatience as if it had been a challenge really to produce something so that milly felt her for the moment only as a much older person standing above her a little doubting the imagined ailments suspecting the easy complaints of ignorant youth it somewhat checked her further that the matter with her was what exactly as yet she wanted knowledge about and she immediately declared for conciliation that if she were merely fanciful kate would see her put to shame kate vividly uttered in return the hope that since she could come out and be so charming could so universally dazzle and interest she wasnt all the while in distress or in anxietydidnt believe herself in short to be in any degree seriously menaced well i want to make outto make out was all that this consistently produced to which kate made clear answer ah then let us by all means  i thought milly said you would like to help me but i must ask you please for the promise of absolute silence  and how if you are ill can your friends remain in ignorance  well if i am it must of course finally come out but i can go for a long time milly spoke with her eyes again on her painted sistersalmost as if under their suggestion she still sat there before kate yet not without a light in her face that will be one of my advantages i think i could die without its being noticed  youre an extraordinary young woman her friend visibly held by her declared at last what a remarkable time to talk of such things  well we wont talk preciselymilly got herself together again i only wanted to make sure of you  here in the midst of but kate could only sigh for wonderalmost visibly too for pity  it made a moment during which her companion waited on her word partly as if from a yearning shy but deep to have her case put to her just as kate was struck by it partly as if the hint of pity were already giving a sense to her whimsical shot with lord mark at mrs lowders first dinner exactly thisthe handsome girls compassionate manner her friendly descent from her own strengthwas what she had then foretold she took kate up as if positively for the deeper taste of it here in the midst of what  of everything theres nothing you cant have theres nothing you cant do  so mrs lowder tells me  it just kept kates eyes fixed as possibly for more of that then however without waiting she went on we all adore you  youre wonderfulyou dear things milly laughed  no its you and kate seemed struck with the real interest of it in three weeks  milly kept it up never were people on such terms all the more reason she added that i shouldnt needlessly torment you  but me what becomes of me said kate  well you milly thoughtif theres anything to bear youll bear it  but i wont bear it said kate croy  oh yes you will all the same youll pity me awfully but youll help me very much and i absolutely trust you so there we are there they were then since kate had so to take it but there milly felt she herself in particular was for it was just the point at which she had wished to arrive she had wanted to prove to herself that she didnt horribly blame her friend for any reserve and what better proof could there be than this quite special confidence if she desired to show kate that she really believed the latter liked her how could she show it more than by asking her for help   xii  what it really came to on the morrow this first timethe time kate went with herwas that the great man had a little to excuse himself had by a rare accidentfor he kept his consultinghours in general rigorously freebut ten minutes to give her ten mere minutes which he yet placed at her service in a manner that she admired even more than she could meet it so crystalclean the great empty cup of attention that he set between them on the table he was presently to jump into his carriage but he promptly made the point that he must see her again see her within a day or two and he named for her at once another houreasing her off beautifully too even then in respect to her possibly failing of justice to her errand the minutes affected her in fact as ebbing more swiftly than her little army of items could muster and they would probably have gone without her doing much more than secure another hearing had it not been for her sense at the last that she had gained above all an impression the impressionall the sharp growth of the final few momentswas neither more nor less than that she might make of a sudden in quite another world another straight friend and a friend who would moreover be wonderfully the most appointed the most thoroughly adjusted of the whole collection inasmuch as he would somehow wear the character scientifically ponderably proveablynot just loosely and sociably literally furthermore it wouldnt really depend on herself sir luke stretts friendship in the least perhaps what made her most stammer and pant was its thus queerly coming over her that she might find she had interested him even beyond her intention find she was in fact launched in some current that would lose itself in the sea of science at the same time that she struggled however she also surrendered there was a moment at which she almost dropped the form of stating of explaining and threw herself without violence only with a supreme pointless quaver that had turned the next instant to an intensity of interrogative stillness upon his general goodwill his large settled face though firm was not as she had thought at first hard he looked in the oddest manner to her fancy half like a general and half like a bishop and she was soon sure that within some such handsome range what it would show her would be what was good what was best for her she had established in other words in this timesaving way a relation with it and the relation was the special trophy that for the hour she bore off it was like an absolute possession a new resource altogether something done up in the softest silk and tucked away under the arm of memory she hadnt had it when she went in and she had it when she came out she had it there under her cloak but dissimulated invisibly carried when smiling smiling she again faced kate croy that young lady had of course awaited her in another room where as the great man was to absent himself no one else was in attendance and she rose for her with such a face of sympathy as might have graced the vestibule of a dentist is it out she seemed to ask as if it had been a question of a tooth and milly indeed kept her in no suspense at all  hes a dear im to come again  but what does he say  milly was almost gay that im not to worry about anything in the world and that if ill be a good girl and do exactly what he tells me hell take care of me for ever and ever  kate wondered as if things scarce fitted but does he allow then that youre ill  i dont know what he allows and i dont care i shall know and whatever it is it will be enough he knows all about me and i like it i dont hate it a bit  still however kate stared but could he in so few minutes ask you enough  he asked me scarcely anythinghe doesnt need to do anything so stupid milly said he can tell he knows she repeated and when i go backfor hell have thought me over a littleit will be all right  kate after a moment made the best of this then when are we to come  it just pulled her friend up for even while they talkedat least it was one of the reasonsshe stood there suddenly irrelevantly in the light of her other identity the identity she would have for mr densher this was always from one instant to another an incalculable light which though it might go off faster than it came on necessarily disturbed it sprang with a perversity all its own from the fact that with the lapse of hours and days the chances themselves that made for his being named continued so oddly to fail there were twenty there were fifty but none of them turned up this in particular was of course not a juncture at which the least of them would naturally be present but it would make none the less milly saw another day practically all stamped with avoidance she saw in a quick glimmer and with it all kates unconsciousness and then she shook off the obsession but it had lasted long enough to qualify her response no she had shown kate how she trusted her and that for loyalty would somehow do oh dear thing now that the ice is broken i shant trouble you again  youll come alone  without a scruple only i shall ask you please for your absolute discretion still  outside before the door on the wide pavement of the great square they had to wait again while their carriage which milly had kept completed a further turn of exercise engaged in by the coachman for reasons of his own the footman was there and had indicated that he was making the circuit so kate went on while they stood but dont you ask a good deal darling in proportion to what you give  this pulled milly up still shorterso short in fact that she yielded as soon as she had taken it in but she continued to smile i see then you can tell  i dont want to tell said kate ill be as silent as the tomb if i can only have the truth from you all i want is that you shouldnt keep from me how you find out that you really are  well then i wont ever but you see for yourself milly went on how i really am im satisfied im happy  kate looked at her long i believe you like it the way things turn out for you  milly met her look now without a thought of anything but the spoken she had ceased to be mr denshers image she was all her own memento and she was none the less fine still still what had passed was a fair bargain and it would do of course i like it i feeli cant otherwise describe itas if i had been on my knees to the priest ive confessed and ive been absolved it has been lifted off  kates eyes never quitted her he must have liked you  ohdoctors milly said but i hope she added he didnt like me too much then as if to escape a little from her friends deeper sounding or as impatient for the carriage not yet in sight her eyes turning away took in the great stale square as its staleness however was but that of london fairly fatigued the late hot london with its dance all danced and its story all told the air seemed a thing of blurred pictures and mixed echoes and an impression met the sensean impression that broke the next moment through the girls tightened lips oh its a beautiful big world and everyone yes everyone it presently brought her back to kate and she hoped she didnt actually look as much as if she were crying as she must have looked to lord mark among the portraits at matcham  kate at all events understood everyone wants to be so nice  so nice said the grateful milly  oh kate laughed well pull you through and wont you now bring mrs stringham  but milly after an instant was again clear about that not till ive seen him once more  she was to have found this preference two days later abundantly justified and yet when in prompt accordance with what had passed between them she reappeared before her distinguished friendthat character having for him in the interval built itself up still higherthe first thing he asked her was whether she had been accompanied she told him on this straightway everything completely free at present from her first embarrassment disposed evenas she felt she might becometo undue volubility and conscious moreover of no alarm from his thus perhaps wishing that she had not come alone it was exactly as if in the fortyeight hours that had passed her acquaintance with him had somehow increased and his own knowledge in particular received mysterious additions they had been together before scarce ten minutes but the relation the one the ten minutes had so beautifully created was there to take straight up and this not on his own part from mere professional heartiness mere bedside manner which she would have dislikedmuch rather from a quiet pleasant air in him of having positively asked about her asked here and there and found out of course he couldnt in the least have asked or have wanted to there was no source of information to his hand and he had really needed none he had found out simply by his geniusand found out she meant literally everything now she knew not only that she didnt dislike thisthe state of being found out about but that on the contrary it was truly what she had come for and that for the time at least it would give her something firm to stand on she struck herself as aware aware as she had never been of really not having had from the beginning anything firm it would be strange for the firmness to come after all from her learning in these agreeable conditions that she was in some way doomed but above all it would prove how little she had hitherto had to hold her up if she was now to be held up by the mere processsince that was perhaps on the cardsof being let down this would only testify in turn to her queer little history that sense of loosely rattling had been no process at all and it was ridiculously true that her thus sitting there to see her life put into the scales represented her first approach to the taste of orderly living such was millys romantic versionthat her life especially by the fact of this second interview was put into the scales and just the best part of the relation established might have been for that matter that the great grave charming man knew had known at once that it was romantic and in that measure allowed for it her only doubt her only fear was whether he perhaps wouldnt even take advantage of her being a little romantic to treat her as romantic altogether this doubtless was her danger with him but she should see and dangers in general meanwhile dropped and dropped  the very place at the end of a few minutes the commodious handsome room far back in the fine old house soundless from position somewhat sallow with years of celebrity somewhat sombre even at midsummerthe very place put on for her a look of custom and use squared itself solidly round her as with promises and certainties she had come forth to see the world and this then was to be the worlds light the rich dusk of a london back these the worlds walls those the worlds curtains and carpet she should be intimate with the great bronze clock and mantelornaments conspicuously presented in gratitude and long ago she should be as one of the circle of eminent contemporaries photographed engraved signatured and in particular framed and glazed who made up the rest of the decoration and made up as well so much of the human comfort and while she thought of all the clean truths unfringed unfingered that the listening stillness strained into pauses and waits would again and again for years have kept distinct she also wondered what she would eventually decide upon to present in gratitude she would give something better at least than the brawny victorian bronzes this was precisely an instance of what she felt he knew of her before he had done with her that she was secretly romancing at that rate in the midst of so much else that was more urgent all over the place so much for her secrets with him none of which really required to be phrased it would have been for example a secret for her from any one else that without a dear lady she had picked up just before coming over she wouldnt have a decently near connection of any sort for such an appeal as she was making to put forward no one in the least as it were to produce for respectability but his seeing it she didnt mind a scrap and not a scrap either his knowing how she had left the dear lady in the dark she had come alone putting her friend off with a fraud giving a pretext of shops of a whim of she didnt know whatthe amusement of being for once in the streets by herself the streets by herself were new to hershe had always had in them a companion or a maid and he was never to believe moreover that she couldnt take full in the face anything he might have to say he was softly amused at her account of her courage though he yet showed it somehow without soothing her too grossly still he did want to know whom she had hadnt there been a lady with her on wednesday  yesa different one not the one whos travelling with me ive told her  distinctly he was amused and it added to his airthe greatest charm of allof giving her lots of time youve told her what  well said milly that i visit you in secret  and how many persons will she tell  oh shes devoted not one  well if shes devoted doesnt that make another friend for you  it didnt take much computation but she nevertheless had to think a moment conscious as she was that he distinctly would want to fill out his notion of hereven a little as it were to warm the air for her that howeverand better early than latehe must accept as of no use and she herself felt for an instant quite a competent certainty on the subject of any such warming the air for milly theale was from the very nature of the case destined never to rid itself of a considerable chill this she could tell him with authority if she could tell him nothing else and she seemed to see now in short that it would importantly simplify yes it makes another but they all together wouldnt makewell i dont know what to call it but the difference i mean when one isreally alone ive never seen anything like the kindness she pulled up a minute while he waitedwaited again as if with his reasons for letting her for almost making her talk what she herself wanted was not for the third time to cry as it were in public she had never seen anything like the kindness and she wished to do it justice but she knew what she was about and justice was not wronged by her being able presently to stick to her point only ones situation is what it is its me it concerns the rest is delightful and useless nobody can really help thats why im by myself today i want to bein spite of miss croy who came with me last if you can help so much the better and also of course if one can a little ones self except for thatyou and me doing our besti like you to see me just as i am yes i like itand i dont exaggerate shouldnt one at the start show the worstso that anything after that may be better it wouldnt make any real differenceit wont make any anything that may happen wontto any one therefore i feel myself this way with you just as i am andif you do in the least care to knowit quite positively bears me up she put it as to his caring to know because his manner seemed to give her all her chance and the impression was there for her to take it was strange and deep for her this impression and she did accordingly take it straight home it showed himshowed him in spite of himselfas allowing somewhere far within things comparatively remote things in fact quite as she would have said outside delicately to weigh with him showed him as interested on her behalf in other questions beside the question of what was the matter with her she accepted such an interest as regular in the highest type of scientific mindhis being the even highest magnificently because otherwise obviously it wouldnt be there but she could at the same time take it as a direct source of light upon herself even though that might present her a little as pretending to equal him wanting to know more about a patient than how a patient was constructed or deranged couldnt be even on the part of the greatest of doctors anything but some form or other of the desire to let the patient down easily when that was the case the reason in turn could only be too manifestly pity and when pity held up its telltale face like a head on a pike in a french revolution bobbing before a window what was the inference but that the patient was bad he might say what he would nowshe would always have seen the head at the window and in fact from this moment she only wanted him to say what he would he might say it too with the greater ease to himself as there wasnt one of her divinations thatas her ownhe would in any way put himself out for finally if he was making her talk she was talking and what it could at any rate come to for him was that she wasnt afraid if he wanted to do the dearest thing in the world for her he would show her he believed she wasnt which undertaking of hersnot to have misled himwas what she counted at the moment as her presumptuous little hint to him that she was as good as himself it put forward the bold idea that he could really be misled and there actually passed between them for some seconds a sign a sign of the eyes only that they knew together where they were this made in their brown old temple of truth its momentary flicker then what followed it was that he had her all the same in his pocket and the whole thing wound up for that consummation with its kind dim smile such kindness was wonderful with such dimness but brightnessthat even of sharp steelwas of course for the other side of the business and it would all come in for her in one way or another do you mean he asked that youve no relations at allnot a parent not a sister not even a cousin nor an aunt  she shook her head as with the easy habit of an interviewed heroine or a freak of nature at a show nobody whatever but the last thing she had come for was to be dreary about it im a survivora survivor of a general wreck you see she added how thats to be taken into accountthat everyone else has gone when i was ten years old there were with my father and my mother six of us im all thats left but they died she went on to be fair all round of different things still there it is and as i told you before im american not that i mean that makes me worse however youll probably know what it makes me  yes he discreetly indulged her i know perfectly what it makes you it makes you to begin with a capital case  she sighed though gratefully as if again before the social scene ah there you are  oh no there we arent at all there i am onlybut as much as you like ive no end of american friends there they are if you please and its a fact that you couldnt very well be in a better place than in their company it puts you with plenty of othersand that isnt pure solitude then he pursued im sure youve an excellent spirit but dont try to bear more things than you need which after an instant he further explained hard things have come to you in youth but you mustnt think life will be for you all hard things youve the right to be happy you must make up your mind to it you must accept any form in which happiness may come  oh ill accept any whatever she almost gaily returned and it seems to me for that matter that im accepting a new one every day now this she smiled  this is very well so far as it goes you can depend on me the great man said for unlimited interest but im only after all one element in fifty we must gather in plenty of others dont mind who knows knows i mean that you and i are friends  ah you do want to see some one she broke out you want to get at some one who cares for me with which however as he simply met this spontaneity in a manner to show that he had often had it from young persons of her race and that he was familiar even with the possibilities of their familiarity she felt her freedom rendered vain by his silence and she immediately tried to think of the most reasonable thing she could say this would be precisely on the subject of that freedom which she now quickly spoke of as complete thats of course by itself a great boon so please dont think i dont know it i can do exactly what i likeanything in all the wide world i havent a creature to asktheres not a finger to stop me i can shake about till im black and blue that perhaps isnt all joy but lots of people i know would like to try it he had appeared about to put a question but then had let her go on which she promptly did for she understood him the next moment as having thus taken it from her that her means were as great as might be she had simply given it to him so and this was all that would ever pass between them on the odious head yet she couldnt help also knowing that an important effect for his judgment or at least for his amusementwhich was his feeling since marvellously he did have feelingwas produced by it all her little pieces had now then fallen together for him like the morsels of coloured glass that used to make combinations under the hand in the depths of one of the polygonal peepshows of childhood so that if its a question of my doing anything under the sun that will help  youll do anything under the sun good he took that beautifully ever so pleasantly for what it was worth but time was neededten minutes or so were needed on the spotto deal even provisionally with the substantive question it was convenient in its degree that there was nothing she wouldnt do but it seemed also highly and agreeably vague that she should have to do anything they thus appeared to be taking her together for the moment and almost for sociability as prepared to proceed to gratuitous extremities the upshot of which was in turn that after much interrogation auscultation exploration much noting of his own sequences and neglecting of hers had duly kept up the vagueness they might have struck themselves or may at least strike us as coming back from an undeterred but useless voyage to the north pole milly was ready under orders for the north pole which fact was doubtless what made a blinding anticlimax of her friends actual abstention from orders no she heard him again distinctly repeat it i dont want you for the present to do anything at all anything that is but obey a small prescription or two that will be made clear to you and let me within a few days come to see you at home  it was at first heavenly then youll see mrs stringham but she didnt mind a bit now  well i shant be afraid of mrs stringham and he said it once more as she asked once more absolutely not i send you nowhere englands all rightanywhere thats pleasant convenient decent will be all right you say you can do exactly as you like oblige me therefore by being so good as to do it theres only one thing you ought of course now as soon as ive seen you again to get out of london  milly thought may i then go back to the continent  by all means back to the continent do go back to the continent  then how will you keep seeing me but perhaps she quickly added you wont want to keep seeing me  he had it all ready he had really everything all ready i shall follow you up though if you mean that i dont want you to keep seeing me  well she asked  it was only just here that he struck her the least bit as stumbling well see all you can thats what it comes to worry about nothing you have at least no worries its a great rare chance  she had got up for she had had from him both that he would send her something and would advise her promptly of the date of his coming to her by which she was virtually dismissed yet for herself one or two things kept her may i come back to england too  rather whenever you like but always when you do come immediately let me know  ah said milly it wont be a great going to and fro  then if youll stay with us so much the better  it touched her the way he controlled his impatience of her and the fact itself affected her as so precious that she yielded to the wish to get more from it so you dont think im out of my mind  perhaps that is he smiled all thats the matter  she looked at him longer no thats too good shall i at any rate suffer  not a bit  and yet then live  my dear young lady said her distinguished friend isnt to live exactly what im trying to persuade you to take the trouble to do   xiii  she had gone out with these last words so in her ears that when once she was well awayback this time in the great square aloneit was as if some instant application of them had opened out there before her it was positively this effect an excitement that carried her on she went forward into space under the sense of an impulse receivedan impulse simple and direct easy above all to act upon she was borne up for the hour and now she knew why she had wanted to come by herself no one in the world could have sufficiently entered into her state no tie would have been close enough to enable a companion to walk beside her without some disparity she literally felt in this first flush that her only company must be the human race at large present all round her but inspiringly impersonal and that her only field must be then and there the grey immensity of london grey immensity had somehow of a sudden become her element grey immensity was what her distinguished friend had for the moment furnished her world with and what the question of living as he put it to her living by option by volition inevitably took on for its immediate face she went straight before her without weakness altogether with strength and still as she went she was more glad to be alone for nobodynot kate croy not susan shepherd eitherwould have wished to rush with her as she rushed she had asked him at the last whether being on foot she might go home so or elsewhere and he had replied as if almost amused again at her extravagance youre active luckily by natureits beautiful therefore rejoice in it be active without follyfor youre not foolish be as active as you can and as you like that had been in fact the final push as well as the touch that most made a mixture of her consciousnessa strange mixture that tasted at one and the same time of what she had lost and what had been given her it was wonderful to her while she took her random course that these quantities felt so equal she had been treatedhadnt sheas if it were in her power to live and yet one wasnt treated sowas oneunless it came up quite as much that one might die the beauty of the bloom had gone from the small old sense of safetythat was distinct she had left it behind her there forever but the beauty of the idea of a great adventure a big dim experiment or struggle in which she might more responsibly than ever before take a hand had been offered her instead it was as if she had had to pluck off her breast to throw away some friendly ornament a familiar flower a little old jewel that was part of her daily dress and to take up and shoulder as a substitute some queer defensive weapon a musket a spear a battleaxe conducive possibly in a higher degree to a striking appearance but demanding all the effort of the military posture she felt this instrument for that matter already on her back so that she proceeded now in very truth as a soldier on a marchproceeded as if for her initiation the first charge had been sounded she passed along unknown streets over dusty littery ways between long rows of fronts not enhanced by the august light she felt good for miles and only wanted to get lost there were moments at corners where she stopped and chose her direction in which she quite lived up to his injunction to rejoice that she was active it was like a new pleasure to have so new a reason she would affirm without delay her option her volition taking this personal possession of what surrounded her was a fair affirmation to start with and she really didnt care if she made it at the cost of alarms for susie susie would wonder in due course whatever as they said at the hotel had become of her yet this would be nothing either probably to wonderments still in store wonderments in truth milly felt even now attended her steps it was quite as if she saw in peoples eyes the reflection of her appearance and pace she found herself moving at times in regions visibly not haunted by oddlooking girls from new york duskily draped sableplumed all but incongruously shod and gazing about them with extravagance she might from the curiosity she clearly excited in byways in sidestreets peopled with grimy children and costermongers carts which she hoped were slums literally have had her musket on her shoulder have announced herself as freshly on the warpath but for the fear of overdoing this character she would here and there have begun conversation have asked her way in spite of the fact that as that would help the requirements of adventure her way was exactly what she wanted not to know the difficulty was that she at last accidentally found it she had come out she presently saw at the regents park round which on two or three occasions with kate croy her public chariot had solemnly rolled but she went into it further now this was the real thing the real thing was to be quite away from the pompous roads well within the centre and on the stretches of shabby grass here were benches and smutty sheep here were idle lads at games of ball with their cries mild in the thick air here were wanderers anxious and tired like herself here doubtless were hundreds of others just in the same box their box their great common anxiety what was it in this grim breathingspace but the practical question of life they could live if they would that is like herself they had been told so she saw them all about her on seats digesting the information feeling it altered assimilated recognising it again as something in a slightly different shape familiar enough the blessed old truth that they would live if they could all she thus shared with them made her wish to sit in their company which she so far did that she looked for a bench that was empty eschewing a still emptier chair that she saw hard by and for which she would have paid with superiority a fee  the last scrap of superiority had soon enough left her if only because she before long knew herself for more tired than she had proposed this and the charm after a fashion of the situation in itself made her linger and rest there was a sort of spell in the sense that nobody in the world knew where she was it was the first time in her life that this had happened somebody everybody appeared to have known before at every instant of it where she was so that she was now suddenly able to put it to herself that that hadnt been a life this present kind of thing therefore might bewhich was where precisely her distinguished friend seemed to be wishing her to come out he wished her also it was true not to make as she was perhaps doing now too much of her isolation at the same time however as he clearly desired to deny her no decent source of interest he was interestedshe arrived at thatin her appealing to as many sources as possible and it fairly filtered into her as she sat and sat that he was essentially propping her up had she been doing it herself she would have called it bolsteringthe bolstering that was simply for the weak and she thought and thought as she put together the proofs that it was as one of the weak he was treating her it was of course as one of the weak that she had gone to himbut oh with how sneaking a hope that he might pronounce her as to all indispensables a veritable young lioness what indeed she was really confronted with was the consciousness that he had not after all pronounced her anything she nursed herself into the sense that he had beautifully got out of it did he think however she wondered that he could keep out of it to the endthough as she weighed the question she yet felt it a little unjust milly weighed in this extraordinary hour questions numerous and strange but she had happily before she moved worked round to a simplification stranger than anything for instance was the effect of its rolling over her that when one considered it he might perhaps have got out by one door but to come in with a beautiful beneficent dishonesty by another it kept her more intensely motionless there that what he might fundamentally be up to was some disguised intention of standing by her as a friend wasnt that what women always said they wanted to do when they deprecated the addresses of gentlemen they couldnt more intimately go on with it was what they no doubt sincerely fancied they could make of men of whom they couldnt make husbands and she didnt even reason that it was by a similar law the expedient of doctors in general for the invalids of whom they couldnt make patients she was somehow so sufficiently aware that her doctor washowever fatuous it might soundexceptionally moved this was the damning little factif she could talk of damnation that she could believe herself to have caught him in the act of irrelevantly liking her she hadnt gone to him to be liked she had gone to him to be judged and he was quite a great enough man to be in the habit as a rule of observing the difference she could like him as she distinctly didthat was another matter all the more that her doing so was now so obviously for herself compatible with judgment yet it would have been all portentously mixed had not as we say a final merciful wave chilling rather but washing clear come to her assistance  it came of a sudden when all other thought was spent she had been asking herself why if her case was graveand she knew what she meant by thathe should have talked to her at all about what she might with futility do or why on the other hand if it were light he should attach an importance to the office of friendship she had him with her little lonely acutenessas acuteness went during the dogdays in the regents parkin a cleft stick she either mattered and then she was ill or she didnt matter and then she was well enough now he was acting as they said at home as if she did matteruntil he should prove the contrary it was too evident that a person at his high pressure must keep his inconsistencies which were probably his highest amusements only for the very greatest occasions her prevision in fine of just where she should catch him furnished the light of that judgment in which we describe her as daring to indulge and the judgment it was that made her sensation simple he had distinguished herthat was the chill he hadnt knownhow could hethat she was devilishly subtle subtle exactly in the manner of the suspected the suspicious the condemned he in fact confessed to it in his way as to an interest in her combinations her funny race her funny losses her funny gains her funny freedom and no doubt above all her funny mannersfunny like those of americans at their best without being vulgar legitimating amiability and helping to pass it off in his appreciation of these redundancies he dressed out for her the compassion he so signally permitted himself to waste but its operation for herself was as directly divesting denuding exposing it reduced her to her ultimate state which was that of a poor girl with her rent to pay for examplestaring before her in a great city milly had her rent to pay her rent for her future everything else but how to meet it fell away from her in pieces in tatters this was the sensation the great man had doubtless not purposed well she must go home like the poor girl and see there might after all be ways the poor girl too would be thinking it came back for that matter perhaps to views already presented she looked about her again on her feet at her scattered melancholy comradessome of them so melancholy as to be down on their stomachs in the grass turned away ignoring burrowing she saw once more with them those two faces of the question between which there was so little to choose for inspiration it was perhaps superficially more striking that one could live if one would but it was more appealing insinuating irresistible in short that one would live if one could  she found after this for the day or two more amusement than she had ventured to count on in the fact if it were not a mere fancy of deceiving susie and she presently felt that what made the difference was the mere fancyas this was oneof a countermove to her great man his taking on himselfshould he do soto get at her companion made her suddenly she held irresponsible made any notion of her own all right for her though indeed at the very moment she invited herself to enjoy this impunity she became aware of new matter for surprise or at least for speculation her idea would rather have been that mrs stringham would have looked at her hardher sketch of the grounds of her long independent excursion showing she could feel as almost cynically superficial yet the dear woman so failed in the event to avail herself of any right of criticism that it was sensibly tempting for an hour to wonder if kate croy had been playing perfectly fair hadnt she possibly from motives of the highest benevolence promptings of the finest anxiety just given poor susie what she would have called the straight tip it must immediately be mentioned however that quite apart from a remembrance of the distinctness of kates promise milly the next thing found her explanation in a truth that had the merit of being general if susie at this crisis suspiciously spared her it was really that susie was always suspiciously sparing heryet occasionally too with portentous and exceptional mercies the girl was conscious of how she dropped at times into inscrutable impenetrable deferencesattitudes that though without at all intending it made a difference for familiarity for the ease of intimacy it was as if she recalled herself to manners to the law of courtetiquettewhich last note above all helped our young woman to a just appreciation it was definite for her even if not quite solid that to treat her as a princess was a positive need of her companions mind wherefore she couldnt help it if this lady had her transcendent view of the way the class in question were treated susan had read history had read gibbon and froude and saintsimon she had highlights as to the special allowances made for the class and since she saw them when young as effete and overtutored inevitably ironic and infinitely refined one must take it for amusing if she inclined to an indulgence verily byzantine if one could only be byzantinewasnt that what she insidiously led one on to sigh milly tried to oblige herfor it really placed susan herself so handsomely to be byzantine now the great ladies of that raceit would be somewhere in gibbonwerent apparently questioned about their mysteries but oh poor milly and hers susan at all events proved scarce more inquisitive than if she had been a mosaic at ravenna susan was a porcelain monument to the odd moral that consideration might like cynicism have abysses besides the puritan finally disencumbered what starved generations wasnt mrs stringham in fancy going to make up for  kate croy came straight to the hotelcame that evening shortly before dinner specifically and publicly moreover in a hansom that driven apparently very fast pulled up beneath their windows almost with the clatter of an accident a smash milly alone as happened in the great garnished void of their sittingroom where a little really like a caged byzantine she had been pacing through the queer longdrawn almost sinister delay of night an effect she yet likedmilly at the sound one of the french windows standing open passed out to the balcony that overhung with pretensions the general entrance and so was in time for the look that kate alighting paying her cabman happened to send up to the front the visitor moreover had a shilling back to wait for during which milly from the balcony looked down at her and a mute exchange but with smiles and nods took place between them on what had occurred in the morning it was what kate had called for and the tone was thus almost by accident determined for milly before her friend came up what was also however determined for her was again yet irrepressibly again that the image presented to her the splendid young woman who looked so particularly handsome in impatience with the fine freedom of her signal was the peculiar property of somebody elses vision that this fine freedom in short was the fine freedom she showed mr densher just so was how she looked to him and just so was how milly was held by herheld as by the strange sense of seeing through that distant persons eyes it lasted as usual the strange sense but fifty seconds yet in so lasting it produced an effect it produced in fact more than one and we take them in their order the first was that it struck our young woman as absurd to say that a girls looking so to a man could possibly be without connections and the second was that by the time kate had got into the room milly was in mental possession of the main connection it must have for herself  she produced this commodity on the spotproduced it that is in straight response to kates frank well what the inquiry bore of course with kates eagerness on the issue of the mornings scene the great mans latest wisdom and it doubtless affected milly a little as the cheerful demand for news is apt to affect troubled spirits when news is not in one of the neater forms prepared for delivery she couldnt have said what it was exactly that on the instant determined her the nearest description of it would perhaps have been as the more vivid impression of all her friend took for granted the contrast between this free quantity and the maze of possibilities through which for hours she had herself been picking her way put on in short for the moment a grossness that even friendly forms scarce lightened it helped forward in fact the revelation to herself that she absolutely had nothing to tell besides which certainly there was something elsean influence at the particular juncture still more obscure kate had lost on the way upstairs the lookthe lookthat made her young hostess so subtly think and one of the signs of which was that she never kept it for many moments at once yet she stood there none the less so in her bloom and in her strength so completely again the handsome girl beyond all others the handsome girl for whom milly had at first gratefully taken her that to meet her now with the note of the plaintive would amount somehow to a surrender to a confession she would never in her life be ill the greatest doctor would keep her at the worst the fewest minutes and it was as if she had asked just with all this practical impeccability for all that was most mortal in her friend these things for milly inwardly danced their dance but the vibration produced and the dust kicked up had lasted less than our account of them almost before she knew it she was answering and answering beautifully with no consciousness of fraud only as with a sudden flare of the famous willpower she had heard about read about and which was what her medical adviser had mainly thrown her back on oh its all right hes lovely  kate was splendid and it would have been clear for milly now had the further presumption been needed that she had said no word to mrs stringham you mean youve been absurd  absurd it was a simple word to say but the consequence of it for our young woman was that she felt it as soon as spoken to have done something for her safety  and kate really hung on her lips theres nothing at all the matter  nothing to worry about i shall take a little watching but i shant have to do anything dreadful or even in the least inconvenient i can do in fact as i like it was wonderful for milly how just to put it so made all its pieces fall at present quite properly into places  yet even before the full effect came kate had seized kissed blessed her my love youre too sweet its too dear but its as i was sure then she grasped the full beauty you can do as you like  quite isnt it charming  ah but catch you kate triumphed with gaiety not doing and what shall you do  for the moment simply enjoy it enjoymilly was completely luminoushaving got out of my scrape  learning you mean so easily that you are well  it was as if kate had but too conveniently put the words into her mouth learning i mean so easily that i am well  only no ones of course well enough to stay in london now he cant kate went on want this of you  mercy noim to knock about im to go to places  but not beastly climatesengadines rivieras boredoms  no just as i say where i prefer im to go in for pleasure  oh the duckkate with her own shades of familiarity abounded but what kind of pleasure  the highest milly smiled  her friend met it as nobly which is the highest  well its just our chance to find out you must help me  what have i wanted to do but help you kate asked from the moment i first laid eyes on you yet with this too kate had her wonder i like your talking though about that what help with your luck all round do you want   xiv  milly indeed at last couldnt say so that she had really for the time brought it along to the point so oddly marked for her by her visitors arrival the truth that she was enviably strong she carried this out from that evening for each hour still left her and the more easily perhaps that the hours were now narrowly numbered all she actually waited for was sir luke stretts promised visit as to her proceeding on which however her mind was quite made up since he wanted to get at susie he should have the freest access and then perhaps he would see how he liked it what was between them they might settle as between them and any pressure it should lift from her own spirit they were at liberty to convert to their use if the dear man wished to fire susan shepherd with a still higher ideal he would only after all at the worst have susan on his hands if devotion in a word was what it would come up for the interested pair to organise she was herself ready to consume it as the dressed and served dish he had talked to her of her appetite her account of which she felt must have been vague but for devotion she could now see this appetite would be of the best gross greedy ravenousthese were doubtless the proper names for her she was at all events resigned in advance to the machinations of sympathy the day that followed her lonely excursion was to be the last but two or three of their stay in london and the evening of that day practically ranked for them as in the matter of outside relations the last of all people were by this time quite scattered and many of those who had so liberally manifested in calls in cards in evident sincerity about visits later on over the land had positively passed in music out of sight whether as members these latter more especially of mrs lowders immediate circle or as members of lord marksour friends being by this time able to make the distinction the general pitch had thus decidedly dropped and the occasions still to be dealt with were special and few one of these for milly announced itself as the doctors call already mentioned as to which she had now had a note from him the single other of importance was their appointed leavetakingfor the shortest separationin respect to mrs lowder and kate the aunt and the niece were to dine with them alone intimately and easilyas easily as should be consistent with the question of their afterwards going on together to some absurdly belated party at which they had had it from aunt maud that they would do well to show sir luke was to make his appearance on the morrow of this and in respect to that complication milly had already her plan  the night was at all events hot and stale and it was late enough by the time the four ladies had been gathered in for their small session at the hotel where the windows were still open to the high balconies and the flames of the candles behind the pink shadesdisposed as for the vigil of watcherswere motionless in the air in which the season lay dead what was presently settled among them was that milly who betrayed on this occasion a preference more marked than usual should not hold herself obliged to climb that evening the social stair however it might stretch to meet her and that mrs lowder and mrs stringham facing the ordeal together kate croy should remain with her and await their return it was a pleasure to milly ever to send susan shepherd forth she saw her go with complacency liked as it were to put people off with her and noted with satisfaction when she so moved to the carriage the further denudationa markedly ebbing tideof her little benevolent back if it wasnt quite aunt mauds ideal moreover to take out the new american girls funny friend instead of the new american girl herself nothing could better indicate the range of that ladys merit than the spirit in whichas at the present hour for instanceshe made the best of the minor advantage and she did this with a broad cheerful absence of illusion she did itconfessing even as much to poor susiebecause frankly she was goodnatured when mrs stringham observed that her own light was too abjectly borrowed and that it was as a link alone fortunately not missing that she was valued aunt maud concurred to the extent of the remark well my dear youre better than nothing tonight furthermore it came up for milly that aunt maud had something particular in mind mrs stringham before adjourning with her had gone off for some shawl or other accessory and kate as if a little impatient for their withdrawal had wandered out to the balcony where she hovered for the time unseen though with scarce more to look at than the dim london stars and the cruder glow up the street on a corner of a small publichouse in front of which a fagged cabhorse was thrown into relief mrs lowder made use of the moment milly felt as soon as she had spoken that what she was doing was somehow for use  dear susan tells me that you saw in america mr densherwhom ive never till now as you may have noticed asked you about but do you mind at last in connection with him doing something for me she had lowered her fine voice to a depth though speaking with all her rich glibness and milly after a small sharpness of surprise was already guessing the sense of her appeal will you name him in any way you like to herand aunt maud gave a nod at the window so that you may perhaps find out whether hes back  ever so many things for milly fell into line at this it was a wonder she afterwards thought that she could be conscious of so many at once she smiled hard however for them all but i dont know that its important to me to find out the array of things was further swollen however even as she said this by its striking her as too much to say she therefore tried as quickly to say less except you mean of course that its important to you she fancied aunt maud was looking at her almost as hard as she was herself smiling and that gave her another impulse you know i never have yet named him to her so that if i should break out now  wellmrs lowder waited  why she may wonder what ive been making a mystery of she hasnt mentioned him you know milly went on herself  noher friend a little heavily weighed itshe wouldnt so its she you see then who has made the mystery  yes milly but wanted to see only there was so much there has been of course no particular reason yet that indeed was neither here nor there do you think she asked he is back  it will be about his time i gather and rather a comfort to me definitely to know  then cant you ask her yourself  ah we never speak of him  it helped milly for the moment to the convenience of a puzzled pause do you mean hes an acquaintance of whom you disapprove for her  aunt maud as well just hung fire i disapprove of her for the poor young man she doesnt care for him  and he cares so much  too much too much and my fear is said mrs lowder that he privately besets her she keeps it to herself but i dont want her worried neither in truth she both generously and confidentially concluded do i want him  milly showed all her own effort to meet the case but what can i do  you can find out where they are if i myself try mrs lowder explained i shall appear to treat them as if i supposed them deceiving me  and you dont you dont milly mused for her suppose them deceiving you  well said aunt maud whose fine onyx eyes failed to blink even though millys questions might have been taken as drawing her rather further than she had originally meant to gowell kate is thoroughly aware of my views for her and that i take her being with me at present in the way she is with me if you know what i mean as a loyal assent to them therefore as my views dont happen to provide a place at all for mr densher much in a manner as i like himtherefore therefore in short she had been prompted to this step though she completed her sense but sketchily with the rattle of her large fan  it assisted them perhaps however for the moment that milly was able to pick out of her sense what might serve as the clearest part of it you do like him then  oh dear yes dont you  milly hesitated for the question was somehow as the sudden point of something sharp on a nerve that winced she just caught her breath but she had ground for joy afterwards she felt in not really having failed to choose with quickness sufficient out of fifteen possible answers the one that would best serve her she was then almost proud as well that she had cheerfully smiled i didthree timesin new york so came and went for her in these simple words the speech that was to figure for her later on that night as the one she had ever uttered that cost her most she was to lie awake at all events half the night for the gladness of not having taken any line so really inferior as the denial of a happy impression  for mrs lowder also moreover her simple words were the right ones they were at any rate that ladys laugh showed in the natural note of the racy you dear american thing but people may be very good and yet not good for what one wants  yes the girl assented even i suppose when what one wants is something very good  oh my child it would take too long just now to tell you all i want i want everything at once and togetherand ever so much for you too you know but youve seen us aunt maud continued youll have made out  ah said milly i dont make out for againit came that way in rushesshe felt an obscurity in things why if our friend here doesnt like him  should i conceive her interested in keeping things from me mrs lowder did justice to the question my dear how can you ask put yourself in her place she meets me but on her terms proud young women are proud young women and proud old ones arewell what i am fond of you as we both are you can help us  milly tried to be inspired does it come back then to my asking her straight  at this however finally aunt maud threw her up oh if youve so many reasons not  ive not so many milly smiled but ive one if i break out so suddenly as knowing him what will she make of my not having spoken before  mrs lowder looked blank at it why should you care what she makes you may have only been decently discreet  ah i have been the girl made haste to say  besides her friend went on i suggested to you through susan your line  yes that reasons a reason for me  and for me mrs lowder insisted shes not therefore so stupid as not to do justice to grounds so marked you can tell her perfectly that i had asked you to say nothing  and may i tell her that youve asked me now to speak  mrs lowder might well have thought yet oddly this pulled her up you cant do it without  milly was almost ashamed to be raising so many difficulties ill do what i can if youll kindly tell me one thing more she faltered a littleit was so prying but she brought it out will he have been writing to her  its exactly my dear what i should like to know mrs lowder was at last impatient push in for yourself and i dare say shell tell you  even now all the same milly had not quite fallen back it will be pushing in she continued to smile for you she allowed her companion however no time to take this up the point will be that if he has been writing she may have answered  but what point you subtle thing is that  it isnt subtle it seems to me but quite simple milly said that if she has answered she has very possibly spoken of me  very certainly indeed but what difference will it make  the girl had a moment at this of thinking it natural that her interlocutress herself should so fail of subtlety it will make the difference that he will have written to her in answer that he knows me and that in turn our young woman explained will give an oddity to my own silence  how so if shes perfectly aware of having given you no opening the only oddity aunt maud lucidly professed is for yourself its in her not having spoken  ah there we are said milly  and she had uttered it evidently in a tone that struck her friend then it has troubled you  but ah the inquiry had only to be made to bring the rare colour with fine inconsequence to her face not really the least little bit and quickly feeling the need to abound in this sense she was on the point to cut short of declaring that she cared after all no scrap how much she obliged only she felt at this instant too the intervention of still other things mrs lowder was in the first place already beforehand already affected as by the sudden vision of her having herself pushed too far milly could never judge from her face of her uppermost motiveit was so little in its hard smooth sheen that kind of human countenance she looked hard when she spoke fair the only thing was that when she spoke hard she likewise didnt look soft something none the less had arisen in her nowa full appreciable tide entering by the rupture of some bar she announced that if what she had asked was to prove in the least a bore her young friend was not to dream of it making her young friend at the same time by the change in her tone dream on the spot more profusely she spoke with a belated light milly could apprehendshe could always apprehendfrom pity and the result of that perception for the girl was singular it proved to her as quickly that kate keeping her secret had been straight with her from kate distinctly then as to why she was to be pitied aunt maud knew nothing and was thereby simply putting in evidence the fine side of her own character this fine side was that she could almost at any hour by a kindled preference or a diverted energy glow for another interest than her own she exclaimed as well at this moment that milly must have been thinking round the case much more than she had supposed and this remark could at once affect the girl as sharply as any other form of the charge of weakness it was what everyone if she didnt look out would soon be sayingtheres something the matter with you what one was therefore ones self concerned immediately to establish was that there was nothing at all i shall like to help you i shall like so far as that goes to help kate herself she made such haste as she could to declare her eyes wandering meanwhile across the width of the room to that dusk of the balcony in which their companion perhaps a little unaccountably lingered she suggested hereby her impatience to begin she almost overtly wondered at the length of the opportunity this friend was giving themreferring it however so far as words went to the other friend breaking off with an amused how tremendously susie must be beautifying  it only marked aunt maud none the less as too preoccupied for her allusion the onyx eyes were fixed upon her with a polished pressure that must signify some enriched benevolence let it go my dear we shall after all soon enough see  if he has come back we shall certainly see milly after a moment replied for hell probably feel that he cant quite civilly not come to see me then there she remarked we shall be it wouldnt then you see come through kate at allit would come through him except she wound up with a smile that he wont find me  she had the most extraordinary sense of interesting her interlocutress in spite of herself more than she wanted it was as if her doom so floated her on that she couldnt stopby very much the same trick it had played her with her doctor shall you run away from him  she neglected the question wanting only now to get off then she went on youll deal with kate directly  shall you run away from her mrs lowder profoundly inquired while they became aware of susies return through the room opening out behind them in which they had dined  this affected milly as giving her but an instant and suddenly with it everything she felt in the connection rose to her lips in a question that even as she put it she knew she was failing to keep colourless is it your own belief that he is with her  aunt maud took it intook in that is everything of the tone that she just wanted her not to and the result for some seconds was but to make their eyes meet in silence mrs stringham had rejoined them and was asking if kate had gonean inquiry at once answered by this young ladys reappearance they saw her again in the open window where looking at them she had pausedproducing thus on aunt mauds part almost too impressive a hush mrs lowder indeed without loss of time smothered any danger in a sweeping retreat with susie but millys words to her just uttered about dealing with her niece directly struck our young woman as already recoiling on herself directness however evaded would be fully for her nothing in fact would ever have been for her so direct as the evasion kate had remained in the window very handsome and upright the outer dark framing in a highly favourable way her summery simplicities and lightnesses of dress milly had given the relation of space no real fear she had heard their talk only she hovered there as with conscious eyes and some added advantage then indeed with small delay her friend sufficiently saw the conscious eyes the added advantage were but those she had now always at commandthose proper to the person milly knew as known to merton densher it was for several seconds again as if the total of her identity had been that of the person known to hima determination having for result another sharpness of its own kate had positively but to be there just as she was to tell her he had come back it seemed to pass between them in fine without a word that he was in london that he was perhaps only round the corner and surely therefore no dealing of millys with her would yet have been so direct   xv  it was doubtless because this queer form of directness had in itself for the hour seemed so sufficient that milly was afterwards aware of having really all the whileduring the strange indescribable session before the return of their companionsdone nothing to intensify it if she was most aware only afterwards under the long discurtained ordeal of the morrows dawn that was because she had really till their evenings end came ceased after a little to miss anything from their ostensible comfort what was behind showed but in gleams and glimpses what was in front never at all confessed to not holding the stage three minutes had not passed before milly quite knew she should have done nothing aunt maud had just asked her she knew it moreover by much the same light that had acted for her with that lady and with sir luke strett it pressed upon her then and there that she was still in a current determined through her indifference timidity bravery generosityshe scarce could say whichby others that not she but the current acted and that somebody else always was the keeper of the lock or the dam kate for example had but to open the floodgate the current moved in its massthe current as it had been of her doing as kate wanted what somehow in the most extraordinary way in the world had kate wanted but to be of a sudden more interesting than she had ever been milly for their evening then quite held her breath with the appreciation of it if she hadnt been sure her companion would have had nothing from her moments with mrs lowder to go by she would almost have seen the admirable creature cutting in to anticipate a danger this fantasy indeed while they sat together dropped after a little even if only because other fantasies multiplied and clustered making fairly for our young woman the buoyant medium in which her friend talked and moved they sat together i say but kate moved as much as she talked she figured there restless and charming just perhaps a shade perfunctory repeatedly quitting her place taking slowly to and fro in the trailing folds of her light dress the length of the room and almost avowedly performing for the pleasure of her hostess  mrs lowder had said to milly at matcham that she and her niece as allies could practically conquer the world but though it was a speech about which there had even then been a vague grand glamour the girl read into it at present more of an approach to a meaning kate for that matter by herself could conquer anything and she milly theale was probably concerned with the world only as the small scrap of it that most impinged on her and that was therefore first to be dealt with on this basis of being dealt with she would doubtless herself do her share of the conquering she would have something to supply kate something to takeeach of them thus to that tune something for squaring with aunt mauds ideal this in short was what it came to nowthat the occasion in the quiet late lamplight had the quality of a rough rehearsal of the possible big drama milly knew herself dealt withhandsomely completely she surrendered to the knowledge for so it was she felt that she supplied her helpful force and what kate had to take kate took as freely and to all appearance as gratefully accepting afresh with each of her long slow walks the relation between them so established and consecrating her companions surrender simply by the interest she gave it the interest to milly herself we naturally mean the interest to kate milly felt as probably inferior it easily and largely came for their present talk for the quick flight of the hour before the breach of the spellit all came when considered from the circumstance not in the least abnormal that the handsome girl was in extraordinary form milly remembered her having said that she was at her best late at night remembered it by its having with its fine assurance made her wonder when she was at her best and how happy people must be who had such a fixed time she had no time at all she was never at her bestunless indeed it were exactly as now in listening watching admiring collapsing if kate moreover quite mercilessly had never been so good the beauty and the marvel of it was that she had never really been so frank being a person of such a calibre as milly would have said that even while dealing with you and thereby as it were picking her steps she could let herself go could in irony in confidence in extravagance tell you things she had never told before that was the impressionthat she was telling things and quite conceivably for her own relief as well almost as if the errors of vision the mistakes of proportion the residuary innocence of spirit still to be remedied on the part of her auditor had their moments of proving too much for her nerves she went at them just now these sources of irritation with an amused energy that it would have been open to milly to regard as cynical and that was nevertheless called foras to this the other was distinctby the way that in certain connections the american mind broke down it seemed at leastthe american mind as sitting there thrilled and dazzled in millynot to understand english society without a separate confrontation with all the cases it couldnt proceed bythere was some technical term she lacked until milly suggested both analogy and induction and then differently instinct none of which were right it had to be led up and introduced to each aspect of the monster enabled to walk all round it whether for the consequent exaggerated ecstasy or for the still more as appeared to this critic disproportionate shock it might the monster kate conceded loom large for those born amid forms less developed and therefore no doubt less amusing it might on some sides be a strange and dreadful monster calculated to devour the unwary to abase the proud to scandalize the good but if one had to live with it one must not to be for ever sitting up learn how which was virtually in short tonight what the handsome girl showed herself as teaching  she gave away publicly in this process lancaster gate and everything it contained she gave away hand over hand millys thrill continued to note aunt maud and aunt mauds glories and aunt mauds complacencies she gave herself away most of all and it was naturally what most contributed to her candour she didnt speak to her friend once more in aunt mauds strain of how they could scale the skies she spoke by her bright perverse preference on this occasion of the need in the first place of being neither stupid nor vulgar it might have been a lesson for our young american in the art of seeing things as they werea lesson so various and so sustained that the pupil had as we have shown but receptively to gape the odd thing furthermore was that it could serve its purpose while explicitly disavowing every personal bias it wasnt that she disliked aunt maud who was everything she had on other occasions declared but the dear woman ineffaceably stamped by inscrutable nature and a dreadful art wasnthow could she bewhat she wasnt she wasnt any one she wasnt anything she wasnt anywhere milly mustnt think itone couldnt as a good friend let her those hours at matcham were inesp√©r√©es were pure manna from heaven or if not wholly that perhaps with humbugging old lord mark as a backer were vain as a ground for hopes and calculations lord mark was very well but he wasnt the cleverest creature in england and even if he had been he still wouldnt have been the most obliging he weighed it out in ounces and indeed each of the pair was really waiting for what the other would put down  she has put down you said milly attached to the subject still and i think what you mean is that on the counter she still keeps hold of you  lestkate took it uphe should suddenly grab me and run oh as he isnt ready to run hes much less ready naturally to grab i amyoure so far right as thaton the counter when im not in the shopwindow in and out of which im thus conveniently commercially whisked the essence all of it of my position and the price as properly of my aunts protection lord mark was substantially what she had begun with as soon as they were alone the impression was even yet with milly of her having sounded his name having imposed it as a topic in direct opposition to the other name that mrs lowder had left in the air and that all her own look as we have seen kept there at first for her companion the immediate strange effect had been that of her consciously needing as it were an alibiwhich successfully she so found she had worked it to the end ridden it to and fro across the course marked for milly by aunt maud and now she had quite so to speak broken it in the bore is that if she wants him so muchwants him heaven forgive her for mehe has put us all out since your arrival by wanting somebody else i dont mean somebody else than you  milly threw off the charm sufficiently to shake her head then i havent made out who it is if im any part of his alternative he had better stop where he is  truly trulyalways always  milly tried to insist with an equal gaiety would you like me to swear  kate appeared for a momentthough that was doubtless but gaiety tooto think havent we been swearing enough  you have perhaps but i havent and i ought to give you the equivalent at any rate there it is truly truly as you sayalways always so im not in the way  thanks said katebut that doesnt help me  oh its as simplifying for him that i speak of it  the difficulty really is that hes a person with so many ideas that its particularly hard to simplify for him thats exactly of course what aunt maud has been trying he wont kate firmly continued make up his mind about me  well milly smiled give him time  her friend met it in perfection one is doing thatone is but one remains all the same but one of his ideas  theres no harm in that milly returned if you come out in the end as the best of them whats a man she pursued especially an ambitious one without a variety of ideas  no doubt the more the merrier and kate looked at her grandly one can but hope to come out and do nothing to prevent it  all of which made for the impression fantastic or not of the alibi the splendour the grandeur were for milly the bold ironic spirit behind it so interesting too in itself what moreover was not less interesting was the fact as our young woman noted it that kate confined her point to the difficulties so far as she was concerned raised only by lord mark she referred now to none that her own taste might present which circumstance again played its little part she was doing what she liked in respect to another person but she was in no way committed to the other person and her furthermore talking of lord mark as not young and not true were only the signs of her clear selfconsciousness were all in the line of her slightly hard but scarce the less graceful extravagance she didnt wish to show too much her consent to be arranged for but that was a different thing from not wishing sufficiently to give it there was something moreover on it all that milly still found occasion to say if your aunt has been as you tell me put out by me i feel that she has remained remarkably kind  oh but she haswhatever might have happened in that respectplenty of use for you you put her in my dear more than you put her out you dont half see it but she has clutched your petticoat you can do anythingyou can do i mean lots that we cant youre an outsider independent and standing by yourself youre not hideously relative to tiers and tiers of others and kate facing in that direction went further and further wound up while milly gaped with extraordinary words were of no use to youits decent to tell you youd be of use to us but thats a different matter my honest advice to you would be she went indeed all lengthsto drop us while you can it would be funny if you didnt soon see how awfully better you can do weve not really done for you the least thing worth speaking ofnothing you mightnt easily have had in some other way therefore youre under no obligation you wont want us next year we shall only continue to want you but thats no reason for you and you mustnt pay too dreadfully for poor mrs stringhams having let you in she has the best conscience in the world shes enchanted with what she has done but you shouldnt take your people from her it has been quite awful to see you do it  milly tried to be amused so as notit was too absurdto be fairly frightened strange enough indeedif not natural enoughthat late at night thus in a mere mercenary house with susie away a want of confidence should possess her she recalled with all the rest of it the next day piecing things together in the dawn that she had felt herself alone with a creature who paced like a panther that was a violent image but it made her a little less ashamed of having been scared for all her scare none the less she had now the sense to find words and yet without susie i shouldnt have had you  it had been at this point however that kate flickered highest oh you may very well loathe me yet  really at last thus it had been too much as with her own least feeble flare after a wondering watch milly had shown she hadnt cared she had too much wanted to know and though a small solemnity of reproach a sombre strain had broken into her tone it was to figure as her nearest approach to serving mrs lowder why do you say such things to me  this unexpectedly had acted by a sudden turn of kates attitude as a happy speech she had risen as she spoke and kate had stopped before her shining at her instantly with a softer brightness poor milly hereby enjoyed one of her views of how people wincing oddly were often touched by her because youre a dove with which she felt herself ever so delicately so considerately embraced not with familiarity or as a liberty taken but almost ceremonially and in the manner of an accolade partly as if though a dove who could perch on a finger one were also a princess with whom forms were to be observed it even came to her through the touch of her companions lips that this form this cool pressure fairly sealed the sense of what kate had just said it was moreover for the girl like an inspiration she found herself accepting as the right one while she caught her breath with relief the name so given her she met it on the instant as she would have met the revealed truth it lighted up the strange dusk in which she lately had walked that was what was the matter with her she was a dove oh wasnt sheit echoed within her as she became aware of the sound outside of the return of their friends there was the next thing little enough doubt about it after aunt maud had been two minutes in the room she had come up mrs lowder with susanwhich she neednt have done at that hour instead of letting kate come down to her so that milly could be quite sure it was to catch hold in some way of the loose end they had left well the way she did catch was simply to make the point that it didnt now in the least matter she had mounted the stairs for this and she had her moment again with her younger hostess while kate on the spot as the latter at the time noted gave susan shepherd unwonted opportunities kate was in other words as aunt maud engaged her friend listening with the handsomest response to mrs stringhams impression of the scene they had just quitted it was in the tone of the fondest indulgencealmost really that of dove cooing to dovethat mrs lowder expressed to milly the hope that it had all gone beautifully her all had an ample benevolence it soothed and simplified she spoke as if it were the two young women not she and her comrade who had been facing the town together but millys answer had prepared itself while aunt maud was on the stair she had felt in a rush all the reasons that would make it the most dovelike and she gave it while she was about it as earnest as candid i dont think dear lady hes here  it gave her straightway the measure of the success she could have as a dove that was recorded in the long look of deep criticism a look without a word that mrs lowder poured forth and the word presently bettered it still oh you exquisite thing the luscious innuendo of it almost startling lingered in the room after the visitors had gone like an oversweet fragrance but left alone with mrs stringham milly continued to breathe it she studied again the dovelike and so set her companion to mere rich reporting that she averted all inquiry into her own case  that with the new day was once more her lawthough she saw before her of course as something of a complication her need each time to decide she should have to be clear as to how a dove would act she settled it she thought well enough this morning by quite readopting her plan in respect to sir luke strett that she was pleased to reflect had originally been pitched in the key of a merely iridescent drab and although mrs stringham after breakfast began by staring at it as if it had been a priceless persian carpet suddenly unrolled at her feet she had no scruple at the end of five minutes in leaving her to make the best of it sir luke strett comes by appointment to see me at eleven but im going out on purpose hes to be told please deceptively that im at home and you as my representative when he comes up are to see him instead he will like that this time better so do be nice to him it had taken naturally more explanation and the mention above all of the fact that the visitor was the greatest of doctors yet when once the key had been offered susie slipped it on her bunch and her young friend could again feel her lovely imagination operate it operated in truth very much as mrs lowders at the last had done the night before it made the air heavy once more with the extravagance of assent it might afresh almost have frightened our young woman to see how people rushed to meet her had she then so little time to live that the road must always be spared her it was as if they were helping her to take it out on the spot susieshe couldnt deny and didnt pretend tomight of a truth on her side have treated such news as a flash merely lurid as to which to do susie justice the pain of it was all there but none the less the margin always allowed her young friend was all there as well and the proposal now made her what was it in short but byzantine the vision of millys perception of the propriety of the matter had at any rate quickly engulfed so far as her attitude was concerned any surprise and any shock so that she only desired the next thing perfectly to possess the facts milly could easily speak on this as if there were only one she made nothing of such another as that she had felt herself menaced the great fact in fine was that she knew him to desire just now more than anything else to meet quite apart some one interested in her who therefore so interested as her faithful susan the only other circumstance that by the time she had quitted her friend she had treated as worth mentioning was the circumstance of her having at first intended to keep quiet she had originally best seen herself as sweetly secretive as to that she had changed and her present request was the result she didnt say why she had changed but she trusted her faithful susan their visitor would trust her not less and she herself would adore their visitor moreover he wouldntthe girl felt suretell her anything dreadful the worst would be that he was in love and that he needed a confidant to work it and now she was going to the national gallery   xvi  the idea of the national gallery had been with her from the moment of her hearing from sir luke strett about his hour of coming it had been in her mind as a place so meagrely visited as one of the places that had seemed at home one of the attractions of europe and one of its highest aids to culture but thatthe old storythe typical frivolous always ended by sacrificing to vulgar pleasures she had had perfectly at those whimsical moments on the br√ºnig the halfshamed sense of turning her back on such opportunities for real improvement as had figured to her from of old in connection with the continental tour under the general head of pictures and things and now she knew for what she had done so the plea had been explicitshe had done so for life as opposed to learning the upshot of which had been that life was now beautifully provided for in spite of those few dips and dashes into the manycoloured stream of history for which of late kate croy had helped her to find time there were possible great chances she had neglected possible great moments she should save for today have all but missed she might still she had felt overtake one or two of them among the titians and the turners she had been honestly nursing the hour and once she was in the benignant halls her faith knew itself justified it was the air she wanted and the world she would now exclusively choose the quiet chambers nobly overwhelming rich but slightly veiled opened out round her and made her presently say if i could lose myself here there were people people in plenty but admirably no personal question it was immense outside the personal question but she had blissfully left it outside and the nearest it came for a quarter of an hour to glimmering again into sight was when she watched for a little one of the more earnest of the ladycopyists two or three in particular spectacled aproned absorbed engaged her sympathy to an absurd extent seemed to show her for the time the right way to live she should have been a lady copyistit met so the case the case was the case of escape of living under water of being at once impersonal and firm there it was before oneone had only to stick and stick  milly yielded to this charm till she was almost ashamed she watched the ladycopyists till she found herself wondering what would be thought by others of a young woman of adequate aspect who should appear to regard them as the pride of the place she would have liked to talk to them to get as it figured to her into their lives and was deterred but by the fact that she didnt quite see herself as purchasing imitations and yet feared she might excite the expectation of purchase she really knew before long that what held her was the mere refuge that something within her was after all too weak for the turners and titians they joined hands about her in a circle too vast though a circle that a year before she would only have desired to trace they were truly for the larger not for the smaller life the life of which the actual pitch for example was an interest the interest of compassion in misguided efforts she marked absurdly her little stations blinking in her shrinkage of curiosity at the glorious walls yet keeping an eye on vistas and approaches so that she shouldnt be flagrantly caught the vistas and approaches drew her in this way from room to room and she had been through many parts of the show as she supposed when she sat down to rest there were chairs in scant clusters places from which one could gaze milly indeed at present fixed her eyes more than elsewhere on the appearance first that she couldnt quite after all have accounted to an examiner for the order of her schools and then on that of her being more tired than she had meant in spite of her having been so much less intelligent they found her eyes it should be added other occupation as well which she let them freely follow they rested largely in her vagueness on the vagueness of other visitors they attached themselves in especial with mixed results to the surprising stream of her compatriots she was struck with the circumstance that the great museum early in august was haunted with these pilgrims as also with that of her knowing them from afar marking them easily each and all and recognising not less promptly that they had ever new lights for hernew lights on their own darkness she gave herself up at last and it was a consummation like another what she should have come to the national gallery for today would be to watch the copyists and reckon the baedekers that perhaps was the moral of a menaced state of healththat one would sit in public places and count the americans it passed the time in a manner but it seemed already the second line of defence and this notwithstanding the pattern so unmistakable of her countryfolk they were cut out as by scissors coloured labelled mounted but their relation to her failed to actthey somehow did nothing for her partly no doubt they didnt so much as notice or know her didnt even recognise their community of collapse with her the sign on her as she sat there that for her too europe was tough it came to her idly thusfor her humour could still playthat she didnt seem then the same success with them as with the inhabitants of london who had taken her up on scarce more of an acquaintance she could wonder if they would be different should she go back with that glamour attached and she could also wonder if it came to that whether she should ever go back her friends straggled past at any rate in all the vividness of their absent criticism and she had even at last the sense of taking a mean advantage there was a finer instant however at which three ladies clearly a mother and daughters had paused before her under compulsion of a comment apparently just uttered by one of them and referring to some object on the other side of the room milly had her back to the object but her face very much to her young compatriot the one who had spoken and in whose look she perceived a certain gloom of recognition recognition for that matter sat confessedly in her own eyes she knew the three generically as easily as a schoolboy with a crib in his lap would know the answer in class she felt like the schoolboy guilty enoughquestioned as honour went as to her right so to possess to dispossess people who hadnt consciously provoked her she would have been able to say where they lived and how had the place and the way been but amenable to the positive she bent tenderly in imagination over marital paternal mr whateverhewas at home eternally named with all the honours and placidities but eternally unseen and existing only as some one who could be financially heard from the mother the puffed and composed whiteness of whose hair had no relation to her apparent age showed a countenance almost chemically clean and dry her companions wore an air of vague resentment humanised by fatigue and the three were equally adorned with short cloaks of coloured cloth surmounted by little tartan hoods the tartans were doubtless conceivable as different but the cloaks curiously only thinkable as one handsome well if you choose to say so it was the mother who had spoken who herself added after a pause during which milly took the reference as to a picture in the english style the three pair of eyes had converged and their possessors had for an instant rested with the effect of a drop of the subject on this last characterisationwith that too of a gloom not less mute in one of the daughters than murmured in the other millys heart went out to them while they turned their backs she said to herself that they ought to have known her that there was something between them they might have beautifully put together but she had lost them alsothey were cold they left her in her weak wonder as to what they had been looking at the handsome disposed her to turnall the more that the english style would be the english school which she liked only she saw before moving by the array on the side facing her that she was in fact among small dutch pictures the action of this was again appreciablethe dim surmise that it wouldnt then be by a picture that the spring in the three ladies had been pressed it was at all events time she should go and she turned as she got on her feet she had had behind her one of the entrances and various visitors who had come in while she sat visitors single and in pairsby one of the former of whom she felt her eyes suddenly held  this was a gentleman in the middle of the place a gentleman who had removed his hat and was for a moment while he glanced absently as she could see at the top tier of the collection tapping his forehead with his pockethandkerchief the occupation held him long enough to give milly time to take for grantedand a few seconds sufficedthat his face was the object just observed by her friends this could only have been because she concurred in their tribute even qualified and indeed the english style of the gentlemanperhaps by instant contrast to the americanwas what had had the arresting power this arresting power at the same timeand that was the marvelhad already sharpened almost to pain for in the very act of judging the bared head with detachment she felt herself shaken by a knowledge of it it was merton denshers own and he was standing there standing long enough unconscious for her to fix him and then hesitate these successions were swift so that she could still ask herself in freedom if she had best let him see her she could still reply to that that she shouldnt like him to catch her in the effort to prevent this and she might further have decided that he was too preoccupied to see anything had not a perception intervened that surpassed the first in violence she was unable to think afterwards how long she had looked at him before knowing herself as otherwise looked at all she was coherently to put together was that she had had a second recognition without his having noticed her the source of this latter shock was nobody less than kate croykate croy who was suddenly also in the line of vision and whose eyes met her eyes at their next movement kate was but two yards offmr densher wasnt alone kates face specifically said so for after a stare as blank at first as millys it broke into a far smile that was what wonderfullyin addition to the marvel of their meetingpassed from her for milly the instant reduction to easy terms of the fact of their being there the two young women together it was perhaps only afterwards that the girl fully felt the connection between this touch and her already established conviction that kate was a prodigious person yet on the spot she none the less in a degree knew herself handled and again as she had been the night before dealt withabsolutely even dealt with for her greater pleasure a minute in fine hadnt elapsed before kate had somehow made her provisionally take everything as natural the provisional was just the charmacquiring that character from one moment to the other it represented happily so much that kate would explain on the very first chance this left moreoverand that was the greatest wonderall due margin for amusement at the way things happened the monstrous oddity of their turning up in such a place on the very heels of their having separated without allusion to it the handsome girl was thus literally in control of the scene by the time merton densher was ready to exclaim with a high flush or a vivid blushone didnt distinguish the embarrassment from the joywhy miss theale fancy and why miss theale what luck  miss theale had meanwhile the sense that for him too on kates part something wonderful and unspoken was determinant and this although distinctly his companion had no more looked at him with a hint than he had looked at her with a question he had looked and he was looking only at milly herself ever so pleasantly and consideratelyshe scarce knew what to call it but without prejudice to her consciousness all the same that women got out of predicaments better than men the predicament of course wasnt definite or phraseableand the way they let all phrasing pass was presently to recur to our young woman as a characteristic triumph of the civilised state but she took it for granted insistently with a small private flare of passion because the one thing she could think of to do for him was to show him how she eased him off she would really tired and nervous have been much disconcerted were it not that the opportunity in question had saved her it was what had saved her most what had made her after the first few seconds almost as brave for kate as kate was for her had made her only ask herself what their friend would like of her that he was at the end of three minutes without the least complicated reference so smoothly their friend was just the effect of their all being sublimely civilised the flash in which he saw this was for milly fairly inspiringto that degree in fact that she was even now on such a plane yearning to be supreme it took no doubt a big dose of inspiration to treat as not funnyor at least as not unpleasantthe anomaly for kate that she knew their gentleman and for herself that kate was spending the morning with him but everything continued to make for this after milly had tasted of her draught she was to wonder in subsequent reflection what in the world they had actually said since they had made such a success of what they didnt say the sweetness of the draught for the time at any rate was to feel success assured what depended on this for mr densher was all obscurity to her and she perhaps but invented the image of his need as a short cut to service whatever were the facts their perfect manners all round saw them through the finest part of millys own inspiration it may further be mentioned was the quick perception that what would be of most service was so to speak her own native woodnote she had long been conscious with shame for her thin blood or at least for her poor economy of her unused margin as an american girlclosely indeed as in english air the text might appear to cover the page she still had reserves of spontaneity if not of comicality so that all this cash in hand could now find employment she became as spontaneous as possible and as american as it might conveniently appeal to mr densher after his travels to find her she said things in the air and yet flattered herself that she struck him as saying them not in the tone of agitation but in the tone of new york in the tone of new york agitation was beautifully discounted and she had now a sufficient view of how much it might accordingly help her  the help was fairly rendered before they left the place when her friends presently accepted her invitation to adjourn with her to luncheon at her hotel it was in the fifth avenue that the meal might have waited kate had never been there so straight but milly was at present taking her and if mr densher had been he had at least never had to come so fast she proposed it as the natural thingproposed it as the american girl and she saw herself quickly justified by the pace at which she was followed the beauty of the case was that to do it all she had only to appear to take kates hint this had said in its fine first smile oh yes our look is queerbut give me time and the american girl could give time as nobody else could what milly thus gave she therefore made them takeeven if as they might surmise it was rather more than they wanted in the porch of the museum she expressed her preference for a fourwheeler they would take their course in that guise precisely to multiply the minutes she was more than ever justified by the positive charm that her spirit imparted even to their use of this conveyance and she touched her highest pointthat is certainly for herselfas she ushered her companions into the presence of susie susie was there with luncheon with her return in prospect and nothing could now have filled her own consciousness more to the brim than to see this good friend take in how little she was abjectly anxious the cup itself actually offered to this good friend might in truth well be startling for it was composed beyond question of ingredients oddly mixed she caught susie fairly looking at her as if to know whether she had brought in guests to hear sir luke stretts report well it was better her companion should have too much than too little to wonder about she had come out anyway as they said at home for the interest of the thing and interest truly sat in her eyes milly was none the less at the sharpest crisis a little sorry for her she could of necessity extract from the odd scene so comparatively little of a soothing secret she saw mr densher suddenly popping up but she saw nothing else that had happened she saw in the same way her young friend indifferent to her young friends doom and she lacked what would explain it the only thing to keep her in patience was the way after luncheon kate almost as might be said made up to her this was actually perhaps as well what most kept milly herself in patience it had in fact for our young woman a positive beautywas so marked as a deviation from the handsome girls previous courses susie had been a bore to the handsome girl and the change was now suggestive the two sat together after they had risen from table in the apartment in which they had lunched making it thus easy for the other guest and his entertainer to sit in the room adjacent this for the latter personage was the beauty it was almost on kates part like a prayer to be relieved if she honestly liked better to be thrown with susan shepherd than with their other friend why that said practically everything it didnt perhaps altogether say why she had gone out with him for the morning but it said as one thought about as much as she could say to his face  little by little indeed under the vividness of kates behaviour the probabilities fell back into their order merton densher was in love and kate couldnt help itcould only be sorry and kind wouldnt that without wild flurries cover everything milly at all events tried it as a cover tried it hard for the time pulled it over her in the front the larger room drew it up to her chin with energy if it didnt so treated do everything for her it did so much that she could herself supply the rest she made that up by the interest of her great question the question of whether seeing him once more with all that as she called it to herself had come and gone her impression of him would be different from the impression received in new york that had held her from the moment of their leaving the museum it kept her company through their drive and during luncheon and now that she was a quarter of an hour alone with him it became acute she was to feel at this crisis that no clear no common answer no direct satisfaction on this point was to reach her she was to see her question itself simply go to pieces she couldnt tell if he were different or not and she didnt know nor care if she were these things had ceased to matter in the light of the only thing she did know this was that she liked him as she put it to herself as much as ever and if that were to amount to liking a new person the amusement would be but the greater she had thought him at first very quiet in spite of recovery from his original confusion though even the shade of bewilderment she yet perceived had not been due to such vagueness on the subject of her reintensified identity as the probable sight over there of many thousands of her kind would sufficiently have justified no he was quiet inevitably for the first half of the time because millys own lively linethe line of spontaneitymade everything else relative and because too so far as kate was spontaneous it was ever so finely in the air among them that the normal pitch must be kept afterwards when they had got a little more used as it were to each others separate felicity he had begun to talk more clearly bethought himself at a given moment of what his natural lively line would be it would be to take for granted she must wish to hear of the states and to give her in its order everything he had seen and done there he abounded of a sudden he almost insisted he returned after breaks to the charge and the effect was perhaps the more odd as he gave no clue whatever to what he had admired as he went or to what he hadnt he simply drenched her with his sociable storyespecially during the time they were away from the others she had stopped then being americanall to let him be english a permission of which he took she could feel both immense and unconscious advantage she had really never cared less for the states than at this moment but that had nothing to do with the matter it would have been the occasion of her life to learn about them for nothing could put him off and he ventured on no reference to what had happened for herself it might have been almost as if he had known that the greatest of all these adventures was her doing just what she did then  it was at this point that she saw the smash of her great question as complete saw that all she had to do with was the sense of being there with him and there was no chill for this in what she also presently sawthat however he had begun he was now acting from a particular desire determined either by new facts or new fancies to be like everyone else simplifyingly kind to her he had caught on already as to mannerfallen into line with everyone else and if his spirits verily had gone up it might well be that he had thus felt himself lighting on the remedy for all awkwardness whatever he did or he didnt milly knew she should still like himthere was no alternative to that but her heart could none the less sink a little on feeling how much his view of her was destined to have in common withas she now sighed over itthe view she could have dreamed of his not having the view of his having something or other if need be quite viewless of his own but he might have what he could with least trouble and the view wouldnt be after all a positive bar to her seeing him the defect of it in generalif she might so ungraciously criticisewas that by its sweet universality it made
