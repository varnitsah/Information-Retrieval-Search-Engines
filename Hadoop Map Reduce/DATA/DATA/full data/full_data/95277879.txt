bank      and by one drouthy fear made still      forgoing thought of quest or kill      now neath his dam the fawn may see      the lean packwolf as cowed as he      and the tall buck unflinching note      the fangs that tore his fathers throat      the pools are shrunkthe streams are dry      and we be playmates thou and i      till yonder cloudgood huntingloose      the rain that breaks our water truce  the law of the junglewhich is by far the oldest law in the worldhas arranged for almost every kind of accident that may befall the jungle people till now its code is as perfect as time and custom can make it you will remember that mowgli spent a great part of his life in the seeonee wolfpack learning the law from baloo the brown bear and it was baloo who told him when the boy grew impatient at the constant orders that the law was like the giant creeper because it dropped across every ones back and no one could escape when thou hast lived as long as i have little brother thou wilt see how all the jungle obeys at least one law and that will be no pleasant sight said baloo  this talk went in at one ear and out at the other for a boy who spends his life eating and sleeping does not worry about anything till it actually stares him in the face but one year baloos words came true and mowgli saw all the jungle working under the law  it began when the winter rains failed almost entirely and ikki the porcupine meeting mowgli in a bamboothicket told him that the wild yams were drying up now everybody knows that ikki is ridiculously fastidious in his choice of food and will eat nothing but the very best and ripest so mowgli laughed and said what is that to me  not much now said ikki rattling his quills in a stiff uncomfortable way but later we shall see is there any more diving into the deep rockpool below the beerocks little brother  no the foolish water is going all away and i do not wish to break my head said mowgli who in those days was quite sure that he knew as much as any five of the jungle people put together  that is thy loss a small crack might let in some wisdom ikki ducked quickly to prevent mowgli from pulling his nosebristles and mowgli told baloo what ikki had said baloo looked very grave and mumbled half to himself if i were alone i would change my huntinggrounds now before the others began to think and yethunting among strangers ends in fighting and they might hurt the mancub we must wait and see how the mohwa blooms  that spring the mohwa tree that baloo was so fond of never flowered the greeny creamcoloured waxy blossoms were heatkilled before they were born and only a few badsmelling petals came down when he stood on his hind legs and shook the tree then inch by inch the untempered heat crept into the heart of the jungle turning it yellow brown and at last black the green growths in the sides of the ravines burned up to broken wires and curled films of dead stuff the hidden pools sank down and caked over keeping the last least footmark on their edges as if it had been cast in iron the juicystemmed creepers fell away from the trees they clung to and died at their feet the bamboos withered clanking when the hot winds blew and the moss peeled off the rocks deep in the jungle till they were as bare and as hot as the quivering blue boulders in the bed of the stream  the birds and the monkeypeople went north early in the year for they knew what was coming and the deer and the wild pig broke far away to the perished fields of the villages dying sometimes before the eyes of men too weak to kill them chil the kite stayed and grew fat for there was a great deal of carrion and evening after evening he brought the news to the beasts too weak to force their way to fresh huntinggrounds that the sun was killing the jungle for three days flight in every direction  mowgli who had never known what real hunger meant fell back on stale honey three years old scraped out of deserted rockhiveshoney black as a sloe and dusty with dried sugar he hunted too for deepboring grubs under the bark of the trees and robbed the wasps of their new broods all the game in the jungle was no more than skin and bone and bagheera could kill thrice in a night and hardly get a full meal but the want of water was the worst for though the jungle people drink seldom they must drink deep  and the heat went on and on and sucked up all the moisture till at last the main channel of the waingunga was the only stream that carried a trickle of water between its dead banks and when hathi the wild elephant who lives for a hundred years and more saw a long lean blue ridge of rock show dry in the very centre of the stream he knew that he was looking at the peace rock and then and there he lifted up his trunk and proclaimed the water truce as his father before him had proclaimed it fifty years ago the deer wild pig and buffalo took up the cry hoarsely and chil the kite flew in great circles far and wide whistling and shrieking the warning  by the law of the jungle it is death to kill at the drinkingplaces when once the water truce has been declared the reason of this is that drinking comes before eating every one in the jungle can scramble along somehow when only game is scarce but water is water and when there is but one source of supply all hunting stops while the jungle people go there for their needs in good seasons when water was plentiful those who came down to drink at the waingungaor anywhere else for that matterdid so at the risk of their lives and that risk made no small part of the fascination of the nights doings to move down so cunningly that never a leaf stirred to wade kneedeep in the roaring shallows that drown all noise from behind to drink looking backward over one shoulder every muscle ready for the first desperate bound of keen terror to roll on the sandy margin and return wetmuzzled and well plumped out to the admiring herd was a thing that all tallantlered young bucks took a delight in precisely because they knew that at any moment bagheera or shere khan might leap upon them and bear them down but now all that lifeanddeath fun was ended and the jungle people came up starved and weary to the shrunken rivertiger bear deer buffalo and pig all togetherdrank the fouled waters and hung above them too exhausted to move off  the deer and the pig had tramped all day in search of something better than dried bark and withered leaves the buffaloes had found no wallows to be cool in and no green crops to steal the snakes had left the jungle and come down to the river in the hope of finding a stray frog they curled round wet stones and never offered to strike when the nose of a rooting pig dislodged them the riverturtles had long ago been killed by bagheera cleverest of hunters and the fish had buried themselves deep in the dry mud only the peace rock lay across the shallows like a long snake and the little tired ripples hissed as they dried on its hot side  it was here that mowgli came nightly for the cool and the companionship the most hungry of his enemies would hardly have cared for the boy then his naked hide made him seem more lean and wretched than any of his fellows his hair was bleached to tow colour by the sun his ribs stood out like the ribs of a basket and the lumps on his knees and elbows where he was used to track on all fours gave his shrunken limbs the look of knotted grassstems but his eye under his matted forelock was cool and quiet for bagheera was his adviser in this time of trouble and told him to go quietly hunt slowly and never on any account to lose his temper  it is an evil time said the black panther one furnacehot evening but it will go if we can live till the end is thy stomach full mancub  there is stuff in my stomach but i get no good of it think you bagheera the rains have forgotten us and will never come again  not i we shall see the mohwa in blossom yet and the little fawns all fat with new grass come down to the peace rock and hear the news on my back little brother  this is no time to carry weight i can still stand alone butindeed we be no fatted bullocks we two  bagheera looked along his ragged dusty flank and whispered last night i killed a bullock under the yoke so low was i brought that i think i should not have dared to spring if he had been loose wou  mowgli laughed yes we be great hunters now said he i am very boldto eat grubs and the two came down together through the crackling undergrowth to the riverbank and the lacework of shoals that ran out from it in every direction  the water cannot live long said baloo joining them look across yonder are trails like the roads of man  on the level plain of the farther bank the stiff junglegrass had died standing and dying had mummied the beaten tracks of the deer and the pig all heading toward the river had striped that colourless plain with dusty gullies driven through the tenfoot grass and early as it was each long avenue was full of firstcomers hastening to the water you could hear the does and fawns coughing in the snufflike dust  upstream at the bend of the sluggish pool round the peace rock and warden of the water truce stood hathi the wild elephant with his sons gaunt and gray in the moonlight rocking to and froalways rocking below him a little were the vanguard of the deer below these again the pig and the wild buffalo and on the opposite bank where the tall trees came down to the waters edge was the place set apart for the eaters of fleshthe tiger the wolves the panther the bear and the others  we are under one law indeed said bagheera wading into the water and looking across at the lines of clicking horns and starting eyes where the deer and the pig pushed each other to and fro good hunting all you of my blood he added lying own at full length one flank thrust out of the shallows and then between his teeth but for that which is the law it would be very good hunting  the quickspread ears of the deer caught the last sentence and a frightened whisper ran along the ranks the truce remember the truce  peace there peace gurgled hathi the wild elephant the truce holds bagheera this is no time to talk of hunting  who should know better than i bagheera answered rolling his yellow eyes upstream i am an eater of turtlesa fisher of frogs ngaayah would i could get good from chewing branches  we wish so very greatly bleated a young fawn who had only been born that spring and did not at all like it wretched as the jungle people were even hathi could not help chuckling while mowgli lying on his elbows in the warm water laughed aloud and beat up the scum with his feet  well spoken little budhorn bagheera purred when the truce ends that shall be remembered in thy favour and he looked keenly through the darkness to make sure of recognising the fawn again  gradually the talking spread up and down the drinkingplaces one could hear the scuffling snorting pig asking for more room the buffaloes grunting among themselves as they lurched out across the sandbars and the deer telling pitiful stories of their long footsore wanderings in quest of food now and again they asked some question of the eaters of flesh across the river but all the news was bad and the roaring hot wind of the jungle came and went between the rocks and the rattling branches and scattered twigs and dust on the water  the menfolk too they die beside their ploughs said a young sambhur i passed three between sunset and night they lay still and their bullocks with them we also shall lie still in a little  the river has fallen since last night said baloo o hathi hast thou ever seen the like of this drought  it will pass it will pass said hathi squirting water along his back and sides  we have one here that cannot endure long said baloo and he looked toward the boy he loved  i said mowgli indignantly sitting up in the water i have no long fur to cover my bones butbut if thy hide were taken off baloo  hathi shook all over at the idea and baloo said severely  mancub that is not seemly to tell a teacher of the law never have i been seen without my hide  nay i meant no harm baloo but only that thou art as it were like the cocoanut in the husk and i am the same cocoanut all naked now that brown husk of thine mowgli was sitting crosslegged and explaining things with his forefinger in his usual way when bagheera put out a paddy paw and pulled him over backward into the water  worse and worse said the black panther as the boy rose spluttering first baloo is to be skinned and now he is a cocoanut be careful that he does not do what the ripe cocoanuts do  and what is that said mowgli off his guard for the minute though that is one of the oldest catches in the jungle  break thy head said bagheera quietly pulling him under again  it is not good to make a jest of thy teacher said the bear when mowgli had been ducked for the third time  not good what would ye have that naked thing running to and fro makes a monkeyjest of those who have once been good hunters and pulls the best of us by the whiskers for sport this was shere khan the lame tiger limping down to the water he waited a little to enjoy the sensation he made among the deer on the opposite to lap growling the jungle has become a whelpingground for naked cubs now look at me mancub  mowgli lookedstared ratheras insolently as he knew how and in a minute shere khan turned away uneasily mancub this and mancub that he rumbled going on with his drink the cub is neither man nor cub or he would have been afraid next season i shall have to beg his leave for a drink augrh  that may come too said bagheera looking him steadily between the eyes that may come toofaugh shere khanwhat new shame hast thou brought here  the lame tiger had dipped his chin and jowl in the water and dark oily streaks were floating from it downstream  man said shere khan coolly i killed an hour since he went on purring and growling to himself  the line of beasts shook and wavered to and fro and a whisper went up that grew to a cry man man he has killed man then all looked towards hathi the wild elephant but he seemed not to hear hathi never does anything till the time comes and that is one of the reasons why he lives so long  at such a season as this to kill man was no other game afoot said bagheera scornfully drawing himself out of the tainted water and shaking each paw catfashion as he did so  i killed for choicenot for food the horrified whisper began again and hathis watchful little white eye cocked itself in shere khans direction for choice shere khan drawled now come i to drink and make me clean again is there any to forbid  bagheeras back began to curve like a bamboo in a high wind but hathi lifted up his trunk and spoke quietly  thy kill was from choice he asked and when hathi asks a question it is best to answer  even so it was my right and my night thou knowest o hathi shere khan spoke almost courteously  yes i know hathi answered and after a little silence hast thou drunk thy fill  for tonight yes  go then the river is to drink and not to defile none but the lame tiger would so have boasted of his right at this season whenwhen we suffer togetherman and jungle people alike clean or unclean get to thy lair shere khan  the last words rang out like silver trumpets and hathis three sons rolled forward half a pace though there was no need shere khan slunk away not daring to growl for he knewwhat every one else knowsthat when the last comes to the last hathi is the master of the jungle  what is this right shere khan speaks of mowgli whispered in bagheeras ear to kill man is always shameful the law says so and yet hathi says  ask him i do not know little brother right or no right if hathi had not spoken i would have taught that lame butcher his lesson to come to the peace rock fresh from a kill of manand to boast of itis a jackals trick besides he tainted the good water  mowgli waited for a minute to pick up his courage because no one cared to address hathi directly and then he cried what is shere khans right o hathi both banks echoed his words for all the people of the jungle are intensely curious and they had just seen something that none except baloo who looked very thoughtful seemed to understand  it is an old tale said hathi a tale older than the jungle keep silence along the banks and i will tell that tale  there was a minute or two of pushing a shouldering among the pigs and the buffalo and then the leaders of the herds grunted one after another we wait and hathi strode forward till he was nearly kneedeep in the pool by the peace rock lean and wrinkled and yellowtusked though he was he looked what the jungle knew him to betheir master  ye know children he began that of all things ye most fear man and there was a mutter of agreement  this tale touches thee little brother said bagheera to mowgli  i i am of the packa hunter of the free people mowgli answered what have i to do with man  and ye do not know why ye fear man hathi went on this is the reason in the beginning of the jungle and none know when that was we of the jungle walked together having no fear of one another in those days there was no drought and leaves and flowers and fruit grew on the same tree and we ate nothing at all except leaves and flowers and grass and fruit and bark  i am glad i was not born in those days said bagheera bark is only good to sharpen claws  and the lord of the jungle was tha the first of the elephants he drew the jungle out of deep waters with his trunk and where he made furrows in the ground with his tusks there the rivers ran and where he struck with his foot there rose ponds of good water and when he blew through his trunkthusthe trees fell that was the manner in which the jungle was made by tha and so the tale was told to me  it has not lost fat in the telling bagheera whispered and mowgli laughed behind his hand  in those days there was no corn or melons or pepper or sugarcane nor were there any little huts such as ye have all seen and the jungle people knew nothing of man but lived in the jungle together making one people but presently they began to dispute over their food though there was grazing enough for all they were lazy each wished to eat where he lay as sometimes we can do now when the spring rains are good tha the first of the elephants was busy making new jungles and leading the rivers in their beds he could not walk in all places therefore he made the first of the tigers the master and the judge of the jungle to whom the jungle people should bring their disputes in those days the first of the tigers ate fruit and grass with the others he was as large as i am and he was very beautiful in colour all over like the blossom of the yellow creeper there was never stripe nor bar upon his hide in those good days when this the jungle was new all the jungle people came before him without fear and his word was the law of all the jungle we were then remember ye one people  yet upon a night there was a dispute between two bucksa grazingquarrel such as ye now settle with the horns and the forefeetand it is said that as the two spoke together before the first of the first of the tigers lying among the flowers a buck pushed him with his horns and the first of the tigers forgot that he was the master and judge of the jungle and leaping upon that buck broke his neck  till that night never one of us had died and the first of the tigers seeing what he had done and being made foolish by the scent of the blood ran away into the marshes of the north and we of the jungle left without a judge fell to fighting among ourselves and tha heard the noise of it and came back then some of us said this and some of us said that but he saw the dead buck among the flowers and asked who had killed and we of the jungle would not tell because the smell of the blood made us foolish we ran to and fro in circles capering and crying out and shaking our heads then tha gave an order to the trees that hang low and to the trailing creepers of the jungle that they should mark the killer of the buck so that he should know him again and he said who will now be master of the jungle people then up leaped the gray ape who lives in the branches and said i will now be master of the jungle  at this tha laughed and said so be it and went away very angry  children ye know the gray ape he was then as he is now at the first he made a wise face for himself but in a little while he began to scratch and to leap up and down and when tha came back he found the gray ape hanging head down from a bough mocking those who stood below and they mocked him again and so there was no law in the jungleonly foolish talk and senseless words  then tha called us all together and said the first of your masters has brought death into the jungle and the second shame now it is time there was a law and a law that ye must not break now ye shall know fear and when ye have found him ye shall know that he is your master and the rest shall follow then we of the jungle said what is fear and tha said seek till ye find so we went up and down the jungle seeking for fear and presently the buffaloes  ugh said mysa the leader of the buffaloes from their sandbank  yes mysa it was the buffaloes they came back with the news that in a cave in the jungle sat fear and that he had no hair and went upon his hind legs then we of the jungle followed the herd till we came to that cave and fear stood at the mouth of it and he was as the buffaloes had said hairless and he walked upon his hinder legs when he saw us he cried out and his voice filled us with the fear that we have now of that voice when we hear it and we ran away tramping upon and tearing each other because we were afraid that night so it was told to me we of the jungle did not lie down together as used to be our custom but each tribe drew off by itselfthe pig with the pig the deer with the deer horn to horn hoof to hooflike keeping to like and so lay shaking in the jungle  only the first of the tigers was not with us for he was still hidden in the marshes of the north and when word was brought to him of the thing we had seen in the cave he said i will go to this thing and break his neck so he ran all the night till he came to the cave but the trees and the creepers on his path remembering the order that tha had given let down their branches and marked him as he ran drawing their fingers across his back his flank his forehead and his jowl wherever they touched him there was a mark and a stripe upon his yellow hide and those stripes do this children wear to this day when he came to the cave fear the hairless one put out his hand and called him the striped one that comes by night and the first of the tigers was afraid of the hairless one and ran back to the swamps howling  mowgli chuckled quietly here his chin in the water  so loud did he howl that tha heard him and said what is the sorrow and the first of the tigers lifting up his muzzle to the newmade sky which is now so old said give me back my power o tha i am made ashamed before all the jungle and i have run away from a hairless one and he has called me a shameful name and why said tha because i am smeared with the mud of the marshes said the first of the tigers swim then and roll on the wet grass and if it be mud it will wash away said tha and the first of the tigers swam and rolled and rolled upon the grass till the jungle ran round and round before his eyes but not one little bar upon all his hide was changed and tha watching him laughed then the first of the tigers said what have i done that this comes to me tha said thou hast killed the buck and thou hast let death loose in the jungle and with death has come fear so that the people of the jungle are afraid one of the other as thou art afraid of the hairless one the first of the tigers said they will never fear me for i knew them since the beginning tha said go and see and the first of the tigers ran to and fro calling aloud to the deer and the pig and the sambhur and the porcupine and all the jungle peoples and they all ran away from him who had been their judge because they were afraid  then the first of the tigers came back and his pride was broken in him and beating his head upon the ground he tore up the earth with all his feet and said remember that i was once the master of the jungle do not forget me o tha let my children remember that i was once without shame or fear and tha said this much i will do because thou and i together saw the jungle made for one night in each year it shall be as it was before the buck was killedfor thee and for thy children in that one night if ye meet the hairless oneand his name is manye shall not be afraid of him but he shall be afraid of you as though ye were judges of the jungle and masters of all things show him mercy in that night of his fear for thou hast known what fear is  then the first of the tigers answered i am content but when next he drank he saw the black stripes upon his flank and his side and he remembered the name that the hairless one had given him and he was angry for a year he lived in the marshes waiting till tha should keep his promise and upon a night when the jackal of the moon the evening star stood clear of the jungle he felt that his night was upon him and he went to that cave to meet the hairless one then it happened as tha promised for the hairless one fell down before him and lay along the ground and the first of the tigers struck him and broke his back for he thought that there was but one such thing in the jungle and that he had killed fear then nosing above the kill he heard tha coming down from the woods of the north and presently the voice of the first of the elephants which is the voice that we hear now  the thunder was rolling up and down the dry scarred hills but it brought no rainonly heatlightning that flickered along the ridgesand hathi went on that was the voice he heard and it said is this thy mercy the first of the tigers licked his lips and said what matter i have killed fear and tha said o blind and foolish thou hast untied the feet of death and he will follow thy trail till thou diest thou hast taught man to kill  the first of the tigers standing stiffly to his kill said he is as the buck was there is no fear now i will judge the jungle peoples once more  and tha said never again shall the jungle peoples come to thee they shall never cross thy trail nor sleep near thee nor follow after thee nor browse by thy lair only fear shall follow thee and with a blow that thou canst not see he shall bid thee wait his pleasure he shall make the ground to open under thy feet and the creeper to twist about thy neck and the treetrunks to grow together about thee higher than thou canst leap and at the last he shall take thy hide to wrap his cubs when they are cold thou hast shown him no mercy and none will he show thee  the first of the tigers was very bold for his night was still on him and he said the promise of tha is the promise of tha he will not take away my night and tha said the one night is thine as i have said but there is a price to pay thou hast taught man to kill and he is no slow learner  the first of the tigers said he is here under my foot and his back is broken let the jungle know i have killed fear  then tha laughed and said thou hast killed one of many but thou thyself shalt tell the junglefor thy night is ended  so the day came and from the mouth of the cave went out another hairless one and he saw the kill in the path and the first of the tigers above it and he took a pointed stick  they throw a thing that cuts now said ikki rustling down the bank for ikki was considered uncommonly good eating by the gondsthey called him hoigooand he knew something of the wicked little gondee axe that whirls across a clearing like a dragonfly  it was a pointed stick such as they put in the foot of a pittrap said hathi and throwing it he struck the first of the tigers deep in the flank thus it happened as tha said for the first of the tigers ran howling up and down the jungle till he tore out the stick and all the jungle knew that the hairless one could strike from far off and they feared more than before so it came about that the first of the tigers taught the hairless one to killand ye know what harm that has since done to all our peoplesthrough the noose and the pitfall and the hidden trap and the flying stick and the stinging fly that comes out of white smoke hathi meant the rifle and the red flower that drives us into the open yet for one night in the year the hairless one fears the tiger as tha promised and never has the tiger given him cause to be less afraid where he finds him there he kills him remembering how the first of the tigers was made ashamed for the rest fear walks up and down the jungle by day and by night  ahi aoo said the deer thinking of what it all meant to them  and only when there is one great fear over all as there is now can we of the jungle lay aside our little fears and meet together in one place as we do now  for one night only does man fear the tiger said mowgli  for one night only said hathi  but ibut webut all the jungle knows that shere khan kills man twice and thrice in a moon  even so then he springs from behind and turns his head aside as he strikes for he is full of fear if man looked at him he would run but on his one night he goes openly down to the village he walks between the houses and thrusts his head into the doorway and the men fall on their faces and there he does his kill one kill in that night  oh said mowgli to himself rolling over in the water now i see why it was shere khan bade me look at him he got no good of it for he could not hold his eyes steady andand i certainly did not fall down at his feet but then i am not a man being of the free people  umm said bagheera deep in his furry throat does the tiger know his night  never till the jackal of the moon stands clear of the evening mist sometimes it falls in the dry summer and sometimes in the wet rainsthis one night of the tiger but for the first of the tigers this would never have been nor would any of us have known fear  the deer grunted sorrowfully and bagheeras lips curled in a wicked smile do men know thistale said he  none know it except the tigers and we the elephantsthe children of tha now ye by the pools have heard it and i have spoken  hathi dipped his trunk into the water as a sign that he did not wish to talk  butbutbut said mowgli turning to baloo why did not the first of the tigers continue to eat grass and leaves and trees he did but break the bucks neck he did not eat what led him to the hot meat  the trees and the creepers marked him little brother and made him the striped thing that we see never again would he eat their fruit but from that day he revenged himself upon the deer and the others the eaters of grass said baloo  then thou knowest the tale heh why have i never heard  because the jungle is full of such tales if i made a beginning there would never be an end to them let go my ear little brother     the law of the jungle  just to give you an idea of the immense variety of the jungle law i have translated into verse baloo always recited them in a sort of singsong a few of the laws that apply to the wolves there are of course hundreds and hundreds more but these will do for specimens of the simpler rulings       now this is the law of the jungleas old and as true as         the sky      and the wolf that shall keep it may prosper but the wolf         that shall break it must die       as the creeper that girdles the treetrunk the law runneth         forward and back      for the strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength         of the wolf is the pack       wash daily from nosetip to tailtip drink deeply but         never too deep      and remember the night is for hunting and forget not         the day is for sleep       the jackal may follow the tiger but cub when thy         whiskers are grown      remember the wolf is a huntergo forth and get food         of thine own       keep peace with the lords of the junglethe tiger the         panther the bear      and trouble not hathi the silent and mock not the boar         in his lair       when pack meets with pack in the jungle and neither         will go from the trail      lie down till the leaders have spokenit may be fair         words shall prevail       when ye fight with a wolf of the pack ye must         fight him alone and afar      lest others take part in the quarrel and the pack be         diminished by war       the lair of the wolf is his refuge and where he has         made him his home      not even the head wolf may enter not even the council         may come       the lair of the wolf is his refuge but where he has         digged it too plain      the council shall send him a message and so he shall         change it again       if ye kill before midnight be silent and wake not the         woods with your bay      lest ye frighten the deer from the crops and the brothers         go empty away       ye may kill for yourselves and your mates and your cubs         as they need and ye can      but kill not for pleasure of killing and seven times never         kill man       if ye plunder his kill from a weaker devour not all in         thy pride

the haunch         and the hump isobey     the miracle of purun bhagat       the night we felt the earth would move        we stole and plucked him by the hand      because we loved him with the love        that knows but cannot understand       and when the roaring hillside broke        and all our world fell down in rain      we saved him we the little folk        but lo he does not come again       mourn now we saved him for the sake        of such poor love as wild ones may      mourn ye our brother will not wake        and his own kind drive us away                               dirge of the langurs   there was once a man in india who was prime minister of one of the semiindependent native states in the northwestern part of the country he was a brahmin so highcaste that caste ceased to have any particular meaning for him and his father had been an important official in the gaycoloured tagrag and bobtail of an oldfashioned hindu court but as purun dass grew up he felt that the old order of things was changing and that if any one wished to get on in the world he must stand well with the english and imitate all that the english believed to be good at the same time a native official must keep his own masters favour this was a difficult game but the quiet closemouthed young brahmin helped by a good english education at a bombay university played it coolly and rose step by step to be prime minister of the kingdom that is to say he held more real power than his master the maharajah  when the old kingwho was suspicious of the english their railways and telegraphsdied purun dass stood high with his young successor who had been tutored by an englishman and between them though he always took care that his master should have the credit they established schools for little girls made roads and started state dispensaries and shows of agricultural implements and published a yearly bluebook on the moral and material progress of the state and the foreign office and the government of india were delighted very few native states take up english progress altogether for they will not believe as purun dass showed he did that what was good for the englishman must be twice as good for the asiatic the prime minister became the honoured friend of viceroys and governors and lieutenantgovernors and medical missionaries and common missionaries and hardriding english officers who came to shoot in the state preserves as well as of whole hosts of tourists who travelled up and down india in the cold weather showing how things ought to be managed in his spare time he would endow scholarships for the study of medicine and manufactures on strictly english lines and write letters to the pioneer the greatest indian daily paper explaining his masters aims and objects  at last he went to england on a visit and had to pay enormous sums to the priests when he came back for even so highcaste a brahmin as purun dass lost caste by crossing the black sea in london he met and talked with every one worth knowingmen whose names go all over the worldand saw a great deal more than he said he was given honorary degrees by learned universities and he made speeches and talked of hindu social reform to english ladies in evening dress till all london cried this is the most fascinating man we have ever met at dinner since cloths were first laid  when he returned to india there was a blaze of glory for the viceroy himself made a special visit to confer upon the maharajah the grand cross of the star of indiaall diamonds and ribbons and enamel and at the same ceremony while the cannon boomed purun dass was made a knight commander of the order of the indian empire so that his name stood sir purun dass kcie  that evening at dinner in the big viceregal tent he stood up with the badge and the collar of the order on his breast and replying to the toast of his masters health made a speech few englishmen could have bettered  next month when the city had returned to its sunbaked quiet he did a thing no englishman would have dreamed of doing for so far as the worlds affairs went he died the jewelled order of his knighthood went back to the indian government and a new prime minister was appointed to the charge of affairs and a great game of general post began in all the subordinate appointments the priests knew what had happened and the people guessed but india is the one place in the world where a man can do as he pleases and nobody asks why and the fact that dewan sir purun dass kcie had resigned position palace and power and taken up the beggingbowl and ochrecoloured dress of a sunnyasi or holy man was considered nothing extraordinary he had been as the old law recommends twenty years a youth twenty years a fighterthough he had never carried a weapon in his lifeand twenty years head of a household he had used his wealth and his power for what he knew both to be worth he had taken honour when it came his way he had seen men and cities far and near and men and cities had stood up and honoured him now he would let those things go as a man drops the cloak he no longer needs  behind him as he walked through the city gates an antelope skin and brasshandled crutch under his arm and a beggingbowl of polished brown cocodemer in his hand barefoot alone with eyes cast on the groundbehind him they were firing salutes from the bastions in honour of his happy successor purun dass nodded all that life was ended and he bore it no more illwill or goodwill than a man bears to a colourless dream of the night he was a sunnyasia houseless wandering mendicant depending on his neighbours for his daily bread and so long as there is a morsel to divide in india neither priest nor beggar starves he had never in his life tasted meat and very seldom eaten even fish a fivepound note would have covered his personal expenses for food through any one of the many years in which he had been absolute master of millions of money even when he was being lionised in london he had held before him his dream of peace and quietthe long white dusty indian road printed all over with bare feet the incessant slowmoving traffic and the sharpsmelling wood smoke curling up under the figtrees in the twilight where the wayfarers sit at their evening meal  when the time came to make that dream true the prime minister took the proper steps and in three days you might more easily have found a bubble in the trough of the long atlantic seas than purun dass among the roving gathering separating millions of india  at night his antelope skin was spread where the darkness overtook himsometimes in a sunnyasi monastery by the roadside sometimes by a mudpillar shrine of kala pir where the jogis who are another misty division of holy men would receive him as they do those who know what castes and divisions are worth sometimes on the outskirts of a little hindu village where the children would steal up with the food their parents had prepared and sometimes on the pitch of the bare grazinggrounds where the flame of his stick fire waked the drowsy camels it was all one to purun dassor purun bhagat as he called himself now earth people and food were all one but unconsciously his feet drew him away northward and eastward from the south to rohtak from rohtak to kurnool from kurnool to ruined samanah and then upstream along the dried bed of the gugger river that fills only when the rain falls in the hills till one day he saw the far line of the great himalayas  then purun bhagat smiled for he remembered that his mother was of rajput brahmin birth from kulu waya hillwoman always homesick for the snowsand that the least touch of hill blood draws a man in the end back to where he belongs  yonder said purun bhagat breasting the lower slopes of the sewaliks where the cacti stand up like sevenbranched candlesticksyonder i shall sit down and get knowledge and the cool wind of the himalayas whistled about his ears as he trod the road that led to simla  the last time he had come that way it had been in state with a clattering cavalry escort to visit the gentlest and most affable of viceroys and the two had talked for an hour together about mutual friends in london and what the indian common folk really thought of things this time purun bhagat paid no calls but leaned on the rail of the mall watching that glorious view of the plains spread out forty miles below till a native mohammedan policeman told him he was obstructing traffic and purun bhagat salaamed reverently to the law because he knew the value of it and was seeking for a law of his own then he moved on and slept that night in an empty hut at chota simla which looks like the very last end of the earth but it was only the beginning of his journey he followed the himalayathibet road the little tenfoot track that is blasted out of solid rock or strutted out on timbers over gulfs a thousand feet deep that dips into warm wet shutin valleys and climbs out across bare grassy hillshoulders where the sun strikes like a burningglass or turns through dripping dark forests where the treeferns dress the trunks from head to heel and the pheasant calls to his mate and he met thibetan herdsmen with their dogs and flocks of sheep each sheep with a little bag of borax on his back and wandering woodcutters and cloaked and blanketed lamas from thibet coming into india on pilgrimage and envoys of little solitary hillstates posting furiously on ringstreaked and piebald ponies or the cavalcade of a rajah paying a visit or else for a long clear day he would see nothing more than a black bear grunting and rooting below in the valley when he first started the roar of the world he had left still rang in his ears as the roar of a tunnel rings long after the train has passed through but when he had put the mutteeanee pass behind him that was all done and purun bhagat was alone with himself walking wondering and thinking his eyes on the ground and his thoughts with the clouds  one evening he crossed the highest pass he had met till thenit had been a twodays climband came out on a line of snowpeaks that banded all the horizonmountains from fifteen to twenty thousand feet high looking almost near enough to hit with a stone though they were fifty or sixty miles away the pass was crowned with dense dark forestdeodar walnut wild cherry wild olive and wild pear but mostly deodar which is the himalayan cedar and under the shadow of the deodars stood a deserted shrine to kaliwho is durga who is sitala who is sometimes worshipped against the smallpox  purun dass swept the stone floor clean smiled at the grinning statue made himself a little mud fireplace at the back of the shrine spread his antelope skin on a bed of fresh pineneedles tucked his bairagihis brasshandled crutchunder his armpit and sat down to rest  immediately below him the hillside fell away clean and cleared for fifteen hundred feet where a little village of stonewalled houses with roofs of beaten earth clung to the steep tilt all round it the tiny terraced fields lay out like aprons of patchwork on the knees of the mountain and cows no bigger than beetles grazed between the smooth stone circles of the threshingfloors looking across the valley the eye was deceived by the size of things and could not at first realise that what seemed to be low scrub on the opposite mountainflank was in truth a forest of hundredfoot pines purun bhagat saw an eagle swoop across the gigantic hollow but the great bird dwindled to a dot ere it was halfway over a few bands of scattered clouds strung up and down the valley catching on a shoulder of the hills or rising up and dying out when they were level with the head of the pass and here shall i find peace said purun bhagat  now a hillman makes nothing of a few hundred feet up or down and as soon as the villagers saw the smoke in the deserted shrine the village priest climbed up the terraced hillside to welcome the stranger  when he met purun bhagats eyesthe eyes of a man used to control thousandshe bowed to the earth took the beggingbowl without a word and returned to the village saying we have at last a holy man never have i seen such a man he is of the plainsbut palecoloureda brahmin of the brahmins then all the housewives of the village said think you he will stay with us and each did her best to cook the most savoury meal for the bhagat hillfood is very simple but with buckwheat and indian corn and rice and red pepper and little fish out of the stream in the valley and honey from the fluelike hives built in the stone walls and dried apricots and turmeric and wild ginger and bannocks of flour a devout woman can make good things and it was a full bowl that the priest carried to the bhagat was he going to stay asked the priest would he need a chelaa discipleto beg for him had he a blanket against the cold weather was the food good  purun bhagat ate and thanked the giver it was in his mind to stay that was sufficient said the priest let the beggingbowl be placed outside the shrine in the hollow made by those two twisted roots and daily should the bhagat be fed for the village felt honoured that such a manhe looked timidly into the bhagats faceshould tarry among them  that day saw the end of purun bhagats wanderings he had come to the place appointed for himthe silence and the space after this time stopped and he sitting at the mouth of the shrine could not tell whether he were alive or dead a man with control of his limbs or a part of the hills and the clouds and the shifting rain and sunlight he would repeat a name softly to himself a hundred hundred times till at each repetition he seemed to move more and more out of his body sweeping up to the doors of some tremendous discovery but just as the door was opening his body would drag him back and with grief he felt he was locked up again in the flesh and bones of purun bhagat  every morning the filled beggingbowl was laid silently in the crutch of the roots outside the shrine sometimes the priest brought it sometimes a ladakhi trader lodging in the village and anxious to get merit trudged up the path but more often it was the woman who had cooked the meal overnight and she would murmur hardly above her breath speak for me before the gods bhagat speak for such a one the wife of soandso now and then some bold child would be allowed the honour and purun bhagat would hear him drop the bowl and run as fast as his little legs could carry him but the bhagat never came down to the village it was laid out like a map at his feet he could see the evening gatherings held on the circle of the threshingfloors because that was the only level ground could see the wonderful unnamed green of the young rice the indigo blues of the indian corn the docklike patches of buckwheat and in its season the red bloom of the amaranth whose tiny seeds being neither grain nor pulse make a food that can be lawfully eaten by hindus in time of fasts  when the year turned the roofs of the huts were all little squares of purest gold for it was on the roofs that they laid out their cobs of the corn to dry hiving and harvest ricesowing and husking passed before his eyes all embroidered down there on the manysided plots of fields and he thought of them all and wondered what they all led to at the long last  even in populated india a man cannot a day sit still before the wild things run over him as though he were a rock and in that wilderness very soon the wild things who knew kalis shrine well came back to look at the intruder the langurs the big graywhiskered monkeys of the himalayas were naturally the first for they are alive with curiosity and when they had upset the beggingbowl and rolled it round the floor and tried their teeth on the brasshandled crutch and made faces at the antelope skin they decided that the human being who sat so still was harmless at evening they would leap down from the pines and beg with their hands for things to eat and then swing off in graceful curves they liked the warmth of the fire too and huddled round it till purun bhagat had to push them aside to throw on more fuel and in the morning as often as not he would find a furry ape sharing his blanket all day long one or other of the tribe would sit by his side staring out at the snows crooning and looking unspeakably wise and sorrowful  after the monkeys came the barasingh that big deer which is like our red deer but stronger he wished to rub off the velvet of his horns against the cold stones of kalis statue and stamped his feet when he saw the man at the shrine but purun bhagat never moved and little by little the royal stag edged up and nuzzled his shoulder purun bhagat slid one cool hand along the hot antlers and the touch soothed the fretted beast who bowed his head and purun bhagat very softly rubbed and ravelled off the velvet afterward the barasingh brought his doe and fawngentle things that mumbled on the holy mans blanketor would come alone at night his eyes green in the fireflicker to take his share of fresh walnuts at last the muskdeer the shyest and almost the smallest of the deerlets came too her big rabbity ears erect even brindled silent mushicknabha must needs find out what the light in the shrine meant and drop out her mooselike nose into purun bhagats lap coming and going with the shadows of the fire purun bhagat called them all my brothers and his low call of bhai bhai would draw them from the forest at noon if they were within ear shot the himalayan black bear moody and suspicioussona who has the vshaped white mark under his chinpassed that way more than once and since the bhagat showed no fear sona showed no anger but watched him and came closer and begged a share of the caresses and a dole of bread or wild berries often in the still dawns when the bhagat would climb to the very crest of the pass to watch the red day walking along the peaks of the snows he would find sona shuffling and grunting at his heels thrusting a curious forepaw under fallen trunks and bringing it away with a whoof of impatience or his early steps would wake sona where he lay curled up and the great brute rising erect would think to fight till he heard the bhagats voice and knew his best friend  nearly all hermits and holy men who live apart from the big cities have the reputation of being able to work miracles with the wild things but all the miracle lies in keeping still in never making a hasty movement and for a long time at least in never looking directly at a visitor the villagers saw the outline of the barasingh stalking like a shadow through the dark forest behind the shrine saw the minaul the himalayan pheasant blazing in her best colours before kalis statue and the langurs on their haunches inside playing with the walnut shells some of the children too had heard sona singing to himself bearfashion behind the fallen rocks and the bhagats reputation as miracleworker stood firm  yet nothing was farther from his mind than miracles he believed that all things were one big miracle and when a man knows that much he knows something to go upon he knew for a certainty that there was nothing great and nothing little in this world and day and night he strove to think out his way into the heart of things back to the place whence his soul had come  so thinking his untrimmed hair fell down about his shoulders the stone slab at the side of the antelope skin was dented into a little hole by the foot of his brasshandled crutch and the place between the treetrunks where the beggingbowl rested day after day sunk and wore into a hollow almost as smooth as the brown shell itself and each beast knew his exact place at the fire the fields changed their colours with the seasons the threshingfloors filled and emptied and filled again and again and again and again when winter came the langurs frisked among the branches feathered with light snow till the mothermonkeys brought their sadeyed little babies up from the warmer valleys with the spring there were few changes in the village the priest was older and many of the little children who used to come with the beggingdish sent their own children now and when you asked of the villagers how long their holy man had lived in kalis shrine at the head of the pass they answered always  then came such summer rains as had not been known in the hills for many seasons through three good months the valley was wrapped in cloud and soaking miststeady unrelenting downfall breaking off into thundershower after thundershower kalis shrine stood above the clouds for the most part and there was a whole month in which the bhagat never caught a glimpse of his village it was packed away under a white floor of cloud that swayed and shifted and rolled on itself and bulged upward but never broke from its piersthe streaming flanks of the valley  all that time he heard nothing but the sound of a million little waters overhead from the trees and underfoot along the ground soaking through the pineneedles dripping from the tongues of draggled fern and spouting in newlytorn muddy channels down the slopes then the sun came out and drew forth the good incense of the deodars and the rhododendrons and that faroff clean smell which the hill people call the smell of the snows the hot sunshine lasted for a week and then the rains gathered together for their last downpour and the water fell in sheets that flayed off the skin of the ground and leaped back in mud purun bhagat heaped his fire high that night for he was sure his brothers would need warmth but never a beast came to the shrine though he called and called till he dropped asleep wondering what had happened in the woods  it was in the black heart of the night the rain drumming like a thousand drums that he was roused by a plucking at his blanket and stretching out felt the little hand of a langur it is better here than in the trees he said sleepily loosening a fold of blanket take it and be warm the monkey caught his hand and pulled hard is it food then said purun bhagat wait awhile and i will prepare some as he kneeled to throw fuel on the fire the langur ran to the door of the shrine crooned and ran back again plucking at the mans knee  what is it what is thy trouble brother said purun bhagat for the langurs eyes were full of things that he could not tell unless one of thy caste be in a trapand none set traps herei will not go into that weather look brother even the barasingh comes for shelter  the deers antlers clashed as he strode into the shrine clashed against the grinning statue of kali he lowered them in purun bhagats direction and stamped uneasily hissing through his halfshut nostrils  hai hai hai said the bhagat snapping his fingers is this payment for a nights lodging but the deer pushed him toward the door and as he did so purun bhagat heard the sound of something opening with a sigh and saw two slabs of the floor draw away from each other while the sticky earth below smacked its lips  now i see said purun bhagat no blame to my brothers that they did not sit by the fire tonight the mountain is falling and yetwhy should i go his eye fell on the empty beggingbowl and his face changed they have given me good food daily sincesince i came and if i am not swift tomorrow there will not be one mouth in the valley indeed i must go and warn them below back there brother let me get to the fire  the barasingh backed unwillingly as purun bhagat drove a pine torch deep into the flame twirling it till it was well lit ah ye came to warn me he said rising better than that we shall do better than that out now and lend me thy neck brother for i have but two feet  he clutched the bristling withers of the barasingh with his right hand held the torch away with his left and stepped out of the shrine into the desperate night there was no breath of wind but the rain nearly drowned the flare as the great deer hurried down the slope sliding on his haunches as soon as they were clear of the forest more of the bhagats brothers joined them he heard though he could not see the langurs pressing about him and behind them the uhh uhh of sona the rain matted his long white hair into ropes the water splashed beneath his bare feet and his yellow robe clung to his frail old body but he stepped down steadily leaning against the barasingh he was no longer a holy man but sir purun dass kcie prime minister of no small state a man accustomed to command going out to save life down the steep plashy path they poured all together the bhagat and his brothers down and down till the deers feet clicked and stumbled on the wall of a threshingfloor and he snorted because he smelt man now they were at the head of the one crooked village street and the bhagat beat with his crutch on the barred windows of the blacksmiths house as his torch blazed up in the shelter of the eaves up and out cried purun bhagat and he did not know his own voice for it was years since he had spoken aloud to a man the hill falls the hill is falling up and out oh you within  it is our bhagat said the blacksmiths wife he stands among his beasts gather the little ones and give the call  it ran from house to house while the beasts cramped in the narrow way surged and huddled round the bhagat and sona puffed impatiently  the people hurried into the streetthey were no more than seventy souls all toldand in the glare of the torches they saw their bhagat holding back the terrified barasingh while the monkeys plucked piteously at his skirts and sona sat on his haunches and roared  across the valley and up the next hill shouted purun bhagat leave none behind we follow  then the people ran as only hill folk can run for they knew that in a landslip you must climb for the highest ground across the valley they fled splashing through the little river at the bottom and panted up the terraced fields on the far side while the bhagat and his brethren followed up and up the opposite mountain they climbed calling to each other by namethe rollcall of the villageand at their heels toiled the big barasingh weighted by the failing strength of purun bhagat at last the deer stopped in the shadow of a deep pinewood five hundred feet up the hillside his instinct that had warned him of the coming slide told him he would he safe here  purun bhagat dropped fainting by his side for the chill of the rain and that fierce climb were killing him but first he called to the scattered torches ahead stay and count your numbers then whispering to the deer as he saw the lights gather in a cluster stay with me brother staytilligo  there was a sigh in the air that grew to a mutter and a mutter that grew to a roar and a roar that passed all sense of hearing and the hillside on which the villagers stood was hit in the darkness and rocked to the blow then a note as steady deep and true as the deep c of the organ drowned everything for perhaps five minutes while the very roots of the pines quivered to it it died away and the sound of the rain falling on miles of hard ground and grass changed to the muffled drum of water on soft earth that told its own tale  never a villagernot even the priestwas bold enough to speak to the bhagat who had saved their lives they crouched under the pines and waited till the day when it came they looked across the valley and saw that what had been forest and terraced field and trackthreaded grazingground was one raw red fanshaped smear with a few trees flung headdown on the scarp that red ran high up the hill of their refuge damming back the little river which had begun to spread into a brickcoloured lake of the village of the road to the shrine of the shrine itself and the forest behind there was no trace for one mile in width and two thousand feet in sheer depth the mountainside had come away bodily planed clean from head to heel  and the villagers one by one crept through the wood to pray before their bhagat they saw the barasingh standing over him who fled when they came near and they heard the langurs wailing in the branches and sona moaning up the hill but their bhagat was dead sitting crosslegged his back against a tree his crutch under his armpit and his face turned to the northeast  the priest said behold a miracle after a miracle for in this very attitude must all sunnyasis be buried therefore where he now is we will build the temple to our holy man  they built the temple before a year was endeda little stoneandearth shrineand they called the hill the bhagats hill and they worship there with lights and flowers and offerings to this day but they do not know that the saint of their worship is the late sir purun dass kcie dcl phd etc once prime minister of the progressive and enlightened state of mohiniwala and honorary or corresponding member of more learned and scientific societies than will ever do any good in this world or the next     a song of kabir       oh light was the world that he weighed in his hands      oh heavy the tale of his fiefs and his lands      he has gone from the guddee and put on the shroud      and departed in guise of bairagi avowed       now the white road to delhi is mat for his feet      the sal and the kikar must guard him from heat      his home is the camp and the waste and the crowd      he is seeking the way as bairagi avowed       he has looked upon man and his eyeballs are clear      there was one there is one and but one saith kabir      the red mist of doing has thinned to a cloud      he has taken the path for bairagi avowed       to learn and discern of his brother the clod      of his brother the brute and his brother the god      he has gone from the council and put on the shroud      can ye hear saith kabir a bairagi avowed     letting in the jungle        veil them cover them wall them round         blossom and creeper and weed       let us forget the sight and the sound         the smell and the touch of the breed        fat black ash by the altarstone         here is the whitefoot rain       and the does bring forth in the fields unsown         and none shall affright them again       and the blind walls crumble unknown oerthrown         and none shall inhabit again   you will remember that after mowgli had pinned shere khans hide to the council rock he told as many as were left of the seeonee pack that henceforward he would hunt in the jungle alone and the four children of mother and father wolf said that they would hunt with him but it is not easy to change ones life all in a minuteparticularly in the jungle the first thing mowgli did when the disorderly pack had slunk off was to go to the homecave and sleep for a day and a night then he told mother wolf and father wolf as much as they could understand of his adventures among men and when he made the morning sun flicker up and down the blade of his skinningknifethe same he had skinned shere khan withthey said he had learned something then akela and gray brother had to explain their share of the great buffalodrive in the ravine and baloo toiled up the hill to hear all about it and bagheera scratched himself all over with pure delight at the way in which mowgli had managed his war  it was long after sunrise but no one dreamed of going to sleep and from time to time during the talk mother wolf would throw up her head and sniff a deep snuff of satisfaction as the wind brought her the smell of the tigerskin on the council rock  but for akela and gray brother here mowgli said at the end i could have done nothing oh mother mother if thou hadst seen the black herdbulls pour down the ravine or hurry through the gates when the manpack flung stones at me  i am glad i did not see that last said mother wolf stiffly it is not my custom to suffer my cubs to be driven to and fro like jackals i would have taken a price from the manpack but i would have spared the woman who gave thee the milk yes i would have spared her alone  peace peace raksha said father wolf lazily our frog has come back againso wise that his own father must lick his feet and what is a cut more or less on the head leave men alone baloo and bagheera both echoed leave men alone  mowgli his head on mother wolfs side smiled contentedly and said that for his own part he never wished to see or hear or smell man again  but what said akela cocking one earbut what if men do not leave thee alone little brother  we be five said gray brother looking round at the company and snapping his jaws on the last word  we also might attend to that hunting said bagheera with a little switchswitch of his tail looking at baloo but why think of men now akela  for this reason the lone wolf answered when that yellow chiefs hide was hung up on the rock i went back along our trail to the village stepping in my tracks turning aside and lying down to make a mixed trail in case one should follow us but when i had fouled the trail so that i myself hardly knew it again mang the bat came hawking between the trees and hung up above me said mang the village of the manpack where they cast out the mancub hums like a hornets nest  it was a big stone that i threw chuckled mowgli who had often amused himself by throwing ripe pawpaws into a hornets nest and racing off to the nearest pool before the hornets caught him  i asked of mang what he had seen he said that the red flower blossomed at the gate of the village and men sat about it carrying guns now i know for i have good causeakela looked down at the old dry scars on his flank and sidethat men do not carry guns for pleasure presently little brother a man with a gun follows our trailif indeed he be not already on it  but why should he men have cast me out what more do they need said mowgli angrily  thou art a man little brother akela returned it is not for us the free hunters to tell thee what thy brethren do or why  he had just time to snatch up his paw as the skinningknife cut deep into the ground below mowgli struck quicker than an average human eye could follow but akela was a wolf and even a dog who is very far removed from the wild wolf his ancestor can be waked out of deep sleep by a cartwheel touching his flank and can spring away unharmed before that wheel comes on  another time mowgli said quietly returning the knife to its sheath speak of the manpack and of mowgli in two breathsnot one  phff that is a sharp tooth said akela snuffing at the blades cut in the earth but living with the manpack has spoiled thine eye little brother i could have killed a buck while thou wast striking  bagheera sprang to his feet thrust up his head as far as he could sniffed and stiffened through every curve in his body gray brother followed his example quickly keeping a little to his left to get the wind that was blowing from the right while akela bounded fifty yards up wind and halfcrouching stiffened too mowgli looked on enviously he could smell things as very few human beings could but he had never reached the hairtriggerlike sensitiveness of a jungle nose and his three months in the smoky village had set him back sadly however he dampened his finger rubbed it on his nose and stood erect to catch the upper scent which though it is the faintest is the truest  man akela growled dropping on his haunches  buldeo said mowgli sitting down he follows our trail and yonder is the sunlight on his gun look  it was no more than a splash of sunlight for a fraction of a second on the brass clamps of the old tower musket but nothing in the jungle winks with just that flash except when the clouds race over the sky then a piece of mica or a little pool or even a highlypolished leaf will flash like a heliograph but that day was cloudless and still  i knew men would follow said akela triumphantly not for nothing have i led the pack  the four cubs said nothing but ran down hill on their bellies melting into the thorn and underbrush as a mole melts into a lawn  where go ye and without word mowgli called  hsh we roll his skull here before midday gray brother answered  back back and wait man does not eat man mowgli shrieked  who was a wolf but now who drove the knife at me for thinking he might be man said akela as the four wolves turned back sullenly and dropped to heel  am i to give reason for all i choose to do said mowgli furiously  that is man there speaks man bagheera muttered under his whiskers even so did men talk round the kings cages at oodeypore we of the jungle know that man is wisest of all if we trusted our ears we should know that of all things he is most foolish raising his voice he added the mancub is right in this men hunt in packs to kill one unless we know what the others will do is bad hunting come let us see what this man means toward us  we will not come gray brother growled hunt alone little brother we know our own minds the skull would have been ready to bring by now  mowgli had been looking from one to the other of his friends his chest heaving and his eyes full of tears he strode forward to the wolves and dropping on one knee said do i not know my mind look at me  they looked uneasily and when their eyes wandered he called them back again and again till their hair stood up all over their bodies and they trembled in every limb while mowgli stared and stared  now said he of us five which is leader  thou art leader little brother said gray brother and he licked mowglis foot  follow then said mowgli and the four followed at his heels with their tails between their legs  this comes of living with the manpack said bagheera slipping down after them there is more in the jungle now than jungle law baloo  the old bear said nothing but he thought many things  mowgli cut across noiselessly through the jungle at right angles to buldeos path till parting the undergrowth he saw the old man his musket on his shoulder running up the trail of overnight at a dogtrot  you will remember that mowgli had left the village with the heavy weight of shere khans raw hide on his shoulders while akela and gray brother trotted behind so that the triple trail was very clearly marked presently buldeo came to where akela as you know had gone back and mixed it all up then he sat down and coughed and grunted and made little casts round and about into the jungle to pick it up again and all the time he could have thrown a stone over those who were watching him no one can be so silent as a wolf when he does not care to be heard and mowgli though the wolves thought he moved very clumsily could come and go like a shadow they ringed the old man as a school of porpoises ring a steamer at full speed and as they ringed him they talked unconcernedly for their speech began below the lowest end of the scale that untrained human beings can hear the other end is bounded by the high squeak of mang the bat which very many people cannot catch at all from that note all the bird and bat and insect talk takes on  this is better than any kill said gray brother as buldeo stooped and peered and puffed he looks like a lost pig in the jungles by the river what does he say buldeo was muttering savagely  mowgli translated he says that packs of wolves must have danced round me he says that he never saw such a trail in his life he says he is tired  he will be rested before he picks it up again said bagheera coolly as he slipped round a treetrunk in the game of blindmansbuff that they were playing now what does the lean thing do  eat or blow smoke out of his mouth men always play with their mouths said mowgli and the silent trailers saw the old man fill and light and puff at a waterpipe and they took good note of the smell of the tobacco so as to be sure of buldeo in the darkest night if necessary  then a little knot of charcoalburners came down the path and naturally halted to speak to buldeo whose fame as a hunter reached for at least twenty miles round they all sat down and smoked and bagheera and the others came up and watched while buldeo began to tell the story of mowgli the devilchild from one end to another with additions and inventions how he himself had really killed shere khan and how mowgli had turned himself into a wolf and fought with him all the afternoon and changed into a boy again and bewitched buldeos rifle so that the bullet turned the corner when he pointed it at mowgli and killed one of buldeos own buffaloes and how the village knowing him to be the bravest hunter in seeonee had sent him out to kill this devilchild but meantime the village had got hold of messua and her husband who were undoubtedly the father and mother of this devilchild and had barricaded them in their own hut and presently would torture them to make them confess they were witch and wizard and then they would be burned to death  when said the charcoalburners because they would very much like to be present at the ceremony  buldeo said that nothing would be done till he returned because the village wished him to kill the jungle boy first after that they would dispose of messua and her husband and divide their lands and buffaloes among the village messuas husband had some remarkably fine buffaloes too it was an excellent thing to destroy wizards buldeo thought and people who entertained wolfchildren out of the jungle were clearly the worst kind of witches  but said the charcoalburners what would happen if the english heard of it the english they had heard were a perfectly mad people who would not let honest farmers kill witches in peace  why said buldeo the headman of the village would report that messua and her husband had died of snakebite that was all arranged and the only thing now was to kill the wolfchild they did not happen to have seen anything of such a creature  the charcoalburners looked round cautiously and thanked their stars they had not but they had no doubt that so brave a man as buldeo would find him if any one could the sun was getting rather low and they had an idea that they would push on to buldeos village and see that wicked witch buldeo said that though it was his duty to kill the devilchild he could not think of letting a party of unarmed men go through the jungle which might produce the wolfdemon at any minute without his escort he therefore would accompany them and if the sorcerers child appearedwell he would show them how the best hunter in seeonee dealt with such things the brahmin he said had given him a charm against the creature that made everything perfectly safe  what says he what says he what says he the wolves repeated every few minutes and mowgli translated until he came to the witch part of the story which was a little beyond him and then he said that the man and woman who had been so kind to him were trapped  does man trap man said bagheera  so he says i cannot understand the talk they are all mad together what have messua and her man to do with me that they should be put in a trap and what is all this talk about the red flower i must look to this whatever they would do to messua they will not do till buldeo returns and so mowgli thought hard with his fingers playing round the haft of the skinningknife while buldeo and the charcoalburners went off very valiantly in single file  i go hotfoot back to the manpack mowgli said at last  and those said gray brother looking hungrily after the brown backs of the charcoalburners  sing them home said mowgli with a grin i do not wish them to be at the village gates till it is dark can ye hold them  gray brother bared his white teeth in contempt we can head them round and round in circles like tethered goatsif i know man  that i do not need sing to them a little lest they be lonely on the road and gray brother the song need not be of the sweetest go with them bagheera and help make that song when night is shut down meet me by the villagegray brother knows the place  it is no light hunting to work for a mancub when shall i sleep said bagheera yawning though his eyes showed that he was delighted with the amusement me to sing to naked men but let us try  he lowered his head so that the sound would travel and cried a long long good huntinga midnight call in the afternoon which was quite awful enough to begin with mowgli heard it rumble and rise and fall and die off in a creepy sort of whine behind him and laughed to himself as he ran through the jungle he could see the charcoalburners huddled in a knot old buldeos gunbarrel waving like a bananaleaf to every point of the compass at once then gray brother gave the yalahi yalaha call for the buckdriving when the pack drives the nilghai the big blue cow before them and it seemed to come from the very ends of the earth nearer and nearer and nearer till it ended in a shriek snapped off short the other three answered till even mowgli could have vowed that the full pack was in full cry and then they all broke into the magnificent morningsong in the jungle with every turn and flourish and gracenote that a deepmouthed wolf of the pack knows this is a rough rendering of the song but you must imagine what it sounds like when it breaks the afternoon hush of the jungle       one moment past our bodies cast        no shadow on the plain      now clear and black they stride our track        and we run home again      in morning hush each rock and bush        stands hard and high and raw      then give the call good rest to all        that keep the jungle law       now horn and pelt our peoples melt        in covert to abide      now crouched and still to cave and hill        our jungle barons glide      now stark and plain mans oxen strain        that draw the newyoked plough      now stripped and dread the dawn is red        above the lit talao       ho get to lair the suns aflare        behind the breathing grass      and cracking through the young bamboo        the warning whispers pass      by day made strange the woods we range        with blinking eyes we scan      while down the skies the wild duck cries        the daythe day to man       the dew is dried that drenched our hide        or washed about our way      and where we drank the puddled bank        is crisping into clay      the traitor dark gives up each mark        of stretched or hooded claw      then hear the call good rest to all        that keep the jungle law  but no translation can give the effect of it or the yelping scorn the four threw into every word of it as they heard the trees crash when the men hastily climbed up into the branches and buldeo began repeating incantations and charms then they lay down and slept for like all who live by their own exertions they were of a methodical cast of mind and no one can work well without sleep  meantime mowgli was putting the miles behind him nine to the hour swinging on delighted to find himself so fit after all his cramped months among men the one idea in his head was to get messua and her husband out of the trap whatever it was for he had a natural mistrust of traps later on he promised himself he would pay his debts to the village at large  it was at twilight when he saw the wellremembered grazinggrounds and the dhaktree where gray brother had waited for him on the morning that he killed shere khan angry as he was at the whole breed and community of man something jumped up in his throat and made him catch his breath when he looked at the village roofs he noticed that every one had come in from the fields unusually early and that instead of getting to their evening cooking they gathered in a crowd under the village tree and chattered and shouted  men must always be making traps for men or they are not content said mowgli last night it was mowglibut that night seems many rains ago tonight it is messua and her man tomorrow and for very many nights after it will be mowglis turn again  he crept along outside the wall till he came to messuas hut and looked through the window into the room there lay messua gagged and bound hand and foot breathing hard and groaning her husband was tied to the gailypainted bedstead the door of the hut that opened into the street was shut fast and three or four people were sitting with their backs to it  mowgli knew the manners and customs of the villagers very fairly he argued that so long as they could eat and talk and smoke they would not do anything else but as soon as they had fed they would begin to be dangerous buldeo would be coming in before long and if his escort had done its duty buldeo would have a very interesting tale to tell so he went in through the window and stooping over the man and the woman cut their thongs pulling out the gags and looked round the hut for some milk  messua was half wild with pain and fear she had been beaten and stoned all the morning and mowgli put his hand over her mouth just in time to stop a scream her husband was only bewildered and angry and sat picking dust and things out of his torn beard  i knewi knew he would come messua sobbed at last now do i know that he is my son and she hugged mowgli to her heart up to that time mowgli had been perfectly steady but now he began to tremble all over and that surprised him immensely  why are these thongs why have they tied thee he asked after a pause  to be put to the death for making a son of theewhat else said the man sullenly look i bleed  messua said nothing but it was at her wounds that mowgli looked and they heard him grit his teeth when he saw the blood  whose work is this said he there is a price to pay  the work of all the village i was too rich i had too many cattle therefore she and i are witches because we gave thee shelter  i do not understand let messua tell the tale  i gave thee milk nathoo dost thou remember messua said timidly because thou wast my son whom the tiger took and because i loved thee very dearly they said that i was thy mother the mother of a devil and therefore worthy of death  and what is a devil said mowgli death i have seen  the man looked up gloomily but messua laughed see she said to her husband i knewi said that he was no sorcerer he is my sonmy son  son or sorcerer what good will that do us the man answered we be as dead already  yonder is the road to the junglemowgli pointed through the window your hands and feet are free go now  we do not know the jungle my son asas thou knowest messua began i do not think that i could walk far  and the men and women would be upon our backs and drag us here again said the husband  hm said mowgli and he tickled the palm of his hand with the tip of his skinningknife i have no wish to do harm to any one of this villageyet but i do not think they will stay thee in a little while they will have much else to think upon ah he lifted his head and listened to shouting and trampling outside so they have let buldeo come home at last  he was sent out this morning to kill thee messua cried didst thou meet him  yeswei met him he has a tale to tell and while he is telling it there is time to do much but first i will learn what they mean think where ye would go and tell me when i come back  he bounded through the window and ran along again outside the wall of the village till he came within earshot of the crowd round the peepultree buldeo was lying on the ground coughing and groaning and every one was asking him questions his hair had fallen about his shoulders his hands and legs were skinned from climbing up trees and he could hardly speak but he felt the importance of his position keenly from time to time he said something about devils and singing devils and magic enchantment just to give the crowd a taste of what was coming then he called for water  bah said mowgli chatterchatter talk talk men are bloodbrothers of the bandarlog now he must wash his mouth with water now he must blow smoke and when all that is done he has still his story to tell they are very wise peoplemen they will leave no one to guard messua till their ears are stuffed with buldeos tales andi grow as lazy as they  he shook himself and glided back to the hut just as he was at the window he felt a touch on his foot  mother said he for he knew that tongue well what dost thou here  i heard my children singing through the woods and i followed the one i loved best little frog i have a desire to see that woman who gave thee milk said mother wolf all wet with the dew  they have bound and mean to kill her i have cut those ties and she goes with her man through the jungle  i also will follow i am old but not yet toothless mother wolf reared herself up on end and looked through the window into the dark of the hut  in a minute she dropped noiselessly and all she said was i gave thee thy first milk but bagheera speaks truth man goes to man at the last  maybe said mowgli with a very unpleasant look on his face but tonight i am very far from that trail wait here but do not let her see  thou wast never afraid of me little frog said mother wolf backing into the high grass and blotting herself out as she knew how  and now said mowgli cheerfully as he swung into the hut again they are all sitting round buldeo who is saying that which did not happen when his talk is finished they say they will assuredly come here with the redwith fire and burn you both and then  i have spoken to my man said messua khanhiwara is thirty miles from here but at khanhiwara we may find the english  and what pack are they said mowgli  i do not know they be white and it is said that they govern all the land and do not suffer people to burn or beat each other without witnesses if we can get thither tonight we live otherwise we die  live then no man passes the gates tonight but what does he do messuas husband was on his hands and knees digging up the earth in one corner of the hut  it is his little money said messua we can take nothing else  ah yes the stuff that passes from hand to hand and never grows warmer do they need it outside this place also said mowgli  the man stared angrily he is a fool and no devil he muttered with the money i can buy a horse we are too bruised to walk far and the village will follow us in an hour  i say they will not follow till i choose but a horse is well thought of for messua is tired her husband stood up and knotted the last of the rupees into his waistcloth mowgli helped messua through the window and the cool night air revived her but the jungle in the starlight looked very dark and terrible  ye know the trail to khanhiwara mowgli whispered  they nodded  good remember now not to be afraid and there is no need to go quickly onlyonly there may be some small singing in the jungle behind you and before  think you we would have risked a night in the jungle through anything less than the fear of burning it is better to be killed by beasts than by men said messuas husband but messua looked at mowgli and smiled  i say mowgli went on just as though he were baloo repeating an old jungle law for the hundredth time to a foolish cubi say that not a tooth in the jungle is bared against you not a foot in the jungle is lifted against you neither man nor beast shall stay you till you come within eyeshot of khanhiwara there will be a watch about you he turned quickly to messua saying he does not believe but thou wilt believe  ay surely my son man ghost or wolf of the jungle i believe  he will be afraid when he hears my people singing thou wilt know and understand go now and slowly for there is no need of any haste the gates are shut  messua flung herself sobbing at mowglis feet but he lifted her very quickly with a shiver then she hung about his neck and called him every name of blessing she could think of but her husband looked enviously across his fields and said if we reach khanhiwara and i get the ear of the english i will bring such a lawsuit against the brahmin and old buldeo and the others as shall eat the village to the bone they shall pay me twice over for my crops untilled and my buffaloes unfed i will have a great justice  mowgli laughed i do not know what justice is butcome next rains and see what is left  they went off toward the jungle and mother wolf leaped from her place of hiding  follow said mowgli and look to it that all the jungle knows these two are safe give tongue a little i would call bagheera  the long low howl rose and fell and mowgli saw messuas husband flinch and turn half minded to run back to the hut  go on mowgli called cheerfully i said there might be singing that call will follow up to khanhiwara it is favour of the jungle  messua urged her husband forward and the darkness shut down on them and mother wolf as bagheera rose up almost under mowglis feet trembling with delight of the night that drives the jungle people wild  i am ashamed of thy brethren he said purring what did they not sing sweetly to buldeo said mowgli  too well too well they made even me forget my pride and by the broken lock that freed me i went singing through the jungle as though i were out wooing in the spring didst thou not hear us  i had other game afoot ask buldeo if he liked the song but where are the four i do not wish one of the manpack to leave the gates tonight  what need of the four then said bagheera shifting from foot to foot his eyes ablaze and purring louder than ever i can hold them little brother is it killing at last the singing and the sight of the men climbing up the trees have made me very ready who is man that we should care for himthe naked brown digger the hairless and toothless the eater of earth i have followed him all dayat noonin the white sunlight i herded him as the wolves herd buck i am bagheera bagheera bagheera as i dance with my shadow so danced i with those men look the great panther leaped as a kitten leaps at a dead leaf whirling overhead struck left and right into the empty air that sang under the strokes landed noiselessly and leaped again and again while the half purr half growl gathered head as steam rumbles in a boiler i am bagheerain the junglein the night and my strength is in me who shall stay my stroke mancub with one blow of my paw i could beat thy head flat as a dead frog in the summer  strike then said mowgli in the dialect of the village not the talk of the jungle and the human words brought bagheera to a full stop flung back on haunches that quivered under him his head just at the level of mowglis once more mowgli stared as he had stared at the rebellious cubs full into the berylgreen eyes till the red glare behind their green went out like the light of a lighthouse shut off twenty miles across the sea till the eyes dropped and the big head with themdropped lower and lower and the red rasp of a tongue grated on mowglis instep  brotherbrotherbrother the boy whispered stroking steadily and lightly from the neck along the heaving back be still be still it is the fault of the night and no fault of thine  it was the smells of the night said bagheera penitently this air cries aloud to me but how dost thou know  of course the air round an indian village is full of all kinds of smells and to any creature who does nearly all his thinking through his nose smells are as maddening as music and drugs are to human beings mowgli gentled the panther for a few minutes longer and he lay down like a cat before a fire his paws tucked under his breast and his eyes half shut  thou art of the jungle and not of the jungle he said at last and i am only a black panther but i love thee little brother  they are very long at their talk under the tree mowgli said without noticing the last sentence buldeo must have told many tales they should come soon to drag the woman and her man out of the trap and put them into the red flower they will find that trap sprung ho ho  nay listen said bagheera the fever is out of my blood now let them find me there few would leave their houses after meeting me it is not the first time i have been in a cage and i do not think they will tie me with cords  be wise then said mowgli laughing for he was beginning to feel as reckless as the panther who had glided into the hut  pah bagheera grunted this place is rank with man but here is just such a bed as they gave me to lie upon in the kings cages at oodeypore now i lie down mowgli heard the strings of the cot crack under the great brutes weight by the broken lock that freed me they will think they have caught big game come and sit beside me little brother we will give them good hunting together  no i have another thought in my stomach the manpack shall not know what share i have in the sport make thine own hunt i do not wish to see them  be it so said bagheera ah now they come  the conference under the peepultree had been growing noisier and noisier at the far end of the village it broke in wild yells and a rush up the street of men and women waving clubs and bamboos and sickles and knives buldeo and the brahmin were at the head of it but the mob was close at their heels and they cried the witch and the wizard let us see if hot coins will make them confess burn the hut over their heads we will teach them to shelter wolfdevils nay beat them first torches more torches buldeo heat the gunbarrels  here was some little difficulty with the catch of the door it had been very firmly fastened but the crowd tore it away bodily and the light of the torches streamed into the room where stretched at full length on the bed his paws crossed and lightly hung down over one end black as the pit and terrible as a demon was bagheera there was one halfminute of desperate silence as the front ranks of the crowd clawed and tore their way back from the threshold and in that minute bagheera raised his head and yawnedelaborately carefully and ostentatiouslyas he would yawn when he wished to insult an equal the fringed lips drew back and up the red tongue curled the lower jaw dropped and dropped till you could see halfway down the hot gullet and the gigantic dogteeth stood clear to the pit of the gums till they rang together upper and under with the snick of steelfaced wards shooting home round the edges of a safe next instant the street was empty bagheera had leaped back through the window and stood at mowglis side while a yelling screaming torrent scrambled and tumbled one over another in their panic haste to get to their own huts  they will not stir till day comes said bagheera quietly and now  the silence of the afternoon sleep seemed to have overtaken the village but as they listened they could hear the sound of heavy grainboxes being dragged over earthen floors and set down against doors bagheera was quite right the village would not stir till daylight mowgli sat still and thought and his face grew darker and darker  what have i done said bagheera at last coming to his feet fawning  nothing but great good watch them now till the day i sleep mowgli ran off into the jungle and dropped like a dead man across a rock and slept and slept the day round and the night back again  when he waked bagheera was at his side and there was a newlykilled buck at his feet bagheera watched curiously while mowgli went to work with his skinningknife ate and drank and turned over with his chin in his hands  the man and the woman are come safe within eyeshot of khanhiwara bagheera said thy lair mother sent the word back by chil the kite they found a horse before midnight of the night they were freed and went very quickly is not that well  that is well said mowgli  and thy manpack in the village did not stir till the sun was high this morning then they ate their food and ran back quickly to their houses  did they by chance see thee  it may have been i was rolling in the dust before the gate at dawn and i may have made also some small song to myself now little brother there is nothing more to do come hunting with me and baloo he has new hives that he wishes to show and we all desire thee back again as of old take off that look which makes even me afraid the man and woman will not be put into the red flower and all goes well in the jungle is it not true let us forget the manpack  they shall be forgotten in a little while where does hathi feed tonight  where he chooses who can answer for the silent one but why what is there hathi can do which we cannot  bid him and his three sons come here to me  but indeed and truly little brother it is notit is not seemly to say come and go to hathi remember he is the master of the jungle and before the manpack changed the look on thy face he taught thee the masterwords of the jungle  that is all one i have a masterword for him now bid him come to mowgli the frog and if he does not hear at first bid him come because of the sack of the fields of bhurtpore  the sack of the fields of bhurtpore bagheera repeated two or three times to make sure i go hathi can but be angry at the worst and i would give a moons hunting to hear a masterword that compels the silent one  he went away leaving mowgli stabbing furiously with his skinningknife into the earth mowgli had never seen human blood in his life before till he had seen andwhat meant much more to himsmelled messuas blood on the thongs that bound her and messua had been kind to him and so far as he knew anything about love he loved messua as completely as he hated the rest of mankind but deeply as he loathed them their talk their cruelty and their cowardice not for anything the jungle had to offer could he bring himself to take a human life and have that terrible scent of blood back again in his nostrils his plan was simpler but much more thorough and he laughed to himself when he thought that it was one of old buldeos tales told under the peepultree in the evening that had put the idea into his head  it was a masterword bagheera whispered in his ear they were feeding by the river and they obeyed as though they were bullocks look where they come now  hathi and his three sons had arrived in their usual way without a sound the mud of the river was still fresh on their flanks and hathi was thoughtfully chewing the green stem of a young plantaintree that he had gouged up with his tusks but every line in his vast body showed to bagheera who could see things when he came across them that it was not the master of the jungle speaking to a mancub but one who was afraid coming before one who was not his three sons rolled side by side behind their father  mowgli hardly lifted his head as hathi gave him good hunting he kept him swinging and rocking and shifting from one foot to another for a long time before he spoke and when he opened his mouth it was to bagheera not to the elephants  i will tell a tale that was told to me by the hunter ye hunted today said mowgli it concerns an elephant old and wise who fell into a trap and the sharpened stake in the pit scarred him from a little above his heel to the crest of his shoulder leaving a white mark mowgli threw out his hand and as hathi wheeled the moonlight showed a long white scar on his slaty side as though he had been struck with a redhot whip men came to take him from the trap mowgli continued but he broke his ropes for he was strong and went away till his wound was healed then came he angry by night to the fields of those hunters and i remember now that he had three sons these things happened many many rains ago and very far awayamong the fields of bhurtpore what came to those fields at the next reaping hathi  they were reaped by me and by my three sons said hathi  and to the ploughing that follows the reaping said mowgli  there was no ploughing said hathi  and to the men that live by the green crops on the ground said mowgli  they went away  and to the huts in which the men slept said mowgli  we tore the roofs to pieces and the jungle swallowed up the walls said hathi  and what more said mowgli  as much good ground as i can walk over in two nights from the east to the west and from the north to the south as much as i can walk over in three nights the jungle took we let in the jungle upon five villages and in those villages and in their lands the grazingground and the soft cropgrounds there is not one man today who takes his food from the ground that was the sack of the fields of bhurtpore which i and my three sons did and now i ask mancub how the news of it came to thee said hathi  a man told me and now i see even buldeo can speak truth it was well done hathi with the white mark but the second time it shall be done better for the reason that there is a man to direct thou knowest the village of the manpack that cast me out they are idle senseless and cruel they play with their mouths and they do not kill the weaker for food but for sport when they are fullfed they would throw their own breed into the red flower this i have seen it is not well that they should live here any more i hate them  kill then said the youngest of hathis three sons picking up a tuft of grass dusting it against his forelegs and throwing it away while his little red eyes glanced furtively from side to side  what good are white bones to me mowgli answered angrily am i the cub of a wolf to play in the sun with a raw head i have killed shere khan and his hide rots on the council rock butbut i do not know whither shere khan is gone and my stomach is still empty now i will take that which i can see and touch let in the jungle upon that village hathi  bagheera shivered and cowered down he could understand if the worst came to the worst a quick rush down the village street and a right and left blow into a crowd or a crafty killing of men as they ploughed in the twilight but this scheme for deliberately blotting out an entire village from the eyes of man and beast frightened him now he saw why mowgli had sent for hathi no one but the longlived elephant could plan and carry through such a war  let them run as the men ran from the fields of bhurtpore till we have the rainwater for the only plough and the noise of the rain on the thick leaves for the pattering of their spindlestill bagheera and i lair in the house of the brahmin and the buck drink at the tank behind the temple let in the jungle hathi  but ibut we have no quarrel with them and it needs the red rage of great pain ere we tear down the places where men sleep said hathi doubtfully  are ye the only eaters of grass in the jungle drive in your peoples let the deer and the pig and the nilghai look to it ye need never show a handsbreadth of hide till the fields are naked let in the jungle hathi  there will be no killing my tusks were red at the sack of the fields of bhurtpore and i would not wake that smell again  nor i i do not wish even their bones to lie on the clean earth let them go and find a fresh lair they cannot stay here i have seen and smelled the blood of the woman that gave me foodthe woman whom they would have killed but for me only the smell of the new grass on their doorsteps can take away that smell it burns in my mouth let in the jungle hathi  ah said hathi so did the scar of the stake burn on my hide till we watched the villages die under in the spring growth now i see thy war shall be our war we will let in the jungle  mowgli had hardly time to catch his breathhe was shaking all over with rage and hate before the place where the elephants had stood was empty and bagheera was looking at him with terror  by the broken lock that freed me said the black panther at last art thou the naked thing i spoke for in the pack when all was young master of the jungle when my strength goes speak for mespeak for baloospeak for us all we are cubs before thee snapped twigs under foot fawns that have lost their doe  the idea of bagheera being a stray fawn upset mowgli altogether and he laughed and caught his breath and sobbed and laughed again till he had to jump into a pool to make himself stop then he swam round and round ducking in and out of the bars of the moonlight like the frog his namesake  by this time hathi and his three sons had turned each to one point of the compass and were striding silently down the valleys a mile away they went on and on for two days marchthat is to say a long sixty milesthrough the jungle and every step they took and every wave of their trunks was known and noted and talked over by mang and chil and the monkey people and all the birds then they began to feed and fed quietly for a week or so hathi and his sons are like kaa the rock python they never hurry till they have to  at the end of that timeand none knew who had started ita rumour went through the jungle that there was better food and water to be found in such and such a valley the pigwho of course will go to the ends of the earth for a full mealmoved first by companies scuffling over the rocks and the deer followed with the small wild foxes that live on the dead and dying of the herds and the heavyshouldered nilghai moved parallel with the deer and the wild buffaloes of the swamps came after the nilghai the least little thing would have turned the scattered straggling droves that grazed and sauntered and drank and grazed again but whenever there was an alarm some one would rise up and soothe them at one time it would be ikki the porcupine full of news of good feed just a little farther on at another mang would cry cheerily and flap down a glade to show it was all empty or baloo his mouth full of roots would shamble alongside a wavering line and half frighten half romp it clumsily back to the proper road very many creatures broke back or ran away or lost interest but very many were left to go forward at the end of another ten days or so the situation was this the deer and the pig and the nilghai were milling round and round in a circle of eight or ten miles radius while the eaters of flesh skirmished round its edge and the centre of that circle was the village and round the village the crops were ripening and in the crops sat men on what they call machansplatforms like pigeonperches made of sticks at the top of four polesto scare away birds and other stealers then the deer were coaxed no more the eaters of flesh were close behind them and forced them forward and inward  it was a dark night when hathi and his three sons slipped down from the jungle and broke off the poles of the machans with their trunks they fell as a snapped stalk of hemlock in bloom falls and the men that tumbled from them heard the deep gurgling of the elephants in their ears then the vanguard of the bewildered armies of the deer broke down and flooded into the village grazinggrounds and the ploughed fields and the sharphoofed rooting wild pig came with them and what the deer left the pig spoiled and from time to time an alarm of wolves would shake the herds and they would rush to and fro desperately treading down the young barley and cutting flat the banks of the irrigating channels before the dawn broke the pressure on the outside of the circle gave way at one point the eaters of flesh had fallen back and left an open path to the south and drove upon drove of buck fled along it others who were bolder lay up in the thickets to finish their meal next night  but the work was practically done when the villagers looked in the morning they saw their crops were lost and that meant death if they did not get away for they lived year in and year out as near to starvation as the jungle was near to them when the buffaloes were sent to graze the hungry brutes found that the deer had cleared the grazinggrounds and so wandered into the jungle and drifted off with their wild mates and when twilight fell the three or four ponies that belonged to the village lay in their stables with their heads beaten in only bagheera could have given those strokes and only bagheera would have thought of insolently dragging the last carcass to the open street  the villagers had no heart to make fires in the fields that night so hathi and his three sons went gleaning among what was left and where hathi gleans there is no need to follow the men decided to live on their stored seedcorn until the rains had fallen and then to take work as servants till they could catch up with the lost year but as the graindealer was thinking of his wellfilled crates of corn and the prices he would levy at the sale of it hathis sharp tusks were picking out the corner of his mudhouse and smashing open the big wicker chest leeped with cowdung where the precious stuff lay  when that last loss was discovered it was the brahmins turn to speak he had prayed to his own gods without answer it might be he said that unconsciously the village had offended some one of the gods of the jungle for beyond doubt the jungle was against them so they sent for the headman of the nearest tribe of wandering gondslittle wise and very black hunters living in the deep jungle whose fathers came of the oldest race in indiathe aboriginal owners of the land they made the gond welcome with what they had and he stood on one leg his bow in his hand and two or three poisoned arrows stuck through his topknot looking half afraid and half contemptuously at the anxious villagers and their ruined fields they wished to know whether his godsthe old godswere angry with them and what sacrifices should be offered the gond said nothing but picked up a trail of the karela the vine that bears the bitter wild gourd and laced it to and fro across the temple door in the face of the staring red hindu image then he pushed with his hand in the open air along the road to khanhiwara and went back to his jungle and watched the jungle people drifting through it he knew that when the jungle moves only white men can hope to turn it aside  there was no need to ask his meaning the wild gourd would grow where they had worshipped their god and the sooner they saved themselves the better  but it is hard to tear a village from its moorings they stayed on as long as any summer food was left to them and they tried to gather nuts in the jungle but shadows with glaring eyes watched them and rolled before them even at midday and when they ran back afraid to their walls on the treetrunks they had passed not five minutes before the bark would be stripped and chiselled with the stroke of some great taloned paw the more they kept to their village the bolder grew the wild things that gambolled and bellowed on the grazinggrounds by the waingunga they had no time to patch and plaster the rear walls of the empty byres that backed on to the jungle the wild pig trampled them down and the knottyrooted vines hurried after and threw their elbows over the newwon ground and the coarse grass bristled behind the vines like the lances of a goblin army following a retreat the unmarried men ran away first and carried the news far and near that the village was doomed who could fight they said against the jungle or the gods of the jungle when the very village cobra had left his hole in the platform under the peepultree so their little commerce with the outside world shrunk as the trodden paths across the open grew fewer and fainter at last the nightly trumpetings of hathi and his three sons ceased to trouble them for they had no more to be robbed of the crop on the ground and the seed in the ground had been taken the outlying fields were already losing their shape and it was time to throw themselves on the charity of the english at khanhiwara  native fashion they delayed their departure from one day to another till the first rains caught them and the unmended roofs let in a flood and the grazingground stood ankle deep and all life came on with a rush after the heat of the summer then they waded outmen women and childrenthrough the blinding hot rain of the morning but turned naturally for one farewell look at their homes  they heard as the last burdened family filed through the gate a crash of falling beams and thatch behind the walls they saw a shiny snaky black trunk lifted for an instant scattering sodden thatch it disappeared and there was another crash followed by a squeal hathi had been plucking off the roofs of the huts as you pluck waterlilies and a rebounding beam had pricked him he needed only this to unchain his full strength for of all things in the jungle the wild elephant enraged is the most wantonly destructive he kicked backward at a mud wall that crumbled at the stroke and crumbling melted to yellow mud under the torrent of rain then he wheeled and squealed and tore through the narrow streets leaning against the huts right and left shivering the crazy doors and crumpling up the caves while his three sons raged behind as they had raged at the sack of the fields of bhurtpore  the jungle will swallow these shells said a quiet voice in the wreckage it is the outer wall that must lie down and mowgli with the rain sluicing over his bare shoulders and arms leaped back from a wall that was settling like a tired buffalo  all in good time panted hathi oh but my tusks were red at bhurtpore to the outer wall children with the head together now  the four pushed side by side the outer wall bulged split and fell and the villagers dumb with horror saw the savage claystreaked heads of the wreckers in the ragged gap then they fled houseless and foodless down the valley as their village shredded and tossed and trampled melted behind them  a month later the place was a dimpled mound covered with soft green young stuff and by the end of the rains there was the roaring jungle in full blast on the spot that had been under plough not six months before     mowglis song against people       i will let loose against you the fleetfooted vines      i will call in the jungle to stamp out your lines          the roofs shall fade before it            the housebeams shall fall          and the karela the bitter karela            shall cover it all       in the gates of these your councils my people shall sing      in the doors of these your garners the batfolk shall cling          and the snake shall be your watchman            by a hearthstone unswept          for the karela the bitter karela            shall fruit where ye slept       ye shall not see my strikers ye shall hear them and guess      by night before the moonrise i will send for my cess          and the wolf shall be your herdsman            by a landmark removed          for the karela the bitter karela            shall seed where ye loved       i will reap your fields before you at the hands of a host      ye shall glean behind my reapers for the bread that is lost          and the deer shall be your oxen            by a headland untilled          for the karela the bitter karela            shall leaf where ye build       i have untied against you the clubfooted vines      i have sent in the jungle to swamp out your lines          the treesthe trees are on you            the housebeams shall fall          and the karela the bitter karela             shall cover you all     the undertakers          when ye say to tabaqui my brother when ye call the             hyena to meat         ye may cry the full truce with jacalathe belly that runs             on four feet                                                   jungle law  respect the aged  it was a thick voicea muddy voice that would have made you shuddera voice like something soft breaking in two there was a quaver in it a croak and a whine  respect the aged o companions of the riverrespect the aged  nothing could be seen on the broad reach of the river except a little fleet of squaresailed woodenpinned barges loaded with buildingstone that had just come under the railway bridge and were driving downstream they put their clumsy helms over to avoid the sandbar made by the scour of the bridgepiers and as they passed three abreast the horrible voice began again  o brahmins of the riverrespect the aged and infirm  a boatman turned where he sat on the gunwale lifted up his hand said something that was not a blessing and the boats creaked on through the twilight the broad indian river that looked more like a chain of little lakes than a stream was as smooth as glass reflecting the sandyred sky in midchannel but splashed with patches of yellow and dusky purple near and under the low banks little creeks ran into the river in the wet season but now their dry mouths hung clear above waterline on the left shore and almost under the railway bridge stood a mudandbrick and thatchandstick village whose main street full of cattle going back to their byres ran straight to the river and ended in a sort of rude brick pierhead where people who wanted to wash could wade in step by step that was the ghaut of the village of muggerghaut  night was falling fast over the fields of lentils and rice and cotton in the lowlying ground yearly flooded by the river over the reeds that fringed the elbow of the bend and the tangled jungle of the grazinggrounds behind the still reeds the parrots and crows who had been chattering and shouting over their evening drink had flown inland to roost crossing the outgoing battalions of the flyingfoxes and cloud upon cloud of waterbirds came whistling and honking to the cover of the reedbeds there were geese barrelheaded and blackbacked teal widgeon mallard and sheldrake with curlews and here and there a flamingo  a lumbering adjutantcrane brought up the rear flying as though each slow stroke would be his last  respect the aged brahmins of the riverrespect the aged  the adjutant half turned his head sheered a little in the direction of the voice and landed stiffly on the sandbar below the bridge then you saw what a ruffianly brute he really was his back view was immensely respectable for he stood nearly six feet high and looked rather like a very proper baldheaded parson in front it was different for his ally sloperlike head and neck had not a feather to them and there was a horrible rawskin pouch on his neck under his china holdall for the things his pickaxe beak might steal his legs were long and thin and skinny but he moved them delicately and looked at them with pride as he preened down his ashygray tailfeathers glanced over the smooth of his shoulder and stiffened into stand at attention  a mangy little jackal who had been yapping hungrily on a low bluff cocked up his ears and tail and scuttered across the shallows to join the adjutant  he was the lowest of his castenot that the best of jackals are good for much but this one was peculiarly low being half a beggar half a criminala cleanerup of village rubbishheaps desperately timid or wildly bold everlastingly hungry and full of cunning that never did him any good  ugh he said shaking himself dolefully as he landed may the red mange destroy the dogs of this village i have three bites for each flea upon me and all because i lookedonly looked mark youat an old shoe in a cowbyre can i eat mud he scratched himself under his left ear  i heard said the adjutant in a voice like a blunt saw going through a thick boardi heard there was a newborn puppy in that same shoe  to hear is one thing to know is another said the jackal who had a very fair knowledge of proverbs picked up by listening to men round the village fires of an evening  quite true so to make sure i took care of that puppy while the dogs were busy elsewhere  they were very busy said the jackal well i must not go to the village hunting for scraps yet awhile and so there truly was a blind puppy in that shoe  it is here said the adjutant squinting over his beak at his full pouch a small thing but acceptable now that charity is dead in the world  ahai the world is iron in these days wailed the jackal then his restless eye caught the least possible ripple on the water and he went on quickly life is hard for us all and i doubt not that even our excellent master the pride of the ghaut and the envy of the river  a liar a flatterer and a jackal were all hatched out of the same egg said the adjutant to nobody in particular for he was rather a fine sort of a liar on his own account when he took the trouble  yes the envy of the river the jackal repeated raising his voice even he i doubt not finds that since the bridge has been built good food is more scarce but on the other hand though i would by no means say this to his noble face he is so wise and so virtuousas i alas i am not  when the jackal owns he is gray how black must the jackal be muttered the adjutant he could not see what was coming  that his food never fails and in consequence  there was a soft grating sound as though a boat had just touched in shoal water the jackal spun round quickly and faced it is always best to face the creature he had been talking about it was a twentyfourfoot crocodile cased in what looked like trebleriveted boilerplate studded and keeled and crested the yellow points of his upper teeth just overhanging his beautifully fluted lower jaw it was the bluntnosed mugger of muggerghaut older than any man in the village who had given his name to the village the demon of the ford before the railway bridge camemurderer maneater and local fetish in one he lay with his chin in the shallows keeping his place by an almost invisible rippling of his tail and well the jackal knew that one stroke of that same tail in the water would carry the mugger up the bank with the rush of a steamengine  auspiciously met protector of the poor he fawned backing at every word a delectable voice was heard and we came in the hopes of sweet conversation my tailless presumption while waiting here led me indeed to speak of thee it is my hope that nothing was overheard  now the jackal had spoken just to be listened to for he knew flattery was the best way of getting things to eat and the mugger knew that the jackal had spoken for this end and the jackal knew that the mugger knew and the mugger knew that the jackal knew that the mugger knew and so they were all very contented together  the old brute pushed and panted and grunted up the bank mumbling respect the aged and infirm and all the time his little eyes burned like coals under the heavy horny eyelids on the top of his triangular head as he shoved his bloated barrelbody along between his crutched legs then he settled down and accustomed as the jackal was to his ways he could not help starting for the hundredth time when he saw how exactly the mugger imitated a log adrift on the bar he had even taken pains to lie at the exact angle a naturally stranded log would make with the water having regard to the current of the season at the time and place all this was only a matter of habit of course because the mugger had come ashore for pleasure but a crocodile is never quite full and if the jackal had been deceived by the likeness he would not have lived to philosophise over it  my child i heard nothing said the mugger shutting one eye the water was in my ears and also i was faint with hunger since the railway bridge was built my people at my village have ceased to love me and that is breaking my heart  ah shame said the jackal so noble a heart too but men are all alike to my mind  nay there are very great differences indeed the mugger answered gently some are as lean as boatpoles others again are fat as young jadogs never would i causelessly revile men they are of all fashions but the long years have shown me that one with another they are very good men women and childreni have no fault to find with them and remember child he who rebukes the world is rebuked by the world  flattery is worse than an empty tin can in the belly but that which we have just heard is wisdom said the adjutant bringing down one foot  consider though their ingratitude to this excellent one began the jackal tenderly  nay nay not ingratitude the mugger said they do not think for others that is all but i have noticed lying at my station below the ford that the stairs of the new bridge are cruelly hard to climb both for old people and young children the old indeed are not so worthy of consideration but i am grievedi am truly grievedon account of the fat children still i think in a little while when the newness of the bridge has worn away we shall see my peoples bare brown legs bravely splashing through the ford as before then the old mugger will be honoured again  but surely i saw marigold wreaths floating off the edge of the ghaut only this noon said the adjutant  marigold wreaths are a sign of reverence all india over  an erroran error it was the wife of the sweetmeatseller she loses her eyesight year by year and cannot tell a log from methe mugger of the ghaut i saw the mistake when she threw the garland for i was lying at the very foot of the ghaut and had she taken another step i might have shown her some little difference yet she meant well and we must consider the spirit of the offering  what good are marigold wreaths when one is on the rubbishheap said the jackal hunting for fleas but keeping one wary eye on his protector of the poor  true but they have not yet begun to make the rubbishheap that shall carry me five times have i seen the river draw back from the village and make new land at the foot of the street five times have i seen the village rebuilt on the banks and i shall see it built yet five times more i am no faithless fishhunting gavial i at kasi today and prayag tomorrow as the saying is but the true and constant watcher of the ford it is not for nothing child that the village bears my name and he who watches long as the saying is shall at last have his reward  i have watched longvery longnearly all my life and my reward has been bites and blows said the jackal  ho ho ho roared the adjutant       in august was the jackal born         the rains fell in september      now such a fearful flood as this         says he i cant remember  there is one very unpleasant peculiarity about the adjutant at uncertain times he suffers from acute attacks of the fidgets or cramp in his legs and though he is more virtuous to behold than any of the cranes who are all immensely respectable he flies off into wild cripplestilt wardances half opening his wings and bobbing his bald head up and down while for reasons best known to himself he is very careful to time his worst attacks with his nastiest remarks at the last word of his song he came to attention again ten times adjutaunter than before  the jackal winced though he was full three seasons old but you cannot resent an insult from a person with a beak a yard long and the power of driving it like a javelin the adjutant was a most notorious coward but the jackal was worse  we must live before we can learn said the mugger and there is this to say little jackals are very common child but such a mugger as i am is not common for all that i am not proud since pride is destruction but take notice it is fate and against his fate no one who swims or walks or runs should say anything at all i am well contented with fate with good luck a keen eye and the custom of considering whether a creek or a backwater has an outlet to it ere you ascend much may be done  once i heard that even the protector of the poor made a mistake said the jackal viciously  true but there my fate helped me it was before i had come to my full growthbefore the last famine but three by the right and left of gunga how full used the streams to be in those days yes i was young and unthinking and when the flood came who so pleased as i a little made me very happy then the village was deep in flood and i swam above the ghaut and went far inland up to the ricefields and they were deep in good mud i remember also a pair of bracelets glass they were and troubled me not a little that i found that evening yes glass bracelets and if my memory serves me well a shoe i should have shaken off both shoes but i was hungry i learned better later yes and so i fed and rested me but when i was ready to go to the river again the flood had fallen and i walked through the mud of the main street who but i came out all my people priests and women and children and i looked upon them with benevolence the mud is not a good place to fight in said a boatman get axes and kill him for he is the mugger of the ford not so said the brahmin look he is driving the flood before him he is the godling of the village then they threw many flowers at me and by happy thought one led a goat across the road  how goodhow very good is goat said the jackal  hairytoo hairy and when found in the water more than likely to hide a crossshaped hook but that goat i accepted and went down to the ghaut in great honour later my fate sent me the boatman who had desired to cut off my tail with an axe his boat grounded upon an old shoal which you would not remember  we are not all jackals here said the adjutant was it the shoal made where the stoneboats sank in the year of the great droutha long shoal that lasted three floods  there were two said the mugger an upper and a lower shoal  ay i forgot a channel divided them and later dried up again said the adjutant who prided himself on his memory  on the lower shoal my wellwishers craft grounded he was sleeping in the bows and half awake leaped over to his waistno it was no more than to his kneesto push off his empty boat went on and touched again below the next reach as the river ran then i followed because i knew men would come out to drag it ashore  and did they do so said the jackal a little awestricken this was hunting on a scale that impressed him  there and lower down they did i went no farther but that gave me three in one daywellfed manjis boatmen all and except in the case of the last then i was careless never a cry to warn those on the bank  ah noble sport but what cleverness and great judgment it requires said the jackal  not cleverness child but only thought a little thought in life is like salt upon rice as the boatmen say and i have thought deeply always the gavial my cousin the fisheater has told me how hard it is for him to follow his fish and how one fish differs from the other and how he must know them all both together and apart i say that is wisdom but on the other hand my cousin the gavial lives among his people my people do not swim in companies with their mouths out of the water as rewa does nor do they constantly rise to the surface of the water and turn over on their sides like mohoo and little chapta nor do they gather in shoals after flood like batchua and chilwa  all are very good eating said the adjutant clattering his beak  so my cousin says and makes a great todo over hunting them but they do not climb the banks to escape his sharp nose my people are otherwise their life is on the land in the houses among the cattle i must know what they do and what they are about to do and adding the tail to the trunk as the saying is i make up the whole elephant is there a green branch and an iron ring hanging over a doorway the old mugger knows that a boy has been born in that house and must some day come down to the ghaut to play is a maiden to be married the old mugger knows for he sees the men carry gifts back and forth and she too comes down to the ghaut to bathe before her wedding andhe is there has the river changed its channel and made new land where there was only sand before the mugger knows  now of what use is that knowledge said the jackal the river has shifted even in my little life indian rivers are nearly always moving about in their beds and will shift sometimes as much as two or three miles in a season drowning the fields on one bank and spreading good silt on the other  there is no knowledge so useful said the mugger for new land means new quarrels the mugger knows oho the mugger knows as soon as the water has drained off he creeps up the little creeks that men think would not hide a dog and there he waits presently comes a farmer saying he will plant cucumbers here and melons there in the new land that the river has given him he feels the good mud with his bare toes anon comes another saying he will put onions and carrots and sugarcane in such and such places they meet as boats adrift meet and each rolls his eye at the other under the big blue turban the old mugger sees and hears each calls the other brother and they go to mark out the boundaries of the new land the mugger hurries with them from point to point shuffling very low through the mud now they begin to quarrel now they say hot words now they pull turbans now they lift up their lathis clubs and at last one falls backward into the mud and the other runs away when he comes back the dispute is settled as the ironbound bamboo of the loser witnesses yet they are not grateful to the mugger no they cry murder and their families fight with sticks twenty aside my people are good peopleupland jatsmalwais of the bet they do not give blows for sport and when the fight is done the old mugger waits far down the river out of sight of the village behind the kikarscrub yonder then come they down my broadshouldered jatseight or nine together under the stars bearing the dead man upon a bed they are old men with gray beards and voices as deep as mine they light a little fireah how well i know that fireand they drink tobacco and they nod their heads together forward in a ring or sideways toward the dead man upon the bank they say the english law will come with a rope for this matter and that such a mans family will be ashamed because such a man must be hanged in the great square of the jail then say the friends of the dead let him hang and the talk is all to do over againonce twice twenty times in the long night then says one at last the fight was a fair fight let us take bloodmoney a little more than is offered by the slayer and we will say no more about it then do they haggle over the bloodmoney for the dead was a strong man leaving many sons yet before amratvela sunrise they put the fire to him a little as the custom is and the dead man comes to me and he says no more about it aha my children the mugger knowsthe mugger knowsand my malwah jats are a good people  they are too closetoo narrow in the hand for my crop croaked the adjutant they waste not the polish on the cows horn as the saying is and again who can glean after a malwai  ah igleanthem said the mugger  now in calcutta of the south in the old days the adjutant went on everything was thrown into the streets and we picked and chose those wore dainty seasons but today they keep their streets as clean as the outside of an egg and my people fly away to be clean is one thing to dust sweep and sprinkle seven times a day wearies the very gods themselves  there was a downcountry jackal had it from a brother who told me that in calcutta of the south all the jackals were as fat as otters in the rains said the jackal his mouth watering at the bare thought of it  ah but the whitefaces are therethe english and they bring dogs from somewhere down the river in boatsbig fat dogsto keep those same jackals lean said the adjutant  they are then as hardhearted as these people i might have known neither earth sky nor water shows charity to a jackal i saw the tents of a whiteface last season after the rains and i also took a new yellow bridle to eat the whitefaces do not dress their leather in the proper way it made me very sick  that was better than my case said the adjutant when i was in my third season a young and a bold bird i went down to the river where the big boats come in the boats of the english are thrice as big as this village  he has been as far as delhi and says all the people there walk on their heads muttered the jackal the mugger opened his left eye and looked keenly at the adjutant  it is true the big bird insisted a liar only lies when he hopes to be believed no one who had not seen those boats could believe this truth  that is more reasonable said the mugger and then  from the insides of this boat they were taking out great pieces of white stuff which in a little while turned to water much split off and fell about on the shore and the rest they swiftly put into a house with thick walls but a boatman who laughed took a piece no larger than a small dog and threw it to me iall my peopleswallow without reflection and that piece i swallowed as is our custom immediately i was afflicted with an excessive cold which beginning in my crop ran down to the extreme end of my toes and deprived me even of speech while the boatmen laughed at me never have i felt such cold i danced in my grief and amazement till i could recover my breath and then i danced and cried out against the falseness of this world and the boatmen derided me till they fell down the chief wonder of the matter setting aside that marvellous coldness was that there was nothing at all in my crop when i had finished my lamentings  the adjutant had done his very best to describe his feelings after swallowing a sevenpound lump of wenham lake ice off an american iceship in the days before calcutta made her ice by machinery but as he did not know what ice was and as the mugger and the jackal knew rather less the tale missed fire  anything said the mugger shutting his left eye againanything is possible that comes out of a boat thrice the size of muggerghaut my village is not a small one  there was a whistle overhead on the bridge and the delhi mail slid across all the carriages gleaming with light and the shadows faithfully following along the river it clanked away into the dark again but the mugger and the jackal were so well used to it that they never turned their heads  is that anything less wonderful than a boat thrice the size of muggerghaut said the bird looking up  i saw that built child stone by stone i saw the bridgepiers rise and when the men fell off they were wondrous surefooted for the most partbut when they fell i was ready after the first pier was made they never thought to look down the stream for the body to burn there again i saved much trouble there was nothing strange in the building of the bridge said the mugger  but that which goes across pulling the roofed carts that is strange the adjutant repeated it is past any doubt a new breed of bullock some day it will not be able to keep its foothold up yonder and will fall as the men did the old mugger will then be ready  the jackal looked at the adjutant and the adjutant looked at the jackal if there was one thing they were more certain of than another it was that the engine was everything in the wide world except a bullock the jackal had watched it time and again from the aloe hedges by the side of the line and the adjutant had seen engines since the first locomotive ran in india but the mugger had only looked up at the thing from below where the brass dome seemed rather like a bullocks hump  myes a new kind of bullock the mugger repeated ponderously to make himself quite sure in his own mind and certainly it is a bullock said the jackal  and again it might be began the mugger pettishly  certainlymost certainly said the jackal without waiting for the other to finish  what said the mugger angrily for he could feel that the others knew more than he did what might it be i never finished my words you said it was a bullock  it is anything the protector of the poor pleases i am his servantnot the servant of the thing that crosses the river  whatever it is it is whiteface work said the adjutant and for my own part i would not lie out upon a place so near to it as this bar  you do not know the english as i do said the mugger there was a whiteface here when the bridge was built and he would take a boat in the evenings and shuffle with his feet on the bottomboards and whisper is he here is he there bring me my gun i could hear him before i could see himeach sound that he madecreaking and puffing and rattling his gun up and down the river as surely as i had picked up one of his workmen and thus saved great expense in wood for the burning so surely would he come down to the ghaut and shout in a loud voice that he would hunt me and rid the river of methe mugger of muggerghaut me children i have swum under the bottom of his boat for hour after hour and heard him fire his gun at logs and when i was well sure he was wearied i have risen by his side and snapped my jaws in his face when the bridge was finished he went away all the english hunt in that fashion except when they are hunted  who hunts the whitefaces yapped the jackal excitedly  no one now but i have hunted them in my time  i remember a little of that hunting i was young then said the adjutant clattering his beak significantly  i was well established here my village was being builded for the third time as i remember when my cousin the gavial brought me word of rich waters above benares at first i would not go for my cousin who is a fisheater does not always know the good from the bad but i heard my people talking in the evenings and what they said made me certain  and what did they say the jackal asked  they said enough to make me the mugger of muggerghaut leave water and take to my feet i went by night using the littlest streams as they served me but it was the beginning of the hot weather and all streams were low i crossed dusty roads i went through tall grass i climbed hills in the moonlight even rocks did i climb childrenconsider this well i crossed the tail of sirhind the waterless before i could find the set of the little rivers that flow gungaward i was a months journey from my own people and the river that i knew that was very marvellous  what food on the way said the jackal who kept his soul in his little stomach and was not a bit impressed by the muggers land travels  that which i could findcousin said the mugger slowly dragging each word  now you do not call a man a cousin in india unless you think you can establish some kind of bloodrelationship and as it is only in old fairytales that the mugger ever marries a jackal the jackal knew for what reason he had been suddenly lifted into the muggers family circle if they had been alone he would not have cared but the adjutants eyes twinkled with mirth at the ugly jest  assuredly father i might have known said the jackal a mugger does not care to be called a father of jackals and the mugger of muggerghaut said as muchand a great deal more which there is no use in repeating here  the protector of the poor has claimed kinship how can i remember the precise degree moreover we eat the same food he has said it was the jackals reply  that made matters rather worse for what the jackal hinted at was that the mugger must have eaten his food on that landmarch fresh and fresh every day instead of keeping it by him till it was in a fit and proper condition as every selfrespecting mugger and most wild beasts do when they can indeed one of the worst terms of contempt along the riverbed is eater of fresh meat it is nearly as bad as calling a man a cannibal  that food was eaten thirty seasons ago said the adjutant quietly if we talk for thirty seasons more it will never come back tell us now what happened when the good waters were reached after thy most wonderful land journey if we listened to the howling of every jackal the business of the town would stop as the saying is  the mugger must have been grateful for the interruption because he went on with a rush  by the right and left of gunga when i came there never did i see such waters  were they better then than the big flood of last season said the jackal  better that flood was no more than comes every five yearsa handful of drowned strangers some chickens and a dead bullock in muddy water with crosscurrents but the season i think of the river was low smooth and even and as the gavial had warned me the dead english came down touching each other i got my girth in that seasonmy girth and my depth from agra by etawah and the broad waters by allahabad  oh the eddy that set under the walls of the fort at allahabad said the adjutant they came in there like widgeon to the reeds and round and round they swungthus  he went off into his horrible dance again while the jackal looked on enviously he naturally could not remember the terrible year of the mutiny they were talking about the mugger continued  yes by allahabad one lay still in the slackwater and let twenty go by to pick one and above all the english were not cumbered with jewellery and noserings and anklets as my women are nowadays to delight in ornaments is to end with a rope for a necklace as the saying is all the muggers of all the rivers grew fat then but it was my fate to be fatter than them all the news was that the english were being hunted into the rivers and by the right and left of gunga we believed it was true so far as i went south i believed it to be true and i went downstream beyond monghyr and the tombs that look over the river  i know that place said the adjutant since those days monghyr is a lost city very few live there now  thereafter i worked upstream very slowly and lazily and a little above monghyr there came down a boatful of whitefacesalive they were as i remember women lying under a cloth spread over sticks and crying aloud there was never a gun fired at us the watchers of the fords in those days all the guns were busy elsewhere we could hear them day and night inland coming and going as the wind shifted i rose up full before the boat because i had never seen whitefaces alive though i knew them wellotherwise a naked white child kneeled by the side of the boat and stooping over must needs try to trail his hands in the river it is a pretty thing to see how a child loves running water i had fed that day but there was yet a little unfilled space within me still it was for sport and not for food that i rose at the childs hands they were so clear a mark that i did not even look when i closed but they were so small that though my jaws rang truei am sure of thatthe child drew them up swiftly unhurt they must have passed between tooth and tooththose small white hands i should have caught him crosswise at the elbows but as i said it was only for sport and desire to see new things that i rose at all they cried out one after another in the boat and presently i rose again to watch them the boat was too heavy to push over they were only women but he who trusts a woman will walk on duckweed in a pool as the saying is and by the right and left of gunga that is truth  once a woman gave me some dried skin from a fish said the jackal i had hoped to get her baby but horsefood is better than the kick of a horse as the saying is what did thy woman do  she fired at me with a short gun of a kind i have never seen before or since five times one after another the mugger must have met with an oldfashioned revolver and i stayed openmouthed and gaping my head in the smoke never did i see such a thing five times as swiftly as i wave my tailthus  the jackal who had been growing more and more interested in the story had just time to leap back as the huge tail swung by like a scythe  not before the fifth shot said the mugger as though he had never dreamed of stunning one of his listenersnot before the fifth shot did i sink and i rose in time to hear a boatman telling all those white women that i was most certainly dead one bullet had gone under a neckplate of mine i know not if it is there still for the reason i cannot turn my head look and see child it will show that my tale is true  i said the jackal shall an eater of old shoes a bonecracker presume to doubt the word of the envy of the river may my tail be bitten off by blind puppies if the shadow of such a thought has crossed my humble mind the protector of the poor has condescended to inform me his slave that once in his life he has been wounded by a woman that is sufficient and i will tell the tale to all my children asking for no proof  overmuch civility is sometimes no better than overmuch discourtesy for as the saying is one can choke a guest with curds i do not desire that any children of thine should know that the mugger of muggerghaut took his only wound from a woman they will have much else to think of if they get their meat as miserably as does their father  it is forgotten long ago it was never said there never was a white woman there was no boat nothing whatever happened at all  the jackal waved his brush to show how completely everything was wiped out of his memory and sat down with an air  indeed very many things happened said the mugger beaten in his second attempt that night to get the better of his friend neither bore malice however eat and be eaten was fair law along the river and the jackal came in for his share of plunder when the mugger had finished a meal i left that boat and went upstream and when i had reached arrah and the backwaters behind it there were no more dead english the river was empty for a while then came one or two dead in red coats not english but of one kind allhindus and purbeeahsthen five and six abreast and at last from arrah to the north beyond agra it was as though whole villages had walked into the water they came out of little creeks one after another as the logs come down in the rains when the river rose they rose also in companies from the shoals they had rested upon and the falling flood dragged them with it across the fields and through the jungle by the long hair all night too going north i heard the guns and by day the shod feet of men crossing fords and that noise which a heavy cartwheel makes on sand under water and every ripple brought more dead at last even i was afraid for i said if this thing happen to men how shall the mugger of muggerghaut escape there were boats too that came up behind me without sails burning continually as the cottonboats sometimes burn but never sinking  ah said the adjutant boats like those come to calcutta of the south they are tall and black they beat up the water behind them with a tail and they  are thrice as big as my village my boats were low and white they beat up the water on either side of them and were no larger than the boats of one who speaks truth should be they made me very afraid and i left water and went back to this my river hiding by day and walking by night when i could not find little streams to help me i came to my village again but i did not hope to see any of my people there yet they were ploughing and sowing and reaping and going to and fro in their fields as quietly as their own cattle  was there still good food in the river said the jackal  more than i had any desire for even iand i do not eat mudeven i was tired and as i remember a little frightened of this constant coming down of the silent ones i heard my people say in my village that all the english were dead but those that came face down with the current were not english as my people saw then my people said that it was best to say nothing at all but to pay the tax and plough the land after a long time the river cleared and those that came down it had been clearly drowned by the floods as i could well see and though it was not so easy then to get food i was heartily glad of it a little killing here and there is no bad thingbut even the mugger is sometimes satisfied as the saying is  marvellous most truly marvellous said the jackal i am become fat through merely hearing about so much good eating and afterward what if it be permitted to ask did the protector of the poor do  i said to myselfand by the right and left of gunga i locked my jaws on that vowi said i would never go roving any more so i lived by the ghaut very close to my own people and i watched over them year after year and they loved me so much that they threw marigold wreaths at my head whenever they saw it lift yes and my fate has been very kind to me and the river is good enough to respect my poor and infirm presence only  no one is all happy from his beak to his tail said the adjutant sympathetically what does the mugger of muggerghaut need more  that little white child which i did not get said the mugger with a deep sigh he was very small but i have not forgotten i am old now but before i die it is my desire to try one new thing it is true they are a heavyfooted noisy and foolish people and the sport would be small but i remember the old days above benares and if the child lives he will remember still it may be he goes up and down the bank of some river telling how he once passed his hands between the teeth of the mugger of muggerghaut and lived to make a tale of it my fate has been very kind but that plagues me sometimes in my dreamsthe thought of the little white child in the bows of that boat he yawned and closed his jaws and now i will rest and think keep silent my children and respect the aged  he turned stiffly and shuffled to the top of the sandbar while the jackal drew back with the adjutant to the shelter of a tree stranded on the end nearest the railway bridge  that was a pleasant and profitable life he grinned looking up inquiringly at the bird who towered above him and not once mark you did he think fit to tell me where a morsel might have been left along the banks yet i have told him a hundred times of good things wallowing downstream how true is the saying all the world forgets the jackal and the barber when the news has been told now he is going to sleep arrh  how can a jackal hunt with a mugger said the adjutant coolly big thief and little thief it is easy to say who gets the pickings  the jackal turned whining impatiently and was going to curl himself up under the treetrunk when suddenly he cowered and looked up through the draggled branches at the bridge almost above his head  what now said the adjutant opening his wings uneasily  wait till we see the wind blows from us to them but they are not looking for usthose two men  men is it my office protects me all india knows i am holy the adjutant being a firstclass scavenger is allowed to go where he pleases and so this one never flinched  i am not worth a blow from anything better than an old shoe said the jackal and listened again hark to that footfall he went on that was no country leather but the shod foot of a whiteface listen again iron hits iron up there it is a gun friend those heavyfooted foolish english are coming to speak with the mugger  warn him then he was called protector of the poor by some one not unlike a starving jackal but a little time ago  let my cousin protect his own hide he has told me again and again there is nothing to fear from the whitefaces they must be whitefaces not a villager of muggerghaut would dare to come after him see i said it was a gun now with good luck we shall feed before daylight he cannot hear well out of water andthis time it is not a woman  a shiny barrel glittered for a minute in the moonlight on the girders the mugger was lying on the sandbar as still as his own shadow his forefeet spread out a little his head dropped between them snoring like amugger  a voice on the bridge whispered its an odd shotstraight down almostbut as safe as houses better try behind the neck golly what a brute the villagers will be wild if hes shot though hes the deota godling of these parts  dont care a rap another voice answered he took about fifteen of my best coolies while the bridge was building and its time he was put a stop to ive been after him in a boat for weeks stand by with the martini as soon as ive given him both barrels of this  mind the kick then a double fourbores no joke  thats for him to decide here goes  there was a roar like the sound of a small cannon the biggest sort of elephantrifle is not very different from some artillery and a double streak of flame followed by the stinging crack of a martini whose long bullet makes nothing of a crocodiles plates but the explosive bullets did the work one of them struck just behind the muggers neck a handsbreadth to the left of the backbone while the other burst a little lower down at the beginning of the tail in ninetynine cases out of a hundred a mortallywounded crocodile can scramble to deep water and get away but the mugger of muggerghaut was literally broken into three pieces he hardly moved his head before the life went out of him and he lay as flat as the jackal  thunder and lightning lightning and thunder said that miserable little beast has the thing that pulls the covered carts over the bridge tumbled at last  it is no more than a gun said the adjutant though his very tailfeathers quivered nothing more than a gun he is certainly dead here come the whitefaces  the two englishmen had hurried down from the bridge and across to the sandbar where they stood admiring the length of the mugger then a native with an axe cut off the big head and four men dragged it across the spit  the last time that i had my hand in a muggers mouth said one of the englishmen stooping down he was the man who had built the bridge it was when i was about five years oldcoming down the river by boat to monghyr i was a mutiny baby as they call it poor mother was in the boat too and she often told me how she fired dads old pistol at the beasts head  well youve certainly had your revenge on the chief of the claneven if the gun has made your nose bleed hi you boatmen haul that head up the bank and well boil it for the skull the skins too knocked about to keep come along to bed now this was worth sitting up all night for wasnt it    curiously enough the jackal and the adjutant made the very same remark not three minutes after the men had left     a ripple song       once a ripple came to land        in the golden sunset burning      lapped against a maidens hand        by the ford returning       dainty foot and gentle breast        here across be glad and rest      maiden wait the ripple saith        wait awhile for i am death       where my lover calls i go        shame it were to treat him coldly      twas a fish that circled so        turning over boldly       dainty foot and tender heart        wait the loaded ferrycart      wait ah wait the ripple saith        maiden wait for i am death       when my lover calls i haste        dame disdain was never wedded      rippleripple round her waist        clear the current eddied       foolish heart and faithful hand        little feet that touched no land      far away the ripple sped        rippleripplerunning red     the kings ankus       these are the four that are never content that have never          been filled since the dews began      jacalas mouth and the glut of the kite and the hands of the          ape and the eyes of man                                  jungle saying  kaa the big rock python had changed his skin for perhaps the twohundredth time since his birth and mowgli who never forgot that he owed his life to kaa for a nights work at cold lairs which you may perhaps remember went to congratulate him skinchanging always makes a snake moody and depressed till the new skin begins to shine and look beautiful kaa never made fun of mowgli any more but accepted him as the other jungle people did for the master of the jungle and brought him all the news that a python of his size would naturally hear what kaa did not know about the middle jungle as they call itthe life that runs close to the earth or under it the boulder burrow and the treebole lifemight have been written upon the smallest of his scales  that afternoon mowgli was sitting in the circle of kaas great coils fingering the flaked and broken old skin that lay all looped and twisted among the rocks just as kaa had left it kaa had very courteously packed himself under mowglis broad bare shoulders so that the boy was really resting in a living armchair  even to the scales of the eyes it is perfect said mowgli under his breath playing with the old skin strange to see the covering of ones own head at ones own feet  ay but i lack feet said kaa and since this is the custom of all my people i do not find it strange does thy skin never feel old and harsh  then go i and wash flathead but it is true in the great heats i have wished i could slough my skin without pain and run skinless  i wash and also i take off my skin how looks the new coat  mowgli ran his hand down the diagonal checkerings of the immense back the turtle is harderbacked but not so gay he said judgmatically the frog my namebearer is more gay but not so hard it is very beautiful to seelike the mottling in the mouth of a lily  it needs water a new skin never comes to full colour before the first bath let us go bathe  i will carry thee said mowgli and he stooped down laughing to lift the middle section of kaas great body just where the barrel was thickest a man might just as well have tried to heave up a twofoot watermain and kaa lay still puffing with quiet amusement then the regular evening game beganthe boy in the flush of his great strength and the python in his sumptuous new skin standing up one against the other for a wrestling matcha trial of eye and strength of course kaa could have crushed a dozen mowglis if he had let himself go but he played carefully and never loosed onetenth of his power ever since mowgli was strong enough to endure a little rough handling kaa had taught him this game and it suppled his limbs as nothing else could sometimes mowgli would stand lapped almost to his throat in kaas shifting coils striving to get one arm free and catch him by the throat then kaa would give way limply and mowgli with both quickmoving feet would try to cramp the purchase of that huge tail as it flung backward feeling for a rock or a stump they would rock to and fro head to head each waiting for his chance till the beautiful statuelike group melted in a whirl of blackandyellow coils and struggling legs and arms to rise up again and again now now now said kaa making feints with his head that even mowglis quick hand could not turn aside look i touch thee here little brother here and here are thy hands numb here again  the game always ended in one waywith a straight driving blow of the head that knocked the boy over and over mowgli could never learn the guard for that lightning lunge and as kaa said there was not the least use in trying  good hunting kaa grunted at last and mowgli as usual was shot away half a dozen yards gasping and laughing he rose with his fingers full of grass and followed kaa to the wise snakes pet bathingplacea deep pitchyblack pool surrounded with rocks and made interesting by sunken treestumps the boy slipped in junglefashion without a sound and dived across rose too without a sound and turned on his back his arms behind his head watching the moon rising above the rocks and breaking up her reflection in the water with his toes kaas diamondshaped head cut the pool like a razor and came out to rest on mowglis shoulder they lay still soaking luxuriously in the cool water  it is very good said mowgli at last sleepily now in the manpack at this hour as i remember they laid them down upon hard pieces of wood in the inside of a mudtrap and having carefully shut out all the clean winds drew foul cloth over their heavy heads and made evil songs through their noses it is better in the jungle  a hurrying cobra slipped down over a rock and drank gave them good hunting and went away  sssh said kaa as though he had suddenly remembered something so the jungle gives thee all that thou hast ever desired little brother  not all said mowgli laughing else there would be a new and strong shere khan to kill once a moon now i could kill with my own hands asking no help of buffaloes and also i have wished the sun to shine in the middle of the rains and the rains to cover the sun in the deep of summer and also i have never gone empty but i wished that i had killed a goat and also i have never killed a goat but i wished it had been buck nor buck but i wished it had been nilghai but thus do we feel all of us  thou hast no other desire the big snake demanded  what more can i wish i have the jungle and the favour of the jungle is there more anywhere between sunrise and sunset  now the cobra said kaa began what cobra he that went away just now said nothing he was hunting  it was another  hast thou many dealings with the poison people i give them their own path they carry death in the foretooth and that is not goodfor they are so small but what hood is this thou hast spoken with  kaa rolled slowly in the water like a steamer in a beam sea three or four moons since said he i hunted in cold lairs which place thou hast not forgotten and the thing i hunted fled shrieking past the tanks and to that house whose side i once broke for thy sake and ran into the ground  but the people of cold lairs do not live in burrows mowgli knew that kaa was telling of the monkey people  this thing was not living but seeking to live kaa replied with a quiver of his tongue he ran into a burrow that led very far i followed and having killed i slept when i waked i went forward  under the earth  even so coming at last upon a white hood a white cobra who spoke of things beyond my knowledge and showed me many things i had never before seen  new game was it good hunting mowgli turned quickly on his side  it was no game and would have broken all my teeth but the white hood said that a manhe spoke as one that knew the breedthat a man would give the breath under his ribs for only the sight of those things  we will look said mowgli i now remember that i was once a man  slowlyslowly it was haste killed the yellow snake that ate the sun we two spoke together under the earth and i spoke of thee naming thee as a man said the white hood and he is indeed as old as the jungle it is long since i have seen a man let him come and he shall see all these things for the least of which very many men would die  that must be new game and yet the poison people do not tell us when game is afoot they are an unfriendly folk  it is not game it isit isi cannot say what it is  we will go there i have never seen a white hood and i wish to see the other things did he kill them  they are all dead things he says he is the keeper of them all  ah as a wolf stands above meat he has taken to his own lair let us go  mowgli swam to bank rolled on the grass to dry himself and the two set off for cold lairs the deserted city of which you may have heard mowgli was not the least afraid of the monkey people in those days but the monkey people had the liveliest horror of mowgli their tribes however were raiding in the jungle and so cold lairs stood empty and silent in the moonlight kaa led up to the ruins of the queens pavilion that stood on the terrace slipped over the rubbish and dived down the halfchoked staircase that went underground from the centre of the pavilion mowgli gave the snakecallwe be of one blood ye and iand followed on his hands and knees they crawled a long distance down a sloping passage that turned and twisted several times and at last came to where the root of some great tree growing thirty feet overhead had forced out a solid stone in the wall they crept through the gap and found themselves in a large vault whose domed roof had been also broken away by treeroots so that a few streaks of light dropped down into the darkness  a safe lair said mowgli rising to his firm feet but overfar to visit daily and now what do we see  am i nothing said a voice in the middle of the vault and mowgli saw something white move till little by little there stood up the hugest cobra he had ever set eyes ona creature nearly eight feet long and bleached by being in darkness to an old ivorywhite even the spectaclemarks of his spread hood had faded to faint yellow his eyes were as red as rubies and altogether he was most wonderful  good hunting said mowgli who carried his manners with his knife and that never left him  what of the city said the white cobra without answering the greeting what of the great the walled citythe city of a hundred elephants and twenty thousand horses and cattle past countingthe city of the king of twenty kings i grow deaf here and it is long since i heard their wargongs  the jungle is above our heads said mowgli i know only hathi and his sons among elephants bagheera has slain all the horses in one village andwhat is a king  i told thee said kaa softly to the cobrai told thee four moons ago that thy city was not  the citythe great city of the forest whose gates are guarded by the kings towerscan never pass they builded it before my fathers father came from the egg and it shall endure when my sons sons are as white as i salomdhi son of chandrabija son of viyeja son of yegasuri made it in the days of bappa rawal whose cattle are ye  it is a lost trail said mowgli turning to kaa i know not his talk  nor i he is very old father of cobras there is only the jungle here as it has been since the beginning  then who is he said the white cobra sitting down before me unafraid knowing not the name of the king talking our talk through a mans lips who is he with the knife and the snakes tongue  mowgli they call me was the answer i am of the jungle the wolves are my people and kaa here is my brother father of cobras who art thou  i am the warden of the kings treasure kurrun raja builded the stone above me in the days when my skin was dark that i might teach death to those who came to steal then they let down the treasure through the stone and i heard the song of the brahmins my masters  umm said mowgli to himself i have dealt with one brahmin already in the manpack andi know what i know evil comes here in a little  five times since i came here has the stone been lifted but always to let down more and never to take away there are no riches like these richesthe treasures of a hundred kings but it is long and long since the stone was last moved and i think that my city has forgotten  there is no city look up yonder are roots of the great trees tearing the stones apart trees and men do not grow together kaa insisted  twice and thrice have men found their way here the white cobra answered savagely but they never spoke till i came upon them groping in the dark and then they cried only a little time but ye come with lies man and snake both and would have me believe the city is not and that my wardship ends little do men change in the years but i change never till the stone is lifted and the brahmins come down singing the songs that i know and feed me with warm milk and take me to the light again iii and no other am the warden of the kings treasure the city is dead ye say and here are the roots of the trees stoop down then and take what ye will earth has no treasure like to these man with the snakes tongue if thou canst go alive by the way that thou hast entered it the lesser kings will be thy servants  again the trail is lost said mowgli coolly can any jackal have burrowed so deep and bitten this great white hood he is surely mad father of cobras i see nothing here to take away  by the gods of the sun and moon it is the madness of death upon the boy hissed the cobra before thine eyes close i will allow thee this favour look thou and see what man has never seen before  they do not well in the jungle who speak to mowgli of favours said the boy between his teeth but the dark changes all as i know i will look if that please thee  he stared with puckeredup eyes round the vault and then lifted up from the floor a handful of something that glittered  oho said he this is like the stuff they play with in the manpack only this is yellow and the other was brown  he let the gold pieces fall and move forward the floor of the vault was buried some five or six feet deep in coined gold and silver that had burst from the sacks it had been originally stored in and in the long years the metal had packed and settled as sand packs at low tide on it and in it and rising through it as wrecks lift through the sand were jewelled elephanthowdahs of embossed silver studded with plates of hammered gold and adorned with carbuncles and turquoises there were palanquins and litters for carrying queens framed and braced with silver and enamel with jadehandled poles and amber curtainrings there were golden candlesticks hung with pierced emeralds that quivered on the branches there were studded images five feet high of forgotten gods silver with jewelled eyes there were coats of mail gold inlaid on steel and fringed with rotted and blackened seedpearls there were helmets crested and beaded with pigeonsblood rubies there were shields of lacquer of tortoiseshell and rhinoceroshide strapped and bossed with red gold and set with emeralds at the edge there were sheaves of diamondhilted swords daggers and huntingknives there were golden sacrificial bowls and ladles and portable altars of a shape that never sees the light of day there were jade cups and bracelets there were incenseburners combs and pots for perfume henna and eyepowder all in embossed gold there were noserings armlets headbands fingerrings and girdles past any counting there were belts seven fingers broad of squarecut diamonds and rubies and wooden boxes trebly clamped with iron from which the wood had fallen away in powder showing the pile of uncut starsapphires opals catseyes sapphires rubies diamonds emeralds and garnets within  the white cobra was right no mere money would begin to pay the value of this treasure the sifted pickings of centuries of war plunder trade and taxation the coins alone were priceless leaving out of count all the precious stones and the dead weight of the gold and silver alone might be two or three hundred tons every native ruler in india today however poor has a hoard to which he is always adding and though once in a long while some enlightened prince may send off forty or fifty bullockcart loads of silver to be exchanged for government securities the bulk of them keep their treasure and the knowledge of it very closely to themselves  but mowgli naturally did not understand what these things meant the knives interested him a little but they did not balance so well as his own and so he dropped them at last he found something really fascinating laid on the front of a howdah half buried in the coins it was a threefoot ankus or elephantgoadsomething like a small boathook the top was one round shining ruby and eight inches of the handle below it were studded with rough turquoises close together giving a most satisfactory grip below them was a rim of jade with a flowerpattern running round itonly the leaves were emeralds and the blossoms were rubies sunk in the cool green stone the rest of the handle was a shaft of pure ivory while the pointthe spike and hookwas goldinlaid steel with pictures of elephantcatching and the pictures attracted mowgli who saw that they had something to do with his friend hathi the silent  the white cobra had been following him closely  is this not worth dying to behold he said have i not done thee a great favour  i do not understand said mowgli the things are hard and cold and by no means good to eat but thishe lifted the ankusi desire to take away that i may see it in the sun thou sayest they are all thine wilt thou give it to me and i will bring thee frogs to eat  the white cobra fairly shook with evil delight assuredly i will give it he said all that is here i will give theetill thou goest away  but i go now this place is dark and cold and i wish to take the thornpointed thing to the jungle  look by thy foot what is that there mowgli picked up something white and smooth it is the bone of a mans head he said quietly and here are two more  they came to take the treasure away many years ago i spoke to them in the dark and they lay still  but what do i need of this that is called treasure if thou wilt give me the ankus to take away it is good hunting if not it is good hunting none the less i do not fight with the poison people and i was also taught the masterword of thy tribe  there is but one masterword here it is mine  kaa flung himself forward with blazing eyes who bade me bring the man he hissed  i surely the old cobra lisped it is long since i have seen man and this man speaks our tongue  but there was no talk of killing how can i go to the jungle and say that i have led him to his death said kaa  i talk not of killing till the time and as to thy going or not going there is the hole in the wall peace now thou fat monkeykiller i have but to touch thy neck and the jungle will know thee no longer never man came here that went away with the breath under his ribs i am the warden of the treasure of the kings city  but thou white worm of the dark i tell thee there is neither king nor city the jungle is all about us cried kaa  there is still the treasure but this can be done wait awhile kaa of the rocks and see the boy run there is room for great sport here life is good run to and fro awhile and make sport boy  mowgli put his hand on kaas head quietly  the white thing has dealt with men of the manpack until now he does not know me he whispered he has asked for this hunting let him have it mowgli had been standing with the ankus held point down he flung it from him quickly and it dropped crossways just behind the great snakes hood pinning him to the floor in a flash kaas weight was upon the writhing body paralysing it from hood to tail the red eyes burned and the six spare inches of the head struck furiously right and left  kill said kaa as mowglis hand went to his knife  no he said as he drew the blade i will never kill again save for food but look you kaa he caught the snake behind the hood forced the mouth open with the blade of the knife and showed the terrible poisonfangs of the upper jaw lying black and withered in the gum the white cobra had outlived his poison as a snake will  thuu it is dried upliterally a rotted out treestump said mowgli and motioning kaa away he picked up the ankus setting the white cobra free  the kings treasure needs a new warden he said gravely thuu thou hast not done well run to and fro and make sport thuu  i am ashamed kill me hissed the white cobra  there has been too much talk of killing we will go now i take the thornpointed thing thuu because i have fought and worsted thee  see then that the thing does not kill thee at last it is death remember it is death there is enough in that thing to kill the men of all my city not long wilt thou hold it jungle man nor he who takes it from thee they will kill and kill and kill for its sake my strength is dried up but the ankus will do my work it is death it is death it is death  mowgli crawled out through the hole into the passage again and the last that he saw was the white cobra striking furiously with his harmless fangs at the stolid golden faces of the gods that lay on the floor and hissing it is death  they were glad to get to the light of day once more and when they were back in their own jungle and mowgli made the ankus glitter in the morning light he was almost as pleased as though he had found a bunch of new flowers to stick in his hair  this is brighter than bagheeras eyes he said delightedly as he twirled the ruby i will show it to him but what did the thuu mean when he talked of death  i cannot say i am sorrowful to my tails tail that he felt not thy knife there is always evil at cold lairsabove ground or below but now i am hungry dost thou hunt with me this dawn said kaa  no bagheera must see this thing good hunting mowgli danced off flourishing the great ankus and stopping from time to time to admire it till he came to that part of the jungle bagheera chiefly used and found him drinking after a heavy kill mowgli told him all his adventures from beginning to end and bagheera sniffed at the ankus between whiles when mowgli came to the white cobras last words the panther purred approvingly  then the white hood spoke the thing which is mowgli asked quickly  i was born in the kings cages at oodeypore and it is in my stomach that i know some little of man very many men would kill thrice in a night for the sake of that one big red stone alone  but the stone makes it heavy to the hand my little bright knife is better andsee the red stone is not good to eat then why would they kill  mowgli go thou and sleep thou hast lived among men and  i remember men kill because they are not huntingfor idleness and pleasure wake again bagheera for what use was this thornpointed thing made  bagheera half opened his eyeshe was very sleepywith a malicious twinkle  it was made by men to thrust into the head of the sons of hathi so that the blood should pour out i have seen the like in the street of oodeypore before our cages that thing has tasted the blood of many such as hathi  but why do they thrust into the heads of elephants  to teach them mans law having neither claws nor teeth men make these thingsand worse  always more blood when i come near even to the things the manpack have made said mowgli disgustedly he was getting a little tired of the weight of the ankus if i had known this i would not have taken it first it was messuas blood on the thongs and now it is hathis i will use it no more look  the ankus flew sparkling and buried itself point down thirty yards away between the trees so my hands are clean of death said mowgli rubbing his palms on the fresh moist earth the thuu said death would follow me he is old and white and mad  white or black or death or life i am going to sleep little brother i cannot hunt all night and howl all day as do some folk  bagheera went off to a huntinglair that he knew about two miles off mowgli made an easy way for himself up a convenient tree knotted three or four creepers together and in less time than it takes to tell was swinging in a hammock fifty feet above ground though he had no positive objection to strong daylight mowgli followed the custom of his friends and used it as little as he could when he waked among the very loudvoiced peoples that live in the trees it was twilight once more and he had been dreaming of the beautiful pebbles he had thrown away  at least i will look at the thing again he said and slid down a creeper to the earth but bagheera was before him mowgli could hear him snuffing in the half light  where is the thornpointed thing cried mowgli  a man has taken it here is the trail  now we shall see whether the thuu spoke truth if the pointed thing is death that man will die let us follow  kill first said bagheera an empty stomach makes a careless eye men go very slowly and the jungle is wet enough to hold the lightest mark  they killed as soon as they could but it was nearly three hours before they finished their meat and drink and buckled down to the trail the jungle people know that nothing makes up for being hurried over your meals  think you the pointed thing will turn in the mans hand and kill him mowgli asked the thuu said it was death  we shall see when we find said bagheera trotting with his head low it is singlefoot he meant that there was only one man and the weight of the thing has pressed his heel far into the ground  hai this is as clear as summer lightning mowgli answered and they fell into the quick choppy trailtrot in and out through the checkers of the moonlight following the marks of those two bare feet  now he runs swiftly said mowgli the toes are spread apart they went on over some wet ground now why does he turn aside here  wait said bagheera and flung himself forward with one superb bound as far as ever he could the first thing to do when a trail ceases to explain itself is to cast forward without leaving your own confusing footmarks on the ground bagheera turned as he landed and faced mowgli crying here comes another trail to meet him it is a smaller foot this second trail and the toes turn inward  then mowgli ran up and looked it is the foot of a gond hunter he said look here he dragged his bow on the grass that is why the first trail turned aside so quickly big foot hid from little foot  that is true said bagheera now lest by crossing each others tracks we foul the signs let each take one trail i am big foot little brother and thou art little foot the gond  bagheera leaped back to the original trail leaving mowgli stooping above the curious narrow track of the wild little man of the woods  now said bagheera moving step by step along the chain of footprints i big foot turn aside here now i hide me behind a rock and stand still not daring to shift my feet cry thy trail little brother  now i little foot come to the rock said mowgli running up his trail now i sit down under the rock leaning upon my right hand and resting my bow between my toes i wait long for the mark of my feet is deep here  i also said bagheera hidden behind the rock i wait resting the end of the thornpointed thing upon a stone it slips for here is a scratch upon the stone cry thy trail little brother  one two twigs and a big branch are broken here said mowgli in an undertone now how shall i cry that ah it is plain now i little foot go away making noises and tramplings so that big foot may hear me he moved away from the rock pace by pace among the trees his voice rising in the distance as he approached a little cascade igo farawaytowherethenoiseoffallingwatercoversmynoise andhereiwait cry thy trail bagheera big foot  the panther had been casting in every direction to see how big foots trail led away from behind the rock then he gave tongue  i come from behind the rock upon my knees dragging the thornpointed thing seeing no one i run i big foot run swiftly the trail is clear let each follow his own i run  bagheera swept on along the clearlymarked trail and mowgli followed the steps of the gond for some time there was silence in the jungle  where art thou little foot cried bagheera mowglis voice answered him not fifty yards to the right  um said the panther with a deep cough the two run side by side drawing nearer  they raced on another halfmile always keeping about the same distance till mowgli whose head was not so close to the ground as bagheeras cried they have met good huntinglook here stood little foot with his knee on a rockand yonder is big foot indeed  not ten yards in front of them stretched across a pile of broken rocks lay the body of a villager of the district a long smallfeathered gond arrow through his back and breast  was the thuu so old and so mad little brother said bagheera gently here is one death at least  follow on but where is the drinker of elephants bloodthe redeyed thorn  little foot has itperhaps it is singlefoot again now  the single trail of a light man who had been running quickly and bearing a burden on his left shoulder held on round a long low spur of dried grass where each footfall seemed to the sharp eyes of the trackers marked in hot iron  neither spoke till the trail ran up to the ashes of a campfire hidden in a ravine  again said bagheera checking as though he had been turned into stone  the body of a little wizened gond lay with its feet in the ashes and bagheera looked inquiringly at mowgli  that was done with a bamboo said the boy after one glance i have used such a thing among the buffaloes when i served in the manpack the father of cobrasi am sorrowful that i made a jest of himknew the breed well as i might have known said i not that men kill for idleness  indeed they killed for the sake of the red and blue stones bagheera answered remember i was in the kings cages at oodeypore  one two three four tracks said mowgli stooping over the ashes four tracks of men with shod feet they do not go so quickly as gonds now what evil had the little woodman done to them see they talked together all five standing up before they killed him bagheera let us go back my stomach is heavy in me and yet it heaves up and down like an orioles nest at the end of a branch  it is not good hunting to leave game afoot follow said the panther those eight shod feet have not gone far  no more was said for fully an hour as they worked up the broad trail of the four men with shod feet  it was clear hot daylight now and bagheera said i smell smoke  men are always more ready to eat than to run mowgli answered trotting in and out between the low scrub bushes of the new jungle they were exploring bagheera a little to his left made an indescribable noise in his throat  here is one that has done with feeding said he a tumbled bundle of gaycoloured clothes lay under a bush and round it was some spilt flour  that was done by the bamboo again said mowgli see that white dust is what men eat they have taken the kill from this onehe carried their foodand given him for a kill to chil the kite  it is the third said bagheera  i will go with new big frogs to the father of cobras and feed him fat said mowgli to himself the drinker of elephants blood is death himselfbut still i do not understand  follow said bagheera  they had not gone half a mile farther when they heard ko the crow singing the deathsong in the top of a tamarisk under whose shade three men were lying a halfdead fire smoked in the centre of the circle under an iron plate which held a blackened and burned cake of unleavened bread close to the fire and blazing in the sunshine lay the rubyandturquoise ankus  the thing works quickly all ends here said bagheera how did these die mowgli there is no mark on any  a jungledweller gets to learn by experience as much as many doctors know of poisonous plants and berries mowgli sniffed the smoke that came up from the fire broke off a morsel of the blackened bread tasted it and spat it out again  apple of death he coughed the first must have made it ready in the food for these who killed him having first killed the gond  good hunting indeed the kills follow close said bagheera  apple of death is what the jungle call thornapple or dhatura the readiest poison in all india  what now said the panther must thou and i kill each other for yonder redeyed slayer  can it speak said mowgli in a whisper did i do it a wrong when i threw it away between us two it can do no wrong for we do not desire what men desire if it be left here it will assuredly continue to kill men one after another as fast as nuts fall in a high wind i have no love to men but even i would not have them die six in a night  what matter they are only men they killed one another and were well pleased said bagheera that first little woodman hunted well  they are cubs none the less and a cub will drown himself to bite the moons light on the water the fault was mine said mowgli who spoke as though he knew all about everything i will never again bring into the jungle strange thingsnot though they be as beautiful as flowers thishe handled the ankus gingerlygoes back to the father of cobras but first we must sleep and we cannot sleep near these sleepers also we must bury him lest he run away and kill another six dig me a hole under that tree  but little brother said bagheera moving off to the spot i tell thee it is no fault of the blooddrinker the trouble is with the men  all one said mowgli dig the hole deep when we wake i will take him up and carry him back    two nights later as the white cobra sat mourning in the darkness of the vault ashamed and robbed and alone the turquoise ankus whirled through the hole in the wall and clashed on the floor of golden coins  father of cobras said mowgli he was careful to keep the other side of the wall get thee a young and ripe one of thine own people to help thee guard the kings treasure so that no man may come away alive any more  ahha it returns then i said the thing was death how comes it that thou art still alive the old cobra mumbled twining lovingly round the ankushaft  by the bull that bought me i do not know that thing has killed six times in a night let him go out no more     the song of the little hunter       ere mor the peacock flutters ere the monkey people cry        ere chil the kite swoops down a furlong sheer      through the jungle very softly flits a shadow and a sigh        he is fear o little hunter he is fear       very softly down the glade runs a waiting watching shade        and the whisper spreads and widens far and near      and the sweat is on thy brow for he passes even now        he is fear o little hunter he is fear       ere the moon has climbed the mountain ere the rocks            are ribbed with light        when the downwarddipping trails are dank and drear      comes a breathing hard behind theesnufflesnuffle            through the night        it is fear o little hunter it is fear       on thy knees and draw the bow bid the shrilling arrow go        in the empty mocking thicket plunge the spear      but thy hands are loosed and weak and the blood has left            thy cheek        it is fear o little hunter it is fear       when the heatcloud sucks the tempest when the slivered            pinetrees fall        when the blinding blaring rainsqualls lash and veer      through the wargongs of the thunder rings a voice more            loud than all        it is fear o little hunter it is fear       now the spates are banked and deep now the footless            boulders leap        now the lightning shows each littlest leafrib clear      but thy throat is shut and dried and thy heart against            thy side        hammers fear o little hunterthis is fear     quiquern       the people of the eastern ice they are melting like the snow      they beg for coffee and sugar they go where the white men go      the people of the western ice they learn to steal and fight      they sell their furs to the tradingpost they sell their souls          to the white      the people of the southern ice they trade with the whalers      crew      their women have many ribbons but their tents are torn and few      but the people of the elder ice beyond the white mans ken      their spears are made of the narwhalhorn and they are the          last of the men                                          translation  he has opened his eyes look  put him in the skin again he will be a strong dog on the fourth month we will name him  for whom said amoraq  kadlus eye rolled round the skinlined snowhouse till it fell on fourteenyearold kotuko sitting on the sleepingbench making a button out of walrus ivory name him for me said kotuko with a grin i shall need him one day  kadlu grinned back till his eyes were almost buried in the fat of his flat cheeks and nodded to amoraq while the puppys fierce mother whined to see her baby wriggling far out of reach in the little sealskin pouch hung above the warmth of the blubberlamp kotuko went on with his carving and kadlu threw a rolled bundle of leather dogharnesses into a tiny little room that opened from one side of the house slipped off his heavy deerskin huntingsuit put it into a whalebonenet that hung above another lamp and dropped down on the sleepingbench to whittle at a piece of frozen sealmeat till amoraq his wife should bring the regular dinner of boiled meat and bloodsoup he had been out since early dawn at the sealholes eight miles away and had come home with three big seal halfway down the long low snow passage or tunnel that led to the inner door of the house you could hear snappings and yelpings as the dogs of his sleighteam released from the days work scuffled for warm places  when the yelpings grew too loud kotuko lazily rolled off the sleepingbench and picked up a whip with an eighteeninch handle of springy whalebone and twentyfive feet of heavy plaited thong he dived into the passage where it sounded as though all the dogs were eating him alive but that was no more than their regular grace before meals when he crawled out at the far end half a dozen furry heads followed him with their eyes as he went to a sort of gallows of whalejawbones from which the dogs meat was hung split off the frozen stuff in big lumps with a broadheaded spear and stood his whip in one hand and the meat in the other each beast was called by name the weakest first and woe betide any dog that moved out of his turn for the tapering lash would shoot out like thonged lightning and flick away an inch or so of hair and hide each beast growled snapped choked once over his portion and hurried back to the protection of the passage while the boy stood upon the snow under the blazing northern lights and dealt out justice the last to be served was the big black leader of the team who kept order when the dogs were harnessed and to him kotuko gave a double allowance of meat as well as an extra crack of the whip  ah said kotuko coiling up the lash i have a little one over the lamp that will make a great many howlings sarpok get in  he crawled back over the huddled dogs dusted the dry snow from his furs with the whalebone beater that amoraq kept by the door tapped the skinlined roof of the house to shake off any icicles that might have fallen from the dome of snow above and curled up on the bench the dogs in the passage snored and whined in their sleep the boybaby in amoraqs deep fur hood kicked and choked and gurgled and the mother of the newlynamed puppy lay at kotukos side her eyes fixed on the bundle of sealskin warm and safe above the broad yellow flame of the lamp  and all this happened far away to the north beyond labrador beyond hudsons strait where the great tides heave the ice about north of melville peninsulanorth even of the narrow fury and hecla straitson the north shore of baffin land where bylots island stands above the ice of lancaster sound like a puddingbowl wrong side up north of lancaster sound there is little we know anything about except north devon and ellesmere land but even there live a few scattered people next door as it were to the very pole  kadlu was an inuitwhat you call an esquimauand his tribe some thirty persons all told belonged to the tununirmiutthe country lying at the back of something in the maps that desolate coast is written navy board inlet but the inuit name is best because the country lies at the very back of everything in the world for nine months of the year there is only ice and snow and gale after gale with a cold that no one can realise who has never seen the thermometer even at zero for six months of those nine it is dark and that is what makes it so horrible in the three months of the summer it only freezes every other day and every night and then the snow begins to weep off on the southerly slopes and a few groundwillows put out their woolly buds a tiny stonecrop or so makes believe to blossom beaches of fine gravel and rounded stones run down to the open sea and polished boulders and streaked rocks lift up above the granulated snow but all that is gone in a few weeks and the wild winter locks down again on the land while at sea the ice tears up and down the offing jamming and ramming and splitting and hitting and pounding and grounding till it all freezes together ten feet thick from the land outward to deep water  in the winter kadlu would follow the seal to the edge of this landice and spear them as they came up to breathe at their blowholes the seal must have open water to live and catch fish in and in the deep of winter the ice would sometimes run eighty miles without a break from the nearest shore in the spring he and his people retreated from the floes to the rocky mainland where they put up tents of skins and snared the seabirds or speared the young seal basking on the beaches later they would go south into baffin land after the reindeer and to get their years store of salmon from the hundreds of streams and lakes of the interior coming back north in september or october for the muskox hunting and the regular winter sealery this travelling was done with dogsleighs twenty and thirty miles a day or sometimes down the coast in big skin womanboats when the dogs and the babies lay among the feet of the rowers and the women sang songs as they glided from cape to cape over the glassy cold waters all the luxuries that the tununirmiut knew came from the southdriftwood for sleighrunners rodiron for harpoontips steel knives tin kettles that cooked food much better than the old soapstone affairs flint and steel and even matches as well as coloured ribbons for the womens hair little cheap mirrors and red cloth for the edging of deerskin dressjackets kadlu traded the rich creamy twisted narwhal horn and muskox teeth these are just as valuable as pearls to the southern inuit and they in turn traded with the whalers and the missionaryposts of exeter and cumberland sounds and so the chain went on till a kettle picked up by a ships cook in the bhendy bazaar might end its days over a blubberlamp somewhere on the cool side of the arctic circle  kadlu being a good hunter was rich in iron harpoons snowknives birddarts and all the other things that make life easy up there in the great cold and he was the head of his tribe or as they say the man who knows all about it by practice this did not give him any authority except now and then he could advise his friends to change their huntinggrounds but kotuko used it to domineer a little in the lazy fat inuit fashion over the other boys when they came out at night to play ball in the moonlight or to sing the childs song to the aurora borealis  but at fourteen an inuit feels himself a man and kotuko was tired of making snares for wildfowl and kitfoxes and most tired of all of helping the women to chew sealand deerskins that supples them as nothing else can the long day through while the men were out hunting he wanted to go into the quaggi the singinghouse when the hunters gathered there for their mysteries and the angekok the sorcerer frightened them into the most delightful fits after the lamps were put out and you could hear the spirit of the reindeer stamping on the roof and when a spear was thrust out into the open black night it came back covered with hot blood he wanted to throw his big boots into the net with the tired air of the head of a family and to gamble with the hunters when they dropped in of an evening and played a sort of homemade roulette with a tin pot and a nail there were hundreds of things that he wanted to do but the grown men laughed at him and said wait till you have been in the buckle kotuko hunting is not all catching  now that his father had named a puppy for him things looked brighter an inuit does not waste a good dog on his son till the boy knows something of dogdriving and kotuko was more than sure that he knew more than everything  if the puppy had not had an iron constitution he would have died from overstuffing and overhandling kotuko made him a tiny harness with a trace to it and hauled him all over the housefloor shouting aua ja aua go to the right choiachoi ja choiachoi go to the left ohaha stop the puppy did not like it at all but being fished for in this way was pure happiness beside being put to the sleigh for the first time he just sat down on the snow and played with the sealhide trace that ran from his harness to the pitu the big thong in the bows of the sleigh then the team started and the puppy found the heavy tenfoot sleigh running up his back and dragging him along the snow while kotuko laughed till the tears ran down his face there followed days and days of the cruel whip that hisses like the wind over ice and his companions all bit him because he did not know his work and the harness chafed him and he was dot allowed to sleep with kotuko any more but had to take the coldest place in the passage it was a sad time for the puppy  the boy learned too as fast as the dog though a dogsleigh is a heartbreaking thing to manage each beast is harnessed the weakest nearest to the driver by his own separate trace which runs under his left foreleg to the main thong where it is fastened by a sort of button and loop which can be slipped by a turn of the wrist thus freeing one dog at a time this is very necessary because young dogs often get the trace between their hind legs where it cuts to the bone and they one and all will go visiting their friends as they run jumping in and out among the traces then they fight and the result is more mixed than a wet fishingline next morning a great deal of trouble can be avoided by scientific use of the whip every inuit boy prides himself as being a master of the long lash but it is easy to flick at a mark on the ground and difficult to lean forward and catch a shirking dog just behind the shoulders when the sleigh is going at full speed if you call one dogs name for visiting and accidentally lash another the two will fight it out at once and stop all the others again if you travel with a companion and begin to talk or by yourself and sing the dogs will halt turn round and sit down to hear what you have to say kotuko was run away from once or twice through forgetting to block the sleigh when he stopped and he broke many lashings and ruined a few thongs before he could be trusted with a full team of eight and the light sleigh then he felt himself a person of consequence and on smooth black ice with a bold heart and a quick elbow he smoked along over the levels as fast as a pack in full cry he would go ten miles to the sealholes and when he was on the huntinggrounds he would twitch a trace loose from the pitu and free the big black leader who was the cleverest dog in the team as soon as the dog had scented a breathinghole kotuko would reverse the sleigh driving a couple of sawedoff antlers that stuck up like perambulatorhandles from the backrest deep into the snow so that the team could not get away then he would crawl forward inch by inch and wait till the seal came up to breathe then he would stab down swiftly with his spear and runningline and presently would haul his seal up to the lip of the ice while the black leader came up and helped to pull the carcass across the ice to the sleigh that was the time when the harnessed dogs yelled and foamed with excitement and kotuko laid the long lash like a redhot bar across all their faces till the carcass froze stiff going home was the heavy work the loaded sleigh had to be humoured among the rough ice and the dogs sat down and looked hungrily at the seal instead of pulling at last they would strike the wellworn sleighroad to the village and toodlekiyi along the ringing ice heads down and tails up while kotuko struck up the angutivaun taina taunane taina the song of the returning hunter and voices hailed him from house to house under all that dim starlittern sky  when kotuko the dog came to his full growth he enjoyed himself too he fought his way up the team steadily fight after fight till one fine evening over their food he tackled the big black leader kotuko the boy saw fair play and made second dog of him as they say so he was promoted to the long thong of the leading dog running five feet in advance of all the others it was his bounden duty to stop all fighting in harness or out of it and he wore a collar of copper wire very thick and heavy on special occasions he was fed with cooked food inside the house and sometimes was allowed to sleep on the bench with kotuko he was a good sealdog and would keep a muskox at bay by running round him and snapping at his heels he would evenand this for a sleighdog is the last proof of braveryhe would even stand up to the gaunt arctic wolf whom all dogs of the north as a rule fear beyond anything that walks the snow he and his masterthey did not count the team of ordinary dogs as companyhunted together day after day and night after night furwrapped boy and savage longhaired narroweyed whitefanged yellow brute all an inuit has to do is to get food and skins for himself and his family the womenfolk make the skins into clothing and occasionally help in trapping small game but the bulk of the foodand they eat enormouslymust be found by the men if the supply fails there is no one up there to buy or beg or borrow from the people must die  an inuit does not think of these chances till he is forced to kadlu kotuko amoraq and the boybaby who kicked about in amoraqs fur hood and chewed pieces of blubber all day were as happy together as any family in the world they came of a very gentle racean inuit seldom loses his temper and almost never strikes a childwho did not know exactly what telling a real lie meant still less how to steal they were content to spear their living out of the heart of the bitter hopeless cold to smile oily smiles and tell queer ghost and fairy tales of evenings and eat till they could eat no more and sing the endless womans song amna aya aya amna ah ah through the long lamplighted days as they mended their clothes and their huntinggear  but one terrible winter everything betrayed them the tununirmiut returned from the yearly salmonfishing and made their houses on the early ice to the north of bylots island ready to go after the seal as soon as the sea froze but it was an early and savage autumn all through september there were continuous gales that broke up the smooth sealice when it was only four or five feet thick and forced it inland and piled a great barrier some twenty miles broad of lumped and ragged and needly ice over which it was impossible to draw the dogsleighs the edge of the floe off which the seal were used to fish in winter lay perhaps twenty miles beyond this barrier and out of reach of the tununirmiut even so they might have managed to scrape through the winter on their stock of frozen salmon and stored blubber and what the traps gave them but in december one of their hunters came across a tupik a skintent of three women and a girl nearly dead whose men had come down from the far north and been crushed in their little skin huntingboats while they were out after the longhorned narwhal kadlu of course could only distribute the women among the huts of the winter village for no inuit dare refuse a meal to a stranger he never knows when his own turn may come to beg amoraq took the girl who was about fourteen into her own house as a sort of servant from the cut of her sharppointed hood and the long diamond pattern of her white deerskin leggings they supposed she came from ellesmere land she had never seen tin cookingpots or woodenshod sleighs before but kotuko the boy and kotuko the dog were rather fond of her  then all the foxes went south and even the wolverine that growling bluntheaded little thief of the snow did not take the trouble to follow the line of empty traps that kotuko set the tribe lost a couple of their best hunters who were badly crippled in a fight with a muskox and this threw more work on the others kotuko went out day after day with a light huntingsleigh and six or seven of the strongest dogs looking till his eyes ached for some patch of clear ice where a seal might perhaps have scratched a breathinghole kotuko the dog ranged far and wide and in the dead stillness of the icefields kotuko the boy could hear his halfchoked whine of excitement above a sealhole three miles away as plainly as though he were at his elbow when the dog found a hole the boy would build himself a little low snow wall to keep off the worst of the bitter wind and there he would wait ten twelve twenty hours for the seal to come up to breathe his eyes glued to the tiny mark he had made above the hole to guide the downward thrust of his harpoon a little sealskin mat under his feet and his legs tied together in the tutareang the buckle that the old hunters had talked about this helps to keep a mans legs from twitching as he waits and waits and waits for the quickeared seal to rise though there is no excitement in it you can easily believe that the sitting still in the buckle with the thermometer perhaps forty degrees below zero is the hardest work an inuit knows when a seal was caught kotuko the dog would bound forward his trace trailing behind him and help to pull the body to the sleigh where the tired and hungry dogs lay sullenly under the lee of the broken ice  a seal did not go very far for each mouth in the little village had a right to be filled and neither bone hide nor sinew was wasted the dogs meat was taken for human use and amoraq fed the team with pieces of old summer skintents raked out from under the sleepingbench and they howled and howled again and waked to howl hungrily one could tell by the soapstone lamps in the huts that famine was near in good seasons when blubber was plentiful the light in the boatshaped lamps would be two feet highcheerful oily and yellow now it was a bare six inches amoraq carefully pricked down the moss wick when an unwatched flame brightened for a moment and the eyes of all the family followed her hand the horror of famine up there in the great cold is not so much dying as dying in the dark all the inuit dread the dark that presses on them without a break for six months in each year and when the lamps are low in the houses the minds of people begin to be shaken and confused  but worse was to come  the underfed dogs snapped and growled in the passages glaring at the cold stars and snuffing into the bitter wind night after night when they stopped howling the silence fell down again as solid and heavy as a snowdrift against a door and men could hear the beating of their blood in the thin passages of the ear and the thumping of their own hearts that sounded as loud as the noise of sorcerers drums beaten across the snow one night kotuko the dog who had been unusually sullen in harness leaped up and pushed his head against kotukos knee kotuko patted him but the dog still pushed blindly forward fawning then kadlu waked and gripped the heavy wolflike head and stared into the glassy eyes the dog whimpered and shivered between kadlus knees the hair rose about his neck and he growled as though a stranger were at the door then he barked joyously and rolled on the ground and bit at kotukos boot like a puppy  what is it said kotuko for he was beginning to be afraid  the sickness kadlu answered it is the dog sickness kotuko the dog lifted his nose and howled and howled again  i have not seen this before what will he do said kotuko  kadlu shrugged one shoulder a little and crossed the hut for his short stabbingharpoon the big dog looked at him howled again and slunk away down the passage while the other dogs drew aside right and left to give him ample room when he was out on the snow he barked furiously as though on the trail of a muskox and barking and leaping and frisking passed out of sight his trouble was not hydrophobia but simple plain madness the cold and the hunger and above all the dark had turned his head and when the terrible dogsickness once shows itself in a team it spreads like wildfire next huntingday another dog sickened and was killed then and there by kotuko as he bit and struggled among the traces then the black second dog who had been the leader in the old days suddenly gave tongue on an imaginary reindeertrack and when they slipped him from the pitu he flew at the throat of an icecliff and ran away as his leader had done his harness on his back after that no one would take the dogs out again they needed them for something else and the dogs knew it and though they were tied down and fed by hand their eyes were full of despair and fear to make things worse the old women began to tell ghosttales and to say that they had met the spirits of the dead hunters lost that autumn who prophesied all sorts of horrible things  kotuko grieved more for the loss of his dog than anything else for though an inuit eats enormously he also knows how to starve but the hunger the darkness the cold and the exposure told on his strength and he began to hear voices inside his head and to see people who were not there out of the tail of his eye one nighthe had unbuckled himself after ten hours waiting above a blind sealhole and was staggering back to the village faint and dizzyhe halted to lean his back against a boulder which happened to be supported like a rockingstone on a single jutting point of ice his weight disturbed the balance of the thing it rolled over ponderously and as kotuko sprang aside to avoid it slid after him squeaking and hissing on the iceslope  that was enough for kotuko he had been brought up to believe that every rock and boulder had its owner its inua who was generally a oneeyed kind of a womanthing called a tornaq and that when a tornaq meant to help a man she rolled after him inside her stone house and asked him whether he would take her for a guardian spirit in summer thaws the icepropped rocks and boulders roll and slip all over the face of the land so you can easily see how the idea of live stones arose kotuko heard the blood beating in his ears as he had heard it all day and he thought that was the tornaq of the stone speaking to him before he reached home he was quite certain that he had held a long conversation with her and as all his people believed that this was quite possible no one contradicted him  she said to me i jump down i jump down from my place on the snow cried kotuko with hollow eyes leaning forward in the halflighted hut she said i will be a guide she said i will guide you to the good sealholes tomorrow i go out and the tornaq will guide me  then the angekok the village sorcerer came in and kotuko told him the tale a second time it lost nothing in the telling  follow the tornait the spirits of the stones and they will bring us food again said the angekok  now the girl from the north had been lying near the lamp eating very little and saying less for days past but when amoraq and kadlu next morning packed and lashed a little handsleigh for kotuko and loaded it with his huntinggear and as much blubber and frozen sealmeat as they could spare she took the pullingrope and stepped out boldly at the boys side  your house is my house she said as the little boneshod sleigh squeaked and bumped behind them in the awful arctic night  my house is your house said kotuko but i think that we shall both go to sedna together  now sedna is the mistress of the underworld and the inuit believe that every one who dies must spend a year in her horrible country before going to quadliparmiut the happy place where it never freezes and the fat reindeer trot up when you call  through the village people were shouting the tornait have spoken to kotuko they will show him open ice he will bring us the seal again their voices were soon swallowed up by the cold empty dark and kotuko and the girl shouldered close together as they strained on the pullingrope or humoured the sleigh through the ice in the direction of the polar sea kotuko insisted that the tornaq of the stone had told him to go north and north they went under tuktuqdjung the reindeerthose stars that we call the great bear  no european could have made five miles a day over the icerubbish and the sharpedged drifts but those two knew exactly the turn of the wrist that coaxes a sleigh round a hummock the jerk that nearly lifts it out of an icecrack and the exact strength that goes to the few quiet strokes of the spearhead that make a path possible when everything looks hopeless  the girl said nothing but bowed her head and the long wolverinefur fringe of her ermine hood blew across her broad dark face the sky above them was an intense velvety black changing to bands of indian red on the horizon where the great stars burned like streetlamps from time to time a greenish wave of the northern lights would roll across the hollow of the high heavens flick like a flag and disappear or a meteor would crackle from darkness to darkness trailing a shower of sparks behind then they could see the ridged and furrowed surface of the floe tipped and laced with strange coloursred copper and bluish but in the ordinary starlight everything turned to one frostbitten gray the floe as you will remember had been battered and tormented by the autumn gales till it was one frozen earthquake there were gullies and ravines and holes like gravelpits cut in ice lumps and scattered pieces frozen down to the original floor of the floe blotches of old black ice that had been thrust under the floe in some gale and heaved up again roundish boulders of ice sawlike edges of ice carved by the snow that flies before the wind and sunken pits where thirty or forty acres lay below the level of the rest of the field from a little distance you might have taken the lumps for seal or walrus overturned sleighs or men on a hunting expedition or even the great tenlegged white spiritbear himself but in spite of these fantastic shapes all on the very edge of starting into life there was neither sound nor the least faint echo of sound and through this silence and through this waste where the sudden lights flapped and went out again the sleigh and the two that pulled it crawled like things in a nightmarea nightmare of the end of the world at the end of the world  when they were tired kotuko would make what the hunters call a halfhouse a very small snow hut into which they would huddle with the travellinglamp and try to thaw out the frozen sealmeat when they had slept the march began againthirty miles a day to get ten miles northward the girl was always very silent but kotuko muttered to himself and broke out into songs he had learned in the singinghousesummer songs and reindeer and salmon songsall horribly out of place at that season he would declare that he heard the tornaq growling to him and would run wildly up a hummock tossing his arms and speaking in loud threatening tones to tell the truth kotuko was very nearly crazy for the time being but the girl was sure that he was being guided by his guardian spirit and that everything would come right she was not surprised therefore when at the end of the fourth march kotuko whose eyes were burning like fireballs in his head told her that his tornaq was following them across the snow in the shape of a twoheaded dog the girl looked where kotuko pointed and something seemed to slip into a ravine it was certainly not human but everybody knew that the tornait preferred to appear in the shape of bear and seal and such like  it might have been the tenlegged white spiritbear himself or it might have been anything for kotuko and the girl were so starved that their eyes were untrustworthy they had trapped nothing and seen no trace of game since they had left the village their food would not hold out for another week and there was a gale coming a polar storm can blow for ten days without a break and all that while it is certain death to be abroad kotuko laid up a snowhouse large enough to take in the handsleigh never be separated from your meat and while he was shaping the last irregular block of ice that makes the keystone of the roof he saw a thing looking at him from a little cliff of ice half a mile away the air was hazy and the thing seemed to be forty feet long and ten feet high with twenty feet of tail and a shape that quivered all along the outlines the girl saw it too but instead of crying aloud with terror said quietly that is quiquern what comes after  he will speak to me said kotuko but the snowknife trembled in his hand as he spoke because however much a man may believe that he is a friend of strange and ugly spirits he seldom likes to be taken quite at his word quiquern too is the phantom of a gigantic toothless dog without any hair who is supposed to live in the far north and to wander about the country just before things are going to happen they may be pleasant or unpleasant things but not even the sorcerers care to speak about quiquern he makes the dogs go mad like the spiritbear he has several extra pairs of legssix or eightand this thing jumping up and down in the haze had more legs than any real dog needed kotuko and the girl huddled into their hut quickly of course if quiquern had wanted them he could have torn it to pieces above their heads but the sense of a footthick snowwall between themselves and the wicked dark was great comfort the gale broke with a shriek of wind like the shriek of a train and for three days and three nights it held never varying one point and never lulling even for a minute they fed the stone lamp between their knees and nibbled at the halfwarm sealmeat and watched the black soot gather on the roof for seventytwo long hours the girl counted up the food in the sleigh there was not more than two days supply and kotuko looked over the iron heads and the deersinew fastenings of his harpoon and his seallance and his birddart there was nothing else to do  we shall go to sedna soonvery soon the girl whispered in three days we shall lie down and go will your tornaq do nothing sing her an angekoks song to make her come here  he began to sing in the highpitched howl of the magic songs and the gale went down slowly in the middle of his song the girl started laid her mittened hand and then her head to the ice floor of the hut kotuko followed her example and the two kneeled staring into each others eyes and listening with every nerve he ripped a thin sliver of whalebone from the rim of a birdsnare that lay on the sleigh and after straightening set it upright in a little hole in the ice firming it down with his mitten it was almost as delicately adjusted as a compassneedle and now instead of listening they watched the thin rod quivered a littlethe least little jar in the world then it vibrated steadily for a few seconds came to rest and vibrated again this time nodding to another point of the compass  too soon said kotuko some big floe has broken far away outside  the girl pointed at the rod and shook her head it is the big breaking she said listen to the groundice it knocks  when they kneeled this time they heard the most curious muffled grunts and knockings apparently under their feet sometimes it sounded as though a blind puppy were squeaking above the lamp then as if a stone were being ground on hard ice and again like muffled blows on a drum but all dragged out and made small as though they travelled through a little horn a weary distance away  we shall not go to sedna lying down said kotuko it is the breaking the tornaq has cheated us we shall die  all this may sound absurd enough but the two were face to face with a very real danger the three days gale had driven the deep water of baffins bay southerly and piled it on to the edge of the farreaching landice that stretches from bylots island to the west also the strong current which sets east out of lancaster sound carried with it mile upon mile of what they call packicerough ice that has not frozen into fields and this pack was bombarding the floe at the same time that the swell and heave of the stormworked sea was weakening and undermining it what kotuko and the girl had been listening to were the faint echoes of that fight thirty or forty miles away and the little telltale rod quivered to the shock of it  now as the inuit say when the ice once wakes after its long winter sleep there is no knowing what may happen for solid floeice changes shape almost as quickly as a cloud the gale was evidently a spring gale sent out of time and anything was possible  yet the two were happier in their minds than before if the floe broke up there would be no more waiting and suffering spirits goblins and witchpeople were moving about on the racking ice and they might find themselves stepping into sednas country side by side with all sorts of wild things the flush of excitement still on them when they left the hut after the gale the noise on the horizon was steadily growing and the tough ice moaned and buzzed all round them  it is still waiting said kotuko  on the top of a hummock sat or crouched the eightlegged thing that they had seen three days beforeand it howled horribly  let us follow said the girl it may know some way that does not lead to sedna but she reeled from weakness as she took the pullingrope the thing moved off slowly and clumsily across the ridges heading always toward the westward and the land and they followed while the growling thunder at the edge of the floe rolled nearer and nearer the floes lip was split and cracked in every direction for three or four miles inland and great pans of tenfootthick ice from a few yards to twenty acres square were jolting and ducking and surging into one another and into the yet unbroken floe as the heavy swell took and shook and spouted between them this batteringram ice was so to speak the first army that the sea was flinging against the floe the incessant crash and jar of these cakes almost drowned the ripping sound of sheets of packice driven bodily under the floe as cards are hastily pushed under a tablecloth where the water was shallow these sheets would be piled one atop of the other till the bottommost touched mud fifty feet down and the discoloured sea banked behind the muddy ice till the increasing pressure drove all forward again in addition to the floe and the packice the gale and the currents were bringing down true bergs sailing mountains of ice snapped off from the greenland side of the water or the north shore of melville bay they pounded in solemnly the waves breaking white round them and advanced on the floe like an oldtime fleet under full sail a berg that seemed ready to carry the world before it would ground helplessly in deep water reel over and wallow in a lather of foam and mud and flying frozen spray while a much smaller and lower one would rip and ride into the flat floe flinging tons of ice on either side and cutting a track half a mile long before it was stopped some fell like swords shearing a rawedged canal and others splintered into a shower of blocks weighing scores of tons apiece that whirled and skirted among the hummocks others again rose up bodily out of the water when they shoaled twisted as though in pain and fell solidly on their sides while the sea threshed over their shoulders this trampling and crowding and bending and buckling and arching of the ice into every possible shape was going on as far as the eye could reach all along the north line of the floe from where kotuko and the girl were the confusion looked no more than an uneasy rippling crawling movement under the horizon but it came toward them each moment and they could hear far away to landward a heavy booming as it might have been the boom of artillery through a fog that showed that the floe was being jammed home against the iron cliffs of bylots island the land to the southward behind them  this has never been before said kotuko staring stupidly this is not the time how can the floe break now  follow that the girl cried pointing to the thing half limping half running distractedly before them they followed tugging at the handsleigh while nearer and nearer came the roaring march of the ice at last the fields round them cracked and starred in every direction and the cracks opened and snapped like the teeth of wolves but where the thing rested on a mound of old and scattered iceblocks some fifty feet high there was no motion kotuko leaped forward wildly dragging the girl after him and crawled to the bottom of the mound the talking of the ice grew louder and louder round them but the mound stayed fast and as the girl looked at him he threw his right elbow upward and outward making the inuit sign for land in the shape of an island and land it was that the eightlegged limping thing had led them tosome granitetipped sandbeached islet off the coast shod and sheathed and masked with ice so that no man could have told it from the floe but at the bottom solid earth and not shifting ice the smashing and rebound of the floes as they grounded and splintered marked the borders of it and a friendly shoal ran out to the northward and turned aside the rush of the heaviest ice exactly as a ploughshare turns over loam there was danger of course that some heavily squeezed icefield might shoot up the beach and plane off the top of the islet bodily but that did not trouble kotuko and the girl when they made their snowhouse and began to eat and heard the ice hammer and skid along the beach the thing had disappeared and kotuko was talking excitedly about his power over spirits as he crouched round the lamp in the middle of his wild sayings the girl began to laugh and rock herself backward and forward  behind her shoulder crawling into the hut crawl by crawl there were two heads one yellow and one black that belonged to two of the most sorrowful and ashamed dogs that ever you saw kotuko the dog was one and the black leader was the other both were now fat welllooking and quite restored to their proper minds but coupled to each other in an extraordinary fashion when the black leader ran off you remember his harness was still on him he must have met kotuko the dog and played or fought with him for his shoulderloop had caught in the plaited copper wire of kotukos collar and had drawn tight so that neither could get at the trace to gnaw it apart but each was fastened sidelong to his neighbours neck that with the freedom of hunting on their own account must have helped to cure their madness they were very sober  the girl pushed the two shamefaced creatures towards kotuko and sobbing with laughter cried that is quiquern who led us to safe ground look at his eight legs and double head  kotuko cut them free and they fell into his arms yellow and black together trying to explain how they had got their senses back again kotuko ran a hand down their ribs which were round and well clothed they have found food he said with a grin i do not think we shall go to sedna so soon my tornaq sent these the sickness has left them  as soon as they had greeted kotuko these two who had been forced to sleep and eat and hunt together for the past few weeks flew at each others throat and there was a beautiful battle in the snowhouse empty dogs do not fight kotuko said they have found the seal let us sleep we shall find food  when they waked there was open water on the north beach of the island and all the loosened ice had been driven landward the first sound of the surf is one of the most delightful that the inuit can hear for it means that spring is on the road kotuko and the girl took hold of hands and smiled for the clear full roar of the surge among the ice reminded them of salmon and reindeer time and the smell of blossoming groundwillows even as they looked the sea began to skim over between the floating cakes of ice so intense was the cold but on the horizon there was a vast red glare and that was the light of the sunken sun it was more like hearing him yawn in his sleep than seeing him rise and the glare lasted for only a few minutes but it marked the turn of the year nothing they felt could alter that  kotuko found the dogs fighting over a freshkilled seal who was following the fish that a gale always disturbs he was the first of some twenty or thirty seal that landed on the island in the course of the day and till the sea froze hard there were hundreds of keen black heads rejoicing in the shallow free water and floating about with the floating ice  it was good to eat sealliver again to fill the lamps recklessly with blubber and watch the flame blaze three feet in the air but as soon as the new seaice bore kotuko and the girl loaded the handsleigh and made the two dogs pull as they had never pulled in their lives for they feared what might have happened in their village the weather was as pitiless as usual but it is easier to draw a sleigh loaded with good food than to hunt starving they left fiveandtwenty seal carcasses buried in the ice of the beach all ready for use and hurried back to their people the dogs showed them the way as soon as kotuko told them what was expected and though there was no sign of a landmark in two days they were giving tongue outside kadlus house only three dogs answered them the others had been eaten and the houses were all dark but when kotuko shouted ojo boiled meat weak voices replied and when he called the muster of the village name by name very distinctly there were no gaps in it  an hour later the lamps blazed in kadlus house snowwater was heating the pots were beginning to simmer and the snow was dripping from the roof as amoraq made ready a meal for all the village and the boybaby in the hood chewed at a strip of rich nutty blubber and the hunters slowly and methodically filled themselves to the very brim with sealmeat kotuko and the girl told their tale the two dogs sat between them and whenever their names came in they cocked an ear apiece and looked most thoroughly ashamed of themselves a dog who has once gone mad and recovered the inuit say is safe against all further attacks  so the tornaq did not forget us said kotuko the storm blew the ice broke and the seal swam in behind the fish that were frightened by the storm now the new sealholes are not two days distant let the good hunters go tomorrow and bring back the seal i have spearedtwentyfive seal buried in the ice when we have eaten those we will all follow the seal on the floe  what do you do said the sorcerer in the same sort of voice as he used to kadlu richest of the tununirmiut  kadlu looked at the girl from the north and said quietly we build a house he pointed to the northwest side of kadlus house for that is the side on which the married son or daughter always lives  the girl turned her hands palm upward with a little despairing shake of her head she was a foreigner picked up starving and could bring nothing to the housekeeping  amoraq jumped from the bench where she sat and began to sweep things into the girls lapstone lamps iron skinscrapers tin kettles deerskins embroidered with muskox teeth and real canvasneedles such as sailors usethe finest dowry that has ever been given on the far edge of the arctic circle and the girl from the north bowed her head down to the very floor  also these said kotuko laughing and signing to the dogs who thrust their cold muzzles into the girls face  ah said the angekok with an important cough as though he had been thinking it all over as soon as kotuko left the village i went to the singinghouse and sang magic i sang all the long nights and called upon the spirit of the reindeer my singing made the gale blow that broke the ice and drew the two dogs toward kotuko when the ice would have crushed his bones my song drew the seal in behind the broken ice my body lay still in the quaggi but my spirit ran about on the ice and guided kotuko and the dogs in all the things they did i did it  everybody was full and sleepy so no one contradicted and the angekok by virtue of his office helped himself to yet another lump of boiled meat and lay down to sleep with the others in the warm welllighted oilsmelling home    now kotuko who drew very well in the inuit fashion scratched pictures of all these adventures on a long flat piece of ivory with a hole at one end when he and the girl went north to ellesmere land in the year of the wonderful open winter he left the picturestory with kadlu who lost it in the shingle when his dogsleigh broke down one summer on the beach of lake netilling at nikosiring and there a lake inuit found it next spring and sold it to a man at imigen who was interpreter on a cumberland sound whaler and he sold it to hans olsen who was afterward a quartermaster on board a big steamer that took tourists to the north cape in norway when the tourist season was over the steamer ran between london and australia stopping at ceylon and there olsen sold the ivory to a cingalese jeweller for two imitation sapphires i found it under some rubbish in a house at colombo and have translated it from one end to the other     angutivaun taina  this is a very free translation of the song of the returning hunter as the men used to sing it after sealspearing the inuit always repeat things over and over again        our gloves are stiff with the frozen blood         our furs with the drifted snow       as we come in with the sealthe seal         in from the edge of the floe        au jana aua oha haq         and the yelping dogteams go       and the long whips crack and the men come back         back from the edge of the floe        we tracked our seal to his secret place         we heard him scratch below       we made our mark and we watched beside         out on the edge of the floe        we raised our lance when he rose to breathe         we drove it downwardso       and we played him thus and we killed him thus         out on the edge of the floe        our gloves are glued with the frozen blood         our eyes with the drifting snow       but we come back to our wives again         back from the edge of the floe        au jana aua oha haq         and the loaded dogteams go       and the wives can hear their men come back         back from

it was after the letting in of the jungle that the pleasantest part of mowglis life began he had the good conscience that comes from paying debts all the jungle was his friend and just a little afraid of him the things that he did and saw and heard when he was wandering from one people to another with or without his four companions would make many many stories each as long as this one so you will never be told how he met the mad elephant of mandla who killed twoandtwenty bullocks drawing eleven carts of coined silver to the government treasury and scattered the shiny rupees in the dust how he fought jacala the crocodile all one long night in the marshes of the north and broke his skinningknife on the brutes backplates how he found a new and longer knife round the neck of a man who had been killed by a wild boar and how he tracked that boar and killed him as a fair price for the knife how he was caught up once in the great famine by the moving of the deer and nearly crushed to death in the swaying hot herds how he saved hathi the silent from being once more trapped in a pit with a stake at the bottom and how next day he himself fell into a very cunning leopardtrap and how hathi broke the thick wooden bars to pieces above him how he milked the wild buffaloes in the swamp and how  but we must tell one tale at a time father and mother wolf died and mowgli rolled a big boulder against the mouth of their cave and cried the death song over them baloo grew very old and stiff and even bagheera whose nerves were steel and whose muscles were iron was a shade slower on the kill than he had been akela turned from gray to milky white with pure age his ribs stuck out and he walked as though he had been made of wood and mowgli killed for him but the young wolves the children of the disbanded seeonee pack throve and increased and when there were about forty of them masterless fullvoiced cleanfooted fiveyearolds akela told them that they ought to gather themselves together and follow the law and run under one head as befitted the free people  this was not a question in which mowgli concerned himself for as he said he had eaten sour fruit and he knew the tree it hung from but when phao son of phaona his father was the gray tracker in the days of akelas headship fought his way to the leadership of the pack according to the jungle law and the old calls and songs began to ring under the stars once more mowgli came to the council rock for memorys sake when he chose to speak the pack waited till he had finished and he sat at akelas side on the rock above phao those were days of good hunting and good sleeping no stranger cared to break into the jungles that belonged to mowglis people as they called the pack and the young wolves grew fat and strong and there were many cubs to bring to the lookingover mowgli always attended a lookingover remembering the night when a black panther bought a naked brown baby into the pack and the long call look look well o wolves made his heart flutter otherwise he would be far away in the jungle with his four brothers tasting touching seeing and feeling new things  one twilight when he was trotting leisurely across the ranges to give akela the half of a buck that he had killed while the four jogged behind him sparring a little and tumbling one another over for joy of being alive he heard a cry that had never been heard since the bad days of shere khan it was what they call in the jungle the pheeal a hideous kind of shriek that the jackal gives when he is hunting behind a tiger or when there is a big killing afoot if you can imagine a mixture of hate triumph fear and despair with a kind of leer running through it you will get some notion of the pheeal that rose and sank and wavered and quavered far away across the waingunga the four stopped at once bristling and growling mowglis hand went to his knife and he checked the blood in his face his eyebrows knotted  there is no striped one dare kill here he said  that is not the cry of the forerunner answered gray brother it is some great killing listen  it broke out again half sobbing and half chuckling just as though the jackal had soft human lips then mowgli drew deep breath and ran to the council rock overtaking on his way hurrying wolves of the pack phao and akela were on the rock together and below them every nerve strained sat the others the mothers and the cubs were cantering off to their lairs for when the pheeal cries it is no time for weak things to be abroad  they could hear nothing except the waingunga rushing and gurgling in the dark and the light evening winds among the treetops till suddenly across the river a wolf called it was no wolf of the pack for they were all at the rock the note changed to a long despairing bay and dhole it said dhole dhole dhole they heard tired feet on the rocks and a gaunt wolf streaked with red on his flanks his right forepaw useless and his jaws white with foam flung himself into the circle and lay gasping at mowglis feet  good hunting under whose headship said phao gravely  good hunting wontolla am i was the answer he meant that he was a solitary wolf fending for himself his mate and his cubs in some lonely lair as do many wolves in the south wontolla means an outlierone who lies out from any pack then he panted and they could see his heartbeats shake him backward and forward  what moves said phao for that is the question all the jungle asks after the pheeal cries  the dhole the dhole of the dekkanred dog the killer they came north from the south saying the dekkan was empty and killing out by the way when this moon was new there were four to memy mate and three cubs she would teach them to kill on the grass plains hiding to drive the buck as we do who are of the open at midnight i heard them together full tongue on the trail at the dawnwind i found them stiff in the grassfour free people four when this moon was new then sought i my bloodright and found the dhole  how many said mowgli quickly the pack growled deep in their throats  i do not know three of them will kill no more but at the last they drove me like the buck on my three legs they drove me look free people  he thrust out his mangled forefoot all dark with dried blood there were cruel bites low down on his side and his throat was torn and worried  eat said akela rising up from the meat mowgli had brought him and the outlier flung himself on it  this shall be no loss he said humbly when he had taken off the first edge of his hunger give me a little strength free people and i also will kill my lair is empty that was full when this moon was new and the blood debt is not all paid  phao heard his teeth crack on a haunchbone and grunted approvingly  we shall need those jaws said he were there cubs with the dhole  nay nay red hunters all grown dogs of their pack heavy and strong for all that they eat lizards in the dekkan  what wontolla had said meant that the dhole the red huntingdog of the dekkan was moving to kill and the pack knew well that even the tiger will surrender a new kill to the dhole they drive straight through the jungle and what they meet they pull down and tear to pieces though they are not as big nor half as cunning as the wolf they are very strong and very numerous the dhole for instance do not begin to call themselves a pack till they are a hundred strong whereas forty wolves make a very fair pack indeed mowglis wanderings had taken him to the edge of the high grassy downs of the dekkan and he had seen the fearless dholes sleeping and playing and scratching themselves in the little hollows and tussocks that they use for lairs he despised and hated them because they did not smell like the free people because they did not live in caves and above all because they had hair between their toes while he and his friends were cleanfooted but he knew for hathi had told him what a terrible thing a dhole huntingpack was even hathi moves aside from their line and until they are killed or till game is scarce they will go forward  akela knew something of the dholes too for he said to mowgli quietly it is better to die in a full pack than leaderless and alone this is good hunting andmy last but as men live thou hast very many more nights and days little brother go north and lie down and if any live after the dhole has gone by he shall bring thee word of the fight   ah said mowgli quite gravely must i go to the marshes and catch little fish and sleep in a tree or must i ask help of the bandarlog and crack nuts while the pack fight below  it is to the death said akela thou hast never met the dholethe red killer even the striped one  aowa aowa said mowgli pettingly i have killed one striped ape and sure am i in my stomach that shere khan would have left his own mate for meat to the dhole if he had winded a pack across three ranges listen now there was a wolf my father and there was a wolf my mother and there was an old gray wolf not too wise he is white now was my father and my mother therefore i he raised his voice i say that when the dhole come and if the dhole come mowgli and the free people are of one skin for that hunting and i say by the bull that bought meby the bull bagheera paid for me in the old days which ye of the pack do not rememberi say that the trees and the river may hear and hold fast if i forget i say that this my knife shall be as a tooth to the packand i do not think it is so blunt this is my word which has gone from me  thou dost not know the dhole man with a wolfs tongue said wontolla i look only to clear the blood debt against them ere they have me in many pieces they move slowly killing out as they go but in two days a little strength will come back to me and i turn again for the blood debt but for ye free people my word is that ye go north and eat but little for a while till the dhole are gone there is no meat in this hunting  hear the outlier said mowgli with a laugh free people we must go north and dig lizards and rats from the bank lest by any chance we meet the dhole he must kill out our huntinggrounds while we lie hid in the north till it please him to give us our own again he is a dogand the pup of a dogred yellowbellied lairless and haired between every toe he counts his cubs six and eight at the litter as though he were chikai the little leaping rat surely we must run away free people and beg leave of the peoples of the north for the offal of dead cattle ye know the saying north are the vermin south are the lice we are the jungle choose ye o choose it is good hunting for the packfor the full packfor the lair and the litter for the inkill and the outkill for the mate that drives the doe and the little little cub within the cave it is metit is metit is met  the pack answered with one deep crashing bark that sounded in the night like a big tree falling it is met they cried stay with these said mowgli to the four we shall need every tooth phao and akela must make ready the battle i go to count the dogs  it is death wontolla cried half rising what can such a hairless one do against the red dog even the striped one remember  thou art indeed an outlier mowgli called back but we will speak when the dholes are dead good hunting all  he hurried off into the darkness wild with excitement hardly looking where he set foot and the natural consequence was that he tripped full length over kaas great coils where the python lay watching a deerpath near the river  kssha said kaa angrily is this junglework to stamp and tramp and undo a nights huntingwhen the game are moving so well too  the fault was mine said mowgli picking himself up indeed i was seeking thee flathead but each time we meet thou art longer and broader by the length of my arm there is none like thee in the jungle wise old strong and most beautiful kaa  now whither does this trail lead kaas voice was gentler not a moon since there was a manling with a knife threw stones at my head and called me bad little treecat names because i lay asleep in the open  ay and turned every driven deer to all the winds and mowgli was hunting and this same flathead was too deaf to hear his whistle and leave the deerroads free mowgli answered composedly sitting down among the painted coils  now this same manling comes with soft tickling words to this same flathead telling him that he is wise and strong and beautiful and this same old flathead believes and makes a place thus for this same stonethrowing manling andart thou at ease now could bagheera give thee so good a restingplace  kaa had as usual made a sort of soft halfhammock of himself under mowglis weight the boy reached out in the darkness and gathered in the supple cablelike neck till kaas head rested on his shoulder and then he told him all that had happened in the jungle that night  wise i may be said kaa at the end but deaf i surely am else i should have heard the pheeal small wonder the eaters of grass are uneasy how many be the dhole  i have not yet seen i came hotfoot to thee thou art older than hathi but oh kaahere mowgli wriggled with sheerjoyit will be good hunting few of us will see another moon  dost thou strike in this remember thou art a man and remember what pack cast thee out let the wolf look to the dog thou art a man  last years nuts are this years black earth said mowgli it is true that i am a man but it is in my stomach that this night i have said that i am a wolf i called the river and the trees to remember i am of the free people kaa till the dhole has gone by  free people kaa grunted free thieves and thou hast tied thyself into the deathknot for the sake of the memory of the dead wolves this is no good hunting  it is my word which i have spoken the trees know the river knows till the dhole have gone by my word comes not back to me  ngssh this changes all trails i had thought to take thee away with me to the northern marshes but the wordeven the word of a little naked hairless manlingis the word now i kaa say  think well flathead lest thou tie thyself into the deathknot also i need no word from thee for well i know  be it so then said kaa i will give no word but what is in thy stomach to do when the dhole come  they must swim the waingunga i thought to meet them with my knife in the shallows the pack behind me and so stabbing and thrusting we a little might turn them downstream or cool their throats  the dhole do not turn and their throats are hot said kaa there will be neither manling nor wolfcub when that hunting is done but only dry bones  alala if we die we die it will be most good hunting but my stomach is young and i have not seen many rains i am not wise nor strong hast thou a better plan kaa  i have seen a hundred and a hundred rains ere hathi cast his milktushes my trail was big in the dust by the first egg i am older than many trees and i have seen all that the jungle has done  but this is new hunting said mowgli never before have the dhole crossed our trail  what is has been what will be is no more than a forgotten year striking backward be still while i count those my years  for a long hour mowgli lay back among the coils while kaa his head motionless on the ground thought of all that he had seen and known since the day he came from the egg the light seemed to go out of his eyes and leave them like stale opals and now and again he made little stiff passes with his head right and left as though he were hunting in his sleep mowgli dozed quietly for he knew that there is nothing like sleep before hunting and he was trained to take it at any hour of the day or night  then he felt kaas back grow bigger and broader below him as the huge python puffed himself out hissing with the noise of a sword drawn from a steel scabbard  i have seen all the dead seasons kaa said at last and the great trees and the old elephants and the rocks that were bare and sharppointed ere the moss grew art thou still alive manling  it is only a little after moonset said mowgli i do not understand  hssh i am again kaa i knew it was but a little time now we will go to the river and i will show thee what is to be done against the dhole  he turned straight as an arrow for the main stream of the waingunga plunging in a little above the pool that hid the peace rock mowgli at his side  nay do not swim i go swiftly my back little brother  mowgli tucked his left arm round kaas neck dropped his right close to his body and straightened his feet then kaa breasted the current as he alone could and the ripple of the checked water stood up in a frill round mowglis neck and his feet were waved to and fro in the eddy under the pythons lashing sides a mile or two above the peace rock the waingunga narrows between a gorge of marble rocks from eighty to a hundred feet high and the current runs like a millrace between and over all manner of ugly stones but mowgli did not trouble his head about the water little water in the world could have given him a moments fear he was looking at the gorge on either side and sniffing uneasily for there was a sweetishsourish smell in the air very like the smell of a big anthill on a hot day instinctively he lowered himself in the water only raising his head to breathe from time to time and kaa came to anchor with a double twist of his tail round a sunken rock holding mowgli in the hollow of a coil while the water raced on  this is the place of death said the boy why do we come here  they sleep said kaa hathi will not turn aside for the striped one yet hathi and the striped one together turn aside for the dhole and the dhole they say turn aside for nothing and yet for whom do the little people of the rocks turn aside tell me master of the jungle who is the master of the jungle  these mowgli whispered it is the place of death let us go  nay look well for they are asleep it is as it was when i was not the length of thy arm  the split and weatherworn rocks of the gorge of the waingunga had been used since the beginning of the jungle by the little people of the rocksthe busy furious black wild bees of india and as mowgli knew well all trails turned off half a mile before they reached the gorge for centuries the little people had hived and swarmed from cleft to cleft and swarmed again staining the white marble with stale honey and made their combs tall and deep in the dark of the inner caves where neither man nor beast nor fire nor water had ever touched them the length of the gorge on both siaes was hung as it were with black shimmery velvet curtains and mowgli sank as he looked for those were the clotted millions of the sleeping bees there were other lumps and festoons and things like decayed treetrunks studded on the face of the rock the old combs of past years or new cities built in the shadow of the windless gorge and huge masses of spongy rotten trash had rolled down and stuck among the trees and creepers that clung to the rockface as he listened he heard more than once the rustle and slide of a honeyloaded comb turning over or failing away somewhere in the dark galleries then a booming of angry wings and the sullen drip drip drip of the wasted honey guttering along till it lipped over some ledge in the open air and sluggishly trickled down on the twigs there was a tiny little beach not five feet broad on one side of the river and that was piled high with the rubbish of uncounted years there were dead bees drones sweepings and stale combs and wings of marauding moths that had strayed in after honey all tumbled in smooth piles of the finest black dust the mere sharp smell of it was enough to frighten anything that had no wings and knew what the little people were  kaa moved upstream again till he came to a sandy bar at the head of the gorge  here is this seasons kill said he look on the bank lay the skeletons of a couple of young deer and a buffalo mowgli could see that neither wolf nor jackal had touched the hones which were laid out naturally  they came beyond the line they did not know the law murmured mowgli and the little people killed them let us go ere they wake  they do not wake till the dawn said kaa now i will tell thee a hunted buck from the south many many rains ago came hither from the south not knowing the jungle a pack on his trail being made blind by fear he leaped from above the pack running by sight for they were hot and blind on the trail the sun was high and the little people were many and very angry many too were those of the pack who leaped into the waingunga but they were dead ere they took water those who did not leap died also in the rocks above but the buck lived  how  because he came first running for his life leaping ere the little people were aware and was in the river when they gathered to kill the pack following was altogether lost under the weight of the little people  the buck lived mowgli repeated slowly  at least he did not die then though none waited his coming down with a strong body to hold him safe against the water as a certain old fat deaf yellow flathead would wait for a manlingyea though there were all the dholes of the dekkan on his trail what is in thy stomach kaas head was close to mowglis ear and it was a little time before the boy answered  it is to pull the very whiskers of death butkaa thou art indeed the wisest of all the jungle  so many have said look now if the dhole follow thee  as surely they will follow ho ho i have many little thorns under my tongue to prick into their hides  if they follow thee hot and blind looking only at thy shoulders those who do not die up above will take water either here or lower down for the little people will rise up and cover them now the waingunga is hungry water and they will have no kaa to hold them but will go down such as live to the shallows by the seeonee lairs and there thy pack may meet them by the throat  ahai eowawa better could not be till the rains fall in the dry season there is now only the little matter of the run and the leap i will make me known to the dholes so that they shall follow me very closely  hast thou seen the rocks above thee from the landward side  indeed no that i had forgotten  go look it is all rotten ground cut and full of holes one of thy clumsy feet set down without seeing would end the hunt see i leave thee here and for thy sake only i will carry word to the pack that they may know where to look for the dhole for myself i am not of one skin with any wolf  when kaa disliked an acquaintance he could be more unpleasant than any of the jungle people except perhaps bagheera he swam downstream and opposite the rock he came on phao and akela listening to the night noises  hssh dogs he said cheerfully the dholes will come downstream if ye be not afraid ye can kill them in the shallows  when come they said phao and where is my mancub said akela  they come when they come said kaa wait and see as for thy mancub from whom thou hast taken a word and so laid him open to death thy mancub is with me and if he be not already dead the fault is none of thine bleached dog wait here for the dhole and be glad that the mancub and i strike on thy side  kaa flashed upstream again and moored himself in the middle of the gorge looking upward at the line of the cliff presently he saw mowglis head move against the stars and then there was a whizz in the air the keen clean schloop of a body falling feet first and next minute the boy was at rest again in the loop of kaas body  it is no leap by night said mowgli quietly i have jumped twice as far for sport but that is an evil place abovelow bushes and gullies that go down very deep all full of the little people i have put big stones one above the other by the side of three gullies these i shall throw down with my feet in running and the little people will rise up behind me very angry  that is mans talk and mans cunning said kaa thou art wise but the little people are always angry  nay at twilight all wings near and far rest for a while i will play with the dhole at twilight for the dhole hunts best by day he follows now wontollas bloodtrail  chil does not leave a dead ox nor the dhole the bloodtrail said kaa  then i will make him a new bloodtrail of his own blood if i can and give him dirt to eat thou wilt stay here kaa till i come again with my dholes  ay but what if they kill thee in the jungle or the little people kill thee before thou canst leap down to the river  when tomorrow comes we will kill for tomorrow said mowgli quoting a jungle saying and again when i am dead it is time to sing the death song good hunting kaa  he loosed his arm from the pythons neck and went down the gorge like a log in a freshet paddling toward the far bank where he found slackwater and laughing aloud from sheer happiness there was nothing mowgli liked better than as he himself said to pull the whiskers of death and make the jungle know that he was their overlord he had often with baloos help robbed bees nests in single trees and he knew that the little people hated the smell of wild garlic so he gathered a small bundle of it tied it up with a bark string and then followed wontollas bloodtrail as it ran southerly from the lairs for some five miles looking at the trees with his head on one side and chuckling as he looked  mowgli the frog have i been said he to himself mowgli the wolf have i said that i am now mowgli the ape must i be before i am mowgli the buck at the end i shall be mowgli the man ho and he slid his thumb along the eighteeninch blade of his knife  wontollas trail all rank with dark bloodspots ran under a forest of thick trees that grew close together and stretched away northeastward gradually growing thinner and thinner to within two miles of the bee rocks from the last tree to the low scrub of the bee rocks was open country where there was hardly cover enough to hide a wolf mowgli trotted along under the trees judging distances between branch and branch occasionally climbing up a trunk and taking a trial leap from one tree to another till he came to the open ground which he studied very carefully for an hour then he turned picked up wontollas trail where he had left it settled himself in a tree with an outrunning branch some eight feet from the ground and sat still sharpening his knife on the sole of his foot and singing to himself  a little before midday when the sun was very warm he heard the patter of feet and smelt the abominable smell of the dholepack as they trotted pitilessly along wontollas trail seen from above the red dhole does not look half the size of a wolf but mowgli knew how strong his feet and jaws were he watched the sharp bay head of the leader snuffing along the trail and gave him good hunting  the brute looked up and his companions halted behind him scores and scores of red dogs with lowhung tails heavy shoulders weak quarters and bloody mouths the dholes are a very silent people as a rule and they have no manners even in their own jungle fully two hundred must have gathered below him but he could see that the leaders sniffed hungrily on wontollas trail and tried to drag the pack forward that would never do or they would be at the lairs in broad daylight and mowgli meant to hold them under his tree till dusk  by whose leave do ye come here said mowgli  all jungles are our jungle was the reply and the dhole that gave it bared his white teeth mowgli looked down with a smile and imitated perfectly the sharp chitterchatter of chikai the leaping rat of the dekkan meaning the dholes to understand that he considered them no better than chikai the pack closed up round the treetrunk and the leader bayed savagely calling mowgli a treeape for an answer mowgli stretched down one naked leg and wriggled his bare toes just above the leaders head that was enough and more than enough to wake the pack to stupid rage those who have hair between their toes do not care to be reminded of it mowgli caught his foot away as the leader leaped up and said sweetly dog red dog go back to the dekkan and eat lizards go to chikai thy brotherdog dogred red dog there is hair between every toe he twiddled his toes a second time  come down ere we starve thee out hairless ape yelled the pack and this was exactly what mowgli wanted he laid himself down along the branch his cheek to the bark his right arm free and there he told the pack what he thought and knew about them their manners their customs their mates and their puppies there is no speech in the world so rancorous and so stinging as the language the jungle people use to show scorn and contempt when you come to think of it you will see how this must be so as mowgli told kaa he had many little thorns under his tongue and slowly and deliberately he drove the dholes from silence to growls from growls to yells and from yells to hoarse slavery ravings they tried to answer his taunts but a cub might as well have tried to answer kaa in a rage and all the while mowglis right hand lay crooked at his side ready for action his feet locked round the branch the big bay leader had leaped many times in the air but mowgli dared not risk a false blow at last made furious beyond his natural strength he bounded up seven or eight feet clear of the ground then mowglis hand shot out like the head of a treesnake and gripped him by the scruff of his neck and the branch shook with the jar as his weight fell back almost wrenching mowgli to the ground but he never loosed his grip and inch by inch he hauled the beast hanging like a drowned jackal up on the branch with his left hand he reached for his knife and cut off the red bushy tail flinging the dhole back to earth again that was all he needed the pack would not go forward on wontollas trail now till they had killed mowgli or mowgli had killed them he saw them settle down in circles with a quiver of the haunches that meant they were going to stay and so he climbed to a higher crotch settled his back comfortably and went to sleep  after three or four hours he waked and counted the pack they were all there silent husky and dry with eyes of steel the sun was beginning to sink in half an hour the little people of the rocks would be ending their labours and as you know the dhole does not fight best in the twilight  i did not need such faithful watchers he said politely standing up on a branch but i will remember this ye be true dholes but to my thinking over much of one kind for that reason i do not give the big lizardeater his tail again art thou not pleased red dog  i myself will tear out thy stomach yelled the leader scratching at the foot of the tree  nay but consider wise rat of the dekkan there will now be many litters of little tailless red dogs yea with raw red stumps that sting when the sand is hot go home red dog and cry that an ape has done this ye will not go come then with me and i will make you very wise  he moved bandarlog fashion into the next tree and so on into the next and the next the pack following with lifted hungry heads now and then he would pretend to fall and the pack would tumble one over the other in their haste to be at the death it was a curious sightthe boy with the knife that shone in the low sunlight as it sifted through the upper branches and the silent pack with their red coats all aflame huddling and following below when he came to the last tree he took the garlic and rubbed himself all over carefully and the dholes yelled with scorn ape with a wolfs tongue dost thou think to cover thy scent they said we follow to the death  take thy tail said mowgli flinging it back along the course he had taken the pack instinctively rushed after it and follow nowto the death  he had slipped down the treetrunk and headed like the wind in bare feet for the bee rocks before the dholes saw what he would do  they gave one deep howl and settled down to the long lobbing canter that can at the last run down anything that runs mowgli knew their packpace to be much slower than that of the wolves or he would never have risked a twomile run in full sight they were sure that the boy was theirs at last and he was sure that he held them to play with as he pleased all his trouble was to keep them sufficiently hot behind him to prevent their turning off too soon he ran cleanly evenly and springily the tailless leader not five yards behind him and the pack tailing out over perhaps a quarter of a mile of ground crazy and blind with the rage of slaughter so he kept his distance by ear reserving his last effort for the rush across the bee rocks  the little people had gone to sleep in the early twilight for it was not the season of late blossoming flowers but as mowglis first footfalls rang hollow on the hollow ground he heard a sound as though all the earth were humming then he ran as he had never run in his life before spurned aside onetwothree of the piles of stones into the dark sweetsmelling gullies heard a roar like the roar of the sea in a cave saw with the tail of his eye the air grow dark behind him saw the current of the waingunga far below and a flat diamondshaped head in the water leaped outward with all his strength the tailless dhole snapping at his shoulder in midair and dropped feet first to the safety of the river breathless and triumphant there was not a sting upon him for the smell of the garlic had checked the little people for just the few seconds that he was among them when he rose kaas coils were steadying him and things were bounding over the edge of the cliffgreat lumps it seemed of clustered bees falling like plummets but before any lump touched water the bees flew upward and the body of a dhole whirled downstream overhead they could hear furious short yells that were drowned in a roar like breakersthe roar of the wings of the little people of the rocks some of the dholes too had fallen into the gullies that communicated with the underground caves and there choked and fought and snapped among the tumbled honeycombs and at last borne up even when they were dead on the heaving waves of bees beneath them shot out of some hole in the riverface to roll over on the black rubbishheaps there were dholes who had leaped short into the trees on the cliffs and the bees blotted out their shapes but the greater number of them maddened by the stings had flung themselves into the river and as kaa said the waingunga was hungry water  kaa held mowgli fast till the boy had recovered his breath  we may not stay here he said the little people are roused indeed come  swimming low and diving as often as he could mowgli went down the river knife in hand  slowly slowly said kaa one tooth does not kill a hundred unless it be a cobras and many of the dholes took water swiftly when they saw the little people rise  the more work for my knife then phai how the little people follow mowgli sank again the face of the water was blanketed with wild bees buzzing sullenly and stinging all they found  nothing was ever yet lost by silence said kaano sting could penetrate his scalesand thou hast all the long night for the hunting hear them howl  nearly half the pack had seen the trap their fellows rushed into and turning sharp aside had flung themselves into the water where the gorge broke down in steep banks their cries of rage and their threats against the treeape who had brought them to their shame mixed with the yells and growls of those who had been punished by the little people to remain ashore was death and every dhole knew it their pack was swept along the current down to the deep eddies of the peace pool but even there the angry little people followed and forced them to the water again mowgli could hear the voice of the tailless leader bidding his people hold on and kill out every wolf in seeonee but he did not waste his time in listening  one kills in the dark behind us snapped a dhole here is tainted water  mowgli had dived forward like an otter twitched a struggling dhole under water before he could open his mouth and dark rings rose as the body plopped up turning on its side the dholes tried to turn but the current prevented them and the little people darted at the heads and ears and they could hear the challenge of the seeonee pack growing louder and deeper in the gathering darkness again mowgli dived and again a dhole went under and rose dead and again the clamour broke out at the rear of the pack some howling that it was best to go ashore others calling on their leader to lead them back to the dekkan and others bidding mowgli show himself and be killed  they come to the fight with two stomachs and several voices said kaa the rest is with thy brethren below yonder the little people go back to sleep they have chased us far now i too turn back for i am not of one skin with any wolf good hunting little brother and remember the dhole bites low  a wolf came running along the bank on three legs leaping up and down laying his head sideways close to the ground hunching his back and breaking high into the air as though he were playing with his cubs it was wontolla the outlier and he said never a word but continued his horrible sport beside the dholes they had been long in the water now and were swimming wearily their coats drenched and heavy their bushy tails dragging like sponges so tired and shaken that they too were silent watching the pair of blazing eyes that moved abreast  this is no good hunting said one panting  good hunting said mowgli as he rose boldly at the brutes side and sent the long knife home behind the shoulder pushing hard to avoid his dying snap  art thou there mancub said wontolla across the water  ask of the dead outlier mowgli replied have none come downstream i have filled these dogs mouths with dirt i have tricked them in the broad daylight and their leader lacks his tail but here be some few for thee still whither shall i drive them  i will wait said wontolla the night is before me  nearer and nearer came the bay of the seeonee wolves for the pack for the full pack it is met and a bend in the river drove the dholes forward among the sands and shoals opposite the lairs  then they saw their mistake they should have landed half a mile higher up and rushed the wolves on dry ground now it was too late the bank was lined with burning eyes and except for the horrible pheeal that had never stopped since sundown there was no sound in the jungle it seemed as though wontolla were fawning on them to come ashore and turn and take hold said the leader of the dholes the entire pack flung themselves at the shore threshing and squattering through the shoal water till the face of the waingunga was all white and torn and the great ripples went from side to side like bowwaves from a boat mowgli followed the rush stabbing and slicing as the dholes huddled together rushed up the riverbeach in one wave  then the long fight began heaving and straining and splitting and scattering and narrowing and broadening along the red wet sands and over and between the tangled treeroots and through and among the bushes and in and out of the grass clumps for even now the dholes were two to one but they met wolves fighting for all that made the pack and not only the short high deepchested whitetusked hunters of the pack but the anxiouseyed lahinisthe shewolves of the lair as the saying isfighting for their litters with here and there a yearling wolf his first coat still half woolly tugging and grappling by their sides a wolf you must know flies at the throat or snaps at the flank while a dhole by preference bites at the belly so when the dholes were struggling out of the water and had to raise their heads the odds were with the wolves on dry land the wolves suffered but in the water or ashore mowglis knife came and went without ceasing the four had worried their way to his side gray brother crouched between the boys knees was protecting his stomach while the others guarded his back and either side or stood over him when the shock of a leaping yelling dhole who had thrown himself full on the steady blade bore him down for the rest it was one tangled confusiona locked and swaying mob that moved from right to left and from left to right along the bank and also ground round and round slowly on its own centre here would be a heaving mound like a waterblister in a whirlpool which would break like a waterblister and throw up four or five mangled dogs each striving to get back to the centre here would be a single wolf borne down by two or three dholes laboriously dragging them forward and sinking the while here a yearling cub would be held up by the pressure round him though he had been killed early while his mother crazed with dumb rage rolled over and over snapping and passing on and in the middle of the thickest press perhaps one wolf and one dhole forgetting everything else would be manoeuvring for first hold till they were whirled away by a rush of furious fighters once mowgli passed akela a dhole on either flank and his all but toothless jaws closed over the loins of a third and once he saw phao his teeth set in the throat of a dhole tugging the unwilling beast forward till the yearlings could finish him but the bulk of the fight was blind flurry and smother in the dark hit trip and tumble yelp groan and worryworryworry round him and behind him and above him as the night wore on the quick giddygoround motion increased the dholes were cowed and afraid to attack the stronger wolves but did not yet dare to run away mowgli felt that the end was coming soon and contented himself with striking merely to cripple the yearlings were growing bolder there was time now and again to breathe and pass a word to a friend and the mere flicker of the knife would sometimes turn a dog aside  the meat is very near the bone gray brother yelled he was bleeding from a score of fleshwounds  but the bone is yet to be cracked said mowgli eowawa thus do we do in the jungle the red blade ran like a flame along the side of a dhole whose hindquarters were hidden by the weight of a clinging wolf  my kill snorted the wolf through his wrinkled nostrils leave him to me  is thy stomach still empty outlier said mowgli wontolla was fearfully punished but his grip had paralysed the dhole who could not turn round and reach him  by the bull that bought me said mowgli with a bitter laugh it is the tailless one and indeed it was the big baycoloured leader  it is not wise to kill cubs and lahinis mowgli went on philosophically wiping the blood out of his eyes unless one has also killed the outlier and it is in my stomach that this wontolla kills thee  a dhole leaped to his leaders aid but before his teeth had found wontollas flank mowglis knife was in his throat and gray brother took what was left  and thus do we do in the jungle said mowgli  wontolla said not a word only his jaws were closing and closing on the backbone as his life ebbed the dhole shuddered his head dropped and he lay still and wontolla dropped above him  huh the blood debt is paid said mowgli sing the song wontolla  he hunts no more said gray brother and akela too is silent this long time  the bone is cracked thundered phao son of phaona they go kill kill out o hunters of the free people  dhole after dhole was slinking away from those dark and bloody sands to the river to the thick jungle upstream or downstream as he saw the road clear  the debt the debt shouted mowgli pay the debt they have slain the lone wolf let not a dog go  he was flying to the river knife in hand to check any dhole who dared to take water when from under a mound of nine dead rose akelas head and forequarters and mowgli dropped on his knees beside the lone wolf  said i not it would be my last fight akela gasped it is good hunting and thou little brother  i live having killed many  even so i die and i wouldi would die by thee little brother  mowgli took the terrible scarred head on his knees and put his arms round the torn neck  it is long since the old days of shere khan and a mancub that rolled naked in the dust  nay nay i am a wolf i am of one skin with the free people mowgli cried it is no will of mine that i am a man  thou art a man little brother wolfling of my watching thou art a man or else the pack had fled before the dhole my life i owe to thee and today thou hast saved the pack even as once i saved thee hast thou forgotten all debts are paid now go to thine own people i tell thee again eye of my eye this hunting is ended go to thine own people  i will never go i will hunt alone in the jungle i have said it  after the summer come the rains and after the rains comes the spring go back before thou art driven  who will drive me  mowgli will drive mowgli go back to thy people go to man  when mowgli drives mowgli i will go mowgli answered  there is no more to say said akela little brother canst thou raise me to my feet i also was a leader of the free people  very carefully and gently mowgli lifted the bodies aside and raised akela to his feet both arms round him and the lone wolf drew a long breath and began the death song that a leader of the pack should sing when he dies it gathered strength as he went on lifting and lifting and ringing far across the river till it came to the last good hunting and akela shook himself clear of mowgli for an instant and leaping into the air fell backward dead upon his last and most terrible kill  mowgli sat with his head on his knees careless of anything else while the remnant of the flying dholes were being overtaken and run down by the merciless lahinis little by little the cries died away and the wolves returned limping as their wounds stiffened to take stock of the losses fifteen of the pack as well as half a dozen lahinis lay dead by the river and of the others not one was unmarked and mowgli sat through it all till the cold daybreak when phaos wet red muzzle was dropped in his hand and mowgli drew back to show the gaunt body of akela  good hunting said phao as though akela were still alive and then over his bitten shoulder to the others howl dogs a wolf has died tonight  but of all the pack of two hundred fighting dholes whose boast was that all jungles were their jungle and that no living thing could stand before them not one returned to the dekkan to carry that word     chils song  this is the song that chil sang as the kites dropped down one after another to the riverbed when the great fight was finished chil is good friends with everybody but he is a coldblooded kind of creature at heart because he knows that almost everybody in the jungle comes to him in the longrun       these were my companions going forth by night            for chil look you for chil      now come i to whistle them the ending of the fight            chil vanguards of chil      word they gave me

away      hear now and judge o ye people of the jungle        answer who shall turn himwho shall stay       man goes to man he is weeping in the jungle        he that was our brother sorrows sore      man goes to man oh we loved him in the jungle        to the mantrail where we may not follow more  the second year after the great fight with red dog and the death of akela mowgli must have been nearly seventeen years old he looked older for hard exercise the best of good eating and baths whenever he felt in the least hot or dusty had given him strength and growth far beyond his age he could swing by one hand from a top branch for half an hour at a time when he had occasion to look along the treeroads he could stop a young buck in midgallop and throw him sideways by the head he could even jerk over the big blue wild boars that lived in the marshes of the north the jungle people who used to fear him for his wits feared him now for his strength and when he moved quietly on his own affairs the mere whisper of his coming cleared the woodpaths and yet the look in his eyes was always gentle even when he fought his eyes never blazed as bagheeras did they only grew more and more interested and excited and that was one of the things that bagheera himself did not understand  he asked mowgli about it and the boy laughed and said when i miss the kill i am angry when i must go empty for two days i am very angry do not my eyes talk then  the mouth is hungry said bagheera but the eyes say nothing hunting eating or swimming it is all onelike a stone in wet or dry weather mowgli looked at him lazily from under his long eyelashes and as usual the panthers head dropped bagheera knew his master  they were lying out far up the side of a hill overlooking the waingunga and the morning mists hung below them in bands of white and green as the sun rose it changed into bubbling seas of red gold churned off and let the low rays stripe the dried grass on which mowgli and bagheera were resting it was the end of the cold weather the leaves and the trees looked worn and faded and there was a dry ticking rustle everywhere when the wind blew a little leaf taptaptapped furiously against a twig as a single leaf caught in a current will it roused bagheera for he snuffed the morning air with a deep hollow cough threw himself on his back and struck with his forepaws at the nodding leaf above  the year turns he said the jungle goes forward the time of new talk is near that leaf knows it is very good  the grass is dry mowgli answered pulling up a tuft even eyeofthespring that is a little trumpetshaped waxy red flower that runs in and out among the grasseseven eyeofthe spring is shut and bagheera is it well for the black panther so to lie on his back and beat with his paws in the air as though he were the treecat  aowh said bagheera he seemed to be thinking of other things  i say is it well for the black panther so to mouth and cough and howl and roll remember we be the masters of the jungle thou and i  indeed yes i hear mancub bagheera rolled over hurriedly and sat up the dust on his ragged black flanks he was just casting his winter coat we be surely the masters of the jungle who is so strong as mowgli who so wise there was a curious drawl in the voice that made mowgli turn to see whether by any chance the black panther were making fun of him for the jungle is full of words that sound like one thing but mean another i said we be beyond question the masters of the jungle bagheera repeated have i done wrong i did not know that the mancub no longer lay upon the ground does he fly then  mowgli sat with his elbows on his knees looking out across the valley at the daylight somewhere down in the woods below a bird was trying over in a husky reedy voice the first few notes of his spring song it was no more than a shadow of the liquid tumbling call he would be pouring later but bagheera heard it  i said the time of new talk is near growled the panther switching his tail  i hear mowgli answered bagheera why dost thou shake all over the sun is warm  that is ferao the scarlet woodpecker said bagheera he has not forgotten now i too must remember my song and he began purring and crooning to himself harking back dissatisfied again and again  there is no game afoot said mowgli  little brother are both thine ears stopped that is no killingword but my song that i make ready against the need  i had forgotten i shall know when the time of new talk is here because then thou and the others all run away and leave me alone mowgli spoke rather savagely  but indeed little brother bagheera began we do not always  i say ye do said mowgli shooting out his forefinger angrily ye do run away and i who am the master of the jungle must needs walk alone how was it last season when i would gather sugarcane from the fields of a manpack i sent a runneri sent theeto hathi bidding him to come upon such a night and pluck the sweet grass for me with his trunk  he came only two nights later said bagheera cowering a little and of that long sweet grass that pleased thee so he gathered more than any mancub could eat in all the nights of the rains that was no fault of mine  he did not come upon the night when i sent him the word no he was trumpeting and running and roaring through the valleys in the moonlight his trail was like the trail of three elephants for he would not hide among the trees he danced in the moonlight before the houses of the manpack i saw him and yet he would not come to me and i am the master of the jungle  it was the time of new talk said the panther always very humble perhaps little brother thou didst not that time call him by a masterword listen to ferao and be glad  mowglis bad temper seemed to have boiled itself away he lay back with his head on his arms his eyes shut i do not knownor do i care he said sleepily let us sleep bagheera my stomach is heavy in me make me a rest for my head  the panther lay down again with a sigh because he could hear ferao practising and repractising his song against the springtime of new talk as they say  in an indian jungle the seasons slide one into the other almost without division there seem to be only twothe wet and the dry but if you look closely below the torrents of rain and the clouds of char and dust you will find all four going round in their regular ring spring is the most wonderful because she has not to cover a clean bare field with new leaves and flowers but to drive before her and to put away the hangingon oversurviving raffle of halfgreen things which the gentle winter has suffered to live and to make the partlydressed stale earth feel new and young once more and this she does so well that there is no spring in the world like the jungle spring  there is one day when all things are tired and the very smells as they drift on the heavy air are old and used one cannot explain this but it feels so then there is another dayto the eye nothing whatever has changedwhen all the smells are new and delightful and the whiskers of the jungle people quiver to their roots and the winter hair comes away from their sides in long draggled locks then perhaps a little rain falls and all the trees and the bushes and the bamboos and the mosses and the juicyleaved plants wake with a noise of growing that you can almost hear and under this noise runs day and night a deep hum that is the noise of the springa vibrating boom which is neither bees nor falling water nor the wind in treetops but the purring of the warm happy world  up to this year mowgli had always delighted in the turn of the seasons it was he who generally saw the first eyeofthespring deep down among the grasses and the first bank of spring clouds which are like nothing else in the jungle his voice could be heard in all sorts of wet starlighted blossoming places helping the big frogs through their choruses or mocking the little upsidedown owls that hoot through the white nights like all his people spring was the season he chose for his flittingsmoving for the mere joy of rushing through the warm air thirty forty or fifty miles between twilight and the morning star and coming back panting and laughing and wreathed with strange flowers the four did not follow him on these wild ringings of the jungle but went off to sing songs with other wolves the jungle people are very busy in the spring and mowgli could hear them grunting and screaming and whistling according to their kind their voices then are different from their voices at other times of the year and that is one of the reasons why spring in the jungle is called the time of new talk  but that spring as he told bagheera his stomach was changed in him ever since the bamboo shoots turned spottybrown he had been looking forward to the morning when the smells should change but when the morning came and mor the peacock blazing in bronze and blue and gold cried it aloud all along the misty woods and mowgli opened his mouth to send on the cry the words choked between his teeth and a feeling came over him that began at his toes and ended in his haira feeling of pure unhappiness so that he looked himself over to be sure that he had not trod on a thorn mor cried the new smells the other birds took it over and from the rocks by the waingunga he heard bagheeras hoarse screamsomething between the scream of an eagle and the neighing of a horse there was a yelling and scattering of bandarlog in the newbudding branches above and there stood mowgli his chest filled to answer mor sinking in little gasps as the breath was driven out of it by this unhappiness  he stared all round him but he could see no more than the mocking bandarlog scudding through the trees and mor his tail spread in full splendour dancing on the slopes below  the smells have changed screamed mor good hunting little brother where is thy answer  little brother good hunting whistled chil the kite and his mate swooping down together the two baffed under mowglis nose so close that a pinch of downy white feathers brushed away  a light spring rainelephantrain they call itdrove across the jungle in a belt half a mile wide left the new leaves wet and nodding behind and died out in a double rainbow and a light roll of thunder the spring hum broke out for a minute and was silent but all the jungle folk seemed to be giving tongue at once all except mowgli  i have eaten good food he said to himself i have drunk good water nor does my throat burn and grow small as it did when i bit the bluespotted root that oo the turtle said was clean food but my stomach is heavy and i have given very bad talk to bagheera and others people of the jungle and my people now too i am hot and now i am cold and now i am neither hot nor cold but angry with that which i cannot see huhu it is time to make a running tonight i will cross the ranges yes i will make a spring running to the marshes of the north and back again i have hunted too easily too long the four shall come with me for they grow as fat as white grubs  he called but never one of the four answered they were far beyond earshot singing over the spring songsthe moon and sambhur songswith the wolves of the pack for in the springtime the jungle people make very little difference between the day and the night he gave the sharp barking note but his only answer was the mocking maiou of the little spotted treecat winding in and out among the branches for early birds nests at this he shook all over with rage and half drew his knife then he became very haughty though there was no one to see him and stalked severely down the hillside chin up and eyebrows down but never a single one of his people asked him a question for they were all too busy with their own affairs  yes said mowgli to himself though in his heart he knew that he had no reason let the red dhole come from the dekkan or the red flower dance among the bamboos and all the jungle runs whining to mowgli calling him great elephantnames but now because eyeofthespring is red and mor forsooth must show his naked legs in some spring dance the jungle goes mad as tabaqui by the bull that bought me am i the master of the jungle or am i not be silent what do ye here  a couple of young wolves of the pack were cantering down a path looking for open ground in which to fight you will remember that the law of the jungle forbids fighting where the pack can see their neckbristles were as stiff as wire and they bayed furiously crouching for the first grapple mowgli leaped forward caught one outstretched throat in either hand expecting to fling the creatures backward as he had often done in games or pack hunts but he had never before interfered with a spring fight the two leaped forward and dashed him aside and without word to waste rolled over and over close locked  mowgli was on his feet almost before he fell his knife and his white teeth were bared and at that minute he would have killed both for no reason but that they were fighting when he wished them to be quiet although every wolf has full right under the law to fight he danced round them with lowered shoulders and quivering hand ready to send in a double blow when the first flurry of the scuffle should be over but while he waited the strength seemed to ebb from his body the knifepoint lowered and he sheathed the knife and watched  i have surely eaten poison he sighed at last since i broke up the council with the red flowersince i killed shere khannone of the pack could fling me aside and these be only tailwolves in the pack little hunters my strength is gone from me and presently i shall die oh mowgli why dost thou not kill them both  the fight went on till one wolf ran away and mowgli was left alone on the torn and bloody ground looking now at his knife and now at his legs and arms while the feeling of unhappiness he had never known before covered him as water covers a log  he killed early that evening and ate but little so as to be in good fettle for his spring running and he ate alone because all the jungle people were away singing or fighting it was a perfect white night as they call it all green things seemed to have made a months growth since the morning the branch that was yellowleaved the day before dripped sap when mowgli broke it the mosses curled deep and warm over his feet the young grass had no cutting edges and all the voices of the jungle boomed like one deep harpstring touched by the moonthe moon of new talk who splashed her light full on rock and pool slipped it between trunk and creeper and sifted it through a million leaves forgetting his unhappiness mowgli sang aloud with pure delight as he settled into his stride it was more like flying than anything else for he had chosen the long downward slope that leads to the northern marshes through the heart of the main jungle where the springy ground deadened the fall of his feet a mantaught man would have picked his way with many stumbles through the cheating moonlight but mowglis muscles trained by years of experience bore him up as though he were a feather when a rotten log or a hidden stone turned under his foot he saved himself never checking his pace without effort and without thought when he tired of groundgoing he threw up his hands monkeyfashion to the nearest creeper and seemed to float rather than to climb up into the thin branches whence he would follow a treeroad till his mood changed and he shot downward in a long leafy curve to the levels again there were still hot hollows surrounded by wet rocks where he could hardly breathe for the heavy scents of the night flowers and the bloom along the creeper buds dark avenues where the moonlight lay in belts as regular as checkered marbles in a church aisle thickets where the wet young growth stood breasthigh about him and threw its arms round his waist and hilltops crowned with broken rock where he leaped from stone to stone above the lairs of the frightened little foxes he would hear very faint and far off the chugdrug of a boar sharpening his tusks on a bole and would come across the great gray brute all alone scribing and rending the bark of a tall tree his mouth dripping with foam and his eyes blazing like fire or he would turn aside to the sound of clashing horns and hissing grunts and dash past a couple of furious sambhur staggering to and fro with lowered heads striped with blood that showed black in the moonlight or at some rushing ford he would hear jacala the crocodile bellowing like a bull or disturb a twined knot of the poison people but before they could strike he would be away and across the glistening shingle and deep in the jungle again  so he ran sometimes shouting sometimes singing to himself the happiest thing in all the jungle that night till the smell of the flowers warned him that he was near the marshes and those lay far beyond his farthest huntinggrounds  here again a mantrained man would have sunk overhead in three strides but mowglis feet had eyes in them and they passed him from tussock to tussock and clump to quaking clump without asking help from the eyes in his head he ran out to the middle of the swamp disturbing the duck as he ran and sat down on a mosscoated treetrunk lapped in the black water the marsh was awake all round him for in the spring the bird people sleep very lightly and companies of them were coming or going the night through but no one took any notice of mowgli sitting among the tall reeds humming songs without words and looking at the soles of his hard brown feet in case of neglected thorns all his unhappiness seemed to have been left behind in his own jungle and he was just beginning a fullthroat song when it came back againten times worse than before  this time mowgli was frightened it is here also he said half aloud it has followed me and he looked over his shoulder to see whether the it were not standing behind him there is no one here the night noises of the marsh went on but never a bird or beast spoke to him and the new feeling of misery grew  i have surely eaten poison he said in an awestricken voice it must be that carelessly i have eaten poison and my strength is going from me i was afraidand yet it was not i that was afraidmowgli was afraid when the two wolves fought akela or even phao would have silenced them yet mowgli was afraid that is true sign i have eaten poison but what do they care in the jungle they sing and howl and fight and run in companies under the moon and ihaimaii am dying in the marshes of that poison which i have eaten he was so sorry for himself that he nearly wept and after he went on they will find me lying in the black water nay i will go back to my own jungle and i will die upon the council rock and bagheera whom i love if he is not screaming in the valleybagheera perhaps may watch by what is left for a little lest chil use me as he used akela  a large warm tear splashed down on his knee and miserable as he was mowgli felt happy that he was so miserable if you can understand that upsidedown sort of happiness as chil the kite used akela he repeated on the night i saved the pack from red dog he was quiet for a little thinking of the last words of the lone wolf which you of course remember now akela said to me many foolish things before he died for when we die our stomachs change he said none the less i am of the jungle  in his excitement as he remembered the fight on waingunga bank he shouted the last words aloud and a wild buffalocow among the reeds sprang to her knees snorting man  uhh said mysa the wild buffalo mowgli could hear him turn in his wallow that is no man it is only the hairless wolf of the seeonee pack on such nights runs he to and fro  uhh said the cow dropping her head again to graze i thought it was man  i say no oh mowgli is it danger lowed mysa  oh mowgli is it danger the boy called back mockingly that is all mysa thinks for is it danger but for mowgli who goes to and fro in the jungle by night watching what do ye care  how loud he cries said the cow thus do they cry mysa answered contemptuously who having torn up the grass know not how to eat it  for less than this mowgli groaned to himself for less than this even last rains i had pricked mysa out of his wallow and ridden him through the swamp on a rush halter he stretched a hand to break one of the feathery reeds but drew it back with a sigh mysa went on steadily chewing the cud and the long grass ripped where the cow grazed i will not die here he said angrily mysa who is of one blood with jacala and the pig would see me let us go beyond the swamp and see what comes never have i run such a spring runninghot and cold together up mowgli  he could not resist the temptation of stealing across the reeds to mysa and pricking him with the point of his knife the great dripping bull broke out of his wallow like a shell exploding while mowgli laughed till he sat down  say now that the hairless wolf of the seeonee pack once herded thee mysa he called  wolf thou the bull snorted stamping in the mud all the jungle knows thou wast a herder of tame cattlesuch a mans brat as shouts in the dust by the crops yonder thou of the jungle what hunter would have crawled like a snake among the leeches and for a muddy jesta jackals jesthave shamed me before my cow come to firm ground and i willi will mysa frothed at the mouth for mysa has nearly the worst temper of any one in the jungle  mowgli watched him puff and blow with eyes that never changed when he could make himself heard through the pattering mud he said what manpack lair here by the marshes mysa this is new jungle to me  go north then roared the angry bull for mowgli had pricked him rather sharply it was a naked cowherds jest go and tell them at the village at the foot of the marsh  the manpack do not love jungletales nor do i think mysa that a scratch more or less on thy hide is any matter for a council but i will go and look at this village yes i will go softly now it is not every night that the master of the jungle comes to herd thee  he stepped out to the shivering ground on the edge of the marsh well knowing that mysa would never charge over it and laughed as he ran to think of the bulls anger  my strength is not altogether gone he said it may be that the poison is not to the bone there is a star sitting low yonder he looked at it between his halfshut hands by the bull that bought me it is the red flowerthe red flower that i lay beside beforebefore i came even to the first seeonee pack now that i have seen i will finish the running  the marsh ended in a broad plain where a light twinkled it was a long time since mowgli had concerned himself with the doings of men but this night the glimmer of the red flower drew him forward  i will look said he as i did in the old days and i will see how far the manpack has changed  forgetting that he was no longer in his own jungle where he could do what he pleased he trod carelessly through the dewloaded grasses till he came to the hut where the light stood three or four yelping dogs gave tongue for he was on the outskirts of a village  ho said mowgli sitting down noiselessly after sending back a deep wolfgrowl that silenced the curs what comes will come mowgli what hast thou to do any more with the lairs of the manpack he rubbed his mouth remembering where a stone had struck it years ago when the other manpack had cast him out  the door of the hut opened and a woman stood peering out into the darkness a child cried and the woman said over her shoulder sleep it was but a jackal that waked the dogs in a little time morning comes  mowgli in the grass began to shake as though he had fever he knew that voice well but to make sure he cried softly surprised to find how mans talk came back messua o messua  who calls said the woman a quiver in her voice  hast thou forgotten said mowgli his throat was dry as he spoke  if it be thou what name did i give thee say she had half shut the door and her hand was clutching at her breast  nathoo ohe nathoo said mowgli for as you remember that was the name messua gave him when he first came to the manpack  come my son she called and mowgli stepped into the light and looked full at messua the woman who had been good to him and whose life he had saved from the manpack so long before she was older and her hair was gray but her eyes and her voice had not changed womanlike she expected to find mowgli where she had left him and her eyes travelled upward in a puzzled way from his chest to his head that touched the top of the door  my son she stammered and then sinking to his feet but it is no longer my son it is a godling of the woods ahai  as he stood in the red light of the oillamp strong tall and beautiful his long black hair sweeping over his shoulders the knife swinging at his neck and his head crowned with a wreath of white jasmine he might easily have been mistaken for some wild god of a jungle legend the child half asleep on a cot sprang up and shrieked aloud with terror messua turned to soothe him while mowgli stood still looking in at the waterjars and the cookingpots the grainbin and all the other human belongings that he found himself remembering so well  what wilt thou eat or drink messua murmured this is all thine we owe our lives to thee but art thou him i called nathoo or a godling indeed  i am nathoo said mowgli i am very far from my own place i saw this light and came hither i did not know thou wast here  after we came to khanhiwara messua said timidly the english would have helped us against those villagers that sought to burn us rememberest thou  indeed i have not forgotten  but when the english law was made ready we went to the village of those evil people and it was no more to be found  that also i remember said mowgli with a quiver of his nostril  my man therefore took service in the fields and at lastfor indeed he was a strong manwe held a little land here it is not so rich as the old village but we do not need muchwe two  where is he the man that dug in the dirt when he was afraid on that night  he is deada year  and he mowgli pointed to the child  my son that was born two rains ago if thou art a godling give him the favour of the jungle that he may be safe among thythy people as we were safe on that night  she lifted up the child who forgetting his fright reached out to play with the knife that hung on mowglis chest and mowgli put the little fingers aside very carefully  and if thou art nathoo whom the tiger carried away messua went on choking he is then thy younger brother give him an elder brothers blessing  haimai what do i know of the thing called a blessing i am neither a godling nor his brother ando mother mother my heart is heavy in me he shivered as he set down the child  like enough said messua bustling among the cookingpots this comes of running about the marshes by night beyond question the fever had soaked thee to the marrow mowgli smiled a little at the idea of anything in the jungle hurting him i will make a fire and thou shalt drink warm milk put away the jasmine wreath the smell is heavy in so small a place  mowgli sat down muttering with his face in his hands all manner of strange feelings that he had never felt before were running over him exactly as though he had been poisoned and he felt dizzy and a little sick he drank the warm milk in long gulps messua patting him on the shoulder from time to time not quite sure whether he were her son nathoo of the long ago days or some wonderful jungle being but glad to feel that he was at least flesh and blood  son she said at lasther eyes were full of pridehave any told thee that thou art beautiful beyond all men  hah said mowgli for naturally he had never heard anything of the kind messua laughed softly and happily the look in his face was enough for her  i am the first then it is right though it comes seldom that a mother should tell her son these good things thou art very beautiful never have i looked upon such a man  mowgli twisted his head and tried to see over his own hard shoulder and messua laughed again so long that mowgli not knowing why was forced to laugh with her and the child ran from one to the other laughing too  nay thou must not mock thy brother said messua catching him to her breast when thou art onehalf as fair we will marry thee to the youngest daughter of a king and thou shalt ride great elephants  mowgli could not understand one word in three of the talk here the warm milk was taking effect on him after his long run so he curled up and in a minute was deep asleep and messua put the hair back from his eyes threw a cloth over him and was happy junglefashion he slept out the rest of that night and all the next day for his instincts which never wholly slept warned him there was nothing to fear he waked at last with a bound that shook the hut for the cloth over his face made him dream of traps and there he stood his hand on his knife the sleep all heavy in his rolling eyes ready for any fight  messua laughed and set the evening meal before him there were only a few coarse cakes baked over the smoky fire some rice and a lump of sour preserved tamarindsjust enough to go on with till he could get to his evening kill the smell of the dew in the marshes made him hungry and restless he wanted to finish his spring running but the child insisted on sitting in his arms and messua would have it that his long blueblack hair must be combed out so she sang as she combed foolish little babysongs now calling mowgli her son and now begging him to give some of his jungle power to the child the hut door was closed but mowgli heard a sound he knew well and saw messuas jaw drop with horror as a great gray paw came under the bottom of the door and gray brother outside whined a muffled and penitent whine of anxiety and fear  out and wait ye would not come when i called said mowgli in jungletalk without turning his head and the great gray paw disappeared  do notdo not bring thythy servants with thee said messua iwe have always lived at peace with the jungle  it is peace said mowgli rising think of that night on the road to khanhiwara there were scores of such folk before thee and behind thee but i see that even in springtime the jungle people do not always forget mother i go  messua drew aside humblyhe was indeed a woodgod she thought but as his hand was on the door the mother in her made her throw her arms round mowglis neck again and again  come back she whispered son or no son come back for i love theelook he too grieves  the child was crying because the man with the shiny knife was going away  come back again messua repeated by night or by day this door is never shut to thee  mowglis throat worked as though the cords in it were being pulled and his voice seemed to be dragged from it as he answered i will surely come back  and now he said as he put by the head of the fawning wolf on the threshold i have a little cry against thee gray brother why came ye not all four when i called so long ago  so long ago it was but last night iwewere singing in the jungle the new songs for this is the time of new talk rememberest thou  truly truly  and as soon as the songs were sung gray brother went on earnestly i followed thy trail i ran from all the others and followed hotfoot but o little brother what hast thou done eating and sleeping with the manpack  if ye had come when i called this had never been said mowgli running much faster  and now what is to be said gray brother mowgli was going to answer when a girl in a white cloth came down some path that led from the outskirts of the village gray brother dropped out of sight at once and mowgli backed noiselessly into a field of highspringing crops he could almost have touched her with his hand when the warm green stalks closed before his face and he disappeared like a ghost the girl screamed for she thought she had seen a spirit and then she gave a deep sigh mowgli parted the stalks with his hands and watched her till she was out of sight  and now i do not know he said sighing in his turn why did ye not come when i called  we follow theewe follow thee gray brother mumbled licking at mowglis heel we follow thee always except in the time of the new talk  and would ye follow me to the manpack mowgli whispered  did i not follow thee on the night our old pack cast thee out who waked thee lying among the crops  ay but again  have i not followed thee tonight  ay but again and again and it may be again gray brother  gray brother was silent when he spoke he growled to himself the black one spoke truth  and he said  man goes to man at the last raksha our mother said  so also said akela on the night of red dog mowgli muttered  so also says kaa who is wiser than us all  what dost thou say gray brother  they cast thee out once with bad talk they cut thy mouth with stones they sent buldeo to slay thee they would have thrown thee into the red flower thou and not i hast said that they are evil and senseless thou and not ii follow my own peopledidst let in the jungle upon them thou and not i didst make song against them more bitter even than our song against red dog  i ask thee what thou sayest  they were talking as they ran gray brother cantered on a while without replying and then he saidbetween bound and bound as it weremancubmaster of the jungleson of raksha lairbrother to methough i forget for a little while in the spring thy trail is my trail thy lair is my lair thy kill is my kill and thy deathfight is my deathfight i speak for the three but what wilt thou say to the jungle  that is well thought between the sight and the kill it is not good to wait go before and cry them all to the council rock and i will tell them what is in my stomach but they may not comein the time of new talk they may forget me  hast thou then forgotten nothing snapped gray brother over his shoulder as he laid himself down to gallop and mowgli followed thinking  at any other season the news would have called all the jungle together with bristling necks but now they were busy hunting and fighting and killing and singing from one to another gray brother ran crying the master of the jungle goes back to man come to the council rock and the happy eager people only answered he will return in the summer heats the rains will drive him to lair run and sing with us gray brother  but the master of the jungle goes back to man gray brother would repeat  eeeyoawa is the time of new talk any less sweet for that they would reply so when mowgli heavyhearted came up through the wellremembered rocks to the place where he had been brought into the council he found only the four baloo who was nearly blind with age and the heavy coldblooded kaa coiled around akelas empty seat  thy trail ends here then manling said kaa as mowgli threw himself down his face in his hands cry thy cry we be of one blood thou and iman and snake together  why did i not die under red dog the boy moaned my strength is gone from me and it is not any poison by night and by day i hear a double step upon my trail when i turn my head it is as though one had hidden himself from me that instant i go to look behind the trees and he is not there i call and none cry again but it is as though one listened and kept back the answer i lie down but i do not rest i run the spring running but i am not made still i bathe but i am not made cool the kill sickens me but i have no heart to fight except i kill the red flower is in my body my bones are waterandi know not what i know  what need of talk said baloo slowly turning his head to where mowgli lay akela by the river said it that mowgli should drive mowgli back to the manpack i said it but who listens now to baloo bagheerawhere is bagheera this nighthe knows also it is the law  when we met at cold lairs manling i knew it said kaa turning a little in his mighty coils man goes to man at the last though the jungle does not cast him out  the four looked at one another and at mowgli puzzled but obedient  the jungle does not cast me out then mowgli stammered  gray brother and the three growled furiously beginning so long as we live none shall dare but baloo checked them  i taught thee the law it is for me to speak he said and though i cannot now see the rocks before me i see far little frog take thine own trail make thy lair with thine own blood and pack and people but when there is need of foot or tooth or eye or a word carried swiftly by night remember master of the jungle the jungle is thine at call  the middle jungle is thine also said kaa i speak for no small people  haimai my brothers cried mowgli throwing up his arms with a sob i know not what i know i would not go but i am drawn by both feet how shall i leave these nights  nay look up little brother baloo repeated there is no shame in this hunting when the honey is eaten we leave the empty hive  having cast the skin said kaa we may not creep into it afresh it is the law  listen dearest of all to me said baloo there is neither word nor will here to hold thee back look up who may question the master of the jungle i saw thee playing among the white pebbles yonder when thou wast a little frog and bagheera that bought thee for the price of a young bull newly killed saw thee also of that looking over we two only remain for raksha thy lairmother is dead with thy lairfather the old wolfpack is long since dead thou knowest whither shere khan went and akela died among the dholes where but for thy wisdom and strength the second seeonee pack would also have died there remains nothing but old bones it is no longer the mancub that asks leave of his pack but the master of the jungle that changes his trail who shall question man in his ways  but bagheera and the bull that bought me said mowgli i would not  his words were cut short by a roar and a crash in the thicket below and bagheera light strong and terrible as always stood before him  therefore he said stretching out a dripping right paw i did not come it was a long hunt but he lies dead in the bushes nowa bull in his second yearthe bull that frees thee little brother all debts are paid now for the rest my word is baloos word he licked mowglis foot remember bagheera loved thee he cried and bounded away at the foot of the hill he cried again long and loud good hunting on a new trail master of the jungle remember bagheera loved thee  thou hast heard said baloo there is no more go now but first come to me o wise little frog come to me  it is hard to cast the skin said kaa as mowgli sobbed and sobbed with his head on the blind bears side and his arms round his neck while baloo tried feebly to lick his feet  the stars are thin said gray brother snuffing at the dawn wind where shall we lair today for from now we follow new trails    and this is the last of the mowgli stories     the outsong  this is the song that mowgli heard behind him in the jungle till he came to messuas door again       baloo       for the sake of him who showed      one wise frog the jungleroad      keep the law the manpack make      for thy blind old baloos sake      clean or tainted hot or stale      hold it as it were the trail      through the day and through the night      questing neither left nor right      for the sake of him who loves      thee beyond all else that moves      when thy pack would make thee pain      say tabaqui sings again      when thy pack would work thee ill      say shere khan is yet to kill      when the knife is drawn to slay      keep the law and go thy way      root and
