prologizes   an epistle containing the strange medical experience of karshish the arab     physician   johannes agricola in meditation   pictor ignotus   fra lippo lippi   andrea del sarto   the bishop orders his tomb at saint praxeds church   bishop blougrams apology   cleon   rudel to the lady of tripoli   one word more   introduction  thirteen years after the publication in 1855 of the poems in two volumes entitled men and women browning reviewed his work and made an interesting reclassification of it  he separated the simpler pieces of a lyric or epic castsuch rhymed presentations of an emotional moment for example as mesmerism and a womans last word or the picturesque rhymed verse telling a story of an experience such as childe roland and the statue and the bustfrom their more complex companions which were almost altogether in blank verse and in general markedly personified a typical man in his environment a cleon or fra lippo a rudel or a blougram  these boldly sculptured figures he set apart from the others as the fit components of the more closely related group which ever since has constituted the division now known as men and women  possibly the poet took some pleasure in thus bringing to confusion those critics who beginning first to take any notice of his work after the issue of these volumes of 1855 discovered therein poems they praised chiefly by means of contrasting them with foregoing work they found unnoticeable and later work they declared inscrutable  their bland discrimination at any rate in favor of men and women became henceforth inapplicable since the poet not only cast out from the division they elected to honor the little lyrical pieces that caught their eye but also brought to the front from his earlier neglected work of the same kind as the monologues retained his johannes agricola of 1836 pictor ignotus of 1845 and rudel of 1842 later criticism moreover that even yet assumes to ring the old changes of discrimination against everything but men and women is made not merely inapplicable by this rearrangement but uninformed a meaningless echo of a borrowed opinion which has had the very ground from under it shifted  the selfcriticism of which this rearrangement gives a hint is more valuable  all the shorter poems accumulated up to this period various as they are in theme and metrical form are uniform in the fashioning of their contour and color as soon as this underlying uniformity of make is recognized it may be seen to be the coloring and relief belonging to any sort of poetic material whether ordinarily accounted dramatic material or not which is imaginatively externalized and made concrete this peculiarity of make browning early acknowledged in his estimate of his shorter poems as characteristic of his touch when he called his lyrics and romances dramatic he became consciously sensitive later to slight variations effected by his manipulation in shape and shade which it yet takes a little thought to discern even after his own redivision of his work has given the clew to his selfjudgments  not only events deeds and charactersthe usual subjectmatter moulded and irradiated by dramatic powerbut thoughts impressions experiences impulses no matter how spiritualized or complex or mobile are transfused with the enlivening light of his creative energy in his shorter poems perhaps the very path struck out through them by the poet in his redivision may be traced between the leaves silently closing together again behind him if it be noticed that among these poems there are some with footholds firmly rooted in the earth and others whose proper realm is air these have wings for alighting for flitting thither and hither or for pursuing some sudden rapt whirl of flight in heavens face at fancys bidding they are certainly not less original than those other solider earthfast poems but they are less unique being motived in transient fancy they are more akin to poems by other hands and could be classed more readily with them by any observer despite all differences as little poetic romances or as a species of lyric  they were probably first found praiseworthy not only because they were simpler but because being more like work already understood and approved adventurous criticism was needed to taste their quality the other longer poems in blank verse graver and more dignified yet even more vivid and far more lifeencompassing which bore the rounded impress of the living human being instead of the shadowy motion of the lively human fancythese are the birth of a process of imaginative brooding upon the development of man by means of individuality throughout the slow unceasing flow of human history browning evidently grew aware that whatever these poems of personality might prove to be worth to the world these were the ones deserving of a place apart under the early title of men and women which he thought especially suited to the more roundly modelled and distinctively colored exemplars of his peculiar faculty  in his next following collection under the similar descriptive title of dramatis personae he added to this class of work shaping in the mould of blank verse mainly used for men and women his personifications of the medium mr sludge the embryo theologian caliban the ripened mystical saint of a death in the desert while abt vogler the creative musician rabbi ben ezra the intuitional philosopher and the chastened adept in loving james lees wife although held within the embrace of their makers dramatic conception of them as persons of his stage were made to pour out their speech in rhyme as johannes agricola in the earlier volume uttered his creed and rudel his lovemessage as if the heat of their emotionmoved personality required such an outlet  some such general notion as this of the scope of this volume and of the design of the poet in the construction classification and orderly arrangement of so much of his briefer work as is here contained seems to be borne out upon a closer examination  on the threshold of this new poetic world of personality stands the poet of the poem significantly called transcendentalism who is speaking to another poet about the too easily obvious metaphorbare philosophy of his opus in twelve books  that the admonishing poet is stationed there at the very doorsill of the gallery of men and women is surely not accidental even if brownings habit of plotting his groups of poems symmetrically by opening with a prologuepoem sounding the right key and rounding the theme with an epilogue did not tend to prove it intentional it is an open secret that the last poem in men and women for instance is an epilogue of autobiographical interest gathering up the foregoing strains of his lyre for a few last chords in so intimate a way that the actual fall of the fingers may be felt the pausing smile seen as the performer turns towards the one who inspired one word more  the appropriateness of transcendentalism as a prologue need be no more of a secret than that of one word more as an epilogue although it is left to betray itself  other poets writing on the poet emerson for example and tennyson place the outright plain name of their thought at the head of their verses without any attempt to make their titles dress their parts and keep as thoroughly true to their roles as the poems themselves  but a complete impersonation of his thought in name and style as well as matter is characteristic of browning and his personified poets playing their parts together in transcendentalism combine to exhibit a little masque exemplifying their writers view of the poet as veritably as if he had named it specifically the poet  one poet shows the other and brings him visibly forward but even in such a morsel of dramatic workmanship as this fiftyone lines all told there is the complexity and involution of life itself and as ever in brownings monologues over the shoulder of the poet more obviously portrayed peers as livingly the face of the poet portraying him and this onethe admonishing poetis set there with his sudden rose as if to indicate with that symbol of poetic magic what kind of spell was sought to be exercised by their maker to conjure up in his house of song the figures that people its niches could a poem be imagined more cunningly devised to reveal a typical poetic personality and a typical theory of poetic method through its way of revealing another  what poet could have composed it but one who himself employed the dramatic method of causing the abstract to be realizable through the concrete image of it instead of the contrary mode of seeking to divest the objective of its concrete form in order to lay bare its abstract essence this opposite theory of the poetic function is precisely the boehme mode against which the veiled dramatic poet who is speaking in favor of the halberstadtian magic admonishes his brother while he himself in practical substantiation of his theory of poetics brings bodily in sight the boyface above the winged harp vivified and beautiful himself although his poem is but a shapeless mist  not directly then but indirectly as the dramatic poet ever reveals himself does the sophisticated face of the subtle poet of men and women appear as the source of power behind both of the poets of this poem prepossessing the reader of the verity and beauty of the theory of poetic art therein exemplified  such an interpretation of transcendentalism and such a conception of it as a key to the art of the volume it opens chimes in harmoniously with the note sounded in the next following poem how it strikes a contemporary  here again a typical poet is personified not however by means of his own poetic way of seeing but of the prosaic way in which he is seen by a contemporary the whole of course being poetically seen and presented by the overpoet browning himself and in such a manifold way that the reader is enabled to conceive as vividly of the talker and his mental atmosphere and social backgroundthe people and habitudes of the good old town of valladolidas of the betalkedof corregidor himself while by the totality of these concrete images an impression is conveyed of the dramatic mode of poetic expression which is far more convincing than any explicit theoretic statement of it could be because so humanly animated  artemis prologizes seems to have been selected to close this little opening sequence of poems on the poet because that fragment of a larger projected work could find place here almost as if it were a poets exercise in blank verse its smooth and spacious rhythm flawless and serene as the distant greek myth of the hero and the goddess it celebrates is in striking contrast with the rougher but brighter and more humanly colloquial blank verse of bishop blougrams apology for example or the stiff carefulness of the epistle of karshish  it might alone suffice by comparison with the metrical craftsmanship of the other poems of men and women to assure the observant reader that never was a good workman more baselessly accused of metrical carelessness than the poet who designedly varies his complicated verseeffects to suit every inner impulse belonging to his dramatic subject  a golden finish being in place in this statuesque hyperionlike monologue of artemis behold here it is and none the less perfect because not merely the outcome of the desire to produce a polished piece of poetic mechanism  browning perhaps linked his next poem the strange medical experience of karshish the arab physician with the calm prologizing of the hellenic goddess by association of the wise pharmacies of aesculapius with the inquisitive sagacity of karshish the notincurious in gods handiwork  by this ordering of the poems the reader may now enjoy at any rate the contrasts between three historic phases of wisdom in bodily ills the phase presented in the dependence of the old greek healer upon simple physical effects soothing with lavers the torn brow and laying the stripes and jagged ends of flesh even once more and the phases typified on the one side by the ingenious arab sire of the modern scientist whose patient correlation of facts and studious sceptical scrutiny of cause and effect are caught in the bud in the diagnosis transmitted by karshish to abib and on the other side by the nazarene physician whose inspired secret of summoning out of the believing soul of man the power to control his bodyso baffled and fascinated karshish drawing his attention in lazarus to just that connection of the known physical with the unknown psychical nature which is still mystically alluring the curiosity of investigators  from the childlike overidealizing mood of lazarus toward the god who had succored him inducing in him so fatalistic an indifference to human concerns there is but a step to the rapture of absolute theology expressed in the person of johannes agricola  such poems as these put before the cool gaze of the present century the very men of the elder day of religion their robes shine with an unearthly light and their abstracted eyes are hypnotized by the effulgence of their own haloes  yet the poet never fails to insinuate some naive foible in their personification a numbness of the heart or an archaism of soul which reveals the possessed one as but a human brother after all shaped by his environment and embodying the spirit of an historic epoch out of which the current of modern life is still streaming  the group of art poems which follows similarly presents a dramatic synthesis of the art of the renaissance as represented by three types of painters the religious devotion of the monastic painter whose ecstatic spirit breathes in pictor ignotus probably gives this poem its place adjoining agricola and lazarus  his artists hankering to create that beauty to bless the world with which his soul refrains from grossly satisfying unites the poem with the two following ones  in the first of these the realistic artist fra lippo is graphically pictured personally ushering in the high noon of the italian efflorescence in the second the gray of that day of art is silvering the selfpainted portrait of the prematurely frigid and facile formalist andrea del sarto  in pictor ignotus not only the personality of the often unknown and unnamed paintingbrother of the monasteries is made clear but also the nature of his beautiful cold art and the enslavement of both art and personality to ecclesiastical beliefs and ideals in fra lippo lippi not alone the figure of the frolicsome monk appears caught in his pleasureloving escapade amid that picturesque knot of alertwitted florentine guards ready to appreciate all the good points in his story of his life and the protection the arms of the church and the favor of the medici have afforded his genius but furthermore is illustrated the irresistible tendency of the artimpulse to expand beyond the bounds set for it either by laws of church or art itself and to find beauty wheresoever in life it chooses to turn the light of its gaze so also in andrea del sarto the easy cleverness of the unaspiring craftsman is not embodied apart from the abject relationship which made his very soul a bondslave to the gross mandates of the cousins whistle  yet in all three poems the biographic and historic conditions contributing toward the individualizing of each artist are so unobtrusively epitomized and vitally blended that while scarcely any item of specific study of the art and artists of the renaissance would be out of place in illustrating the essential truth of the portraiture and assisting in the better appreciation of the poem there is no detail of the workmanship which does not fall into the background as a mere accessory to the dominant figure through whose relationship to his art his station in the past is made clear  this sort of dramatic synthesis of a salient historical epoch is again strikingly disclosed in the following poem of the renaissance period the bishop orders his tomb at saint praxeds church  in this again the artconnoisseurship of the prelacy so important an element in the italian movement towards artexpression is revealed to the life in the beautyloving personality of the dying bishop  and by means also of his social ties with his nephews called closer than they wish about him now with her whom men would have to be their mother once with old gandolf whom he fancies leering at him from his onionstone tomb and with all those strong desires of the time for the delight of being envied for marble baths and horses and brown greek manuscripts and mistresses the seeds of human decay planted in the plot of time known as the central renaissance by the same lingering fleshliness and selfdestroying selfindulgence as was at home in pagan days are livingly exposed to the historic sense  is the modern prelate portrayed in bishop blougrams apology with all his bland subtlety complex culture and ripened perceptions distant as the nineteenth century from the sixteenth very different at bottom from his renaissance brother in respect to his native hankering for the pleasure of estimation above his fellows gigadibs is his gandolf whom he would craftily overtop  he is the one raised for the time above the commonalty by his criticism of the bishop to whom the prelate would fain show how little he was to be despised how far more honored and powerful he was among men  as for gigadibs it is to be noticed that browning quietly makes him do more than leer enviously at his complacent competitor from a tombtop  the sudden healthy vehemence that struck him and made him start to test his first plough in a new world and read his last chapter of st john to better purpose than towards selfglorification beyond his fellows is a parable of the more profitable life to be found in following the famous injunction of that chapter in johns gospel feed my sheep than in causing those sheep to motion one as the bishop would have his obsequious wethers of the flock motion him to the choice places of the sward  so as vivid a picture of the materialism and monopolizing of the present century sowing seeds of decay and selfdestruction in the movement of this age toward love of the truth of the beauty of genuineness in character and earnestness in aim is portrayed through the realistic personality of the great modern bishop in his easysmiling afterdinner talk with gigadibs the literary man as is presented of the central renaissance period in the companion picture of the bishop of saint praxeds  in cleon the man of composite art and culture the last ripe fruitage of greek development is personified and brought into contact at the moment of the dawn of christianity in europe with the ardent impulse the christian ideal of spiritual life supplied to human civilization how close the wise and broad greek culture came to being allsufficing capable of effecting almost enough of impetus for the aspiring progress of the world and yet how much it lacked a warmer element essential to be engrafted upon its lofty beauty the reader upon whose imaginative vision the personality of cleon rises can scarcely help but feel  the aesthetic and religious or philosophical interests vitally conceived and blended which link together so many of the main poems of men and women close with cleon  rudel the troubadour presenting in the selfabandonment of his offering of love to the lady of tripoli an impersonation of the chivalric love characteristic of the provencal life of the twelfth century intervenes appropriately last of all between the preceding poems and the epilogue which devotes heart and brain of the poet himself with the creatures of his hand to his moon of poets  as these poetic creations now stand they all seem upon examination to incarnate the fullbodied life of distinctive types of men centred amid their relations with other men within a specific social environment and fulfilling the possibilities for such unique dramatic syntheses as were revealed but partially or in embryo here and there among the other shorter poems of this period of the poets growth  in one important particular the rearrangement of the men and women group of poems made its title inappropriate  the graceful presence and lovelit eyes of the many women of the shorter lovepoems were withdrawn and artemis andrea del sartos wife the priors niecesaint lucy i would say as fra lippo explainsand perhaps the inspirer of rudels chivalry too the shadowy yet learned and queenly lady of tripoli alone were left to represent the women of the title  as for minor inexactitudes what does it matter that the advantage gained by nicely selecting the poems properly belonging together both in conception and artistic modelling was won at the cost of making the reference inaccurate in the opening lines of one word more to my fifty men and women naming me the fifty poems finishedor that the mention of roland in line 138 is no longer in place with karshish cleon lippo and andrea now that the fantastic story of childe rolands desperate loyalty is given closer companionship among the varied experiences narrated in the dramatic romances  while as for the mention of the norbert of in a balconywhich was originally included as but one item along with the other contents of men and womenthat miniature drama although it stands by itself now is still near enough at hand in the revised order to account for the allusion these are all triflesmere sins against literal accuracy but the discrepancy in the title occasioned by the absence of women is of more importance  it is of especial interest in calling attention to the fact that the creator of pompilia balaustion and the heroine of the inn albumall central figures whence radiate the life and spiritual energy of the work they ennoblehad at this period created no typical figures of women in any degree corresponding to those of his men  charlotte porter helen a clarke   transcendentalism a poem in twelve books  1855  stop

following the cherub at the top                      50 that points to god with his paired halfmoon wings   notes  transcendentalism is a criticism placed in the mouth of a poet of another poet whose manner of singing is prosaic because it seeks to transcend or penetrate beyond phenomena by divesting poetic expression of those concrete embodiments which enable it to appeal to the senses and imagination  instead of bare abstractions being suited to the developed mind it is the primitive mind which like boehmes has the merely metaphysical turn and expects to discover the unincarnate absolute essence of things the maturer mind craves the vitalizing method of the artist who like the magician of halberstadt recreates things bodily in all their beautiful vivid wholeness  yet the poet who sincerely holds so fragmentary a conception of art is himself a poem to the poet who holds the larger view  his boyface singing to god above his ineffective harpstrings is a concrete image of this sort of poetic transcendentalism  it is obvious that browning uses the halberstadt and not the boehme method in presenting this embodiment of his subject  the supposition of certain commentators that browning is here picturing his own artistic method as transcendental is a misconception of his characteristic theory of poetic art as shown here and elsewhere  22 boehme jacob an inspired german shoemaker 15751624 who wrote aurora the three principles etc mystical commentaries on biblical events  when twentyfive years old says hotham in mysterium magnum 1653 he was surrounded by a divine light and replenished with heavenly knowledge    going abroad into the fieldes to a greene before neysgate at gorlitz and viewing the herbes and grass of the fielde in his inward light he saw into their essences     and from that fountain of revelation wrote de signatura rerum on the signatures of things the tough book to which browning refers  37 halberstadt johann semeca called teutonicus a canon of halberstadt in germany who was interested in the unchurchly study of mediaeval science and reputed to be a magician possessing the vegetable stone supposed to make plants grow at will having the same power over organic life that the philosophers stone of the alchemists had over minerals so that like albertus magnus another such mage of the middle ages he could cause flowers to spring up

the arab physician writing to abib his master upon meeting with lazarus after he has been raised from the dead  well versed in eastern medical lore he tries to explain the extraordinary phenomenon according to his knowledge  he attributes lazarus version of the miracle to mania induced by trance and the means used by the nazarene physician to awaken him and strengthens his view by describing the strange state of mind in which he finds lazaruslike a child with no appreciation of the relative values of things  through his renewal of life he had caught a glimpse of it from the infinite point of view and lives now only with the desire to please god  his sole active quality is a great love for all humanity his impatience manifests itself only at sin and ignorance and is quickly curbed  karshish not able to realize this new plane of vision in which had been revealed to lazarus the equal worth of all things in the divine plan is incapable of understanding lazarus but in spite of his attempt to make light of the case he is deeply impressed by the character of lazarus and has besides a hardly acknowledged desire to believe in this revelation told of by lazarus of god as love  professor corson says of this poem it may be said to polarize the idea so often presented in brownings poetry that doubt is a condition of the vitality of faith  17 snakestone a name given to any substance used as a remedy for snakebites for example some are of chalk some of animal charcoal and some of vegetable substances  28 vespasian neros general who marched against palestine in 66 and was

their prey in the open field or in divers lurkingplaces and are distinguished by this habit from the other great group known as the sedentary spiders because they sit or hang upon their webs and capture their prey by means of silken snares  the next line is not determinative of the species for there is a great number of spiders any one of which might be described as sprinkled with mottles on an ashgray back  we have a little saltigrade or jumping spider known as the zebra spider epiblemum scenicum which is found in europe and i believe also in syria  one often sees this species and its congeners upon the ledges of rocks the edges of tombstones the walls of buildings and like situations hunting their prey which they secure by jumping upon it  so common is the zebra spider that i might think that browning referred to it if i were not in doubt whether he would express the stripes of white upon its ashgray abdomen by the word mottles  however there arc other spiders belonging to the same tribe saltigrades that really are mottled  there are also spiders known as the lycosids or wolf spiders or ground spiders which are often of an ashgray color and marked with little whitish spots after the manner of brownings syrian species  perhaps the poet had one of these in mind at least he accurately describes their manner of seeking prey  the next line is an interrupted one take five and drop them    take five what  five of these ashgray mottled spiders  certainly  but what can be meant by the expression drop them  this opens up to us a strange chapter in human superstition  it was long a prevalent idea that the spider in various forms possessed some occult power of healing and men administered it internally or applied it externally as a cure for many diseases  pliny gives a number of such remedies  a certain spider applied in a piece of cloth or another one a white spider with very elongated thin legs beaten up in oil is said by this ancient writer upon natural history to form an ointment for the eyes  similarly the thick pulp of a spiders body mixed with the oil of roses is used for the ears  sir matthew lister who was indeed the father of english

richard garnett says browning commits an oversight it seems to me in making lazarus fifty years of age at the eve of the siege of jerusalem circa 68 a d  the miracle is supposed to have been wrought about 33 a d and lazarus would then have been only fifteen although according to tradition he was thirty when he was raised from the dead and lived only thirty years after  upon this prof charles b wright comments in poetlore april 1897 i incline to think that the oversight is not brownings  let us stand by the tradition and the resulting age of sixtyfive    karshish is simply stating his professional judgment  lazarus is given an age suited to his appearancehe seems a man of fifty  the years have touched him lightly since heaven opened to his soul    and that marvellous physical freshness deceives the very leech himself  177 greek fire used by the byzantine greeks in warfare first against the saracens at the siege of constantinople in 673 a d therefore an anachronism in this

gorgeous roof no suns and moons though eer so bright   avail to stop me splendorproof   i keep the broods of stars aloof for i intend to get to god   for t is to god i speed so fast for in gods  breast my own abode   those shoals of dazzling glory passed   i lay my spirit down at last                            10 i lie where i have always lain   god smiles as he has always smiled ere suns

this head this hand should rest upon   thus ere he fashioned star or sun                      20 and having thus created me   thus rooted me he bade me grow guiltless forever like a tree   that buds and blooms nor seeks to know   the law by which it prospers so but sure that thought and word and deed   all go to swell his love for me me made because that love had need   of something irreversibly

agricola in meditation presents the doctrine of predestination as it appears to a devout and poetic soul whose conviction of the truth of such a doctrine has the strength of a divine revelation those elected for gods love can do nothing to weaken it those not elected can do nothing to gain it but it is not his to reason why indeed he could not praise a god whose ways he could understand or for whose love he had to bargain  johannes agricola 14921566 luthers secretary 1519 afterward in conflict with him and author of the doctrine called by luther antinomian because it rejected the law of the old testament as of no use under the gospel dispensation  in a note accompanying the first publication of this poem browning quotes from the dictionary of all religions 1704 they say that good works do not further nor evil works hinder salvation that the child of god cannot sin that god never chastiseth him that murder drunkenness etc are sins in the wicked but not in him that the child of grace being once assured of salvation afterwards never doubteth    that god doth not love any man for his holiness that sanctification is no evidence of justification  though many antinomians taught thus says george willis cooke in his browning guide book it does not correctly represent the position of agricola who in reality held moral obligations to be incumbent upon the christian but for guidance in these he found in the new testament all the principles and motives necessary   pictor ignotus  florence 15  1845  i could have painted pictures like that youths   ye praise so  how my soul springs

the limit space and bound   allowed to truth made visible in man and like that youth ye praise so all i saw   over the canvas could my hand have flung each face obedient to its passions law   each passion clear proclaimed without a tongue whether hope rose at once in all the blood   atiptoe for the blessing of embrace or rapture drooped the eyes as when her brood   pull down the nesting doves

 and then not go to heaven but linger here here on my earth earths every man my friend   the thought grew frightful t was so wildly dear       40 but a voice changed it  glimpses of such sights   have scared me like the revels through a door of some strange house of idols at its rites   this world seemed not the world it was before mixed with my loving trusting ones there trooped      who  summoned those cold faces that begun to press on me and judge me  though i stooped   shrinking as from the soldiery a nun they drew me forth and spite of me    enough   these buy and sell our pictures take and give          50 count them for garniture and householdstuff   and where they live needs must our pictures live and see their faces listen to their prate   partakers of their daily pettiness discussed ofthis i love or this i hate   this likes me more and this affects me less wherefore i chose my portion  if at whiles   my heart sinks as monotonous i paint these endless cloisters and eternal aisles   with the same series  virgin babe and saint           60 with the same cold calm beautiful regard   at least no merchant traffics in my heart the sanctuarys gloom at least shall ward   vain tongues

earth  notes  pictor ignotus is a reverie characteristic of a monastic painter of the renaissance who recognizes in the genius of a youth whose pictures are praised a gift akin to his own but which he has never so exercised spite of the joy such free human expression and recognition of his power would have given him because he could not bear to submit his art to worldly contact  so he has chosen to sink his name in unknown service to the church and to devote his fancy to pure and beautiful but cold and monotonous repetitions of sacred themes  his gentle regret that his own pictures will moulder unvisited is half wonderment that the youth can endure the sullying of his work by secular fame  67 travertine a white limestone the name being a corruption of tiburtinus from tibur  now tivoli near

doubled me up and down i went old aunt lapaccia trussed me with one hand its fellow was a stinger as i knew and so along the wall over the bridge                    90 by the straight cut to the convent  six words there while i stood munching my first bread that month so boy youre minded quoth the good fat father wiping his own mouth t was refectiontime to quit this very miserable world will

taught me latin in pure waste flower o the clove                                     110 all the latin i construe is amo i love but mind you when a boy starves in the streets eight years together as my fortune was watching folks faces to know who will fling the bit of halfstripped grapebunch he desires and who will curse or kick him for his pains which gentleman processional and fine holding a candle to the sacrament will wink and let him lift a plate and catch the droppings of the wax to sell again                   120 or holla for the eight and have him whipped how say inay which dog bites which lets drop his bone from the heap of offal in the street why soul and sense of him grow sharp alike he learns the look of things and none the less for admonition from the hungerpinch i had a store of such remarks be sure which after i found leisure turned to use i drew mens faces on my copybooks scrawled them within the antiphonarys marge             130 joined legs and arms to the long musicnotes found eyes and nose and chin for as and bs and made a string of pictures of the world betwixt the ins and outs of verb and noun on the wall the bench the door  the monks looked black nay quoth the prior turn him out d ye say in no wise  lose a crow and catch a lark what if at last we get our man of parts we carmelites like those camaldolese and preaching friars to do our church up fine            140 and put the front on it that ought to be and hereupon he bade me daub away thank you my head being crammed the walls a blank never was such prompt disemburdening first every sort of monk the black and white i drew them fat and lean  then folk at church from good old gossips waiting to confess their cribs of barreldroppings candleends to the breathless fellow at the altarfoot fresh from his murder safe and sitting there             150 with the little children round him in a row of admiration half for his beard and half for that white anger of his victims son shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm signing himself with the other because of christ whose  sad face on the cross sees only this after the passion of a thousand years till some poor girl her apron oer her head which  the intense eyes looked through came at eve on tiptoe said a word dropped in a loaf                160 her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers the  brute took growling prayed and so was gone i painted all then cried t is ask and have choose for mores readylaid the ladder flat and showed  my covered bit of cloisterwall the monks closed in a circle and praised loud till checked taught what to see and not to see being simple bodiesthats the very man look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog that womans like the priors niece who comes             170 to care about his asthma its the life but there my triumphs strawfire flared and funked their betters took their turn to see and say the prior and the learned pulled a face and stopped all that in no time  how whats here quite from the mark of painting bless us all faces arms legs and bodies like the true as much as pea and pea its devilsgame your business is not to catch men with show with homage to the perishable clay                       180 but lift them over it ignore it all make them forget theres such a thing as flesh your business is to paint the souls of men mans soul and its a fire smoke    no its not    its vapor done up like a newborn babe in that shape when you die it leaves your mouth its    well what matters talking its the soul give us no more of body than shows soul heres giotto with his saint apraising god that sets us praisingwhy not stop with him             190 why put all thoughts of praise out of our head with wonder at lines colors and what not paint the soul never mind the legs and arms rub all out try at it a second time oh that white smallish female with the breasts shes just my niece    herodias i would say who went and danced and got mens heads cut off have it all out  now  is this sense i ask a fine way to paint soul by painting body so ill the eye cant stop there must go further         200 and cant fare worse  thus yellow does for white when what you put for yellows simply black and any sort of meaning looks intense when all beside itself means and looks naught why cant a painter lift each foot in turn left foot and right foot go a double step make his flesh liker and his soul more like both in their order take the prettiest face the priors niece    patronsaintis it so pretty you  cant discover if it means hope fear               210 sorrow or joy wont beauty go with these suppose ive made her eyes all right and blue cant i take breath and try to add lifes flash and then add soul and heighten them threefold or say theres beauty with no soul at all i never saw itput the case the same if you get simple beauty and naught else you get about the best thing god invents thats somewhat and youll find the soul you have missed within yourself when you return him thanks              220 rub all out  well well theres my life in short and so the thing has gone on ever since im grown a man no doubt ive broken bounds you should not take a fellow

 notes  fra lippo lippi is a dramatic monologue which incidentally conveys the whole story of the occurrence the poem starts fromthe seizure of fra lippo by the city guards past midnight in an equivocal neighborhoodand the lively talk that arose thereupon outlines the character and past life of the florentine artistmonk 14121469 and the subordinate personalities of the group of officers and makes all this contribute towards the presentation of fra lippo as a type of the more realistic and secular artist of the renaissance who valued flesh and protested against the ascetic spirit which strove to isolate the soul  7 the carmine monastery of the del carmine friars  17 cosimo de medici 13891464 florentine statesman and patron of the arts  23 pilchards a kind of fish  53 flower o the broom of the many varieties of folksongs in italy that which furnished browning with a model for lippos songs is called a stornello  the name is variously derived  some take it as merely short for ritornillo others derive it from a storno to sing against each other because the peasants sing them at their work and as one ends a song another caps it with a fresh one and so on  these stornelli consist of three lines the first usually contains the name of a flower which sets the rhyme and is five syllables long  then the love theme is told in two lines of eleven syllables each agreeing by rhyme assonance or repetition with the first  the first line may be looked upon as a burden set at the beginning instead of as is more familiar to us at the end  there are also stornelli formed of three lines of eleven syllables without any burden  browning has made lippos songs of only two lines but he has strictly followed the rule of making the first line containing the address to the flower of five syllables  the tuscany versions of two of the songs used by browning are as follows  flower of the pine  call me not ever happy heart again but call me heavy heart 0 comrades mine  flower of

same realistic manner as brownings saint laurence whose martyrdom of broiling to death on a gridiron affords lippos powers a livelier effect  the legend of this saint makes his fortitude such that he bade his persecutors turn him over as he was done on one side  346 something in sant ambrogios picture of the virgin crowned with angels and saints painted for saint ambrose church now at the belle

the relations existing between andreas character his choice of a wife and the peculiar quality of his art the whole serving also to illustrate the picture on which the poem is based the gray tone that silvers the picture pervades the poem with an air of helpless resigned melancholy and sets forth the fatal quality of facile craftsmanship joined with a flaccid spirit  mr john kenyon mrs brownings cousin asked browning to get him a copy of the picture of andrea and his wife in the pitti palace  browning being unable to find one wrote this poem describing it instead  andrea 14861531 because his

pay it  now well talk    so you despise me mr gigadibs no deprecationnay i beg you sir beside t is our engagement dont you know i promised if youd watch a dinner out wed see truth dawn togethertruth that peeps over the glasses edge when dinners done and body gets its sop and holds its noise and leaves soul free a little  nows the time            20 truths break of day  you do despise me then and if i say despise menever fear 1 know you do not in a certain sense not in my armchair for example here i well imagine you respect my place status entourage worldly circumstance quite to its valuevery much indeed are up to the protesting eyes of you in pride at being seated here for once youll turn it to such capital account                    30 when somebody through years and years to come hints

in his heart halfsaid as much indeedthe  things his trade i warrant blougram s sceptical at times how otherwise  i liked him i confess che che my dear sir as we say at rome dont you protest now its fair give and take you have had your turn and spoken your hometruths the hands mine now and here you follow suit    thus much conceded still the first fact stays you do despise me your ideal of life                      50 is not the bishops you would not be i you would like better to be goethe now or buonaparte or bless me lower still count dorsayso you did what you preferred spoke as you thought and as you cannot help believed or disbelieved no matter what so long as on that point whateer it was you loosed your mind were whole and sole yourself that my ideal never can include upon that element of truth and worth                       60 never be based for say they make me pope they cantsuppose it for our argument why there im at my tethers end ive reached my height and not a height which pleases you an unbelieving pope wont do you say its like those eerie stories nurses tell of how some actor on a stage played death with pasteboard crown sham orb and tinselled dart and called himself the monarch of the world then going in the tireroom afterward                    70 because the play was done to shift himself got touched upon the sleeve familiarly the moment he had shut the closet door by death himself  thus god might touch a pope at unawares ask what his baubles mean and whose part he presumed to play just now best be yourself imperial plain and true  so drawing comfortable breath again you weigh and find whatever more or less i boast of my ideal realized                               80 is nothing in the balance when opposed to your ideal your grand simple life of which you will not realize one jot i am much you are nothing you would be all i would be merely much you beat me there  no friend you do not beat me hearken why the common problem yours mine every ones isnot to fancy what were fair in life provided it could bebut finding first what may be then find how to make it fair                 90 up to our means a very different thing no abstract

heres mine a bishops outfit criticise whats wrong  why wont you be a bishop too    why first you dont believe you dont and cant      150 not statedly that is and fixedly and absolutely and exclusively in any revelation called divine no dogmas nail your faith and what remains but say so like the honest man you are first therefore overhaul theology nay i too not a fool you please to think must find believing every whit as hard and if i do not frankly say as much the ugly consequence is clear enough                     160     now wait my friend well i do not believe if youll accept no faith that is not fixed absolute and exclusive as you say youre wrongi mean  to prove it in due time meanwhile i know where difficulties lie i could not cannot solve nor ever shall so give up hope accordingly to solve to you and over the wine  our dogmas then with both of us though in unlike degree missing full credenceoverboard with them               170 i mean to meet you on your own premise good there go mine in company with yours    and now what are we unbelievers both calm and complete determinately fixed today tomorrow and forever pray youll guarantee me that  not so i think in no wise all weve gained is that belief as unbelief before shakes us by fits confounds us like its predecessor  wheres the gain how can we guard our unbelief                  180 make it bear fruit to usthe problem here just when we are safest theres a sunsettouch a fancy from a flowerbell some ones death a chorusending from euripides and thats enough for fifty hopes and fears as old and new at once as natures self to rap and knock and enter in our soul take hands and dance there a fantastic ring round the ancient idol on his base again the grand perhaps  we look on helplessly                190 there the old misgivings crooked questions are this good godwhat he could do if he would would if he couldthen must have done long since if so when where and how some way must be once feel about and soon or late you hit some sense in which it might be after all why not the way the truth the life                                      that way over the mountain which who stands upon is apt to doubt if it be meant for a road while if he views it from the waste itself              200 up goes the line there plain from base to brow not vague mistakable whats a break or two seen from the unbroken desert either side and then to bring in fresh philosophy what if the breaks themselves should prove at last the most consummate of contrivances to train a mans eye teach him what is faith and so we stumble at truths very test all we have gained then by our unbelief is a life of doubt diversified by faith                  210 for one of faith diversified by doubt we called the chessboard whitewe call it black    well you rejoin the ends no worse at least weve reason for both colors on the board why not confess then where i drop the faith and you the doubt that im as right as you    because friend in the next place this being so and both things evenfaith and unbelief left to a mans choicewell proceed a step returning to our image which i like                     220    a mans choice yesbut a cabinpassengers the man made for the special life o the world do you forget him i remember though consult our ships conditions and you find one and but one choice suitable to all the choice that you unluckily prefer turning things topsyturvythey or it going to the ground  belief or unbelief bears upon life determines its whole course begins at its beginning  see the world                   230 such as it isyou made it not nor i i mean to take it as it isand you not so youll take itthough you get naught else i know the special kind of life i like what suits the most my idiosyncrasy brings out the best of me and bears me fruit in power peace pleasantness and length of days i find that positive belief does this for me and unbelief no whit of this for you it does howeverthat well try            240 t is clear i cannot lead my life at least induce the world to let me peaceably without declaring at the outset friends i absolutely and peremptorily believei say faith is my waking life one sleeps indeed and dreams at intervals we know but wakings the main point with us and my provisions for lifes waking part accordingly i use heart head and hand all day i build scheme study and make friends        250 and when night overtakes me down i lie sleep dream a little and get done with it the sooner the better to begin afresh whats midnights doubt before the daysprings faith you the philosopher that disbelieve that recognize the night give dreams their weight to be consistent you should keep your bed abstain from healthy acts that prove you man for fear you drowse perhaps at unawares and certainly at night youll sleep and dream            260 live through the day and bustle as you please and so you live to sleep as i to wake to unbelieve as i to still believe well and the common sense o the world calls you bedriddenand its good things come to me its estimation which is half the fight thats the firstcabin comfort i secure the next    but you perceive with half an eye come come its best believing if we may you cant but own that                          next concede again             270 if once we choose belief on all accounts we cant be too decisive in our faith conclusive and exclusive in its terms to suit the world which gives us the good things in every mans career are certain points whereon he dares not be indifferent the world detects him clearly if he dare as baffled at the game and losing life he may care little or he may care much for riches honor pleasure work repose                280 since various theories of life and lifes success are extant which might easily comport with either estimate of these and whoso chooses wealth or poverty labor or quiet is not judged a fool because his fellow would choose otherwise we let him choose upon his own account so long as hes consistent with his choice but certain points left wholly to himself when once a man has arbitrated on                        290 we say he must succeed there or go hang thus he should wed the woman he loves most or needs most whatsoeer the love or need for he cant wed twice  then he must avouch or follow at the least sufficiently the form of faith his conscience holds the best whateer the process of conviction was for nothing can compensate his mistake on such a point the man himself being judge he cannot wed twice nor twice lose his soul             300    well now theres one great form of christian faith i happened to be born inwhich to teach was given me as i grew up on all hands as best and readiest means of living by the same on examination being proved the most pronounced moreover fixed precise and absolute form of faith in the whole world accordingly most  potent of all forms for working on the world  observe my  friend such as you know me i am free to say                    310 in these hard latter days which hamper one myselfby no immoderate exercise of intellect and learning but the tact to let external forces work for me bid the streets stones be bread and they are bread bid peters creed or rather hildebrands exalt me oer my fellows in the world and make my life an ease and joy and pride it does sowhich for me s a great point gained who have a soul and body that exact                       320 a comfortable care in many ways theres power in me and will to dominate which i must exercise they hurt me else in many ways i need mankinds respect obedience and the love thats born of fear while at the same time theres a taste i have a toy of soul a titillating thing refuses to digest these dainties crude the naked life is gross till clothed upon i must take what men offer with a grace                  330 as though i would not could i help it take an uniform i wear though overrich something imposed on me no choice of mine no fancydress worn for pure fancys sake and despicable therefore now folk kneel and kiss my handof course the churchs hand thus i am made thus life is best for me and thus that it should be i have procured and thus it could not be another way i venture to imagine                         youll reply                      340 so far my choice no doubt is a success but were i made of better elements with nobler instincts purer tastes like you i hardly would account the thing success though it did all for me i say                                   but friend we speak of what is not of what might be and how twere better if twere otherwise i am the man you see here plain enough grant im a beast why beasts must lead beasts lives suppose i own at once to tail and claws                  350 the tailless man exceeds me but being tailed ill lash out lion fashion and leave apes to dock their stump and dress their haunches up my business is not to remake myself but make the absolute best of what god made orour first similethough you prove me doomed to a viler berth still to the steeragehole the sheeppen or the pigstye i should strive to make what use of each were possible and as this cabin gets upholstery                        360 that hutch should rustle with sufficient straw    but friend i dont acknowledge quite so fast i fail of all your manhoods lofty tastes enumerated  so complacently on the mere ground that you forsooth can find in this particular life i choose to lead no fit provision for them  can you not say you my fault is i address myself to grosser estimators than should judge and thats no way of holding up the soul                 370 which nobler needs mens praise perhaps yet knows one wise mans verdict outweighs all the fools would like the two but forced to choose takes that i pine among my million imbeciles you think aware some dozen men of sense eye me and know me whether i believe in the last winking virgin as i vow and am a fool or disbelieve in her and am a knaveapprove in neither case withhold their voices though i look their way            380 like verdi when at his worst operas end the thing they gave at florencewhats its name while the mad housefuls plaudits near outbang his orchestra of saltbox tongs and bones he looks through all the roaring and the wreaths where sits rossini patient in his stall    nay friend i meet you with an answer here that even your prime men who appraise their kind are men still catch a wheel within a wheel see more in a truth than the truths simple self         390 confuse themselves  you see lads walk the street sixty the minute whats to note in that you see one lad oerstride a chimneystack him you must watchhes sure to fall yet stands our interests on the dangerous edge of things the honest thief the tender murderer the superstitious atheist demirep that loves and saves her soul in new french books we watch while these in equilibrium keep the giddy line midway one step aside                    400 theyre classed and done with  i then keep the line before your sagesjust the men to shrink from the gross weights coarse scales and labels broad you offer their refinement  fool or knave why needs a bishop be a fool or knave when theres a thousand diamond weights between so i enlist them  your picked twelve youll find profess themselves indignant scandalized at thus being held unable to explain how a superior man who disbelieves                        410 may not believe as well thats schellings way its through my coming in the tail of time nicking the minute with a happy tact had i been born three hundred years ago theyd say whats strange  blougram of course believes and seventy years since disbelieves of course but now he may believe and yet and yet how can he  all eyes turn with interest whereas step off the line on either side you for example clever to a fault                      420 the rough and ready man who write apace read somewhat seldomer think perhaps even less you disbelieve  who wonders and who cares lord soandsohis coat bedropped with wax all peters chains about his waist his back brave with the needlework of noodledom believes  again who wonders and who cares but i the man of sense and learning too the able to think yet act the this the that i to believe at this late time of day                   430 enough you see i need not fear contempt    except its yours admire me as these may you dont  but whom at least do you admire present your own perfection your ideal your pattern man for a minuteoh make haste is it napoleon you would have us grow concede the means allow his head and hand a large concession clever as you are good  in our common primal element of unbelief we cant believe you know                 440 were still at

what or in what its alive and shines and leads him and thats all we want have we aught in our sober night shall point such ends as his were and direct the means of working out our purpose straight as his               450 nor bring a moments trouble on success with aftercare to justify the same be a napoleon and yet disbelieve why the mans mad friend take his light away whats the vague good o the world for which you dare with comfort to yourself blow millions up we neither of us see it we do see the blownup millionsspatter of their brains and writhing of their bowels and so forth in that bewildering entanglement                          460 of horrible eventualities past calculation to the end of time can i mistake for some clear word of god which were my ample warrant for it all his puff of hazy instinct idle talk the state thats i quacknonsense about crowns and when one beats the man to his last hold a vague idea of setting things to rights policing people efficaciously more to their profit most of all to his own             470 the whole to end that dismallest of ends by an austrian marriage cant to us the church and resurrection of the old regime would i who hope to live a dozen years fight austerlitz for reasons such and such no for concede me but the merest chance doubt may be wrongtheres judgment life to come with just that chance i dare not  doubt proves right this present life is allyou offer me its dozen noisy years without a chance                   480 that wedding an archduchess wearing lace and getting called by divers newcoined names will drive off ugly

hierarchy with gigadibs the literary man who played with spoons explored his plates design and ranged the olivestones about its edge while the great bishop rolled him out a mind long crumpled till creased consciousness lay smooth     for blougram he believed say half he spoke         980 the other portion as he shaped it thus for argumentatory purposes he felt his foe was foolish to dispute some arbitrary accidental thoughts that crossed his mind amusing because new he chose to represent as fixtures there invariable convictions such they seemed beside his interlocutors loose cards flung

firmer yet beneath it both of us may sink and reach his ground was over mine and broke the first so let him sit with me this many a year  he did not sit five minutes  just a week sufficed his sudden

three and started for australiathere i hope by this time he has tested his first plough and studied his last chapter of st john  notes  bishop blougrams apology is made over the wine after dinner to defend himself from the criticisms of a doubting young literary man who despises him because he considers that he cannot be true to his convictions in conforming to the doctrines of the catholic church he builds up his defence from the proposition that the problem of life is not to conceive ideals which cannot be realized but to find what is and make it as fair as possible  the bishop admits his unbelief but being free to choose either belief or unbelief since neither can be proved wholly true chooses belief as his guiding principle because he finds it the best for making his own life and that of others happy and comfortable in this world  once having chosen faith on this ground the more absolute the form of faith the more potent the results besides the bishop has that desire of domination in his nature which the authorization of the church makes safer for him  to gigadibs objection that were his nature nobler he would not count this success he replies he is as god made him and can but make the best of himself as he is  to the objection that he addresses himself to grosser estimators than he ought he replies that all the world is interested in the fact that a man of his sense and learning too still believes at this late hour  he points out the impossibility of his following an ideal like napoleons for conceding the merest chance that doubt may be wrong and judgment to follow this life he would not dare to slaughter men as napoleon had for such slight ends  as for shakespeares ideal he cant write plays like his if he wanted to but he has realized things in his life which shakespeare only imagined and which he presumes shakespeare would not have scorned to have realized in his life judging from his fulfilled ambition to be a gentleman of property at stratford  he admits however that enthusiasm in belief such as luthers would be far preferable to his own way of living and after this enthusiasm in unbelief which he might have if it were not for that plaguy chance that doubt may be wrong  gigadibs interposes that the risk is as great for cool indifference as for bold doubt  blougram disputes that point by declaring that doubts prove faith and that mans free will preferring to have faith true to having doubt true tips the balance in favor of faith and shows that mans instinct or aspiration is toward belief that unquestioning belief such as that of the past has no moral effect on man but faith which knows itself through doubt is a moral spur  thus the arguments from expediency instinct and consciousness all bear on the side of faith and convince the bishop that it is safer to keep his faith intact from his doubts  he then proves that gigadibs with all his assumption of superiority in his frankness of unbelief is in about the same position as himself since the moral law which he follows has no surer foundation than the religious law the bishop follows both founded upon instinct  the bishop closes as he began with the consciousness that rewards for his way of living are of a substantial nature while gigadibs has nothing to show for his frankness and does not hesitate to say that gigadibs will consider his conversation with the bishop the greatest honor ever conferred upon him  the poet adds some lines somewhat apologetic for the bishop intimating that his arguments were suited to the calibre of his critic and that with a profounder critic he would have made a more serious defence  speaking of a review of this poem by cardinal wiseman 18011865 browning says in a letter to a friend printed in poetlore may 1896 the most curious notice i ever had was from cardinal wiseman on blougramie himself  it was in the rambler a catholic journal of those days and certified to be his by father prout who said nobody else would have dared put it in this review praises the poem for its fertility of illustration and felicity of argument and says that though utterly mistaken in the very groundwork of religion though starting from the most unworthy notions of the work of a catholic bishop and defending a selfindulgence every honest man must feel to be disgraceful it is yet in its way triumphant  6

length as thou didst hear with painting is mine too i know the true proportions of a man and woman also not observed before and i have written three books on the soul proving absurd all written hitherto and putting us to ignorance again for musicwhy i have combined the moods                 60 inventing one  in brief all arts are mine thus much the people know and  recognize throughout our seventeen islands  marvel not we of these latter days with greater mind than our forerunners since more composite look not so great beside their simple way to a judge who only sees one way at once one mindpoint and no other at a time compares the small part of a man of us with some whole man of the heroic age                     70 great in his waynot ours nor meant for ours and ours is greater had we skill to know for what we call this life of men on earth this sequence of the souls achievements here being as i find much reason to conceive intended to be viewed eventually as a great whole not analyzed to parts but each part having reference to all how shall a certain part pronounced complete endure effacement by another part                         80 was the thing donethen whats to do again see in the chequered pavement opposite suppose the artist made a perfect rhomb and next a lozenge then a trapezoid he did not overlay them superimpose the new upon the old and blot it out but laid them on a level in his work making at last a picture there it lies so first the perfect separate forms were made the portions of mankind and after so                    90 occurred the combination of the same for where had been a progress otherwise mankind made up of all the single men in such a synthesis the labor ends now mark me those divine men of old time have reached thou sayest well each at one point the outside verge that rounds our faculty and where they reached who can do more than reach it takes but little water just to touch at some one point the inside of a sphere                 100 and as we turn the sphere touch all the rest in due succession but the finer air which not so palpably nor obviously though no less universally can touch the whole circumference of that emptied sphere fills it more fully than the water did holds thrice the weight of water in itself resolved into a subtler element and yet the vulgar call the sphere first full up to the visible heightand after void                110 not knowing airs more hidden properties and thus our soul misknown cries out to zeus to vindicate his purpose in our life why stay we on the earth unless to grow long since i imaged wrote the fiction out that he or other god descended here and once for all showed simultaneously what in its nature never can be shown piecemeal or in successionshowed i say the worth both absolute and relative                      120 of all his children from the birth of time his instruments for all appointed work i now go on to imagemight we hear the judgment which should give the due to each show where the labor lay and where the ease and prove zeus self the latent everywhere this is a dreambut no dream let us hope that years and days the summers and the springs follow each other with unwaning powers the grapes which dye thy wine are richer far             130 through culture than the wild wealth of the rock the wave plum than the

phidias and his friend i am not great as they are point by point but i have entered into sympathy with these four running these into one soul who separate ignored each others art say is it nothing

           150 i stand myself  refer this to the gods whose gift alone it is which shall i dare all pride apart upon the absurd pretext that such a gift by chance lay in my hand discourse of lightly or depreciate it might have fallen to anothers hand what then i pass too surely let at least truth stay     and next of what thou followest on to ask this being with me as i declare 0 king my works in all these varicolored kinds                 160 so done by me accepted so by men thou askest if my soul thus in mens hearts i must not be accounted to attain the very crown and proper end of life inquiring thence how now life closeth up i face death with success in my right hand whether i fear death less than dost thyself the fortunate of men  for writest thou thou leavest much behind while i leave naught thy life stays in the poems men shall sing               170 the pictures men shall study while my life complete and whole now in its power and joy dies altogether with my brain and arm is lost indeed since what survives myself the brazen statue to oerlook my grave see on the promontory which i named and thatsome supple courtier of my heir shall use its robed and sceptred arm perhaps to fix the rope to which best drags it down i go then triumph thou who dost not go                180    nay thou art worthy of hearing my whole mind is this apparent when thou turnst to muse upon the scheme of earth and man in chief that admiration grows as knowledge grows that imperfection means perfection hid reserved in part to grace the aftertime if in the morning of philosophy ere aught had been recorded nay perceived thou with the light now in thee couldst have looked on all earths tenantry from worm to bird               190 ere man her last appeared upon the stage thou wouldst have seen them perfect and deduced the perfectness of others yet unseen conceding whichhad zeus then questioned thee shall i go on a step improve on this do more for visible creatures than is done thou wouldst have answered ay by making each grow conscious in himselfby that alone alls perfect else the shell sucks fast the rock the fish strikes through the sea the snake both swims    200 and slides forth range the beasts the birds take flight till lifes mechanics can no further go and all this joy in natural life is put like fire from off thy finger into each so exquisitely perfect is the same but t is pure fire and they mere matter are it has them not they it and so i choose for man thy last premeditated work if i might add a glory to the scheme that a third thing should stand apart from both          210 a quality arise within his soul which introactive made to supervise and feel the force it has may view itself and so be happy  man might live at first the animal life but is there nothing more in due time let him critically learn how he lives and the more he gets to know of his own lifes adaptabilities the more joygiving will his life become thus man who hath this quality is best                 220     but thou king hadst more reasonably said let progress end at onceman make no step beyond the natural man the better beast using his senses not the sense of sense in man theres failure only since he left the lower and inconscious forms of life we called it an advance the rendering plain mans spirit might grow conscious of mans life and by new lore so added to the old take each step higher over the brutes head              230 this grew the only life the pleasurehouse watchtower and treasurefortress of the soul which whole surrounding flats of natural life seemed only fit to yield subsistence to a tower that crowns a country  but alas the soul now climbs it just to perish there for thence we  have discovered t is no dream we know  this which we had not else perceived that theres a world of capability for joy spread round about us meant for us             240 inviting us and still the soul craves all and still the flesh replies take no jot more than ere thou clombst the tower to look abroad nay so much less as that fatigue has brought deduction to it  we struggle fain to enlarge our bounded physical recipiency increase our power supply fresh oil to life repair the waste of age and sickness no it skills not lifes inadequate to joy as the soul sees joy tempting life to take              250 they praise a fountain in my garden here wherein a naiad sends the waterbow thin from her tube she smiles to see it rise what if i told her it is just a thread from that great river which the hills shut up and mock  her with my  leave to take the same the

can use but a mans joy while he sees gods  is it for zeus to boast see man how happy i live and despair that i may be still happierfor thy use if this were so we could not thank our lord as hearts beat on to doing tis not so malice it is not  is it carelessness still no  if carewhere is the sign i ask and get no answer and agree in sum 0 king with thy profound discouragement                 270 who seest the wider but to sigh the more most progress is most failure thou sayest well    the last point nowthou dost except a case holding joy not impossible to one with artistgiftsto such a man as i who leave behind me living works indeed for such a poem such a painting lives what dost thou verily trip upon a word confound the accurate view of what joy is caught somewhat  clearer by my eyes than thine          280 with feeling joy confound the knowing how and showing how to live my faculty with actually livingotherwise where is the artists vantage oer the king because in my great epos i display how divers men young strong fair wise can act is this as though i acted if i paint carve the young phoebus am i therefore young methinks im older that i bowed myself the many years of pain that taught me art                290 indeed to know is something and to prove how all this beauty might be enjoyed is more but knowing naught to enjoy is something too yon rower with the moulded

not die sappho survives because we sing her songs and aeschylus because we read his plays why if they live still let them come and take thy slave in my despite drink from thy cup speak in my place  thou diest while i survive say rather that my fate is deadlier still in this that every day my sense of joy                   310 grows more acute my soul intensified by power and insight more enlarged more keen while every day my hairs fall more and more my hand shakes and the heavy years increase the horror quickening still from year to year the consummation coming past escape when i

thinking acting man the man who loved his life so overmuch sleep in my urn  it is so horrible i dare at times imagine to my need some future state revealed to us by zeus unlimited in capability for joy as this is in desire for joy to seek which the joyhunger forces us that stung by straitness of our life made strait on purpose to make prized the life at large             330 freed by the throbbing impulse we call death we burst there as the worm into the fly who while a worm still wants his wings  but no zeus has not yet revealed it and alas he must have done so were it possible     live long and happy and in that thought die glad for what was  farewell  and for the rest i cannot tell thy messenger aright where to deliver what he bears of thine to one called paulus we have heard his fame              340 indeed if christus be not one with him i know not nor am troubled much to know thou canst not think a mere barbarian jew as paulus proves to be one circumcised hath access to

scholars certain slaves              350 who touched on this same isle preached him and christ and as i gathered from a bystander their doctrine could be held by no sane man  notes  cleon expresses the approach of greek thought at the time of christ towards the idea of immortality as made known by cleon a greek poet writing in reply to a greek patron whose princely gifts and letter asking comment on the philosophical significance of death have just reached him  the important conclusions reached by cleon in his answer are that the composite mind is greater than the minds of the past because it is capable of accomplishing much in many lines of activity and of sympathizing with each of those simple great minds that had reached the highest possible perfection at one point  it is indeed the necessary next step in development though all classes of mind fit into the perfected mosaic of life no one achievement blotting out any other  this soul and mind development he deduces from the physical development he sees about him  but since with the growth of human consciousness and the increase of knowledge comes greater capability to the soul for joy while the failure of physical powers shuts off the possibility of realizing joy it would have been better had man been left with nothing higher than mere sense like the brutes  dismissing the idea of immortality through ones works as unsatisfactory to the individual he finally concludes that a long and happy life is all there is to be hoped for since had the future life which he has sometimes dared to hope for been possible zeus would long before have revealed it  he dismisses the preaching of one paulus as untenable  as certain also of your own poets have said this motto hints that pauls speech at athens acts 172228

true grace while the sun does not even perceive the flower  he imagines himself as a pilgrim revealing to the lady of tripoli by means of this symbol the entire sinking of self in his love for her  even mens praise of his songs is no more to him than the bees which bask on a sunflower are to it  rudel was a provencal troubadour and lived in the twelfth century the crusaders returning from the

with her and composed songs in honor of her beauty and finally set out to the east in pilgrims garb  on his way he was taken ill but lived to reach the port of tripoli  the countess being told of his arrival went on board the vessel  when rudel heard she was coming he revived said she had restored him to life by her coming and that he was willing to die having seen her  he died in her arms she

dante of the dread inferno wrote one songand in my  brain i sing it               200 drew one angelborne see on my bosom                                        r  b  notes  one word more is the dedication to elizabeth barrett browning which was appended to men and women as first published when it contained fifty poems since distributed under other titles  the poet recalling how rafael when he would allexpress his love wrote sonnets to the loved one and how dante prepared to paint an angel for beatrice draws the conclusion that there is no artist but longs to give expression to his supreme love in some other art than his own which would be the medium of a spontaneous natural outburst of feeling in a way impossible in the familiar forms of his own art thus he would gain a mans joy and miss the artists sorrow for like the miracles of moses the work of the artist is subject to the cold criticism of the world which expects him nevertheless always to be the artist and has no sympathy for him as a man  since there is no other art but poetry in which it is possible for browning to express himself he will at least drop his accustomed dramatic form and speak in his own person though it be poor let it stand as a symbol for allexpression  yet does she not know him for he has shown her his soulside as one might imagine the moon showing another side to a mortal lover which would remain forever as much a mystery to the outside world as the vision seen by moses etc similarly he has admired the side his moon of poets has shown the whole world in her poetry but he blesses himself with the thought of the other side which he alone has seen  5 century of sonnets rafael is known to have written four love sonnets on the back of sketches for his wall painting the disputa which are still preserved in collections one of them in the british museum  the italian text of these sonnets with english translations are given in wolzogens life of him translated by f e bunnett  did he ever write a hundred  it is supposed that the lost book once owned by guido reni apparently the one referred to in stanza iv was a book of drawings  perhaps these also bore sonnets on their backs or browning guessed they did  10  who that one margarita a girl rafael met and loved in rome two portraits of whom existone in the barberini palace rome the other in the pitti in florence  they resemble the sistine and other madonnas by rafael  21 madonnas etc san sisto now in dresden foligno in the vatican rome the one in florence is called del granduca and represents her appearing in a vision the one in the louvre called la belle jardiniere is seated in a garden among lilies  32 dante once etc on that day writes dante vita nuova xxxv which fulfilled the year since my lady had been made of the citizens of eternal life remembering of her as i sat alone i betook myself to draw the resemblance of an angel upon certain tablets  that this lady was beatrice portinari as browning supposes dantes devotion to her in both the new life and the divine comedy should leave no doubt  yet the literalness of mr w m  rossetti makes him obtuse here as he and other commentators seem to be in their understanding of browning throughout this stanza  browning evidently contrasts dantes tenderness here towards beatrice with the remorselessness of his pen in the inferno see cantos 32 and 33 where he stigmatized his enemies as if using their very flesh for his parchment so that ever after in the eyes of all florence they seemed to bear the marks of the poets hate of their wickedness  it was people of this sort grandees of the town browning fancies who again hinder loving breaking in upon the poet and seizing him unawares forsooth at this intimate moment of loving artistry  chancing to turn my head dante continues i perceived that some were standing beside me to whom i should have given courteous greeting and that they were observing what i did also i learned afterwards that they had been there a while before i perceived them  the tender moment was over he stopped the painting simply saying another was with me  74 he who smites the rock moses whose experience in smiting the
