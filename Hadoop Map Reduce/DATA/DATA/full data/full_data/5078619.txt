5078619	when god laughs and other stories  by jack london   1911 mills and boon edition   contents       when god laughs      the apostate      a wicked woman      just meat      created he them      the chinago      make westing      semper idem      a nose for the king      the francis spaight      a curious fragment      a piece of steak     when god laughs with compliments to harry cowell       the gods the gods are stronger time       falls down before them all mens knees       bow all mens prayers and sorrows climb       like incense toward them yea for these           are gods felise  carquinez had relaxed finally he stole a glance at the rattling windows looked upward at the beamed roof and listened for a moment to the savage roar of the southeaster as it caught the bungalow in its bellowing jaws then he held his glass between him and the fire and laughed for joy through the golden wine  it is beautiful he said it is sweetly sweet it is a womans wine and it was made for grayrobed saints to drink  we grow it on our own warm hills i said with pardonable california pride you rode up yesterday through the vines from which it was made  it was worth while to get carquinez to loosen up nor was he ever really himself until he felt the mellow warmth of the vine singing in his blood he was an artist it is true always an artist but somehow sober the high pitch and lilt went out of his thoughtprocesses and he was prone to be as deadly dull as a british sundaynot dull as other men are dull but dull when measured by the sprightly wight that monte carquinez was when he was really himself  from all this it must not be inferred that carquinez who is my dear friend and dearer comrade was a sot far from it he rarely erred as i have said he was an artist he knew when he had enough and enough with him was equilibriumthe equilibrium that is yours and mine when we are sober  his was a wise and instinctive temperateness that savoured of the greek yet he was far from greek i am aztec i am inca i am spaniard i have heard him say and in truth he looked it a compound of strange and ancient races what with his swarthy skin and the asymmetry and primitiveness of his features his eyes under massively arched brows were wide apart and black with the blackness that is barbaric while before them was perpetually falling down a great black mop of hair through which he gazed like a roguish satyr from a thicket he invariably wore a soft flannel shirt under his velvetcorduroy jacket and his necktie was red this latter stood for the red flag he had once lived with the socialists of paris and it symbolized the blood and brotherhood of man also he had never been known to wear anything on his head save a leatherbanded sombrero it was even rumoured that he had been born with this particular piece of headgear and in my experience it was provocative of nothing short of sheer delight to see that mexican sombrero hailing a cab in piccadilly or stormtossed in the crush for the new york elevated  as i have said carquinez was made quick by wineas the clay was made quick when god breathed the breath of life into it was his way of saying it i confess that he was blasphemously intimate with god and i must add that there was no blasphemy in him he was at all times honest and because he was compounded of paradoxes greatly misunderstood by those who did not know him he could be as elementally raw at times as a screaming savage and at other times as delicate as a maid as subtle as a spaniard andwell was he not aztec inca spaniard  and now i must ask pardon for the space i have given him he is my friend and i love him the house was shaking to the storm as he drew closer to the fire and laughed at it through his wine he looked at me and by the added lustre of his eye and by the alertness of it i knew that at last he was pitched in his proper key  and so you think youve won out against the gods he demanded  why the gods  whose will but theirs has put satiety upon man he cried  and whence the will in me to escape satiety i asked triumphantly  again the gods he laughed it is their game we play they deal and shuffle all the cards and take the stakes think not that you have escaped by fleeing from the mad cities you with your vineclad hills your sunsets and your sunrises your homely fare and simple round of living  ive watched you ever since i came you have not won you have surrendered you have made terms with the enemy you have made confession that you are tired you have flown the white flag of fatigue you have nailed up a notice to the effect that life is ebbing down in you you have run away from life you have played a trick shabby trick you have balked at the game you refuse to play you have thrown your cards under the table and run away to hide here amongst your hills  he tossed his straight hair back from his flashing eyes and scarcely interrupted to roll a long brown mexican cigarette  but the gods know it is an old trick all the generations of man have tried it and lost the gods know how to deal with such as you to pursue is to possess and to possess is to be sated and so you in your wisdom have refused any longer to pursue you have elected surcease very well you will become sated with surcease you say you have escaped satiety you have merely bartered it for senility and senility is another name for satiety it is satietys masquerade bah  but look at me i cried  carquinez was ever a demon for haling ones soul out and making rags and tatters of it  he looked me witheringly up and down  you see no signs i challenged  decay is insidious he retorted you are rotten ripe  i laughed and forgave him for his very deviltry but he refused to be forgiven  do i not know he asked the gods always win i have watched men play for years what seemed a winning game in the end they lost  dont you ever make mistakes i asked  he blew many meditative rings of smoke before replying  yes i was nearly fooled once let me tell you there was marvin fiske you remember him and his dantesque face and poets soul singing his chant of the flesh the very priest of love and there was ethel baird whom also you must remember  a warm saint i said  that is she holy as love and sweeter just a woman made for love and yethow shall i saydrenched through with holiness as your own air here is with the perfume of flowers well they married they played a hand with the gods  and they won they gloriously won i broke in  carquinez looked at me pityingly and his voice was like a funeral bell  they lost they supremely colossally lost  but the world believes otherwise i ventured coldly  the world conjectures the world sees only the face of things but i know has it ever entered your mind to wonder why she took the veil buried herself in that dolorous convent of the living dead  because she loved him so and when he died  speech was frozen on my lips by carquinezs sneer  a pat answer he said machinemade like a piece of cottondrill the worlds judgment and much the world knows about it like you she fled from life she was beaten she flung out the white flag of fatigue and no beleaguered city ever flew that flag in such bitterness and tears  now i shall tell you the whole tale and you must believe me for i know they had pondered the problem of satiety they loved love they knew to the uttermost farthing the value of love they loved him so well that they were fain to keep him always warm and athrill in their hearts they welcomed his coming they feared to have him depart  love was desire they held a delicious pain he was ever seeking easement and when he found that for which he sought he died love denied was love alive love granted was love deceased do you follow me they saw it was not the way of life to be hungry for what it has to eat and still be hungryman has never accomplished that feat the problem of satiety that is it to have and to keep the sharp famineedge of appetite at the groaning board this was their problem for they loved love often did they discuss it with all loves sweet ardours brimming in their eyes his ruddy blood spraying their cheeks his voice playing in and out with their voices now hiding as a tremolo in their throats and again shading a tone with that ineffable tenderness which he alone can utter  how do i know all this i sawmuch more i learned from her diary this i found in it from fiona macleod for truly that wandering voice that twilightwhisper that breath so dewysweet that flamewinged luteplayer whom none sees but for a moment in a rainbowshimmer of joy or a sudden lightningflare of passion this exquisite mystery we call amor comes to some rapt visionaries at least not with a song upon the lips that all may hear or with blithe viol of public music but as one wrought by ecstasy dumbly eloquent with desire  how to keep the flamewinged luteplayer with his dumb eloquence of desire to feast him was to lose him their love for each other was a great love their granaries were overflowing with plenitude yet they wanted to keep the sharp famineedge of their love undulled  nor were they lean little fledglings theorizing on the threshold of love they were robust and realized souls they had loved before with others in the days before they met and in those days they had throttled love with caresses and killed him with kisses and buried him in the pit of satiety  they were not cold wraiths this man and woman they were warm human they had no saxon soberness in their blood the colour of it was sunsetred they glowed with it temperamentally theirs was the french joy in the flesh they were idealists but their idealism was gallic it was not tempered by the chill and sombre fluid that for the english serves as blood there was no stoicism about them they were americans descended out of the english and yet the refraining and selfdenying of the english spiritgroping were not theirs  they were all this that i have said and they were made for joy only they achieved a concept a curse on concepts they played with logic and this was their logicbut first let me tell you of a talk we had one night it was of gautiers madeline de maupin you remember the maid she kissed once and once only and kisses she would have no more not that she found kisses were not sweet but that she feared with repetition they would cloy satiety again she tried to play without stakes against the gods now this is contrary to a rule of the game the gods themselves have made only the rules are not posted over the table mortals must play in order to learn the rules  well to the logic the man and the woman argued thus why kiss once only if to kiss once were wise was it not wiser to kiss not at all thus could they keep love alive fasting he would knock forever at their hearts  perhaps it was out of their heredity that they achieved this unholy concept the breed will out and sometimes most fantastically thus in them did cursed albion array herself a scheming wanton a bold coldcalculating and artful hussy after all i do not know but this i know it was out of their inordinate desire for joy that they forewent joy  as he said i read it long afterward in one of his letters to her to hold you in my arms close and yet not close to yearn for you and never to have you and so always to have you and she for you to be always just beyond my reach to be ever attaining you and yet never attaining you and for this to last forever always fresh and new and always with the first flush upon us  that is not the way they said it on my lips their lovephilosophy is mangled and who am i to delve into their soulstuff i am a frog on the dank edge of a great darkness gazing goggleeyed at the mystery and wonder of their flaming souls  and they were right as far as they went everything is good as long as it is unpossessed satiety and possession are deaths horses they run in span       and time could only tutor us to eke        our raptures warmth with customs afterglow  they got that from a sonnet of alfred austins it was called loves wisdom it was the one kiss of madeline de maupin how did it run       kiss we and part no further can we go        and better death than we from high to low    should dwindle or decline from strong to weak  but they were wiser they would not kiss and part they would not kiss at all and thus they planned to stay at loves topmost peak they married you were in england at the time and never was there such a marriage they kept their secret to themselves i did not know then their raptures warmth did not cool their love burned with increasing brightness never was there anything like it the time passed the months the years and ever the flamewinged luteplayer grew more resplendent  everybody marvelled they became the wonderful lovers and they were greatly envied sometimes women pitied her because she was childless it is the form the envy of such creatures takes  and i did not know their secret i pondered and i marvelled as first i had expected subconsciously i imagine the passing of their love then i became aware that it was time that passed and love that remained then i became curious what was their secret what were the magic fetters with which they bound love to them how did they hold the graceless elf what elixir of eternal love had they drunk together as had tristram and iseult of old time and whose hand had brewed the fairy drink  as i say i was curious and i watched them they were lovemad they lived in an unending revel of love they made a pomp and ceremonial of it they saturated themselves in the art and poetry of love no they were not neurotics they were sane and healthy and they were artists but they had accomplished the impossible they had achieved deathless desire  and i i saw much of them and their everlasting miracle of love i puzzled and wondered and then one day  carquinez broke off abruptly and asked have you ever read loves waiting time  i shook my head  page wrote itcurtis hidden page i think well it was that bit of verse that gave me the clue one day in the windowseat near the big pianoyou remember how she could play she used to laugh sometimes and doubt whether it was for them i came or for the music she called me a musicsot once a sounddebauchee what a voice he had when he sang i believed in immortality my regard for the gods grew almost patronizing and i devised ways and means whereby i surely could outwit them and their tricks  it was a spectacle for god that man and woman years married and singing lovesongs with a freshness virginal as newborn love himself with a ripeness and wealth of ardour that young lovers can never know young lovers were pale and anaemic beside that longmarried pair to see them all fire and flame and tenderness at a trembling distance lavishing caresses of eye and voice with every action through every silencetheir love driving them toward each other and they withholding like fluttering moths each to the other a candleflame and revolving each about the other in the mad gyrations of an amazing orbitflight it seemed in obedience to some great law of physics more potent than gravitation and more subtle that they must corporeally melt each into each there before my very eyes small wonder they were called the wonderful lovers  i have wandered now to the clue one day in the windowseat i found a book of verse it opened of itself betraying long habit to loves waiting time the page was thumbed and limp with overhandling and there i read       so sweet it is to stand but just apart        to know each other better and to keep        the soft delicious sense of two that touch         o love not yet  sweet let us keep our love        wrapped round with sacred mystery awhile        waiting the secret of the coming years        that come not yet not yet sometime                     not yet         oh yet a little while our love may grow        when it has blossomed it will haply die        feed it with lipless kisses let it sleep        bedded in dead denial yet some while        oh yet a little while a little while  i folded the book on my thumb and sat there silent and without moving for a long time i was stunned by the clearness of vision the verse had imparted to me it was illumination it was like a bolt of gods lightning in the pit they would keep love the fickle sprite the forerunner of young lifeyoung life that is imperative to be born  i conned the lines over in my mindnot yet sometimeo love not yetfeed it with lipless kisses let it sleep and i laughed aloud ha ha i saw with white vision their blameless souls they were children they did not understand they played with natures fire and bedded with a naked sword they laughed at the gods they would stop the cosmic sap they had invented a system and brought it to the gamingtable of life and expected to win out beware i cried the gods are behind the table they make new rules for every system that is devised you have no chance to win  but i did not so cry to them i waited they would learn that their system was worthless and throw it away they would be content with whatever happiness the gods gave them and not strive to wrest more away  i watched i said nothing the months continued to come and go and still the famineedge of their love grew the sharper never did they dull it with a permitted loveclasp they ground and whetted it on selfdenial and sharper and sharper it grew this went on until even i doubted did the gods sleep i wondered or were they dead i laughed to myself the man and the woman had made a miracle they had outwitted god they had shamed the flesh and blackened the face of the good earth mother they had played with her fire and not been burned they were immune they were themselves gods knowing good from evil and tasting not was this the way gods came to be i asked myself i am a frog i said but for my mudlidded eyes i should have been blinded by the brightness of this wonder i have witnessed i have puffed myself up with my wisdom and passed judgment upon gods  yet even in this my latest wisdom i was wrong they were not gods they were man and womansoft clay that sighed and thrilled shot through with desire thumbed with strange weaknesses which the gods have not  carquinez broke from his narrative to roll another cigarette and to laugh harshly it was not a pretty laugh it was like the mockery of a devil and it rose over and rode the roar of the storm that came muffled to our ears from the crashing outside world  i am a frog he said apologetically how were they to understand they were artists not biologists they knew the clay of the studio but they did not know the clay of which they themselves were made but this i will saythey played high never was there such a game before and i doubt me if there will ever be such a game again  never was lovers ecstasy like theirs they had not killed love with kisses they had quickened him with denial and by denial they drove him on till he was all aburst with desire and the flamewinged luteplayer fanned them with his warm wings till they were all but swooning it was the very delirium of love and it continued undiminished and increasing through the weeks and months  they longed and yearned with all the fond pangs and sweet delicious agonies with an intensity never felt by lovers before nor since  and then one day the drowsy gods ceased nodding they aroused and looked at the man and woman who had made a mock of them and the man and woman looked into each others eyes one morning and knew that something was gone it was the flamewinged one he had fled silently in the night from their anchorites board  they looked into each others eyes and knew that they did not care desire was dead do you understand desire was dead and they had never kissed not once had they kissed love was gone they would never yearn and burn again for them there was nothing leftno more tremblings and flutterings and delicious anguishes no more throbbing and pulsing and sighing and song desire was dead it had died in the night on a couch cold and unattended nor had they witnessed its passing they learned it for the first time in each others eyes  the gods may not be kind but they are often merciful they had twirled the little ivory ball and swept the stakes from the table all that remained was the man and woman gazing into each others cold eyes and then he died that was the mercy within the week marvin fiske was deadyou remember the accident and in her diary written at this time i long afterward read mitchell kennerlys       there was not a single hour        we might have kissed and did not kiss  oh the irony of it i cried out  and carquinez in the firelight a veritable mephistopheles in velvet jacket fixed me with his black eyes  and they won you said the worlds judgment i have told you and i know they won as you are winning here in your hills  but you i demanded hotly you with your orgies of sound and sense with your mad cities and madder frolicsbethink you that you win  he shook his head slowly because you with your sober bucolic regime lose is no reason that i should win we never win sometimes we think we win that is a little pleasantry of the gods     the apostate       now i wake me up to work       i pray the lord i may not shirk       if i should die before the night       i pray the lord my works all right                                     amen  if you dont git up johnny i wont give you a bite to eat  the threat had no effect on the boy he clung stubbornly to sleep fighting for its oblivion as the dreamer fights for his dream the boys hands loosely clenched themselves and he made feeble spasmodic blows at the air these blows were intended for his mother but she betrayed practised familiarity in avoiding them as she shook him roughly by the shoulder  lemme lone  it was a cry that began muffled in the deeps of sleep that swiftly rushed upward like a wail into passionate belligerence and that died away and sank down into an inarticulate whine it was a bestial cry as of a soul in torment filled with infinite protest and pain  but she did not mind she was a sadeyed tiredfaced woman and she had grown used to this task which she repeated every day of her life she got a grip on the bedclothes and tried to strip them down but the boy ceasing his punching clung to them desperately in a huddle at the foot of the bed he still remained covered then she tried dragging the bedding to the floor the boy opposed her she braced herself hers was the superior weight and the boy and bedding gave the former instinctively following the latter in order to shelter against the chill of the room that bit into his body  as he toppled on the edge of the bed it seemed that he must fall headfirst to the floor but consciousness fluttered up in him he righted himself and for a moment perilously balanced then he struck the floor on his feet on the instant his mother seized him by the shoulders and shook him again his fists struck out this time with more force and directness at the same time his eyes opened she released him he was awake  all right he mumbled  she caught up the lamp and hurried out leaving him in darkness  youll be docked she warned back to him  he did not mind the darkness when he had got into his clothes he went out into the kitchen his tread was very heavy for so thin and light a boy his legs dragged with their own weight which seemed unreasonable because they were such skinny legs he drew a brokenbottomed chair to the table  johnny his mother called sharply  he arose as sharply from the chair and without a word went to the sink it was a greasy filthy sink a smell came up from the outlet he took no notice of it that a sink should smell was to him part of the natural order just as it was a part of the natural order that the soap should be grimy with dishwater and hard to lather nor did he try very hard to make it lather several splashes of the cold water from the running faucet completed the function he did not wash his teeth for that matter he had never seen a toothbrush nor did he know that there existed beings in the world who were guilty of so great a foolishness as tooth washing  you might wash yourself wunst a day without bein told his mother complained  she was holding a broken lid on the pot as she poured two cups of coffee he made no remark for this was a standing quarrel between them and the one thing upon which his mother was hard as adamant wunst a day it was compulsory that he should wash his face he dried himself on a greasy towel damp and dirty and ragged that left his face covered with shreds of lint  i wish we didnt live so far away she said as he sat down i try to do the best i can you know that but a dollar on the rent is such a savin an weve more room here you know that  he scarcely followed her he had heard it all before many times the range of her thought was limited and she was ever harking back to the hardship worked upon them by living so far from the mills  a dollar means more grub he remarked sententiously id sooner do the walkin an git the grub  he ate hurriedly half chewing the bread and washing the unmasticated chunks down with coffee the hot and muddy liquid went by the name of coffee johnny thought it was coffeeand excellent coffee that was one of the few of lifes illusions that remained to him he had never drunk real coffee in his life  in addition to the bread there was a small piece of cold pork his mother refilled his cup with coffee as he was finishing the bread he began to watch if more was forthcoming she intercepted his questioning glance  now dont be hoggish johnny was her comment youve had your share your brothers an sisters are smallern you  he did not answer the rebuke he was not much of a talker also he ceased his hungry glancing for more he was uncomplaining with a patience that was as terrible as the school in which it had been learned he finished his coffee wiped his mouth on the back of his hand and started to rise  wait a second she said hastily i guess the loaf kin stand you another slicea thin un  there was legerdemain in her actions with all the seeming of cutting a slice from the loaf for him she put loaf and slice back in the bread box and conveyed to him one of her own two slices she believed she had deceived him but he had noted her sleightofhand nevertheless he took the bread shamelessly he had a philosophy that his mother because of her chronic sickliness was not much of an eater anyway  she saw that he was chewing the bread dry and reached over and emptied her coffee cup into his  dont set good somehow on my stomach this morning she explained  a distant whistle prolonged and shrieking brought both of them to their feet she glanced at the tin alarmclock on the shelf the hands stood at halfpast five the rest of the factory world was just arousing from sleep she drew a shawl about her shoulders and on her head put a dingy hat shapeless and ancient  weve got to run she said turning the wick of the lamp and blowing down the chimney  they groped their way out and down the stairs it was clear and cold and johnny shivered at the first contact with the outside air the stars had not yet begun to pale in the sky and the city lay in blackness both johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked there was no ambition in the leg muscles to swing the feet clear of the ground  after fifteen silent minutes his mother turned off to the right  dont be late was her final warning from out of the dark that was swallowing her up  he made no response steadily keeping on his way in the factory quarter doors were opening everywhere and he was soon one of a multitude that pressed onward through the dark as he entered the factory gate the whistle blew again he glanced at the east across a ragged skyline of housetops a pale light was beginning to creep this much he saw of the day as he turned his back upon it and joined his work gang  he took his place in one of many long rows of machines before him above a bin filled with small bobbins were large bobbins revolving rapidly upon these he wound the jutetwine of the small bobbins the work was simple all that was required was celerity the small bobbins were emptied so rapidly and there were so many large bobbins that did the emptying that there were no idle moments  he worked mechanically when a small bobbin ran out he used his left hand for a brake stopping the large bobbin and at the same time with thumb and forefinger catching the flying end of twine also at the same time with his right hand he caught up the loose twineend of a small bobbin these various acts with both hands were performed simultaneously and swiftly then there would come a flash of his hands as he looped the weavers knot and released the bobbin there was nothing difficult about weavers knots he once boasted he could tie them in his sleep and for that matter he sometimes did toiling centuries long in a single night at tying an endless succession of weavers knots  some of the boys shirked wasting time and machinery by not replacing the small bobbins when they ran out and there was an overseer to prevent this he caught johnnys neighbour at the trick and boxed his ears  look at johnny therewhy aint you like him the overseer wrathfully demanded  johnnys bobbins were running full blast but he did not thrill at the indirect praise there had been a time but that was long ago very long ago his apathetic face was expressionless as he listened to himself being held up as a shining example he was the perfect worker he knew that he had been told so often it was a commonplace and besides it didnt seem to mean anything to him any more from the perfect worker he had evolved into the perfect machine when his work went wrong it was with him as with the machine due to faulty material it would have been as possible for a perfect naildie to cut imperfect nails as for him to make a mistake  and small wonder there had never been a time when he had not been in intimate relationship with machines machinery had almost been bred into him and at any rate he had been brought up on it twelve years before there had been a small flutter of excitement in the loom room of this very mill johnnys mother had fainted they stretched her out on the floor in the midst of the shrieking machines a couple of elderly women were called from their looms the foreman assisted and in a few minutes there was one more soul in the loom room than had entered by the doors it was johnny born with the pounding crashing roar of the looms in his ears drawing with his first breath the warm moist air that was thick with flying lint he had coughed that first day in order to rid his lungs of the lint and for the same reason he had coughed ever since  the boy alongside of johnny whimpered and sniffed the boys face was convulsed with hatred for the overseer who kept a threatening eye on him from a distance but every bobbin was running full the boy yelled terrible oaths into the whirling bobbins before him but the sound did not carry half a dozen feet the roaring of the room holding it in and containing it like a wall  of all this johnny took no notice he had a way of accepting things besides things grow monotonous by repetition and this particular happening he had witnessed many times it seemed to him as useless to oppose the overseer as to defy the will of a machine machines were made to go in certain ways and to perform certain tasks it was the same with the overseer  but at eleven oclock there was excitement in the room in an apparently occult way the excitement instantly permeated everywhere the onelegged boy who worked on the other side of johnny bobbed swiftly across the floor to a bin truck that stood empty into this he dived out of sight crutch and all the superintendent of the mill was coming along accompanied by a young man he was well dressed and wore a starched shirta gentleman in johnnys classification of men and also the inspector  he looked sharply at the boys as he passed along sometimes he stopped and asked questions when he did so he was compelled to shout at the top of his lungs at which moments his face was ludicrously contorted with the strain of making himself heard his quick eye noted the empty machine alongside of johnnys but he said nothing johnny also caught his eye and he stopped abruptly he caught johnny by the arm to draw him back a step from the machine but with an exclamation of surprise he released the arm  pretty skinny the superintendent laughed anxiously  pipe stems was the answer look at those legs the boys got the ricketsincipient but hes got them if epilepsy doesnt get him in the end it will be because tuberculosis gets him first  johnny listened but did not understand furthermore he was not interested in future ills there was an immediate and more serious ill that threatened him in the form of the inspector  now my boy i want you to tell me the truth the inspector said or shouted bending close to the boys ear to make him hear how old are you  fourteen johnny lied and he lied with the full force of his lungs so loudly did he lie that it started him off in a dry hacking cough that lifted the lint which had been settling in his lungs all morning  looks sixteen at least said the superintendent  or sixty snapped the inspector  hes always looked that way  how long asked the inspector quickly  for years never gets a bit older  or younger i dare say i suppose hes worked here all those years  off and onbut that was before the new law was passed the superintendent hastened to add  machine idle the inspector asked pointing at the unoccupied machine beside johnnys in which the partfilled bobbins were flying like mad  looks that way the superintendent motioned the overseer to him and shouted in his ear and pointed at the machine machines idle he reported back to the inspector  they passed on and johnny returned to his work relieved in that the ill had been averted but the onelegged boy was not so fortunate the sharpeyed inspector haled him out at arms length from the bin truck his lips were quivering and his face had all the expression of one upon whom was fallen profound and irremediable disaster the overseer looked astounded as though for the first time he had laid eyes on the boy while the superintendents face expressed shock and displeasure  i know him the inspector said hes twelve years old ive had him discharged from three factories inside the year this makes the fourth  he turned to the onelegged boy you promised me word and honour that youd go to school  the onelegged boy burst into tears please mr inspector two babies died on us and were awful poor  what makes you cough that way the inspector demanded as though charging him with crime  and as in denial of guilt the onelegged boy replied it aint nothin i jes caught a cold last week mr inspector thats all  in the end the onelegged boy went out of the room with the inspector the latter accompanied by the anxious and protesting superintendent after that monotony settled down again the long morning and the longer afternoon wore away and the whistle blew for quitting time darkness had already fallen when johnny passed out through the factory gate in the interval the sun had made a golden ladder of the sky flooded the world with its gracious warmth and dropped down and disappeared in the west behind a ragged skyline of housetops  supper was the family meal of the daythe one meal at which johnny encountered his younger brothers and sisters it partook of the nature of an encounter to him for he was very old while they were distressingly young he had no patience with their excessive and amazing juvenility he did not understand it his own childhood was too far behind him he was like an old and irritable man annoyed by the turbulence of their young spirits that was to him arrant silliness he glowered silently over his food finding compensation in the thought that they would soon have to go to work that would take the edge off of them and make them sedate and dignifiedlike him thus it was after the fashion of the human that johnny made of himself a yardstick with which to measure the universe  during the meal his mother explained in various ways and with infinite repetition that she was trying to do the best she could so that it was with relief the scant meal ended that johnny shoved back his chair and arose he debated for a moment between bed and the front door and finally went out the latter he did not go far he sat down on the stoop his knees drawn up and his narrow shoulders drooping forward his elbows on his knees and the palms of his hands supporting his chin  as he sat there he did no thinking he was just resting so far as his mind was concerned it was asleep his brothers and sisters came out and with other children played noisily about him an electric globe at the corner lighted their frolics he was peevish and irritable that they knew but the spirit of adventure lured them into teasing him they joined hands before him and keeping time with their bodies chanted in his face weird and uncomplimentary doggerel at first he snarled curses at themcurses he had learned from the lips of various foremen finding this futile and remembering his dignity he relapsed into dogged silence  his brother will next to him in age having just passed his tenth birthday was the ringleader johnny did not possess particularly kindly feelings toward him his life had early been embittered by continual giving over and giving way to will he had a definite feeling that will was greatly in his debt and was ungrateful about it in his own playtime far back in the dim past he had been robbed of a large part of that playtime by being compelled to take care of will will was a baby then and then as now their mother had spent her days in the mills to johnny had fallen the part of little father and little mother as well  will seemed to show the benefit of the giving over and the giving way he was wellbuilt fairly rugged as tall as his elder brother and even heavier it was as though the lifeblood of the one had been diverted into the others veins and in spirits it was the same johnny was jaded worn out without resilience while his younger brother seemed bursting and spilling over with exuberance  the mocking chant rose louder and louder will leaned closer as he danced thrusting out his tongue johnnys left arm shot out and caught the other around the neck at the same time he rapped his bony fist to the others nose it was a pathetically bony fist but that it was sharp to hurt was evidenced by the squeal of pain it produced the other children were uttering frightened cries while johnnys sister jennie had dashed into the house  he thrust will from him kicked him savagely on the shins then reached for him and slammed him face downward in the dirt nor did he release him till the face had been rubbed into the dirt several times then the mother arrived an anaemic whirlwind of solicitude and maternal wrath  why cant he leave me alone was johnnys reply to her upbraiding cant he see im tired  im as big as you will raged in her arms his face a mass of tears dirt and blood im as big as you now an im goin to git bigger then ill lick yousee if i dont  you ought to be to work seein how big you are johnny snarled thats whats the matter with you you ought to be to work an its up to your ma to put you to work  but hes too young she protested hes only a little boy  i was youngern him when i started to work  johnnys mouth was open further to express the sense of unfairness that he felt but the mouth closed with a snap he turned gloomily on his heel and stalked into the house and to bed the door of his room was open to let in warmth from the kitchen as he undressed in the semidarkness he could hear his mother talking with a neighbour woman who had dropped in his mother was crying and her speech was punctuated with spiritless sniffles  i cant make out whats gittin into johnny he could hear her say he didnt used to be this way he was a patient little angel  an he is a good boy she hastened to defend hes worked faithful an he did go to work too young but it wasnt my fault i do the best i can im sure  prolonged sniffling from the kitchen and johnny murmured to himself as his eyelids closed down you betcher life ive worked faithful  the next morning he was torn bodily by his mother from the grip of sleep then came the meagre breakfast the tramp through the dark and the pale glimpse of day across the housetops as he turned his back on it and went in through the factory gate it was another day of all the days and all the days were alike  and yet there had been variety in his lifeat the times he changed from one job to another or was taken sick when he was six he was little mother and father to will and the other children still younger at seven he went into the millswinding bobbins when he was eight he got work in another mill his new job was marvellously easy all he had to do was to sit down with a little stick in his hand and guide a stream of cloth that flowed past him this stream of cloth came out of the maw of a machine passed over a hot roller and went on its way elsewhere but he sat always in one place beyond the reach of daylight a gasjet flaring over him himself part of the mechanism  he was very happy at that job in spite of the moist heat for he was still young and in possession of dreams and illusions and wonderful dreams he dreamed as he watched the steaming cloth streaming endlessly by but there was no exercise about the work no call upon his mind and he dreamed less and less while his mind grew torpid and drowsy nevertheless he earned two dollars a week and two dollars represented the difference between acute starvation and chronic underfeeding  but when he was nine he lost his job measles was the cause of it after he recovered he got work in a glass factory the pay was better and the work demanded skill it was piecework and the more skilful he was the bigger wages he earned here was incentive and under this incentive he developed into a remarkable worker  it was simple work the tying of glass stoppers into small bottles at his waist he carried a bundle of twine he held the bottles between his knees so that he might work with both hands thus in a sitting position and bending over his own knees his narrow shoulders grew humped and his chest was contracted for ten hours each day this was not good for the lungs but he tied three hundred dozen bottles a day  the superintendent was very proud of him and brought visitors to look at him in ten hours three hundred dozen bottles passed through his hands this meant that he had attained machinelike perfection all waste movements were eliminated every motion of his thin arms every movement of a muscle in the thin fingers was swift and accurate he worked at high tension and the result was that he grew nervous at night his muscles twitched in his sleep and in the daytime he could not relax and rest he remained keyed up and his muscles continued to twitch also he grew sallow and his lintcough grew worse then pneumonia laid hold of the feeble lungs within the contracted chest and he lost his job in the glassworks  now he had returned to the jute mills where he had first begun with winding bobbins but promotion was waiting for him he was a good worker he would next go on the starcher and later he would go into the loom room there was nothing after that except increased efficiency  the machinery ran faster than when he had first gone to work and his mind ran slower he no longer dreamed at all though his earlier years had been full of dreaming once he had been in love it was when he first began guiding the cloth over the hot roller and it was with the daughter of the superintendent she was much older than he a young woman and he had seen her at a distance only a paltry halfdozen times but that made no difference on the surface of the cloth stream that poured past him he pictured radiant futures wherein he performed prodigies of toil invented miraculous machines won to the mastership of the mills and in the end took her in his arms and kissed her soberly on the brow  but that was all in the long ago before he had grown too old and tired to love also she had married and gone away and his mind had gone to sleep yet it had been a wonderful experience and he used often to look back upon it as other men and women look back upon the time they believed in fairies he had never believed in fairies nor santa claus but he had believed implicitly in the smiling future his imagination had wrought into the steaming cloth stream  he had become a man very early in life at seven when he drew his first wages began his adolescence a certain feeling of independence crept up in him and the relationship between him and his mother changed somehow as an earner and breadwinner doing his own work in the world he was more like an equal with her manhood fullblown manhood had come when he was eleven at which time he had gone to work on the night shift for six months no child works on the night shift and remains a child  there had been several great events in his life one of these had been when his mother bought some california prunes two others had been the two times when she cooked custard those had been events he remembered them kindly and at that time his mother had told him of a blissful dish she would sometime makefloating island she had called it better than custard for years he had looked forward to the day when he would sit down to the table with floating island before him until at last he had relegated the idea of it to the limbo of unattainable ideals  once he found a silver quarter lying on the sidewalk that also was a great event in his life withal a tragic one he knew his duty on the instant the silver flashed on his eyes before even he had picked it up at home as usual there was not enough to eat and home he should have taken it as he did his wages every saturday night right conduct in this case was obvious but he never had any spending of his money and he was suffering from candy hunger he was ravenous for the sweets that only on redletter days he had ever tasted in his life  he did not attempt to deceive himself he knew it was sin and deliberately he sinned when he went on a fifteencent candy debauch ten cents he saved for a future orgy but not being accustomed to the carrying of money he lost the ten cents this occurred at the time when he was suffering all the torments of conscience and it was to him an act of divine retribution he had a frightened sense of the closeness of an awful and wrathful god god had seen and god had been swift to punish denying him even the full wages of sin  in memory he always looked back upon that as the one great criminal deed of his life and at the recollection his conscience always awoke and gave him another twinge it was the one skeleton in his closet also being so made and circumstanced he looked back upon the deed with regret he was dissatisfied with the manner in which he had spent the quarter he could have invested it better and out of his later knowledge of the quickness of god he would have beaten god out by spending the whole quarter at one fell swoop in retrospect he spent the quarter a thousand times and each time to better advantage  there was one other memory of the past dim and faded but stamped into his soul everlasting by the savage feet of his father it was more like a nightmare than a remembered vision of a concrete thingmore like the racememory of man that makes him fall in his sleep and that goes back to his arboreal ancestry  this particular memory never came to johnny in broad daylight when he was wide awake it came at night in bed at the moment that his consciousness was sinking down and losing itself in sleep it always aroused him to frightened wakefulness and for the moment in the first sickening start it seemed to him that he lay crosswise on the foot of the bed in the bed were the vague forms of his father and mother he never saw what his father looked like he had but one impression of his father and that was that he had savage and pitiless feet  his earlier memories lingered with him but he had no late memories all days were alike yesterday or last year were the same as a thousand yearsor a minute nothing ever happened there were no events to mark the march of time time did not march it stood always still it was only the whirling machines that moved and they moved nowherein spite of the fact that they moved faster  when he was fourteen he went to work on the starcher it was a colossal event something had at last happened that could be remembered beyond a nights sleep or a weeks payday it marked an era it was a machine olympiad a thing to date from when i went to work on the starcher or after or before i went to work on the starcher were sentences often on his lips  he celebrated his sixteenth birthday by going into the loom room and taking a loom here was an incentive again for it was piecework and he excelled because the clay of him had been moulded by the mills into the perfect machine at the end of three months he was running two looms and later three and four  at the end of his second year at the looms he was turning out more yards than any other weaver and more than twice as much as some of the less skilful ones and at home things began to prosper as he approached the full stature of his earning power not however that his increased earnings were in excess of need the children were growing up they ate more and they were going to school and schoolbooks cost money and somehow the faster he worked the faster climbed the prices of things even the rent went up though the house had fallen from bad to worse disrepair  he had grown taller but with his increased height he seemed leaner than ever also he was more nervous with the nervousness increased his peevishness and irritability the children had learned by many bitter lessons to fight shy of him his mother respected him for his earning power but somehow her respect was tinctured with fear  there was no joyousness in life for him the procession of the days he never saw the nights he slept away in twitching unconsciousness the rest of the time he worked and his consciousness was machine consciousness outside this his mind was a blank he had no ideals and but one illusion namely that he drank excellent coffee he was a workbeast he had no mental life whatever yet deep down in the crypts of his mind unknown to him were being weighed and sifted every hour of his toil every movement of his hands every twitch of his muscles and preparations were making for a future course of action that would amaze him and all his little world  it was in the late spring that he came home from work one night aware of unusual tiredness there was a keen expectancy in the air as he sat down to the table but he did not notice he went through the meal in moody silence mechanically eating what was before him the children umd and ahd and made smacking noises with their mouths but he was deaf to them  dye know what youre eatin his mother demanded at last desperately  he looked vacantly at the dish before him and vacantly at her  floatin island she announced triumphantly  oh he said  floating island the children chorussed loudly  oh he said and after two or three mouthfuls he added i guess i aint hungry tonight  he dropped the spoon shoved back his chair and arose wearily from the table  an i guess ill go to bed  his feet dragged more heavily than usual as he crossed the kitchen floor undressing was a titans task a monstrous futility and he wept weakly as he crawled into bed one shoe still on he was aware of a rising swelling something inside his head that made his brain thick and fuzzy his lean fingers felt as big as his wrist while in the ends of them was a remoteness of sensation vague and fuzzy like his brain the small of his back ached intolerably all his bones ached he ached everywhere and in his head began the shrieking pounding crashing roaring of a million looms all space was filled with flying shuttles they darted in and out intricately amongst the stars he worked a thousand looms himself and ever they speeded up faster and faster and his brain unwound faster and faster and became the thread that fed the thousand flying shuttles  he did not go to work next morning he was too busy weaving colossally on the thousand looms that ran inside his head his mother went to work but first she sent for the doctor it was a severe attack of la grippe he said jennie served as nurse and carried out his instructions  it was a very severe attack and it was a week before johnny dressed and tottered feebly across the floor another week the doctor said and he would be fit to return to work the foreman of the loom room visited him on sunday afternoon the first day of his convalescence the best weaver in the room the foreman told his mother his job would be held for him he could come back to work a week from monday  why dont you thank im johnny his mother asked anxiously  hes ben that sick he aint himself yet she explained apologetically to the visitor  johnny sat hunched up and gazing steadfastly at the floor he sat in the same position long after the foreman had gone it was warm outdoors and he sat on the stoop in the afternoon sometimes his lips moved he seemed lost in endless calculations  next morning after the day grew warm he took his seat on the stoop he had pencil and paper this time with which to continue his calculations and he calculated painfully and amazingly  what comes after millions he asked at noon when will came home from school an how dye work em  that afternoon finished his task each day but without paper and pencil he returned to the stoop he was greatly absorbed in the one tree that grew across the street he studied it for hours at a time and was unusually interested when the wind swayed its branches and fluttered its leaves throughout the week he seemed lost in a great communion with himself on sunday sitting on the stoop he laughed aloud several times to the perturbation of his mother who had not heard him laugh for years  next morning in the early darkness she came to his bed to rouse him he had had his fill of sleep all the week and awoke easily he made no struggle nor did he attempt to hold on to the bedding when she stripped it from him he lay quietly and spoke quietly  it aint no use ma  youll be late she said under the impression that he was still stupid with sleep  im awake ma an i tell you it aint no use you might as well lemme alone i aint goin to git up  but youll lose your job she cried  i aint goin to git up he repeated in a strange passionless voice  she did not go to work herself that morning this was sickness beyond any sickness she had ever known fever and delirium she could understand but this was insanity she pulled the bedding up over him and sent jennie for the doctor  when that person arrived johnny was sleeping gently and gently he awoke and allowed his pulse to be taken  nothing the matter with him the doctor reported badly debilitated thats all not much meat on his bones  hes always been that way his mother volunteered  now go way ma an let me finish my snooze  johnny spoke sweetly and placidly and sweetly and placidly he rolled over on his side and went to sleep  at ten oclock he awoke and dressed himself he walked out into the kitchen where he found his mother with a frightened expression on her face  im goin away ma he announced an i jes want to say goodbye  she threw her apron over her head and sat down suddenly and wept he waited patiently  i might aknown it she was sobbing  where she finally asked removing the apron from her head and gazing up at him with a stricken face in which there was little curiosity  i dont knowanywhere  as he spoke the tree across the street appeared with dazzling brightness on his inner vision it seemed to lurk just under his eyelids and he could see it whenever he wished  an your job she quavered  i aint never goin to work again  my god johnny she wailed dont say that  what he had said was blasphemy to her as a mother who hears her child deny god was johnnys mother shocked by his words  whats got into you anyway she demanded with a lame attempt at imperativeness  figures he answered jes figures ive ben doin a lot of figurin this week an its most surprisin  i dont see what thats got to do with it she sniffled  johnny smiled patiently and his mother was aware of a distinct shock at the persistent absence of his peevishness and irritability  ill show you he said im plum tired out what makes me tired moves ive ben movin ever since i was born im tired of movin an i aint goin to move any more remember when i worked in the glasshouse i used to do three hundred dozen a day now i reckon i made about ten different moves to each bottle thats thirtysix thousan moves a day ten days three hundred an sixty thousan moves one month one million an

aint going to do it any more im jes goin to set an set an rest an rest and then rest some more  but whats goin to come of will an the children she asked despairingly  thats it will an the children he repeated  but there was no bitterness in his voice he had long known his mothers ambition for the younger boy but the thought of it no longer rankled nothing mattered any more not even that  i know ma what youve ben plannin for willkeepin him in school to make a bookkeeper out of him but it aint no use ive quit hes got to go to work  an after i have brung you up the way i have she wept starting to

i reckon i didnt git enough to eat when he come along an was a kid i was workin an earnin grub for him too but thats done with will can go to work same as me or he can go to hell i dont care which im tired im goin now aint you goin to say goodbye  she made no reply the apron had gone over her head again and she was crying he paused a moment in the doorway  im sure i done the best i knew how she was sobbing  he passed out of the house and down the street a wan delight came into his face at the sight of the lone tree jes aint goin to do nothin he said to himself half aloud in a crooning tone he glanced wistfully up at the sky but the bright sun dazzled and blinded him  it was a long walk he took and he did not walk fast it took him past the jutemill the muffled roar of the loom room came to his ears and he smiled it was a gentle placid smile he hated no one not even the pounding shrieking machines there was no bitterness in him nothing but an inordinate hunger for rest  the houses and factories thinned out and the open spaces increased as he approached the country at last the city was behind him and he was walking down a leafy lane beside the railroad track he did not walk like a man he did not look like a man he was a travesty of the human it was a twisted and stunted and nameless piece of life that shambled like a sickly ape arms loosehanging stoopshouldered narrowchested grotesque and terrible  he passed by a small railroad station and lay down in the grass under a tree all afternoon he lay there sometimes he dozed with muscles that twitched in his sleep when awake he lay without movement watching the birds or looking up at the sky through the branches of the tree above him once or twice he laughed aloud but without relevance to anything he had seen or felt  after twilight had gone in the first darkness of the night a freight train rumbled into the station when the engine was switching cars on to the sidetrack johnny crept along the side of the train he pulled open the sidedoor of an empty boxcar and awkwardly and laboriously climbed in he closed the door the engine whistled johnny was lying down and in the darkness he smiled     a wicked woman  it was because she had broken with billy that loretta had come visiting to santa clara billy could not understand his sister had reported that he had walked the floor and cried all night loretta had not slept all night either while she had wept most of the night daisy knew this because it was in her arms that the weeping had been done and daisys husband captain kitt knew too the tears of loretta and the comforting by daisy had lost him some sleep  now captain kitt did not like to lose sleep neither did he want loretta to marry billynor anybody else it was captain kitts belief that daisy needed the help of her younger sister in the household but he did not say this aloud instead he always insisted that loretta was too young to think of marriage so it was captain kitts idea that loretta should be packed off on a visit to mrs hemingway there wouldnt be any billy there  before loretta had been at santa clara a week she was convinced that captain kitts idea was a good one in the first place though billy wouldnt believe it she did not want to marry billy and in the second place though captain kitt wouldnt believe it she did not want to leave daisy by the time loretta had been at santa clara two weeks she was absolutely certain that she did not want to marry billy but she was not so sure about not wanting to leave daisy not that she loved daisy less but that shehad doubts  the day of lorettas arrival a nebulous plan began shaping itself in mrs hemingways brain the second day she remarked to jack hemingway her husband that loretta was so innocent a young thing that were it not for her sweet guilelessness she would be positively stupid in proof of which mrs hemingway told her husband several things that made him chuckle by the third day mrs hemingways plan had taken recognizable form then it was that she composed a letter on the envelope she wrote mr edward bashford athenian club san francisco  dear ned the letter began she had once been violently loved by him for three weeks in her premarital days but she had covenanted herself to jack hemingway who had prior claims and her heart as well and ned bashford had philosophically not broken his heart over it he merely added the experience to a large fund of similarly collected data out of which he manufactured philosophy artistically and temperamentally he was a greeka tired greek he was fond of quoting from nietzsche in token that he too had passed through the long sickness that follows upon the ardent search for truth that he too had emerged too experienced too shrewd too profound ever again to be afflicted by the madness of youths in their love of truth to worship appearance he often quoted to believe in forms in tones in words in the whole olympus of appearance this particular excerpt he always concluded with those greeks were superficialout of profundity  he was a fairly young greek jaded and worn women were faithless and unveracious he heldat such times that he had relapses and descended to pessimism from his wonted high philosophical calm he did not believe in the truth of women but faithful to his german master he did not strip from them the airy gauzes that veiled their untruth he was content to accept them as appearances and to make the best of it he was superficialout of profundity  jack says to be sure to say to you good swimming mrs hemingway wrote in her letter and also to bring your fishing duds along mrs hemingway wrote other things in the letter she told him that at last she was prepared to exhibit to him an absolutely true unsullied and innocent woman a more guileless immaculate bud of womanhood never blushed on the planet was one of the several ways in which she phrased the inducement and to her husband she said triumphantly if i dont marry ned off this time leaving unstated the terrible alternative that she lacked either vocabulary to express or imagination to conceive  contrary to all her forebodings loretta found that she was not unhappy at santa clara truly billy wrote to her every day but his letters were less distressing than his presence also the ordeal of being away from daisy was not so severe as she had expected for the first time in her life she was not lost in eclipse in the blaze of daisys brilliant and mature personality under such favourable circumstances loretta came rapidly to the front while mrs hemingway modestly and shamelessly retreated into the background  loretta began to discover that she was not a pale orb shining by reflection quite unconsciously she became a small centre of things when she was at the piano there was some one to turn the pages for her and to express preferences for certain songs when she dropped her handkerchief there was some one to pick it up and there was some one to accompany her in ramblings and flower gatherings also she learned to cast flies in still pools and below savage riffles and how not to entangle silk lines and gutleaders with the shrubbery  jack hemingway did not care to teach beginners and fished much by himself or not at all thus giving ned bashford ample time in which to consider loretta as an appearance as such she was all that his philosophy demanded her blue eyes had the direct gaze of a boy and out of his profundity he delighted in them and forbore to shudder at the duplicity his philosophy bade him to believe lurked in their depths she had the grace of a slender flower the fragility of colour and line of fine china in all of which he pleasured greatly without thought of the life force palpitating beneath and in spite of bernard shawin whom he believed  loretta burgeoned she swiftly developed personality she discovered a will of her own and wishes of her own that were not everlastingly entwined with the will and the wishes of daisy she was petted by jack hemingway spoiled by alice hemingway and devotedly attended by ned bashford they encouraged her whims and laughed at her follies while she developed the pretty little tyrannies that are latent in all pretty and delicate women her environment acted as a soporific upon her ancient desire always to live with daisy this desire no longer prodded her as in the days of her companionship with billy the more she saw of billy the more certain she had been that she could not live away from daisy the more she saw of ned bashford the more she forgot her pressing need of daisy  ned bashford likewise did some forgetting he confused superficiality with profundity and entangled appearance with reality until he accounted them one loretta was different from other women there was no masquerade about her she was real he said as much to mrs hemingway and more who agreed with him and at the same time caught her husbands eyelid drooping down for the moment in an unmistakable wink  it was at this time that loretta received a letter from billy that was somewhat different from his others in the main like all his letters it was pathological it was a long recital of symptoms and sufferings his nervousness his sleeplessness and the state of his heart then followed reproaches such as he had never made before they were sharp enough to make her weep and true enough to put tragedy into her face this tragedy she carried down to the breakfast table it made jack and mrs hemingway speculative and it worried ned they glanced to him for explanation but he shook his head  ill find out tonight mrs hemingway said to her husband  but ned caught loretta in the afternoon in the big livingroom she tried to turn away he caught her hands and she faced him with wet lashes and trembling lips he looked at her silently and kindly the lashes grew wetter  there there dont cry little one he said soothingly  he put his arm protectingly around her shoulder and to his shoulder like a tired child she turned her face he thrilled in ways unusual for a greek who has recovered from the long sickness  oh ned she sobbed on his shoulder if you only knew how wicked i am  he smiled indulgently and breathed in a great breath freighted with the fragrance of her hair he thought of his worldexperience of women and drew another long breath there seemed to emanate from her the perfect sweetness of a childthe aura of a white soul was the way he phrased it to himself  then he noticed that her sobs were increasing  whats the matter little one he asked pettingly and almost paternally has jack been bullying you or has your dearly beloved sister failed to write  she did not answer and he felt that he really must kiss her hair that he could not be responsible if the situation continued much longer  tell me he said gently and well see what i can do  i cant you will despise meoh ned i am so ashamed  he laughed incredulously and lightly touched her hair with his lipsso lightly that she did not know  dear little one let us forget all about it whatever it is i want to tell you how i love  she uttered a sharp cry that was all delight and then moaned  too late  too late he echoed in surprise  oh why did i why did i she was moaning  he was aware of a swift chill at his heart  what he asked  oh i he billy  i am such a wicked woman ned i know you will never speak to me again  thiserthis billy he began haltingly he is your brother  no he i didnt know i was so young i could not help it oh i shall go mad i shall go mad  it was then that loretta felt his shoulder and the encircling arm become limp he drew away from her gently and gently he deposited her in a big chair where she buried her face and sobbed afresh he twisted his moustache fiercely then drew up another chair and sat down  ii do not understand he said  i am so unhappy she wailed  why unhappy  because he he wants me to marry him  his face cleared on the instant and he placed a hand soothingly on hers  that should not make any girl unhappy he remarked sagely because you dont love him is no reasonof course you dont love him  loretta shook her head and shoulders in a vigorous negative  what  bashford wanted to make sure  no she asserted explosively i dont love billy i dont want to love billy  because you dont love him bashford resumed with confidence is no reason that you should be unhappy just because he has proposed to you  she sobbed again and from the midst of her sobs she cried  thats the trouble i wish i did love him oh i wish i were dead  now my dear child you are worrying yourself over trifles his other hand crossed over after its mate and rested on hers women do it every day because you have changed your mind or did not know your mind because you haveto use an unnecessarily harsh wordjilted a man  jilted she had raised her head and was looking at him with teardimmed eyes oh ned if that were all  all he asked in a hollow voice while his hands slowly retreated from hers he was about to speak further then remained silent  but i dont want to marry him loretta broke forth protestingly  then i shouldnt he counselled  but i ought to marry him  ought to marry him  she nodded  that is a strong word  i know it is she acquiesced while she strove to control her trembling lips then she spoke more calmly i am a wicked woman a terribly wicked woman no one knows how wicked i amexcept billy  there was a pause ned bashfords face was grave and he looked queerly at loretta  hebilly knows he asked finally  a reluctant nod and flaming cheeks was the reply  he debated with himself for a while seeming like a diver to be preparing himself for the plunge  tell me about it he spoke very firmly you must tell me all of it  and will youeverforgive me she asked in a faint small voice  he hesitated drew a long breath and made the plunge  yes he said desperately ill forgive you go ahead  there was no one to tell me she began we were with each other so much i did not know anything of the worldthen  she paused to meditate bashford was biting his lip impatiently  if i had only known  she paused again  yes go on he urged  we were together almost every evening  billy he demanded with a savageness that startled her  yes of course billy we were with each other so much if i had only known there was no one to tell me i was so young  her lips parted as though to speak further and she regarded him anxiously  the scoundrel  with the explosion ned bashford was on his feet no longer a tired greek but a violently angry young man  billy is not a scoundrel he is a good man loretta defended with a firmness that surprised bashford  i suppose youll be telling me next that it was all your fault he said sarcastically  she nodded  what he shouted  it was all my fault she said steadily i should never have let him i was to blame  bashford ceased from his pacing up and down and when he spoke his voice was resigned  all right he said i dont blame you in the least loretta and you have been very honest but billy is right and you are wrong you must get married  to billy she asked in a dim faraway voice  yes to billy ill see to it where does he live ill make him  but i dont want to marry billy she cried out in alarm oh ned you wont do that  i shall he answered sternly you must and billy must do you understand  loretta buried her face in the cushioned chair back and broke into a passionate storm of sobs  all that bashford could make out at first as he listened was but i dont want to leave daisy i dont want to leave daisy  he paced grimly back and forth then stopped curiously to listen  how was i to knowboohoo loretta was crying he didnt tell me nobody else ever kissed me i never dreamed a kiss could be so terrible until boohoo until he wrote to me i only got the letter this morning  his face brightened it seemed as though light was dawning on him  is that what youre crying about  nno  his heart sank  then what are you crying about he asked in a hopeless voice  because you said i had to marry billy and i dont want to marry billy i dont want to leave daisy i dont know what i want i wish i were dead  he nerved himself for another effort  now look here loretta be sensible what is this about kisses you havent told me everything  ii dont want to tell you everything  she looked at him beseechingly in the silence that fell  must i she quavered finally  you must he said imperatively you must tell me everything  well then must i  you must  he i we she began flounderingly then blurted out i let him and he kissed me  go on bashford commanded desperately  thats all she answered  all there was a vast incredulity in his voice  all in her voice was an interrogation no less vast  i meanernothing worse he was overwhelmingly aware of his own awkwardness  worse she was frankly puzzled as though there could be billy said  when did he say it bashford demanded abruptly  in his letter i got this morning billy said that my our our kisses were terrible if we didnt get married  bashfords head was swimming  what else did billy say he asked  he said that when a woman allowed a man to kiss her she always married himthat it was terrible if she didnt it was the custom he said and i say it is a bad wicked custom and i dont like it i know im terrible she added defiantly but i cant help it  bashford absentmindedly brought out a cigarette  do you mind if i smoke he asked as he struck a match  then he came to himself  i beg your pardon he cried flinging away match and cigarette i dont want to smoke i didnt mean that at all what i mean is  he bent over loretta caught her hands in his then sat on the arm of the chair and softly put one arm around her  loretta i am a fool i mean it and i mean something more i want you to be my wife  he waited anxiously in the pause that followed  you might answer me he urged  i will if  yes go on if what  if i dont have to marry billy  you cant marry both of us he almost shouted  and it isnt the custom what what billy said  no it isnt the custom now loretta will you marry me  dont be angry with me she pouted demurely  he gathered her into his arms and kissed her  i wish it were the custom she said in a faint voice from the midst of the embrace because then id have to marry you ned dear wouldnt i     just meat  he strolled to the corner and glanced up and down the intersecting street but saw nothing save the oases of light shed by the street lamps at the successive crossings then he strolled back the way he had come he was a shadow of a man sliding noiselessly and without undue movement through the semidarkness also he was very alert like a wild animal in the jungle keenly perceptive and receptive the movement of another in the darkness about him would need to have been more shadowy than he to have escaped him  in addition to the running advertisement of the state of affairs carried to him by his senses he had a subtler perception a feel of the atmosphere around him he knew that the house in front of which he paused for a moment contained children yet by no willed effort of perception did he have this knowledge for that matter he was not even aware that he knew so occult was the impression yet did a moment arise in which action in relation to that house were imperative he would have acted on the assumption that it contained children he was not aware of all that he knew about the neighbourhood  in the same way he knew not how he knew that no danger threatened in the footfalls that came up the cross street before he saw the walker he knew him for a belated pedestrian hurrying home the walker came into view at the crossing and disappeared on up the street the man that watched noted a light that flared up in the window of a house on the corner and as it died down he knew it for an expiring match this was conscious identification of familiar phenomena and through his mind flitted the thought wanted to know what time in another house one room was lighted the light burned dimly and steadily and he had the feel that it was a sickroom  he was especially interested in a house across the street in the middle of the block to this house he paid most attention no matter what way he looked nor what way he walked his looks and his steps always returned to it except for an open window above the porch there was nothing unusual about the house nothing came in nor out nothing happened there were no lighted windows nor had lights appeared and disappeared in any of the windows yet it was the central point of his consideration he rallied to it each time after a divination of the state of the neighbourhood  despite his feel of things he was not confident he was supremely conscious of the precariousness of his situation though unperturbed by the footfalls of the chance pedestrian he was as keyed up and sensitive and ready to be startled as any timorous deer he was aware of the possibility of other intelligences prowling about in the darknessintelligences similar to his own in movement perception and divination  far down the street he caught a glimpse of something that moved and he knew it was no late homegoer but menace and danger he whistled twice to the house across the street then faded away shadowlike to the corner and around the corner here he paused and looked about him carefully reassured he peered back around the corner and studied the object that moved and that was coming nearer he had divined aright it was a policeman  the man went down the cross street to the next corner from the shelter of which he watched the corner he had just left he saw the policeman pass by going straight on up the street he paralleled the policemans course and from the next corner again watched him go by then he returned the way he had come he whistled once to the house across the street and after a time whistled once again there was reassurance in the whistle just as there had been warning in the previous double whistle  he saw a dark bulk outline itself on the roof of the porch and slowly descend a pillar then it came down the steps passed through the small iron gate and went down the sidewalk taking on the form of a man he that watched kept on his own side of the street and moved on abreast to the corner where he crossed over and joined the other he was quite small alongside the man he accosted  howd you make out matt he asked  the other grunted indistinctly and walked on in silence a few steps  i reckon i landed the goods he said  jim chuckled in the darkness and waited for further information the blocks passed by under their feet and he grew impatient  well how about them goods he asked what kind of a haul did you make anyway  i was too busy to figger it out but its fat i can tell you that much jim its fat i dont dast to think how fat it is wait till we get to the room  jim looked at him keenly under the street lamp of the next crossing and saw that his face was a trifle grim and that he carried his left arm peculiarly  whats the matter with your arm he demanded  the little cuss bit me hope i dont get hydrophoby folks gets hydrophoby from manbite sometimes dont they  gave you fight eh jim asked encouragingly  the other grunted  youre hardern hell to get information from jim burst out irritably tell us about it you aint goin to lose money just atellin a guy  i guess i choked him some came the answer then by way of explanation he woke up on me  you did it neat i never heard a sound  jim the other said with seriousness its a hangin matter i fixed m i had to he woke up on me you an mes got to do some layin low for a spell  jim gave a low whistle of comprehension  did you hear me whistle he asked suddenly  sure i was all done i was just comin out  it was a bull but he wasnt on a little bit went right by an kept apaddin the hoof out a sight then i come back an gave you the whistle what made you take so long after that  i was waitin to make sure matt explained i was mighty glad when i heard you whistle again its hard work waitin i just sat there an thought an thought oh all kinds of things its remarkable what a fellowll think about and then there was a darn cat that kept movin around the house all botherin me with its noises  an its fat jim exclaimed irrelevantly and with joy  im sure tellin you jim its fat im plum anxious for another look at em  unconsciously the two men quickened their pace yet they did not relax from their caution twice they changed their course in order to avoid policemen and they made very sure that they were not observed when they dived into the dark hallway of a cheap rooming house down town  not until they had gained their own room on the top floor did they scratch a match while jim lighted a lamp matt locked the door and threw the bolts into place as he turned he noticed that his partner was waiting expectantly matt smiled to himself at the others eagerness  them searchlights is all right he said drawing forth a small pocket electric lamp and examining it but we got to get a new battery its runnin pretty weak i thought once or twice itd leave me in the dark funny arrangements in that house i near got lost his room was on the left an that fooled me some  i told you it was on the left jim interrupted  you told me it was on the right matt went on i guess i know what you told me an theres the map you drew  fumbling in his vest pocket he drew out a folded slip of paper as he unfolded it jim bent over and looked  i did make a mistake he confessed  you sure did it got me guessin some for a while  but it dont matter now jim cried lets see what you got  it does matter matt retorted it matters a lot to me ive got to run all the risk i put my head in the trap while you stay on the street you got to get on to yourself an be more careful all right ill show you  he dipped loosely into his trousers pocket and brought out a handful of small diamonds he spilled them out in a blazing stream on the greasy table jim let out a great oath  thats nothing matt said with triumphant complacence i aint begun yet  from one pocket after another he continued bringing forth the spoil there were many diamonds wrapped in chamois skin that were larger than those in the first handful from one pocket he brought out a handful of very small cut gems  sun dust he remarked as he spilled them on the table in a space by themselves  jim examined them  just the same they retail for a couple of dollars each he said is that all  aint it enough the other demanded in an aggrieved tone  sure it is jim answered with unqualified approval bettern i expected i wouldnt take a cent less than ten thousan for the bunch  ten thousan matt sneered theyre worth twict that an i dont know anything about joolery either look at that big boy  he picked it out from the sparkling heap and held it near to the lamp with the air of an expert weighing and judging  worth a thousan all by its lonely was jims quicker judgment  a thousan your grandmother was matts scornful rejoinder you couldnt buy it for three  wake me up im dreamin the sparkle of the gems was in jims eyes and he began sorting out the larger diamonds and examining them were rich men mattwell be regular swells  itll take years to get rid of em was matts more practical thought  but think how well live nothin to do but spend the money an go on gettin rid of em  matts eyes were beginning to sparkle though sombrely as his phlegmatic nature woke up  i told you i didnt dast think how fat it was he murmured in a low voice  what a killin what a killin was the others more ecstatic utterance  i almost forgot matt said thrusting his hand into his inside coat pocket  a string of large pearls emerged from wrappings of tissue paper and chamois skin jim scarcely glanced at them  theyre worth money he said and returned to the diamonds  a silence fell on the two men jim played with the gems running them through his fingers sorting them into piles and spreading them out flat and wide he was a slender weazened man nervous irritable highstrung and anaemica typical child of the gutter with unbeautiful twisted features smalleyed with face and mouth perpetually and feverishly hungry brutish in a catlike way stamped to the core with degeneracy  matt did not finger the diamonds he sat with chin on hands and elbows on table blinking heavily at the blazing array he was in every way a contrast to the other no city had bred him he was heavymuscled and hairy gorillalike in strength and aspect for him there was no unseen world his eyes were full and wide apart and there seemed in them a certain bold brotherliness they inspired confidence but a closer inspection would have shown that his eyes were just a trifle too full just a shade too wide apart he exceeded spilled over the limits of normality and his features told lies about the man beneath  the bunch is worth fifty thousan jim remarked suddenly  a hundred thousan matt said  the silence returned and endured a long time to be broken again by jim  what in hell was he doin with em all at the housethats what i want to know id athought hed kept em in the safe down at the store  matt had just been considering the vision of the throttled man as he had last looked upon him in the dim light of the electric lantern but he did not start at the mention of him  theres no tellin he answered he might aben gettin ready to chuck his pardner he might apulled out in the mornin for parts unknown if we hadnt happened along i guess theres just as many thieves among honest men as there is among thieves you read about such things in the papers jim pardners is always knifin each other  a queer nervous look came into the others eyes matt did not betray that he noted it though he said  what was you thinkin about jim  jim was a trifle awkward for the moment  nothin he answered only i was thinkin just how funny it wasall them jools at his house what made you ask  nothin i was just wonderin that was all  the silence settled down broken by an occasional low and nervous giggle on the part of jim he was overcome by the spread of gems it was not that he felt their beauty he was unaware that they were beautiful in themselves but in them his swift imagination visioned the joys of life they would buy and all the desires and appetites of his diseased mind and sickly flesh were tickled by the promise they extended he builded wondrous orgyhaunted castles out of their brilliant fires and was appalled at what he builded then it was that he giggled it was all too impossible to be real and yet there they blazed on the table before him fanning the flame of the lust of him and he giggled again  i guess we might as well count em matt said suddenly tearing himself away from his own visions you watch me an see that its square because you an me has got to be on the square jim understand  jim did not like this and betrayed it in his eyes while matt did not like what he saw in his partners eyes  understand matt repeated almost menacingly  aint we always ben square the other replied on the defensive because of the treachery already whispering in him  it dont cost nothin bein square in hard times matt retorted its bein square in prosperity that counts when we aint got nothin we cant help bein square were prosperous now an weve got to be business menhonest business men understand  thats the talk for me jim approved but deep down in the meagre soul of himand in spite of himwanton and lawless thoughts were stirring like chained beasts  matt stepped to the food shelf behind the twoburner kerosene cooking stove he emptied the tea from a paper bag and from a second bag emptied some red peppers returning to the table with the bags he put into them the two sizes of small diamonds then he counted the large gems and wrapped them in their tissue paper and chamois skin  hundred an fortyseven goodsized ones was his inventory twenty real big ones two big boys and one whopper an a couple of fistfuls of teeny ones an dust  he looked at jim  correct was the response  he wrote the count out on a slip of memorandum paper and made a copy of it giving one slip to his partner and retaining the other  just for reference he said  again he had recourse to the food shelf where he emptied the sugar from a large paper bag into this he thrust the diamonds large and small wrapped it up in a bandanna handkerchief and stowed it away under his pillow then he sat down on the edge of the bed and took off his shoes  an you think theyre worth a hundred thousan jim asked pausing and looking up from the unlacing of his shoe  sure was the answer i seen a dancehouse girl down in arizona once with some big sparklers on her they wasnt real she said if they was she wouldnt be dancin said theyd be worth all of fifty thousan an she didnt have a dozen of em all told  whod work for a livin jim triumphantly demanded pick an shovel work he sneered work like a dog all my life an save all my wages an i wouldnt have half as much as we got tonight  dish washins about your measure an you couldnt get moren twenty a month an board your figgers is way off but your point is well taken let them that likes it work i rode range for thirty a month when i was young an foolish well im older an i aint ridin range  he got into bed on one side jim put out the light and followed him in on the other side  hows your arm feel jim queried amiably  such concern was unusual and matt noted it and replied  i guess theres no danger of hydrophoby what made you ask  jim felt in himself a guilty stir and under his breath he cursed the others way of asking disagreeable questions but aloud he answered  nothin only you seemed scared of it at first what are you goin to do with your share matt  buy a cattle ranch in arizona an set down an pay other men to ride range for me theres some several id like to see askin a job from me damn them an now you shut your face jim itll be some time before i buy that ranch just now im goin to sleep  but jim lay long awake nervous and twitching rolling about restlessly and rolling himself wide awake every time he dozed the diamonds still blazed under his eyelids and the fire of them hurt matt in spite of his heavy nature slept lightly like a wild animal alert in its sleep and jim noticed every time he moved that his partners body moved sufficiently to show that it had received the impression and that it was trembling on the verge of awakening for that matter jim did not know whether or not frequently the other was awake once quietly betokening complete consciousness matt said to him aw go to sleep jim dont worry about them jools theyll keep and jim had thought that at that particular moment matt had been surely asleep  in the late morning matt was awake with jims first movement and thereafter he awoke and dozed with him until midday when they got up together and began dressing  im goin out to get a paper an some bread matt said you boil the coffee  as jim listened unconsciously his gaze left matts face and roved to the pillow beneath which was the bundle wrapped in the bandanna handkerchief on the instant matts face became like a wild beasts  look here jim he snarled youve got to play square if you do me dirt ill fix you understand id eat you jim you know that id bite right into your throat an eat you like that much beefsteak  his sunburned skin was black with the surge of blood in it and his tobaccostained teeth were exposed by the snarling lips jim shivered and involuntarily cowered there was death in the man he looked at only the night before that blackfaced man had killed another with his hands and it had not hurt his sleep and in his own heart jim was aware of a sneaking guilt of a train of thought that merited all that was threatened  matt passed out leaving him still shivering then a hatred twisted his own face and he softly hurled savage curses at the door he remembered the jewels and hastened to the bed feeling under the pillow for the bandanna bundle he crushed it with his fingers to make certain that it still contained the diamonds assured that matt had not carried them away he looked toward the kerosene stove with a guilty start then he hurriedly lighted it filled the coffeepot at the sink and put it over the flame  the coffee was boiling when matt returned and while the latter cut the bread and put a slice of butter on the table jim poured out the coffee it was not until he sat down and had taken a few sips of the coffee that matt pulled out the morning paper from his pocket  we was way off he said i told you i didnt dast figger out how fat it was look at that  he pointed to the headlines on the first page  swift nemesis on bujannoffs track they read murdered in his sleep after robbing his partner  there you have it matt cried he robbed his partnerrobbed him like a dirty thief  half a million of jewels missin jim read aloud he put the paper down and stared at matt  thats what i told you the latter said what in hell do we know about jools half a millionan the best i could figger it was a hundred thousan go on an read the rest of it  they read on silently their heads side by side the untouched coffee growing cold and ever and anon one or the other burst forth with some salient printed fact  id like to seen metzners face when he opened the safe at the store this mornin jim gloated  he hit the high places right away for bujannoffs house matt explained go on an read  was to have sailed last night at ten on the sajoda for the south seassteamship delayed by extra freight  thats why we caught m in bed matt interrupted it was just lucklike pickin a fiftytoone winner  sajoda sailed at six this mornin  he didnt catch her matt said i saw his alarmclock was set at five thatd given m plenty of time only i come along an put the kibosh on his time go on  adolph metzner in despairthe famous haythorne pearl necklacemagnificently assorted pearlsvalued by experts at from fifty to seventy thousan dollars  jim broke off to swear vilely and solemnly concluding with those damn oystereggs worth all that money  he licked his lips and added they was beauties an no mistake  big brazilian gem he read on eighty thousan dollarsmany valuable gems of the first waterseveral thousan small diamonds well worth forty thousan  what you dont know about jools is worth knowin matt smiled goodhumouredly  theory of the sleuths jim read thieves must have knowncleverly kept watch on bujannoffs actionsmust have learned his plan and trailed him to his house with the fruits of his robbery  cleverhell matt broke out thats the way reputations is made in the noospapers howd we know he was robbin his pardner  anyway weve got the goods jim grinned lets look at em again  he assured himself that the door was locked and bolted while matt brought out the bundle in the bandanna and opened it on the table  aint they beauties though jim exclaimed at sight of the pearls and for a time he had eyes only for them accordin to the experts worth from fifty to seventy thousan dollars  an women like them things matt commented an theyll do everything to get emsell themselves commit murder anything  just like you an me  not on your life matt retorted ill commit murder for em but not for their own sakes but for sake of what theyll get me thats the difference women want the jools for themselves an i want the jools for the women an such things theyll get me  lucky that men an women dont want the same things jim remarked  thats what makes commerce matt agreed people wantin different things  in the middle of the afternoon jim went out to buy food while he was gone matt cleared the table of the jewels wrapping them up as before and putting them under the pillow then he lighted the kerosene stove and started to boil water for coffee a few minutes later jim returned  most surprising he remarked streets an stores an people just like they always was nothin changed an me walking along through it all a millionaire nobody looked at me an guessed it  matt grunted unsympathetically he had little comprehension of the lighter whims and fancies of his partners imagination  did you get a porterhouse he demanded  sure an an inch thick its a peach look at it  he unwrapped the steak and held it up for the others inspection then he made the coffee and set the table while matt fried the steak  dont put on too much of them red peppers jim warned i aint used to your mexican cookin you always season too hot  matt grunted a laugh and went on with his cooking jim poured out the coffee but first into the nicked china cup he emptied a powder he had carried in his vest pocket wrapped in a ricepaper he had turned his back for the moment on his partner but he did not dare to glance around at him matt placed a newspaper on the table and on the newspaper set the hot fryingpan he cut the steak in half and served jim and himself  eat her while shes hot he counselled and with knife and fork set the example  shes a dandy was jims judgment after his first mouthful but i tell you one thing straight im never goin to visit you on that arizona ranch so you neednt ask me  whats the matter now matt asked  hells the matter was the answer the mexican cookin on your ranchd be too much for me if ive got hell acomin in the next life im not goin to torment my insides in this one damned peppers  he smiled expelled his breath forcibly to cool his burning mouth drank some coffee and went on eating the steak  what do you think about the next life anyway matt he asked a little later while secretly he wondered why the other had not yet touched his coffee  aint no next life matt answered pausing from the steak to take his first sip of coffee nor heaven nor hell nor nothin you get all thats comin right here in this life  an afterward jim queried out of his morbid curiosity for he knew that he looked upon a man that was soon to die an afterward he repeated  did you ever see a man two weeks dead the other asked  jim shook his head  well i have he was like this beefsteak you an me is eatin it was once steer cavortin over the landscape but now its just meat thats all just meat an thats what you an me an all people come tomeat  matt gulped down the whole cup of coffee and refilled the cup  are you scared to die he asked  jim shook his head whats the use i dont die anyway i pass on an live again  to go stealin an lyin an snivellin through another life an go on that way forever an ever an ever matt sneered  maybe ill improve jim suggested hopefully maybe stealin wont be necessary in the life to come  he ceased abruptly and stared straight before him a frightened expression on his face  whats the matter matt demanded  nothin i was just wonderinjim returned to himself with an effortabout this dyin that was all  but he could not shake off the fright that had startled him it was as if an unseen thing of gloom had passed him by casting upon him the intangible shadow of its presence he was aware of a feeling of foreboding something ominous was about to happen calamity hovered in the air he gazed fixedly across the table at the other man he could not understand was it that he had blundered and poisoned himself no matt had the nicked cup and he had certainly put the poison in the nicked cup  it was all his own imagination was his next thought it had played him tricks before fool of course it was of course something was about to happen but it was about to happen to matt had not matt drunk the whole cup of coffee  jim brightened up and finished his steak sopping bread in the gravy when the meat was gone  when i was a kid he began but broke off abruptly  again the unseen thing of gloom had fluttered and his being was vibrant with premonition of impending misfortune he felt a disruptive influence at work in the flesh of him and in all his muscles there was a seeming that they were about to begin to twitch he sat back suddenly and as suddenly leaned forward with his elbows on the table a tremor ran dimly through the muscles of his body it was like the first rustling of leaves before the oncoming of wind he clenched his teeth it came again a spasmodic tensing of his muscles he knew panic at the revolt within his being his muscles no longer recognized his mastery over them again they spasmodically tensed despite the will of him for he had willed that they should not tense this was revolution within himself this was anarchy and the terror of impotence rushed up in him as his flesh gripped and seemed to seize him in a clutch chills running up and down his back and sweat starting on his brow he glanced about the room and all the details of it smote him with a strange sense of familiarity it was as though he had just returned from a long journey he looked across the table at his partner matt was watching him and smiling an expression of horror spread over jims face  my god matt he screamed you aint doped me  matt smiled and continued to watch him in the paroxysm that followed jim did not become unconscious his muscles tensed and twitched and knotted hurting him and crushing him in their savage grip and in the midst of it all it came to him that matt was acting queerly he was travelling the same road the smile had gone from his face and there was on it an intent expression as if he were listening to some inner tale of himself and trying to divine the message matt got up and walked across the room and back again then sat down  you did this jim he said quietly  but i didnt think youd try to fix me jim answered reproachfully  oh i fixed you all right matt said with teeth close together and shivering body what did you give me  strychnine  same as i gave you matt volunteered its a hell of a mess aint it  youre lyin matt jim pleaded you aint doped me have you  i sure did jim an i didnt overdose you neither i cooked it in as neat as you please in your half the porterhousehold on wherere you goin  jim had made a dash for the door and was throwing back the bolts matt sprang in between and shoved him away  drug store jim panted drug store  no you dont youll stay right here there aint goin to be any runnin out an makin a poison play on the streetnot with all them jools reposin under the pillow savve even if you didnt die youd be in the hands of the police with a whole lot of explanations comin emetics is the stuff for poison im just as bad bit as you an im goin to take a emetic thats all theyd give you at a drug store anyway  he thrust jim back into the middle of the room and shot the bolts into place as he went across the floor to the food shelf he passed one hand over his brow and flung off the beaded sweat it spattered audibly on the floor jim watched agonizedly as matt got the mustardcan and a cup and ran for the sink he stirred a cupful of mustard and water and drank it down jim had followed him and was reaching with trembling hands for the empty cup again matt shoved him away as he mixed a second cupful he demanded  dyou think one cupll do for me you can wait till im done  jim started to totter toward the door but matt checked him  if you monkey with that door ill twist your neck savve you can take yours when im done an if it saves you ill twist your neck anyway you aint got no chance nohow i told you many times what youd get if you did me dirt  but you did me dirt too jim articulated with an effort  matt was drinking the second cupful and did not answer the sweat had got into jims eyes and he could scarcely see his way to the table where he got a cup for himself but matt was mixing a third cupful and as before thrust him away  i told you to wait till i was done matt growled get outa my way  and jim supported his twitching body by holding on to the sink the while he yearned toward the yellowish concoction that stood for life it was by sheer will that he stood and clung to the sink his flesh strove to double him up and bring him to the floor matt drank the third cupful and with difficulty managed to get to a chair and sit down his first paroxysm was passing the spasms that afflicted him were dying away this good effect he ascribed to the mustard and water he was safe at any rate he wiped the sweat from his face and in the interval of calm found room for curiosity he looked at his partner  a spasm had shaken the mustard can out of jims hands and the contents were spilled upon the floor he stooped to scoop some of the mustard into the cup and the succeeding spasm doubled him upon the floor matt smiled  stay with it he encouraged its the stuff all right its fixed me up  jim heard him and turned toward him a stricken face twisted with suffering and pleading spasm now followed spasm till he was in convulsions rolling on the floor and yellowing his face and hair in the mustard  matt laughed hoarsely at the sight but the laugh broke midway a tremor had run through his body a new paroxysm was beginning he arose and staggered across to the sink where with probing forefinger he vainly strove to assist the action of the emetic in the end he clung to the sink as jim had clung filled with the horror of going down to the floor  the others paroxysm had passed and he sat up weak and fainting too weak to rise his forehead dripping his lips flecked with a foam made yellow by the mustard in which he had rolled he rubbed his eyes with his knuckles and groans that were like whines came from his throat  what are you snifflin about matt demanded out of his agony all you got to do is die an when you die youre dead  i aint snifflin its the mustard stingin my eyes jim panted with desperate slowness  it was his last successful attempt at speech thereafter he babbled incoherently pawing the air with shaking arms till a fresh convulsion stretched him on the floor  matt struggled back to the chair and doubled up on it with his arms clasped about his knees he fought with his disintegrating flesh he came out of the convulsion cool and weak he looked to see how it went with the other and saw him lying motionless  he tried to soliloquize to be facetious to have his last grim laugh at life but his lips made only incoherent sounds the thought came to him that the emetic had failed and that nothing remained but the drug store he looked toward the door and drew himself to his feet there he saved himself from falling by clutching the chair another paroxysm had begun and in the midst of the paroxysm with his body and all the parts of it flying apart and writhing and twisting back again into knots he clung to the chair and shoved it before him across the floor the last shreds of his will were leaving him when he gained the door he turned the key and shot back one bolt he fumbled for the second bolt but failed then he leaned his weight against the door and slid down gently to the floor     created he them  she met him at the door  i did not think you would be so early  it is half past eight he looked at his watch the train leaves at 912  he was very businesslike until he saw her lips tremble as she abruptly turned and led the way  itll be all right little woman he said soothingly doctor bodineaus the man hell pull him through youll see  they entered the livingroom his glance quested apprehensively about then turned to her  wheres al  she did not answer but with a sudden impulse came close to him and stood motionless she was a slender darkeyed woman in whose face was stamped the strain and stress of living but the fine lines and the haunted look in the eyes were not the handiwork of mere worry he knew whose handiwork it was as he looked upon it and she knew when she consulted her mirror  its no use mary he said he put his hand on her shoulder weve tried everything its a wretched business i know but what else can we do youve failed doctor bodineaus all thats left  if i had another chance she began falteringly  weve threshed that all out he answered harshly youve got to buck up now you know what conclusion we arrived at you know you havent the ghost of a hope in another chance  she shook her head i know it but it is terrible the thought of his going away to fight it out alone  he wont be alone theres doctor bodineau and besides its a beautiful place  she remained silent  it is the only thing he said  it is the only thing she repeated mechanically  he looked at his watch wheres al  ill send him  when the door had closed behind her he walked over to the window and looked out drumming absently with his knuckles on the pane  hello  he turned and responded to the greeting of the man who had just entered there was a perceptible drag to the mans feet as he walked across toward the window and paused irresolutely halfway  ive changed my mind george he announced hurriedly and nervously im not going  he plucked at his sleeve shuffled with his feet dropped his eyes and with a strong effort raised them again to confront the other  george regarded him silently his nostrils distending and his lean fingers unconsciously crooking like an eagles talons about to clutch  in line and feature there was much of resemblance between the two men and yet in the strongest resemblances there was a radical difference theirs were the same black eyes but those of the man at the window were sharp and straight looking while those of the man in the middle of the room were cloudy and furtive he could not face the others gaze and continually and vainly struggled with himself to do so the high cheek bones with the hollows beneath were the same yet the texture of the hollows seemed different the thinlipped mouths were from the same mould but georges lips were firm and muscular while als were soft and loosethe lips of an ascetic turned voluptuary there was also a sag at the corners his flesh hinted of grossness especially so in the eaglelike aquiline nose that must once have been like the others but that had lost the austerity the others still retained  al fought for steadiness in the middle of the floor the silence bothered him he had a feeling that he was about to begin swaying back and forth he moistened his lips with his tongue  im going to stay he said desperately  he dropped his eyes and plucked again at his sleeve  and you are only twentysix years old george said at last you poor feeble old man  dont be so sure of that al retorted with a flash of belligerence  do you remember when we swam that mile and a half across the channel  well and what of it a sullen expression was creeping across als face  and do you remember when we boxed in the barn after school  i could take all you gave me  all i gave you georges voice rose momentarily to a higher pitch you licked me four afternoons out of five you were twice as strong as ithree times as strong and now id be afraid to land on you with a sofa cushion youd crumple up like a last years leaf youd die you poor miserable old man  you neednt abuse me just because ive changed my mind the other protested the hint of a whine in his voice  his wife entered and he looked appealingly to her but the man at the window strode suddenly up to him and burst out  you dont know your own mind for two successive minutes you havent any mind you spineless crawling worm  you cant make me angry al smiled with cunning and glanced triumphantly at his wife you cant make me angry he repeated as though the idea were thoroughly gratifying to him i know your game its my stomach i tell you i cant help it before god i cant isnt it my stomach mary  she glanced at george and spoke composedly though she hid a trembling hand in a fold of her skirt  isnt it time she asked softly  her husband turned upon her savagely im not going to go he cried thats just what ive been telling him and i tell you again all of you im not going you cant bully me  why al dear you said she began  never mind what i said he broke out ive said something else right now and youve heard it and that settles it  he walked across the room and threw himself with emphasis into a morris chair but the other man was swiftly upon him the talonlike fingers gripped his shoulders jerked him to his feet and held him there  youve reached the limit al and i want you to understand it ive tried to treat you like like my brother but hereafter i shall treat you like the thing that you are do you understand  the anger in his voice was cold the blaze in his eyes was cold it was vastly more effective than any outburst and al cringed under it and under the clutching hand that was bruising his shoulder muscles  it is only because of me that you have this house that you have the food you eat your position any other man would have been shown the door a year agotwo years ago i have held you in it your salary has been charity it has been paid out of my pocket mary her dresses that gown she has on is made over she wears the discarded dresses of her sisters of my wife charitydo you understand your childrenthey are wearing the discarded clothes of my children of the children of my neighbours who think the clothes went to some orphan asylum and it is an orphan asylum or it soon will be  he emphasized each point with an unconscious tightening of his grip on the shoulder al was squirming with the pain of it the sweat was starting out on his forehead  now listen well to me his brother went on in three minutes you will tell me that you are going with me if you dont mary and the children will be taken away from youtoday you neednt ever come to the office this house will be closed to you and in six months i shall have the pleasure of burying you you have three minutes to make up your mind  al made a strangling movement and reached up with weak fingers to the clutching hand  my heart let me go youll be the death of me he gasped  the hand thrust him down forcibly into the morris chair and released him  the clock on the mantle ticked loudly george glanced at it and at mary she was leaning against the table unable to conceal her trembling he became unpleasantly aware of the feeling of his brothers fingers on his hand quite unconsciously he wiped the back of the hand upon his coat the clock ticked on in the silence it seemed to george that the room reverberated with his voice he could hear himself still speaking  ill go came from the morris chair  it was a weak and shaken voice and it was a weak and shaken man that pulled himself out of the morris chair he started toward the door  where are you going george demanded  suit case came the response maryll send the trunk later ill be back in a minute  the door closed after him a moment later struck with sudden suspicion george was opening the door he glanced in his brother stood at a sideboard in one hand a decanter in the other hand bottom up and to his lips a whisky glass  across the glass al saw that he was observed it threw him into a panic hastily he tried to refill the glass and get it to his lips but glass and decanter were sent smashing to the floor he snarled it was like the sound of a wild beast but the grip on his shoulder subdued and frightened him he was being propelled toward the door  the suit case he gasped its there in that room let me get it  wheres the key his brother asked when he had brought it  it isnt locked  the next moment the suit case was spread open and georges hand was searching the contents from one side it brought out a bottle of whisky from the other side a flask he snapped the case to  come on he said if we miss one car we miss that train  he went out into the hallway leaving al with his wife it was like a funeral george thought as he waited  his brothers overcoat caught on the knob of the front door and delayed its closing long enough for marys first sob to come to their ears georges lips were very thin and compressed as he went down the steps in one hand he carried the suit case with the other hand he held his brothers arm  as they neared the corner he heard the electric car a block away and urged his brother on al was breathing hard his feet dragged and shuffled and he held back  a hell of a brother you are he panted  for reply he received a vicious jerk on his arm it reminded him of his childhood when he was hurried along by some angry grownup and like a child he had to be helped up the car step he sank down on an outside seat panting sweating overcome by the exertion he followed georges eyes as the latter looked him up and down  a hell of a brother you are was georges comment when he had finished the inspection  moisture welled into als eyes  its my stomach he said with selfpity  i dont wonder was the retort burnt out like the crater of a volcano fervent heat isnt a circumstance  thereafter they did not speak when they arrived at the transfer point george came to himself with a start he smiled with fixed gaze that did not see the houses that streamed across his field of vision he had himself been sunk deep in selfpity he helped his brother from the car and looked up the intersecting street the car they were to take was not in sight  als eyes chanced upon the corner grocery and saloon across the way at once he became restless his hands passed beyond his control and he yearned hungrily across the street to the door that swung open even as he looked and let in a happy pilgrim and in that instant he saw the whitejacketed bartender against an array of glittering glass quite unconsciously he started to cross the street  hold on georges hand was on his arm  i want some whisky he answered  youve already had some  that was hours ago go on george let me have some its the last day dont shut off on me until we get theregod knows it will be soon enough  george glanced desperately up the street the car was in sight  there isnt time for a drink he said  i dont want a drink i want a bottle als voice became wheedling go on george its the last the very last  no the denial was as final as georges thin lips could make it  al glanced at the approaching car he sat down suddenly on the curbstone  whats the matter his brother asked with momentary alarm  nothing i want some whisky its my stomach  come on now get up  george reached for him but was anticipated for his brother sprawled flat on the pavement oblivious to the dirt and to the curious glances of the passersby the car was clanging its gong at the crossing a block away  youll miss it al grinned from the pavement and it will be your fault  georges fists clenched tightly  for two cents id give you a thrashing  and miss the car was the triumphant comment from the pavement  george looked at the car it was halfway down the block he looked at his watch he debated a second longer  all right he said ill get it but you get on that car if you miss it ill break the bottle over your head  he dashed across the street and into the saloon the car came in and stopped there were no passengers to get off al dragged himself up the steps and sat down he smiled as the conductor rang the bell and the car started the swinging door of the saloon burst open clutching in his hand the suit case and a pint bottle of whisky george started in pursuit the conductor his hand on the bell cord waited to see if it would be necessary to stop it was not george swung lightly aboard sat down beside his brother and passed him the bottle  you might have got a quart al said reproachfully  he extracted the cork with a pocket corkscrew and elevated the bottle  im sick my stomach he explained in apologetic tones to the passenger who sat next to him  in the train they sat in the smokingcar george felt that it was imperative also having successfully caught the train his heart softened he felt more kindly toward his brother and accused himself of unnecessary harshness he strove to atone by talking about their mother and sisters and the little affairs and interests of the family but al was morose and devoted himself to the bottle as the time passed his mouth hung looser and looser while the rings under his eyes seemed to puff out and all his facial muscles to relax  its my stomach he said once when he finished the bottle and dropped it under the seat but the swift hardening of his brothers face did not encourage further explanations  the conveyance that met them at the station had all the dignity and luxuriousness of a private carriage georges eyes were keen for the ear marks of the institution to which they were going but his apprehensions were allayed from moment to moment as they entered the wide gateway and rolled on through the spacious grounds he felt sure that the institutional side of the place would not jar upon his brother it was more like a summer hotel or better yet a country club and as they swept on through the spring sunshine the songs of birds in his ears and in his nostrils the breath of flowers george sighed for a week of rest in such a place and before his eyes loomed the arid vista of summer in town and at the office there was not room in his income for his brother and himself  let us take a walk in the grounds he suggested after they had met doctor bodineau and inspected the quarters assigned to al the carriage leaves for the station in half an hour and well just have time  its beautiful he remarked a moment later under his feet was the velvet grass the trees arched overhead and he stood in mottled sunshine i wish i could stay for a month  ill trade places with you al said quickly  george laughed it off but he felt a sinking of the heart  look at that oak he cried and that woodpecker isnt he a beauty  i dont like it here he heard his brother mutter  georges lips tightened in preparation for the struggle but he said  im going to send mary and the children off to the mountains she needs it and so do they and when youre in shape ill send you right on to join them then you can take your summer vacation before you come back to the office  im not going to stay in this damned hole for all you talk about it al announced abruptly  yes you are and youre going to get your health and strength back again so that the look of you will put the colour in marys cheeks where it used to be  im going back with you als voice was firm im going to take the same train back its about time for that carriage i guess  i havent told you all my plans george tried to go on but al cut him off  you might as well quit that i dont want any of your soapy talking you treat me like a child im not a child my minds made up and ill show you how long it can stay made up you neednt talk to me i dont care a rap for what youre going to say  a baleful light was in his eyes and to his brother he seemed for all the world like a cornered rat desperate and ready to fight as george looked at him he remembered back to their childhood and it came to him that at last was aroused in al the same old stubborn strain that had enabled him as a child to stand against all force and persuasion  george abandoned hope he had lost this creature was not human the last fine instinct of the human had fled it was a brute sluggish and stolid impossible to movejust the raw stuff of life combative rebellious and indomitable and as he contemplated his brother he felt in himself the rising up of a similar brute he became suddenly aware that his fingers were tensing and crooking like a thugs and he knew the desire to kill and his reason turned traitor at last counselled that he should kill that it was the only thing left for him to do  he was aroused by a servant calling to him through the trees that the carriage was waiting he answered then looking straight before him he discovered his brother he had forgotten it was his brother it had been only a thing the moment before he began to talk and as he talked the way became clear to him his reason had not turned traitor the brute in him had merely orientated his reason  you are no earthly good al he said you know that youve made marys life a hell you are a curse to your children and you have not made life exactly a paradise for the rest of us  theres no use your talking al interjected im not going to stay here  thats what im coming to george continued you dont have to stay here als face brightened and he involuntarily made a movement as though about to start toward the carriage on the other hand it is not necessary that you should return with me there is another way  georges hand went to his hip pocket and appeared with a revolver it lay along his palm the butt toward al and toward al he extended it at the same time with his head he indicated the nearby thicket  you cant bluff me al snarled  it is not a bluff al look at me i mean it and if you dont do it for yourself i shall have to do it for you  they faced each other the proffered revolver still extended al debated for a moment then his eyes blazed with a quick movement he seized the revolver  my god ill do it he said ill show you what ive got in me  george felt suddenly sick he turned away he did not see his brother enter the thicket but he heard the passage of his body through the leaves and branches  goodbye al he called  goodbye came from the thicket  george felt the sweat upon his forehead he began mopping his face with his handkerchief he heard as from a remote distance the voice of the servant again calling to him that the carriage was waiting the woodpecker dropped down through the mottled sunshine and lighted on the trunk of a tree a dozen feet away george felt that it was all a dream and yet through it all he felt supreme justification it was the right thing to do it was the only thing  his whole body gave a spasmodic start as though the revolver had been fired it was the voice of al close at his back  heres your gun al said ill stay  the servant appeared among the trees approaching rapidly and calling anxiously george put the weapon in his pocket and caught both his brothers hands in his own  god bless you old man he murmured andwith a final squeeze of the handsgood luck  im coming he called to the servant and turned and ran through the trees toward the carriage     the chinago     the coral waxes the palm grows but man departs                                   tahitian proverb  ah cho did not understand french he sat in the crowded court room very weary and bored listening to the unceasing explosive french that now one official and now another uttered it was just so much gabble to ah cho and he marvelled at the stupidity of the frenchmen who took so long to find out the murderer of chung ga and who did not find him at all the five hundred coolies on the plantation knew that ah san had done the killing and here was ah san not even arrested it was true that all the coolies had agreed secretly not to testify against one another but then it was so simple the frenchmen should have been able to discover that ah san was the man they were very stupid these frenchmen  ah cho had done nothing of which to be afraid he had had no hand in the killing it was true he had been present at it and schemmer the overseer on the plantation had rushed into the barracks immediately afterward and caught him there along with four or five others but what of that chung ga had been stabbed only twice it stood to reason that five or six men could not inflict two stab wounds at the most if a man had struck but once only two men could have done it  so it was that ah cho reasoned when he along with his four companions had lied and blocked and obfuscated in their statements to the court concerning what had taken place they had heard the sounds of the killing and like schemmer they had run to the spot they had got there before schemmerthat was all true schemmer had testified that attracted by the sound of quarrelling as he chanced to pass by he had stood for at least five minutes outside that then when he entered he found the prisoners already inside and that they had not entered just before because he had been standing by the one door to the barracks but what of that ah cho and his four fellowprisoners had testified that schemmer was mistaken in the end they would be let go they were all confident of that five men could not have their heads cut off for two stab wounds besides no foreign devil had seen the killing but these frenchmen were so stupid in china as ah cho well knew the magistrate would order all of them to the torture and learn the truth the truth was very easy to learn under torture but these frenchmen did not torturebigger fools they therefore they would never find out who killed chung ga  but ah cho did not understand everything the english company that owned the plantation had imported into tahiti at great expense the five hundred coolies the stockholders were clamouring for dividends and the company had not yet paid any wherefore the company did not want its costly contract labourers to start the practice of killing one another also there were the french eager and willing to impose upon the chinagos the virtues and excellences of french law there was nothing like setting an example once in a while and besides of what use was new caledonia except to send men to live out their days in misery and pain in payment of the penalty for being frail and human  ah cho did not understand all this he sat in the court room and waited for the baffled judgment that would set him and his comrades free to go back to the plantation and work out the terms of their contracts this judgment would soon be rendered proceedings were drawing to a close he could see that there was no more testifying no more gabble of tongues the french devils were tired too and evidently waiting for the judgment and as he waited he remembered back in his life to the time when he had signed the contract and set sail in the ship for tahiti times had been hard in his seacoast village and when he indentured himself to labour for five years in the south seas at fifty cents mexican a day he had thought himself fortunate there were men in his village who toiled a whole year for ten dollars mexican and there were women who made nets all the year round for five dollars while in the houses of shopkeepers there were maidservants who received four dollars for a year of service and here he was to receive fifty cents a day for one day only one day he was to receive that princely sum what if the work were hard at the end of the five years he would return homethat was in the contractand he would never have to work again he would be a rich man for life with a house of his own a wife and children growing up to venerate him yes and back of the house he would have a small garden a place of meditation and repose with goldfish in a tiny lakelet and wind bells tinkling in the several trees and there would be a high wall all around so that his meditation and repose should be undisturbed  well he had worked out three of those five years he was already a wealthy man in his own country through his earnings and only two years more intervened between the cotton plantation on tahiti and the meditation and repose that awaited him but just now he was losing money because of the unfortunate accident of being present at the killing of chung ga he had lain three weeks in prison and for each day of those three weeks he had lost fifty cents but now judgment would soon be given and he would go back to work  ah cho was twentytwo years old he was happy and goodnatured and it was easy for him to smile while his body was slim in the asiatic way his face was rotund it was round like the moon and it irradiated a gentle complacence and a sweet kindliness of spirit that was unusual among his countrymen nor did his looks belie him he never caused trouble never took part in wrangling he did not gamble his soul was not harsh enough for the soul that must belong to a gambler he was content with little things and simple pleasures the hush and quiet in the cool of the day after the blazing toil in the cotton field was to him an infinite satisfaction he could sit for hours gazing at a solitary flower and philosophizing about the mysteries and riddles of being a blue heron on a tiny crescent of sandy beach a silvery splatter of flying fish or a sunset of pearl and rose across the lagoon could entrance him to all forgetfulness of the procession of wearisome days and of the heavy lash of schemmer  schemmer karl schemmer was a brute a brutish brute but he earned his salary he got the last particle of strength out of the five hundred slaves for slaves they were until their term of years was up schemmer worked hard to extract the strength from those five hundred sweating bodies and to transmute it into bales of fluffy cotton ready for export his dominant ironclad primeval brutishness was what enabled him to effect the transmutation also he was assisted by a thick leather belt three inches wide and a yard in length with which he always rode and which on occasion could come down on the naked back of a stooping coolie with a report like a pistolshot these reports were frequent when schemmer rode down the furrowed field  once at the beginning of the first year of contract labour he had killed a coolie with a single blow of his fist he had not exactly crushed the mans head like an eggshell but the blow had been sufficient to addle what was inside and after being sick for a week the man had died but the chinese had not complained to the french devils that ruled over tahiti it was their own look out schemmer was their problem they must avoid his wrath as they avoided the venom of the centipedes that lurked in the grass or crept into the sleeping quarters on rainy nights the chinagossuch they were called by the indolent brownskinned island folksaw to it that they did not displease schemmer too greatly this was equivalent to rendering up to him a full measure of efficient toil that blow of schemmers fist had been worth thousands of dollars to the company and no trouble ever came of it to schemmer  the french with no instinct for colonization futile in their childish playgame of developing the resources of the island were only too glad to see the english company succeed what matter of schemmer and his redoubtable fist the chinago that died well he was only a chinago besides he died of sunstroke as the doctors certificate attested true in all the history of tahiti no one had ever died of sunstroke but it was that precisely that which made the death of this chinago unique the doctor said as much in his report he was very candid dividends must be paid or else one more failure would be added to the long history of failure in tahiti  there was no understanding these white devils ah cho pondered their inscrutableness as he sat in the court room waiting the judgment there was no telling what went on at the back of their minds he had seen a few of the white devils they were all alikethe officers and sailors on the ship the french officials the several white men on the plantation including schemmer their minds all moved in mysterious ways there was no getting at they grew angry without apparent cause and their anger was always dangerous they were like wild beasts at such times they worried about little things and on occasion could outtoil even a chinago they were not temperate as chinagos were temperate they were gluttons eating prodigiously and drinking more prodigiously a chinago never knew when an act would please them or arouse a storm of wrath a chinago could never tell what pleased one time the very next time might provoke an outburst of anger there was a curtain behind the eyes of the white devils that screened the backs of their minds from the chinagos gaze and then on top of it all was that terrible efficiency of the white devils that ability to do things to make things go to work results to bend to their wills all creeping crawling things and the powers of the very elements themselves yes the white men were strange and wonderful and they were devils look at schemmer  ah cho wondered why the judgment was so long in forming not a man on trial had laid hand on chung ga ah san alone had killed him ah san had done it bending chung gas head back with one hand by a grip of his queue and with the other hand from behind reaching over and driving the knife into his body twice had he driven it in there in the court room with closed eyes ah cho saw the killing acted over againthe squabble the vile words bandied back and forth the filth and insult flung upon venerable ancestors the curses laid upon unbegotten generations the leap of ah san the grip on the queue of chung ga the knife that sank twice into his flesh the bursting open of the door the irruption of schemmer the dash for the door the escape of ah san the flying belt of schemmer that drove the rest into the corner and the firing of the revolver as a signal that brought help to schemmer ah cho shivered as he lived it over one blow of the belt had bruised his cheek taking off some of the skin schemmer had pointed to the bruises when on the witnessstand he had identified ah cho it was only just now that the marks had become no longer visible that had been a blow half an inch nearer the centre and it would have taken out his eye then ah cho forgot the whole happening in a vision he caught of the garden of meditation and repose that would be his when he returned to his own land  he sat with impassive face while the magistrate rendered the judgment likewise were the faces of his four companions impassive and they remained impassive when the interpreter explained that the five of them had been found guilty of the murder of chung ga and that ah chow should have his head cut off ah cho serve twenty years in prison in new caledonia wong li twelve years and ah tong ten years there was no use in getting excited about it even ah chow remained expressionless as a mummy though it was his head that was to be cut off the magistrate added a few words and the interpreter explained that ah chows face having been most severely bruised by schemmers strap had made his identification so positive that since one man must die he might as well be that man also the fact that ah chos face likewise had been severely bruised conclusively proving his presence at the murder and his undoubted participation had merited him the twenty years of penal servitude and down to the ten years of ah tong the proportioned reason for each sentence was explained let the chinagos take the lesson to heart the court said finally for they must learn that the law would be fulfilled in tahiti though the heavens fell  the five chinagos were taken back to jail they were not shocked nor grieved the sentences being unexpected was quite what they were accustomed to in their dealings with the white devils from them a chinago rarely expected more than the unexpected the heavy punishment for a crime they had not committed was no stranger than the countless strange things that white devils did in the weeks that followed ah cho often contemplated ah chow with mild curiosity his head was to be cut off by the guillotine that was being erected on the plantation for him there would be no declining years no gardens of tranquillity ah cho philosophized and speculated about life and death as for himself he was not perturbed twenty years were merely twenty years by that much was his garden removed from himthat was all he was young and the patience of asia was in his bones he could wait those twenty years and by that time the heats of his blood would be assuaged and he would be better fitted for that garden of calm delight he thought of a name for it he would call it the garden of the morning calm he was made happy all day by the thought and he was inspired to devise a moral maxim on the virtue of patience which maxim proved a great comfort especially to wong li and ah tong ah chow however did not care for the maxim his head was to be separated from his body in so short a time that he had no need for patience to wait for that event he smoked well ate well slept well and did not worry about the slow passage of time  cruchot was a gendarme he had seen twenty years of service in the colonies from nigeria and senegal to the south seas and those twenty years had not perceptibly brightened his dull mind he was as slowwitted and stupid as in his peasant days in the south of france he knew discipline and fear of authority and from god down to the sergeant of gendarmes the only difference to him was the measure of slavish obedience which he rendered in point of fact the sergeant bulked bigger in his mind than god except on sundays when gods mouthpieces had their say god was usually very remote while the sergeant was ordinarily very close at hand  cruchot it was who received the order from the chief justice to the jailer commanding that functionary to deliver over to cruchot the person of ah chow now it happened that the chief justice had given a dinner the night before to the captain and officers of the french manofwar his hand was shaking when he wrote out the order and his eyes were aching so dreadfully that he did not read over the order it was only a chinagos life he was signing away anyway so he did not notice that he had omitted the final letter in ah chows name the order read ah cho and when cruchot presented the order the jailer turned over to him the person of ah cho cruchot took that person beside him on the seat of a wagon behind two mules and drove away  ah cho was glad to be out in the sunshine he sat beside the gendarme and beamed he beamed more ardently than ever when he noted the mules headed south toward atimaono undoubtedly schemmer had sent for him to be brought back schemmer wanted him to work very well he would work well schemmer would never have cause to complain it was a hot day there had been a stoppage of the trades the mules sweated cruchot sweated and ah cho sweated but it was ah cho that bore the heat with the least concern he had toiled three years under that sun on the plantation he beamed and beamed with such genial good nature that even cruchots heavy mind was stirred to wonderment  you are very funny he said at last  ah cho nodded and beamed more ardently unlike the magistrate cruchot spoke to him in the kanaka tongue and this like all chinagos and all foreign devils ah cho understood  you laugh too much cruchot chided ones heart should be full of tears on a day like this  i am glad to get out of the jail  is that all the gendarme shrugged his shoulders  is it not enough was the retort  then you are not glad to have your head cut off  ah cho looked at him in abrupt perplexity and said  why i am going back to atimaono to work on the plantation for schemmer are you not taking me to atimaono  cruchot stroked his long moustaches reflectively well well he said finally with a flick of the whip at the off mule so you dont know  know what ah cho was beginning to feel a vague alarm wont schemmer let me work for him any more  not after today cruchot laughed heartily it was a good joke you see you wont be able to work after today a man with his head off cant work eh he poked the chinago in the ribs and chuckled  ah cho maintained silence while the mules trotted a hot mile then he spoke is schemmer going to cut off my head  cruchot grinned as he nodded  it is a mistake said ah cho gravely i am not the chinago that is to have his head cut off i am ah cho the honourable judge has determined that i am to stop twenty years in new caledonia  the gendarme laughed it was a good joke this funny chinago trying to cheat the guillotine the mules trotted through a coconut grove and for half a mile beside the sparkling sea before ah cho spoke again  i tell you i am not ah chow the honourable judge did not say that my head was to go off  dont be afraid said cruchot with the philanthropic intention of making it easier for his prisoner it is not difficult to die that way he snapped his fingers it is quicklike that it is not like hanging on the end of a rope and kicking and making faces for five minutes it is like killing a chicken with a hatchet you cut its head off that is all and it is the same with a man poufit is over it doesnt hurt you dont even think it hurts you dont think your head is gone so you cannot think it is very good that is the way i want to diequick ah quick you are lucky to die that way you might get the leprosy and fall to pieces slowly a finger at a time and now and again a thumb also the toes i knew a man who was burned by hot water it took him two days to die you could hear him yelling a kilometre away but you ah so easy chckthe knife cuts your neck like that it is finished the knife may even tickle who can say nobody who died that way ever came back to say  he considered this last an excruciating joke and permitted himself to be convulsed with laughter for half a minute part of his mirth was assumed but he considered it his humane duty to cheer up the chinago  but i tell you i am ah cho the other persisted i dont want my head cut off  cruchot scowled the chinago was carrying the foolishness too far  i am not ah chow ah cho began  that will do the gendarme interrupted he puffed up his cheeks and strove to appear fierce  i tell you i am not ah cho began again  shut up bawled cruchot  after that they rode along in silence it was twenty miles from papeete to atimaono and over half the distance was covered by the time the chinago again ventured into speech  i saw you in the court room when the honourable judge sought after our guilt he began very good and do you remember that ah chow whose head is to be cut offdo you remember that heah chowwas a tall man look at me  he stood up suddenly and cruchot saw that he was a short man and just as suddenly cruchot caught a glimpse of a memory picture of ah chow and in that picture ah chow was tall to the gendarme all chinagos looked alike one face was like another but between tallness and shortness he could differentiate and he knew that he had the wrong man beside him on the seat he pulled up the mules abruptly so that the pole shot ahead of them elevating their collars  you see it was a mistake said ah cho smiling pleasantly  but cruchot was thinking already he regretted that he had stopped the wagon he was unaware of the error of the chief justice and he had no way of working it out but he did know that he had been given this chinago to take to atimaono and that it was his duty to take him to atimaono what if he was the wrong man and they cut his head off it was only a chinago when all was said and what was a chinago anyway besides it might not be a mistake he did not know what went on in the minds of his superiors they knew their business best who was he to do their thinking for them once in the long ago he had attempted to think for them and the sergeant had said cruchot you are a fool the quicker you know that the better you will get on you are not to think you are to obey and leave thinking to your betters he smarted under the recollection also if he turned back to papeete he would delay the execution at atimaono and if he were wrong in turning back he would get a reprimand from the sergeant who was waiting for the prisoner and furthermore he would get a reprimand at papeete as well  he touched the mules with the whip and drove on he looked at his watch he would be half an hour late as it was and the sergeant was bound to be angry he put the mules into a faster trot the more ah cho persisted in explaining the mistake the more stubborn cruchot became the knowledge that he had the wrong man did not make his temper better the knowledge that it was through no mistake of his confirmed him in the belief that the wrong he was doing was the right and rather than incur the displeasure of the sergeant he would willingly have assisted a dozen wrong chinagos to their doom  as for ah cho after the gendarme had struck him over the head with the butt of the whip and commanded him in a loud voice to shut up there remained nothing for him to do but to shut up the long ride continued in silence ah cho pondered the strange ways of the foreign devils there was no explaining them what they were doing with him was of a piece with everything they did first they found guilty five innocent men and next they cut off the head of the man that even they in their benighted ignorance had deemed meritorious of no more than twenty years imprisonment and there was nothing he could do he could only sit idly and take what these lords of life measured out to him once he got in a panic and the sweat upon his body turned cold but he fought his way out of it he endeavoured to resign himself to his fate by remembering and repeating certain passages from the yin chih wen the tract of the quiet way but instead he kept seeing his dreamgarden of meditation and repose this bothered him until he abandoned himself to the dream and sat in his garden listening to the tinkling of the windbells in the several trees and lo sitting thus in the dream he was able to remember and repeat the passages from the tract of the quiet way  so the time passed nicely until atimaono was reached and the mules trotted up to the foot of the scaffold in the shade of which stood the impatient sergeant ah cho was hurried up the ladder of the scaffold beneath him on one side he saw assembled all the coolies of the plantation schemmer had decided that the event would be a good objectlesson and so he called in the coolies from the fields and compelled them to be present as they caught sight of ah cho they gabbled among themselves in low voices they saw the mistake but they kept it to themselves the inexplicable white devils had doubtlessly changed their minds instead of taking the life of one innocent man they were taking the life of another innocent man ah chow or ah chowhat did it matter which they could never understand the white dogs any more than could the white dogs understand them ah cho was going to have his head cut off but they when their two remaining years of servitude were up were going back to china  schemmer had made the guillotine himself he was a handy man and though he had never seen a guillotine the french officials had explained the principle to him it was on his suggestion that they had ordered the execution to take place at atimaono instead of at papeete the scene of the crime schemmer had argued was the best possible place for the punishment and in addition it would have a salutary influence upon the halfthousand chinagos on the plantation schemmer had also volunteered to act as executioner and in that capacity he was now on the scaffold experimenting with the instrument he had made a banana tree of the size and consistency of a mans neck lay under the guillotine ah cho watched with fascinated eyes the german turning a small crank hoisted the blade to the top of the little derrick he had rigged a jerk on a stout piece of cord loosed the blade and it dropped with a flash neatly severing the banana trunk  how does it work the sergeant coming out on top the scaffold had asked the question  beautifully was schemmers exultant answer let me show you  again he turned the crank that hoisted the blade jerked the cord and sent the blade crashing down on the soft tree but this time it went no more than twothirds of the way through  the sergeant scowled that will not serve he said  schemmer wiped the sweat from his forehead what it needs is more weight he announced walking up to the edge of the scaffold he called his orders to the blacksmith for a twentyfivepound piece of iron as he stooped over to attach the iron to the broad top of the blade ah cho glanced at the sergeant and saw his opportunity  the honourable judge said that ah chow was to have his head cut off he began  the sergeant nodded impatiently he was thinking of the fifteenmile ride before him that afternoon to the windward side of the island and of berthe the pretty halfcaste daughter of lafiere the pearltrader who was waiting for him at the end of it  well i am not ah chow i am ah cho the honourable jailer has made a mistake ah chow is a tall man and you see i am short  the sergeant looked at him hastily and saw the mistake schemmer he called imperatively come here  the german grunted but remained bent over his task till the chunk of iron was lashed to his satisfaction is your chinago ready he demanded  look at him was the answer is he the chinago  schemmer was surprised he swore tersely for a few seconds and looked regretfully across at the thing he had made with his own hands and which he was eager to see work look here he said finally we cant postpone this affair ive lost three hours work already out of those five hundred chinagos i cant afford to lose it all over again for the right man lets put the performance through just the same it is only a chinago  the sergeant remembered the long ride before him and the pearltraders daughter and debated with himself  they will blame it on cruchotif it is discovered the german urged but theres little chance of its being discovered ah chow wont give it away at any rate  the blame wont lie with cruchot anyway the sergeant said it must have been the jailers mistake  then lets go on with it they cant blame us who can tell one chinago from another we can say that we merely carried out instructions with the chinago that was turned over to us besides i really cant take all those coolies a second time away from their labour  they spoke in french and ah cho who did not understand a word of it nevertheless knew that they were determining his destiny he knew also that the decision rested with the sergeant and he hung upon that officials lips  all right announced the sergeant go ahead with it he is only a chinago  im going to try it once more just to make sure schemmer moved the banana trunk forward under the knife which he had hoisted to the top of the derrick  ah cho tried to remember maxims from the tract of the quiet way live in concord came to him but it was not applicable he was not going to live he was about to die no that would not do forgive maliceyes but there was no malice to forgive schemmer and the rest were doing this thing without malice it was to them merely a piece of work that had to be done just as clearing the jungle ditching the water and planting cotton were pieces of work that had to be done schemmer jerked the cord and ah cho forgot the tract of the quiet way the knife shot down with a thud making a clean slice of the tree  beautiful exclaimed the sergeant pausing in the act of lighting a cigarette beautiful my friend  schemmer was pleased at the praise  come on ah chow he said in the tahitian tongue  but i am not ah chow ah cho began  shut up was the answer if you open your mouth again ill break your head  the overseer threatened him with a clenched fist and he remained silent what was the good of protesting those foreign devils always had their way he allowed himself to be lashed to the vertical board that was the size of his body schemmer drew the buckles tightso tight that the straps cut into his flesh and hurt but he did not complain the hurt would not last long he felt the board tilting over in the air toward the horizontal and closed his eyes and in that moment he caught a last glimpse of his garden of meditation and repose it seemed to him that he sat in the garden a cool wind was blowing and the bells in the several trees were tinkling softly also birds were making sleepy noises and from beyond the high wall came the subdued sound of village life  then he was aware that the board had come to rest and from muscular pressures and tensions he knew that he was lying on his back he opened his eyes straight above him he saw the suspended knife blazing in the sunshine he saw the weight which had been added and noted that one of schemmers knots had slipped then he heard the sergeants voice in sharp command ah cho closed his eyes hastily he did not want to see that knife descend but he felt itfor one great fleeting instant and in that instant he remembered cruchot and what cruchot had said but cruchot was wrong the knife did not tickle that much he knew before he ceased to know     make westing       whatever you do make westing make westing                     sailing directions for cape horn  for seven weeks the mary rogers had been between 50 degrees south in the atlantic and 50 degrees south in the pacific which meant that for seven weeks she had been struggling to round cape horn for seven weeks she had been either in dirt or close to dirt save once and then following upon six days of excessive dirt which she had ridden out under the shelter of the redoubtable terra del fuego coast she had almost gone ashore during a heavy swell in the dead calm that had suddenly fallen for seven weeks she had wrestled with the cape horn graybeards and in return been buffeted and smashed by them she was a wooden ship and her ceaseless straining had opened her seams so that twice a day the watch took its turn at the pumps  the mary rogers was strained the crew was strained and big dan cullen master was likewise strained perhaps he was strained most of all for upon him rested the responsibility of that titanic struggle he slept most of the time in his clothes though he rarely slept he haunted the deck at night a great burly robust ghost black with the sunburn of thirty years of sea and hairy as an orangoutang he in turn was haunted by one thought of action a sailing direction for the horn whatever you do make westing make westing it was an obsession he thought of nothing else except at times to blaspheme god for sending such bitter weather  make westing he hugged the horn and a dozen times lay hove to with the iron cape bearing eastbynorth or northnortheast a score of miles away and each time the eternal west wind smote him back and he made easting he fought gale after gale south to 64 degrees inside the antarctic driftice and pledged his immortal soul to the powers of darkness for a bit of westing for a slant to take him around and he made easting in despair he had tried to make the passage through the straits of le maire halfway through the wind hauled to the northard of northwest the glass dropped to 2888 and he turned and ran before a gale of cyclonic fury missing by a hairsbreadth piling up the mary rogers on the blacktoothed rocks twice he had made west to the diego ramirez rocks one of the times saved between two snowsqualls by sighting the gravestones of ships a quarter of a mile dead ahead  blow captain dan cullen instanced all his thirty years at sea to prove that never had it blown so before the mary rogers was hove to at the time he gave the evidence and to clinch it inside half an hour the mary rogers was hove down to the hatches her new maintopsail and brand new spencer were blown away like tissue paper and five sails furled and fast under double gaskets were blown loose and stripped from the yards and before morning the mary rogers was hove down twice again and holes were knocked in her bulwarks to ease her decks from the weight of ocean that pressed her down  on an average of once a week captain dan cullen caught glimpses of the sun once for ten minutes the sun shone at midday and ten minutes afterward a new gale was piping up both watches were shortening sail and all was buried in the obscurity of a driving snowsquall for a fortnight once captain dan cullen was without a meridian or a chronometer sight rarely did he know his position within half of a degree except when in sight of land for sun and stars remained hidden behind the sky and it was so gloomy that even at the best the horizons were poor for accurate observations a gray gloom shrouded the world the clouds were gray the great driving seas were leaden gray the smoking crests were a gray churning even the occasional albatrosses were gray while the snowflurries were not white but gray under the sombre pall of the heavens  life on board the mary rogers was graygray and gloomy the faces of the sailors were bluegray they were afflicted with seacuts and seaboils and suffered exquisitely they were shadows of men for seven weeks in the forecastle or on deck they had not known what it was to be dry they had forgotten what it was to sleep out a watch and all watches it was all hands on deck they caught snatches of agonized sleep and they slept in their oilskins ready for the everlasting call so weak and worn were they that it took both watches to do the work of one that was why both watches were on deck so much of the time and no shadow of a man could shirk duty nothing less than a broken leg could enable a man to knock off work and there were two such who had been mauled and pulped by the seas that broke aboard  one other man who was the shadow of a man was george dorety he was the only passenger on board a friend of the firm and he had elected to make the voyage for his health but seven weeks of cape horn had not bettered his health he gasped and panted in his bunk through the long heaving nights and when on deck he was so bundled up for warmth that he resembled a peripatetic oldclothes shop at midday eating at the cabin table in a gloom so deep that the swinging sealamps burned always he looked as bluegray as the sickest saddest man forard nor did gazing across the table at captain dan cullen have any cheering effect upon him captain cullen chewed and scowled and kept silent the scowls were for god and with every chew he reiterated the sole thought of his existence which was make westing he was a big hairy brute and the sight of him was not stimulating to the others appetite he looked upon george dorety as a jonah and told him so once each meal savagely transferring the scowl from god to the passenger and back again  nor did the mate prove a first aid to a languid appetite joshua higgins by name a seaman by profession and pull but a potwolloper by capacity he was a loosejointed sniffling creature heartless and selfish and cowardly without a soul in fear of his life of dan cullen and a bully over the sailors who knew that behind the mate was captain cullen the lawgiver and compeller the driver and the destroyer the incarnation of a dozen bucko mates in that wild weather at the southern end of the earth joshua higgins ceased washing his grimy face usually robbed george dorety of what little appetite he managed to accumulate ordinarily this lavatorial dereliction would have caught captain cullens eye and vocabulary but in the present his mind was filled with making westing to the exclusion of all other things not contributory thereto whether the mates face was clean or dirty had no bearing upon westing later on when 50 degrees south in the pacific had been reached joshua higgins would wash his face very abruptly in the meantime at the cabin table where gray twilight alternated with lamplight while the lamps were being filled george dorety sat between the two men one a tiger and the other a hyena and wondered why god had made them the second mate matthew turner was a true sailor and a man but george dorety did not have the solace of his company for he ate by himself solitary when they had finished  on saturday morning july 24 george dorety awoke to a feeling of life and headlong movement on deck he found the mary rogers running off before a howling southeaster nothing was set but the lower topsails and the foresail it was all she could stand yet she was making fourteen knots as mr turner shouted in doretys ear when he came on deck and it was all westing she was going around the horn at last if the wind held mr turner looked happy the end of the struggle was in sight but captain cullen did not look happy he scowled at dorety in passing captain cullen did not want god to know that he was pleased with that wind he had a conception of a malicious god and believed in his secret soul that if god knew it was a desirable wind god would promptly efface it and send a snorter from the west so he walked softly before god smothering his joy down under scowls and muttered curses and so fooling god for god was the only thing in the universe of which dan cullen was afraid  all saturday and saturday night the mary rogers raced her westing persistently she logged her fourteen knots so that by sunday morning she had covered three hundred and fifty miles if the wind held she would make around if it failed and the snorter came from anywhere between southwest and north back the mary rogers would be hurled and be no better off than she had been seven weeks before and on sunday morning the wind was failing the big sea was going down and running smooth both watches were on deck setting sail after sail as fast as the ship could stand it and now captain cullen went around brazenly before god smoking a big cigar smiling jubilantly as if the failing wind delighted him while down underneath he was raging against god for taking the life out of the blessed wind make westing so he would if god would only leave him alone secretly he pledged himself anew to the powers of darkness if they would let him make westing he pledged himself so easily because he did not believe in the powers of darkness he really believed only in god though he did not know it and in his inverted theology god was really the prince of darkness captain cullen was a devilworshipper but he called the devil by another name that was all  at midday after calling eight bells captain cullen ordered the royals on the men went aloft faster than they had gone in weeks not alone were they nimble because of the westing but a benignant sun was shining down and limbering their stiff bodies george dorety stood aft near captain cullen less bundled in clothes than usual soaking in the grateful warmth as he watched the scene swiftly and abruptly the incident occurred there was a cry from the foreroyalyard of man overboard somebody threw a lifebuoy over the side and at the same instant the second mates voice came aft ringing and peremptory  hard down your helm  the man at the wheel never moved a spoke he knew better for captain dan cullen was standing alongside of him he wanted to move a spoke to move all the spokes to grind the wheel down hard down for his comrade drowning in the sea he glanced at captain dan cullen and captain dan cullen gave no sign  down hard down the second mate roared as he sprang aft  but he ceased springing and commanding and stood still when he saw dan cullen by the wheel and big dan cullen puffed at his cigar and said nothing astern and going astern fast could be seen the sailor he had caught the lifebuoy and was clinging to it nobody spoke nobody moved the men aloft clung to the royal yards and watched with terrorstricken faces and the mary rogers raced on making her westing a long silent minute passed  who was it captain cullen demanded  mops sir eagerly answered the sailor at the wheel  mops topped a wave astern and disappeared temporarily in the trough it was a large wave but it was no graybeard a small boat could live easily in such a sea and in such a sea the mary rogers could easily come to but she could not come to and make westing at the same time  for the first time in all his years george dorety was seeing a real drama of life and deatha sordid little drama in which the scales balanced an unknown sailor named mops against a few miles of longitude at first he had watched the man astern but now he watched big dan cullen hairy and black vested with power of life and death smoking a cigar  captain dan cullen smoked another long silent minute then he removed the cigar from his mouth he glanced aloft at the spars of the mary rogers and overside at the sea  sheet home the royals he cried  fifteen minutes later they sat at table in the cabin with food served before them on one side of george dorety sat dan cullen the tiger on the other side joshua higgins the hyena nobody spoke on deck the men were sheeting home the skysails george dorety could hear their cries while a persistent vision haunted him of a man called mops alive and well clinging to a lifebuoy miles astern in that lonely ocean he glanced at captain cullen and experienced a feeling of nausea for the man was eating his food with relish almost bolting it  captain cullen dorety said you are in command of this ship and it is not proper for me to comment now upon what you do but i wish to say one thing there is a hereafter and yours will be a hot one  captain cullen did not even scowl in his voice was regret as he said  it was blowing a living gale it was impossible to save the man  he fell from the royalyard dorety cried hotly you were setting the royals at the time fifteen minutes afterward you were setting the skysails  it was a living gale wasnt it mr higgin captain cullen said turning to the mate  if youd brought her to itd have taken the sticks out of her was the mates answer you did the proper thing captain cullen the man hadnt a ghost of a show  george dorety made no answer and to the meals end no one spoke after that dorety had his meals served in his stateroom captain cullen scowled at him no longer though no speech was exchanged between them while the mary rogers sped north toward warmer latitudes at the end of the week dan cullen cornered dorety on deck  what are you going to do when we get to frisco he demanded bluntly  i am going to swear out a warrant for your arrest dorety answered quietly i am going to charge you with murder and i am going to see you hanged for it  youre almighty sure of yourself captain cullen sneered turning on his heel  a second week passed and one morning found george dorety standing in the coachhouse companionway at the forard end of the long poop taking his first gaze around the deck the mary rogers was reaching fullandby in a stiff breeze every sail was set and drawing including the staysails captain cullen strolled forard along the poop he strolled carelessly glancing at the passenger out of the corner of his eye dorety was looking the other way standing with head and shoulders outside the companionway and only the back of his head was to be seen captain cullen with swift eye embraced the mainstaysailblock and the head and estimated the distance he glanced about him nobody was looking aft joshua higgins pacing up and down had just turned his back and was going the other way captain cullen bent over suddenly and cast the staysailsheet off from its pin the heavy block hurtled through the air smashing doretys head like an eggshell and hurtling on and back and forth as the staysail whipped and slatted in the wind joshua higgins turned around to see what had carried away and met the full blast of the vilest portion of captain cullens profanity  i made the sheet fast myself whimpered the mate in the first lull with an extra turn to make sure i remember it distinctly  made fast the captain snarled back for the benefit of the watch as it struggled to capture the flying sail before it tore to ribbons you couldnt make your grandmother fast you useless hells scullion if you made that sheet fast with an extra turn why in hell didnt it stay fast thats what i want to know why in hell didnt it stay fast  the mate whined inarticulately  oh shut up was the final word of captain cullen  half an hour later he was as surprised as any when the body of george dorety was found inside the companionway on the floor in the afternoon alone in his room he doctored up the log  ordinary seaman karl brun he wrote lost overboard from foreroyalyard in a gale of wind was running at the time and for the safety of the ship did not dare come up to the wind nor could a boat have lived in the sea that was running  on another page he wrote  had often warned mr dorety about the danger he ran because of his carelessness on deck i told him once that some day he would get his head knocked off by a block a carelessly fastened mainstaysail sheet was the cause of the accident which was deeply to be regretted because mr dorety was a favourite with all of us  captain dan cullen read over his literary effort with admiration blotted the page and closed the log he lighted a cigar and stared before him he felt the mary rogers lift and heel and surge along and knew that she was making nine knots a smile of satisfaction slowly dawned on his black and hairy face well anyway he had made his westing and fooled god     semper idem  doctor bicknell was in a remarkably gracious mood through a minor accident a slight bit of carelessness that was all a man who might have pulled through had died the preceding night though it had been only a sailorman one of the innumerable unwashed the steward of the receiving hospital had been on the anxious seat all the morning it was not that the man had died that gave him discomfort he knew the doctor too well for that but his distress lay in the fact that the operation had been done so well one of the most delicate in surgery it had been as successful as it was clever and audacious all had then depended upon the treatment the nurses the steward and the man had died nothing much a bit of carelessness yet enough to bring the professional wrath of doctor bicknell about his ears and to perturb the working of the staff and nurses for twentyfour hours to come  but as already stated the doctor was in a remarkably gracious mood when informed by the steward in fear and trembling of the mans unexpected takeoff his lips did not so much as form one syllable of censure nay they were so pursed that snatches of ragtime floated softly from them to be broken only by a pleasant query after the health of the others eldestborn the steward deeming it impossible that he could have caught the gist of the case repeated it  yes yes doctor bicknell said impatiently i understand but how about semper idem is he ready to leave  yes theyre helping him dress now the steward answered passing on to the round of his duties content that peace still reigned within the iodinesaturated walls  it was semper idems recovery which had so fully compensated doctor bicknell for the loss of the sailorman lives were to him as nothing the unpleasant but inevitable incidents of the profession but cases ah cases were everything people who knew him were prone to brand him a butcher but his colleagues were at one in the belief that a bolder and yet a more capable man never stood over the table he was not an imaginative man he did not possess and hence had no tolerance for emotion his nature was accurate precise scientific men were to him no more than pawns without individuality or personal value but as cases it was different the more broken a man was the more precarious his grip on life the greater his significance in the eyes of doctor bicknell he would as readily forsake a poet laureate suffering from a common accident for a nameless mangled vagrant who defied every law of life by refusing to die as would a child forsake a punch and judy for a circus  so it had been in the case of semper idem the mystery of the man had not appealed to him nor had his silence and the veiled romance which the yellow reporters had so sensationally and so fruitlessly exploited in divers sunday editions but semper idems throat had been cut that was the point that was where his interest had centred cut from ear to ear and not one surgeon in a thousand to give a snap of the fingers for his chance of recovery but thanks to the swift municipal ambulance service and to doctor bicknell he had been dragged back into the world he had sought to leave the doctors coworkers had shaken their heads when the case was brought in impossible they said throat windpipe jugular all but actually severed and the loss of blood frightful as it was such a foregone conclusion doctor bicknell had employed methods and done things which made them even in their professional capacities shudder and lo the man had recovered  so on this morning that semper idem was to leave the hospital hale and hearty doctor bicknells geniality was in nowise disturbed by the stewards report and he proceeded cheerfully to bring order out of the chaos of a childs body which had been ground and crunched beneath the wheels of an electric car  as many will remember the case of semper idem aroused a vast deal of unseemly yet highly natural curiosity he had been found in a slum lodging with throat cut as aforementioned and blood dripping down upon the inmates of the room below and disturbing their festivities he had evidently done the deed standing with head bowed forward that he might gaze his last upon a photograph which stood on the table propped against a candlestick it was this attitude which had made it possible for doctor bicknell to save him so terrific had been the sweep of the razor that had he had his head thrown back as he should have done to have accomplished the act properly with his neck stretched and the elastic vascular walls distended he would have of a certainty wellnigh decapitated himself  at the hospital during all the time he travelled the repugnant road back to life not a word had left his lips nor could anything be learned of him by the sleuths detailed by the chief of police nobody knew him nor had ever seen or heard of him before he was strictly uniquely of the present his clothes and surroundings were those of the lowest labourer his hands the hands of a gentleman but not a shred of writing was discovered nothing save in one particular which would serve to indicate his past or his position in life  and that one particular was the photograph if it were at all a likeness the woman who gazed frankly out upon the onlooker from the cardmount must have been a striking creature indeed it was an amateur production for the detectives were baffled in that no professional photographers signature or studio was appended across a corner of the mount in delicate feminine tracery was written semper idem semper fidelis and she looked it as many recollect it was a face one could never forget clever halftones remarkably like were published in all the leading papers at the time but such procedure gave rise to nothing but the uncontrollable public curiosity and interminable copy to the spacewriters  for want of a better name the rescued suicide was known to the hospital attendants and to the world as semper idem and semper idem he remained reporters detectives and nurses gave him up in despair not one word could he be persuaded to utter yet the flitting conscious light of his eyes showed that his ears heard and his brain grasped every question put to him  but this mystery and romance played no part in doctor bicknells interest when he paused in the office to have a parting word with his patient he the doctor had performed a prodigy in the matter of this man done what was virtually unprecedented in the annals of surgery he did not care who or what the man was and it was highly improbable that he should ever see him again but like the artist gazing upon a finished creation he wished to look for the last time upon the work of his hand and brain  semper idem still remained mute he seemed anxious to be gone not a word could the doctor extract from him and little the doctor cared he examined the throat of the convalescent carefully idling over the hideous scar with the lingering halfcaressing fondness of a parent it was not a particularly pleasing sight an angry line circled the throatfor all the world as though the man had just escaped the hangmans nooseand disappearing below the ear on either side had the appearance of completing the fiery periphery at the nape of the neck  maintaining his dogged silence yielding to the others examination in much the manner of a leashed lion semper idem betrayed only his desire to drop from out of the public eye  well ill not keep you doctor bicknell finally said laying a hand on the mans shoulder and stealing a last glance at his own handiwork but let me give you a bit of advice next time you try it on hold your chin up so dont snuggle it down and butcher yourself like a cow neatness and despatch you know neatness and despatch  semper idems eyes flashed in token that he heard and a moment later the hospital door swung to on his heel  it was a busy day for doctor bicknell and the afternoon was well along when he lighted a cigar preparatory to leaving the table upon which it seemed the sufferers almost clamoured to be laid but the last one an old ragpicker with a broken shoulderblade had been disposed of and the first fragrant smoke wreaths had begun to curl about his head when the gong of a hurrying ambulance came through the open window from the street followed by the inevitable entry of the stretcher with its ghastly freight  lay it on the table the doctor directed turning for a moment to place his cigar in safety what is it  suicidethroat cut responded one of the stretcher bearers down on morgan alley little hope i think sir hes most gone  eh well ill give him a look anyway he leaned over the man at the moment when the quick made its last faint flutter and succumbed  its semper idem come back again the steward said  ay replied doctor bicknell and gone again no bungling this time properly done upon my life sir properly done took my advice to the letter im not required here take it along to the morgue  doctor bicknell secured his cigar and relighted it that he said between the puffs looking at the steward that evens up for the one you lost last night were quits now     a nose for the king  in the morning calm of korea when its peace and tranquillity truly merited its ancient name chosen there lived a politician by name yi chin ho he was a man of parts andwho shall sayperhaps in no wise worse than politicians the world over but unlike his brethren in other lands yi chin ho was in jail not that he had inadvertently diverted to himself public moneys but that he had inadvertently diverted too much excess is to be deplored in all things even in grafting and yi chin hos excess had brought him to most deplorable straits  ten thousand strings of cash he owed the government and he lay in prison under sentence of death there was one advantage to the situationhe had plenty of time in which to think and he thought well then called he the jailer to him  most worthy man you see before you one most wretched he began yet all will be well with me if you will but let me go free for one short hour this night and all will be well with you for i shall see to your advancement through the years and you shall come at length to the directorship of all the prisons of chosen  how now demanded the jailer what foolishness is this one short hour and you but waiting for your head to be chopped off and i with an aged and muchtoberespected mother not to say anything of a wife and several children of tender years out upon you for the scoundrel that you are  from the sacred city to the ends of all the eight coasts there is no place for me to hide yi chin ho made reply i am a man of wisdom but of what worth my wisdom here in prison were i free well i know i could seek out and obtain the money wherewith to repay the government i know of a nose that will save me from all my difficulties  a nose cried the jailer  a nose said yi chin ho a remarkable nose if i may say so a most remarkable nose  the jailer threw up his hands despairingly ah what a wag you are what a wag he laughed to think that that very admirable wit of yours must go the way of the choppingblock  and so saying he turned and went away but in the end being a man soft of head and heart when the night was well along he permitted yi chin ho to go  straight he went to the governor catching him alone and arousing him from his sleep  yi chin ho or im no governor cried the governor what do you here who should be in prison waiting on the choppingblock  i pray your excellency to listen to me said yi chin ho squatting on his hams by the bedside and lighting his pipe from the firebox a dead man is without value it is true i am as a dead man without value to the government to your excellency or to myself but if so to say your excellency were to give me my freedom  impossible cried the governor beside you are condemned to death  your excellency well knows that if i can repay the ten thousand strings of cash the government will pardon me yi chin ho went on so as i say if your excellency were to give me my freedom for a few days being a man of understanding i should then repay the government and be in position to be of service to your excellency i should be in position to be of very great service to your excellency  have you a plan whereby you hope to obtain this money asked the governor  i have said yi chin ho  then come with it to me tomorrow night i would now sleep said the governor taking up his snore where it had been interrupted  on the following night having again obtained leave of absence from the jailer yi chin ho presented himself at the governors bedside  is it you yi chin ho asked the governor and have you the plan  it is i your excellency answered yi chin ho and the plan is here  speak commanded the governor  the plan is here repeated yi chin ho here in my hand  the governor sat up and opened his eyes yi chin ho proffered in his hand a sheet of paper the governor held it to the light  nothing but a nose said he  a bit pinched so and so your excellency said yi chin ho  yes a bit pinched here and there as you say said the governor  withal it is an exceeding corpulent nose thus and so all in one place at the end proceeded yi chin ho your excellency would seek far and wide and many a day for that nose and find it not  an unusual nose admitted the governor  there is a wart upon it said yi chin ho  a most unusual nose said the governor never have i seen the like but what do you with this nose yi chin ho  i seek it whereby to repay the money to the government said yi chin ho i seek it to be of service to your excellency and i seek it to save my own worthless head further i seek your excellencys seal upon this picture of the nose  and the governor laughed and affixed the seal of state and yi chin ho departed for a month and a day he travelled the kings road which leads to the shore of the eastern sea and there one night at the gate of the largest mansion of a wealthy city he knocked loudly for admittance  none other than the master of the house will i see said he fiercely to the frightened servants i travel upon the kings business  straightway was he led to an inner room where the master of the house was roused from his sleep and brought blinking before him  you are pak chung chang head man of this city said yi chin ho in tones that were allaccusing i am upon the kings business  pak chung chang trembled well he knew the kings business was ever a terrible business his knees smote together and he near fell to the floor  the hour is late he quavered were it not well to  the kings business never waits thundered yi chin ho come apart with me and swiftly i have an affair of moment to discuss with you  it is the kings affair he added with even greater fierceness so that pak chung changs silver pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers and clattered on the floor  know then said yi chin ho when they had gone apart that the king is troubled with an affliction a very terrible affliction in that he failed to cure the court physician has had nothing else than his head chopped off from all the eight provinces have the physicians come to wait upon the king wise consultation have they held and they have decided that for a remedy for the kings affliction nothing else is required than a nose a certain kind of nose a very peculiar certain kind of nose  then by none other was i summoned than his excellency the prime minister himself he put a paper into my hand upon this paper was the very peculiar kind of nose drawn by the physicians of the eight provinces with the seal of state upon it  go said his excellency the prime minister seek out this nose for the kings affliction is sore and wheresoever you find this nose upon the face of a man strike it off forthright and bring it in all haste to the court for the king must be cured go and come not back until your search is rewarded  and so i departed upon my quest said yi chin ho i have sought out the remotest corners of the kingdom i have travelled the eight highways searched the eight provinces and sailed the seas of the eight coasts and here i am  with a great flourish he drew a paper from his girdle unrolled it with many snappings and cracklings and thrust it before the face of pak chung chang upon the paper was the picture of the nose  pak chung chang stared upon it with bulging eyes  never have i beheld such a nose he began  there is a wart upon it said yi chin ho  never have i beheld pak chung chang began again  bring your father before me yi chin ho interrupted sternly  my ancient and verymuchtoberespected ancestor sleeps said pak chung chang  why dissemble demanded yi chin ho you know it is your fathers nose bring him before me that i may strike it off and be gone hurry lest i make bad report of you  mercy cried pak chung chang falling on his knees it is impossible it is impossible you cannot strike off my fathers nose he cannot go down without his nose to the grave he will become a laughter and a byword and all my days and nights will be filled with woe o reflect report that you have seen no such nose in your travels you too have a father  pak chung chang clasped yi chin hos knees and fell to weeping on his sandals  my heart softens strangely at your tears said yi chin ho i too know filial piety and regard but he hesitated then added as though thinking aloud it is as much as my head is worth  how much is your head worth asked pak chung chang in a thin small voice  a not remarkable head said yi chin ho an absurdly unremarkable head but such is my great foolishness i value it at nothing less than one hundred thousand strings of cash  so be it said pak chung chang rising to his feet  i shall need horses to carry the treasure said yi chin ho and men to guard it well as i journey through the mountains there are robbers abroad in the land  there are robbers abroad in the land said pak chung chang sadly but it shall be as you wish so long as my ancient and verymuchtoberespected ancestors nose abide in its appointed place  say nothing to any man of this occurrence said yi chin ho else will other and more loyal servants than i be sent to strike off your fathers nose  and so yi chin ho departed on his way through the mountains blithe of heart and gay of song as he listened to the jingling bells of his treasureladen ponies  there is little more to tell yi chin ho prospered through the years by his efforts the jailer attained at length to the directorship of all the prisons of chosen the governor ultimately betook himself to the sacred city to be prime minister to the king while yi chin ho became the kings boon companion and sat at table with him to the end of a round fat life but pak chung chang fell into a melancholy and ever after he shook his head sadly with tears in his eyes whenever he regarded the expensive nose of his ancient and verymuchtoberespected ancestor     the francis spaight  a true tale retold  the francis spaight was running before it solely under a mizzentopsail when the thing happened it was not due to carelessness so much as to the lack of discipline of the crew and to the fact that they were indifferent seamen at best the man at the wheel in particular a limerick man had had no experience with salt water beyond that of rafting timber on the shannon between the quebec vessels and the shore he was afraid of the huge seas that rose out of the murk astern and bore down upon him and he was more given to cowering away from their threatened impact than he was to meeting their blows with the wheel and checking the ships rush to broach to  it was three in the morning when his unseamanlike conduct precipitated the catastrophe at sight of a sea far larger than its fellows he crouched down releasing his hands from the spokes the francis spaight sheered as her stern lifted on the sea receiving the full fling of the cap on her quarter the next instant she was in the trough her leerail buried till the ocean was level with her hatchcoamings sea after sea breaking over her weather rail and sweeping what remained exposed of the deck with icy deluges  the men were out of hand helpless and hopeless stupid in their bewilderment and fear and resolute only in that they would not obey orders some wailed others clung silently in the weather shrouds and still others muttered prayers or shrieked vile imprecations and neither captain nor mate could get them to bear a hand at the pumps or at setting patches of sails to bring the vessel up to the wind and sea inside the hour the ship was over on her beam ends the lubberly cowards climbing up her side and hanging on in the rigging when she went over the mate was caught and drowned in the aftercabin as were two sailors who had sought refuge in the forecastle  the mate had been the ablest man on board and the captain was now scarcely less helpless than his men beyond cursing them for their worthlessness he did nothing and it remained for a man named mahoney a belfast man and a boy obrien of limerick to cut away the fore and main masts this they did at great risk on the perpendicular wall of the wreck sending the mizzentopmast overside along in the general crash the francis spaight righted and it was well that she was lumber laden else she would have sunk for she was already waterlogged the mainmast still fast by the shrouds beat like a thunderous sledgehammer against the ships side every stroke bringing groans from the men  day dawned on the savage ocean and in the cold gray light all that could be seen of the francis spaight emerging from the sea were the poop the shattered mizzenmast and a ragged line of bulwarks it was midwinter in the north atlantic and the wretched men were halfdead from cold but there was no place where they could find rest every sea breached clean over the wreck washing away the salt incrustations from their bodies and depositing fresh incrustations the cabin under the poop was awash to the knees but here at least was shelter from the chill wind and here the survivors congregated standing upright holding on by the cabin furnishings and leaning against one another for support  in vain mahoney strove to get the men to take turns in watching aloft from the mizzenmast for any chance vessel the icy gale was too much for them and they preferred the shelter of the cabin obrien the boy who was only fifteen took turns with mahoney on the freezing perch it was the boy at three in the afternoon who called down that he had sighted a sail this did bring them from the cabin and they crowded the poop rail and weather mizzen shrouds as they watched the strange ship but its course did not lie near and when it disappeared below the skyline they returned shivering to the cabin not one offering to relieve the watch at the mast head  by the end of the second day mahoney and obrien gave up their attempt and thereafter the vessel drifted in the gale uncared for and without a lookout there were thirteen alive and for seventytwo hours they stood kneedeep in the sloshing water on the cabin floor halffrozen without food and with but three bottles of wine shared among them all food and fresh water were below and there was no getting at such supplies in the waterlogged condition of the wreck as the days went by no food whatever passed their lips fresh water in small quantities they were able to obtain by holding a cover of a tureen under the saddle of the mizzenmast but the rain fell infrequently and they were hard put when it rained they also soaked their handkerchiefs squeezing them out into their mouths or into their shoes as the wind and sea went down they were even able to mop the exposed portions of the deck that were free from brine and so add to their water supply but food they had none and no way of getting it though seabirds flew repeatedly overhead  in the calm weather that followed the gale after having remained on their feet for ninetysix hours they were able to find dry planks in the cabin on which to lie but the long hours of standing in the salt water had caused sores to form on their legs these sores were extremely painful the slightest contact or scrape caused severe anguish and in their weak condition and crowded situation they were continually hurting one another in this manner not a man could move about without being followed by volleys of abuse curses and groans so great was their misery that the strong oppressed the weak shoving them aside from the dry planks to shift for themselves in the cold and wet the boy obrien was specially maltreated though there were three other boys it was obrien who came in for most of the abuse there was no explaining it except on the ground that his was a stronger and more dominant spirit than those of the other boys and that he stood up more for his rights resenting the petty injustices that were meted out to all the boys by the men whenever obrien came near the men in search of a dry place to sleep or merely moved about he was kicked and cuffed away in return he cursed them for their selfish brutishness and blows and kicks and curses were rained upon him miserable as were all of them he was thus made far more miserable and it was only the flame of life unusually strong in him that enabled him to endure  as the days went by and they grew weaker their peevishness and illtemper increased which in turn increased the illtreatment and sufferings of obrien by the sixteenth day all hands were far gone with hunger and they stood together in small groups talking in undertones and occasionally glancing at obrien it was at high noon that the conference came to a head the captain was the spokesman all were collected on the poop  men the captain began we have been a long time without foodtwo weeks and two days it is though it seems more like two years and two months we cant hang out much longer it is beyond human nature to go on hanging out with nothing in our stomachs there is a serious question to consider whether it is better for all to die or for one to die we are standing with our feet in our graves if one of us dies the rest may live until a ship is sighted what say you  michael behane the man who had been at the wheel when the francis spaight broached to called out that it was well the others joined in the cry  let it be one of the bys cried sullivan a tarbert man glancing at the same time significantly at obrien  it is my opinion the captain went on that it will be a good deed for one of us to die for the rest  a good deed a good deed the men interjected  and it is my opinion that tis best for one of the boys to die they have no families to support nor would they be considered so great a loss to their friends as those who have wives and children  tis right very right very fit it should be done the men muttered one to another  but the four boys cried out against the injustice of it  our lives is just as dear to us as the rest iv yez obrien protested an our famblies too as for wives an childer who is there savin meself to care for me old mother thats a widow as you know well michael behane that comes from limerick tis not fair let the lots be drawn between all of us men and bys  mahoney was the only man who spoke in favour of the boys declaring that it was the fair thing for all to share alike sullivan and the captain insisted on the drawing of lots being confined to the boys there were high words in the midst of which sullivan turned upon obrien snarling  twould be a good deed to put you out of the way you deserve it twould be the right way to serve you an serve you we will  he started toward obrien with intent to lay hands on him and proceed at once with the killing while several others likewise shuffled toward him and reached for him he stumbled backwards to escape them at the same time crying that he would submit to the drawing of the lots among the boys  the captain prepared four sticks of different lengths and handed them to sullivan  youre thinkin the drawinll not be fair the latter sneered to obrien so its yerselfll do the drawin  to this obrien agreed a handkerchief was tied over his eyes blindfolding him and he knelt down on the deck with his back to sullivan  whoever you name for the shortest stickll die the captain said  sullivan held up one of the sticks the rest were concealed in his hand so that no one could see whether it was the short stick or not  an whose stick will it be sullivan demanded  for little johnny sheehan obrien answered  sullivan laid the stick aside those who looked could not tell if it were the fatal one sullivan held up another stick  whose will it be  for george burns was the reply  the stick was laid with the first one and a third held up  an whose is this wan  for myself said obrien  with a quick movement sullivan threw the four sticks together no one had seen  tis for yourself yeve drawn it sullivan announced  a good deed several of the men muttered  obrien was very quiet he arose to his feet took the bandage off and looked around  where is ut he demanded the short stick the wan for me  the captain pointed to the four sticks lying on the deck  how do you know the stick was mine obrien questioned did you see ut johnny sheehan  johnny sheehan who was the youngest of the boys did not answer  did you see ut obrien next asked mahoney  no i didnt see ut  the men were muttering and growling  twas a fair drawin sullivan said ye had yer chanct an ye lost thats all iv ut  a fair drawin the captain added didnt i behold it myself the stick was yours obrien an ye may as well get ready wheres the cook gorman come here fetch the tureen cover some of ye gorman do your duty like a man  but howll i do it the cook demanded he was a weakeyed weakchinned indecisive man  tis a damned murder obrien cried out  ill have none

irresolutely  if yez dont make mate for us well be makin mate of yerself behane threatened somebody must die an as well you as another  johnny sheehan began to cry obrien listened anxiously his face was pale his lips trembled and at times his whole body shook  i signed on as cook gorman enounced an cook i wud if galley there was but ill not lay me hand to murder tis not in the articles im the cook  an cook yell be for wan minute more only sullivan said grimly at the same moment gripping the cooks head from behind and bending it back till the windpipe and jugular were stretched taut wheres yer knife mike pass it along  at the touch of the steel gorman whimpered  ill do ut if yezll hold the by  the pitiable condition of the cook seemed in some fashion to nerve up obrien  its all right gorman he said go on with ut tis meself knows yer not wantin to do ut its all right sirthis to the captain who had laid a hand heavily on his arm ye wont have to hold me sir ill stand still  stop yer blitherin an go an get the tureen cover behane commanded johnny sheehan at the same time dealing him a heavy cuff alongside the head  the boy who was scarcely more than a child fetched the cover he crawled and tottered along the deck so weak was he from hunger the tears still ran down his cheeks behane took the cover from him at the same time administering another cuff  obrien took off his coat and bared his right arm his under lip still trembled but he held a tight grip on himself the captains penknife was opened and passed to gorman  mahoney tell me mother what happened to me if ever ye get back obrien requested  mahoney nodded  tis black murder black an damned he said the bys fleshll do none iv yez anny good mark me words yell not profit by it none iv yez  get ready the captain ordered you sullivan hold the coverthats itclose up spill nothing its precious stuff  gorman made an effort the knife was dull he was weak besides his hand was shaking so violently that he nearly dropped the knife the three boys were crouched apart in a huddle crying and sobbing with the exception of mahoney the men were gathered about the victim craning their necks to see  be a man gorman the captain cautioned  the wretched cook was seized with a spasm of resolution sawing back and forth with the blade on obriens wrist the veins were severed sullivan held the tureen cover close underneath the cut veins gaped wide but no ruddy flood gushed forth there was no blood at all the veins were dry and empty no one spoke the grim and silent figures swayed in unison with each heave of the ship every eye was turned fixedly upon that inconceivable and monstrous thing the dry veins of a creature that was alive  tis a warnin mahoney cried lave the by alone mark me words his deathll do none iv yez anny good  try at the elbowthe left elbow tis nearer the heart the captain said finally in a dim and husky voice that was unlike his own  give me the knife obrien said roughly taking it out of the cooks hand i cant be lookin at ye puttin me to hurt  quite coolly he cut the vein at the left elbow but like the cook he failed to bring blood  this is all iv no use sullivan said tis better to put

head off iv me an died happy  sullivan leaped in and caught the unhappy lad by the hair the rest of the men followed obrien kicked and struggled snarling and snapping at the hands that clutched him from every side little johnny sheehan broke out into wild screaming but the men took no notice of him obrien was bent backward to the deck the tureen cover under his neck gorman was shoved forward some one had thrust a large sheathknife into his hand  do yer duty do yer duty the men cried  the cook bent over but he caught the boys eyes and faltered  if ye dont ill kill ye with me own hands behane shouted  from every side a torrent of abuse and threats poured in upon the cook still he hung back  maybe therell be more blood in his veins than obriens sullivan suggested significantly  behane caught gorman by the hair and twisted his head back while sullivan attempted to take possession of the sheathknife but gorman clung to it desperately  lave go an ill do ut he screamed frantically dont be cuttin me throat ill do the deed ill do the deed  see that you do it then the captain threatened him  gorman allowed himself to be shoved forward he looked at the boy closed his eyes and muttered a prayer then without opening his eyes he did the deed that had been appointed him obrien emitted a shriek that sank swiftly to a gurgling sob the men held him till his struggles ceased when he was laid upon the deck they were eager and impatient and with oaths and threats they urged gorman to hurry with the preparation of the meal  lave ut you bloody butchers mahoney said quietly lave ut i tell yez yell not be needin anny iv ut now tis as i said yell not be profitin by the lads blood empty ut overside behane empty ut overside  behane still holding the tureen cover in both his hands glanced to windward he walked to the rail and threw the cover and contents into the sea a fullrigged ship was bearing down upon them a short mile away so occupied had they been with the deed just committed that none had had eyes for a lookout all hands watched her coming onthe brightly coppered forefoot parting the water like a golden knife the headsails flapping lazily and emptily at each downward surge and the towering canvas tiers dipping and curtsying with each stately swing of the sea no man spoke  as she hove to a cable length away the captain of the francis spaight bestirred himself and ordered a tarpaulin to be thrown over obriens corpse a boat was lowered from the strangers side and began to pull toward them john gorman laughed he laughed softly at first but he accompanied each stroke of the oars with spasmodically increasing glee it was this maniacal laughter that greeted the rescue boat as it hauled alongside and the first officer clambered on board     a curious fragment       the capitalist or industrial oligarch roger vanderwater      mentioned in the narrative has been identified as the ninth      in the line of the vanderwaters that controlled for hundreds      of years the cotton factories of the south this roger      vanderwater flourished in the last decades of the twenty      sixth century after christ which was the fifth century of      the terrible industrial oligarchy that was reared upon the      ruins of the early republic       from internal evidences we are convinced that the narrative      which follows was not reduced to writing till the twenty      ninth century not only was it unlawful to write or print      such matter during that period but the workingclass was so      illiterate that only in rare instances were its members able      to read and write this was the dark reign of the overman      in whose speech the great mass of the people were      characterized as the herd animals all literacy was      frowned upon and stamped out from the statutebooks of the      times may be instanced that black law that made it a capital      offence for any man no matter of what class to teach even      the alphabet to a member of the workingclass such      stringent limitation of education to the ruling class was      necessary if that class was to continue to rule       one result of the foregoing was the development of the      professional storytellers these storytellers were paid by      the oligarchy and the tales they told were legendary      mythical romantic and harmless but the spirit of freedom      never quite died out and agitators under the guise of      storytellers preached revolt to the slave class that the      following tale was banned by the oligarchs we have proof      from the records of the criminal police court of ashbury      wherein on january 27 2734 one john tourney found guilty      of telling the tale in a boozingken of labourers was      sentenced to five years penal servitude in the borax mines      of the arizona deserteditors note   listen my brothers and i will tell you a tale of an arm it was the arm of tom dixon and tom dixon was a weaver of the first class in a factory of that hellhound and master roger vanderwater this factory was called hells bottom by the slaves who toiled in it and i guess they ought to know and it was situated in kingsbury at the other end of the town from vanderwaters summer palace you do not know where kingsbury is there are many things my brothers that you do not know and it is sad it is because you do not know that you are slaves when i have told you this tale i should like to form a class among you for the learning of written and printed speech our masters read and write and possess many books and it is because of that that they are our masters and live in palaces and do not work when the toilers learn to read and writeall of themthey will grow strong then they will use their strength to break their bonds and there will be no more masters and no more slaves  kingsbury my brothers is in the old state of alabama for three hundred years the vanderwaters have owned kingsbury and its slave pens and factories and slave pens and factories in many other places and states you have heard of the vanderwaterswho has notbut let me tell you things you do not know about them the first vanderwater was a slave even as you and i have you got that he was a slave and that was over three hundred years ago his father was a machinist in the slave pen of alexander burrell and his mother was a washerwoman in the same slave pen there is no doubt about this i am telling you truth it is history it is printed every word of it in the history books of our masters which you cannot read because your masters will not permit you to learn to read you can understand why they will not permit you to learn to read when there are such things in the books they know and they are very wise if you did read such things you might be wanting in respect to your masters which would be a dangerous thing to your masters but i know for i can read and i am telling you what i have read with my own eyes in the history books of our masters  the first vanderwaters name was not vanderwater it was vangebill vange the son of yergis vange the machinist and laura carnly the washerwoman young bill vange was strong he might have remained with the slaves and led them to freedom instead however he served the masters and was well rewarded he began his service when yet a small child as a spy in his home slave pen he is known to have informed on his own father for seditious utterance this is fact i have read it with my own eyes in the records he was too good a slave for the slave pen alexander burrell took him out while yet a child and he was taught to read and write he was taught many things and he was entered in the secret service of the government of course he no longer wore the slave dress except for disguise at such times when he sought to penetrate the secrets and plots of the slaves it was he when but eighteen years of age who brought that great hero and comrade ralph jacobus to trial and execution in the electric chair of course you have all heard the sacred name of ralph jacobus but it is news to you that he was brought to his death by the first vanderwater whose name was vange i know i have read it in the books there are many interesting things like that in the books  and after ralph jacobus died his shameful death bill vanges name began the many changes it was to undergo he was known as sly vange far and wide he rose high in the secret service and he was rewarded in grand ways but still he was not a member of the master class the men were willing that he should become so it was the women of the master class who refused to have sly vange one of them sly vange gave good service to the masters he had been a slave himself and he knew the ways of the slaves there was no fooling him in those days the slaves were braver than now and they were always trying for their freedom and sly vange was everywhere in all their schemes and plans bringing their schemes and plans to naught and their leaders to the electric chair it was in 2255 that his name was next changed for him it was in that year that the great mutiny took place in that region west of the rocky mountains seventeen millions of slaves strove bravely to overthrow their masters who knows if sly vange had not lived but that they would have succeeded but sly vange was very much alive the masters gave him supreme command of the situation in eight months of fighting one million and three hundred and fifty thousand slaves were killed vange bill vange sly vange killed them and he broke the great mutiny and he was greatly rewarded and so red were his hands with the blood of the slaves that thereafter he was called bloody vange you see my brothers what interesting things are to be found in the books when one can read them and take my word for it there are many other things even more interesting in the books and if you will but study with me in a years time you can read those books for yourselvesay in six months some of you will be able to read those books for yourselves  bloody vange lived to a ripe old age and always to the last was he received in the councils of the masters but never was he made a master himself he had first opened his eyes you see in a slave pen but oh he was well rewarded he had a dozen palaces in which to live he who was no master owned thousands of slaves he had a great pleasure yacht upon the sea that was a floating palace and he owned a whole island in the sea where toiled ten thousand slaves on his coffee plantations but in his old age he was lonely for he lived apart hated by his brothers the slaves and looked down upon by those he had served and who refused to be his brothers the masters looked down upon him because he had been born a slave enormously wealthy he died but he died horribly tormented by his conscience regretting all he had done and the red stain on his name  but with his children it was different they had not been born in the slave pen and by the special ruling of the chief oligarch of that time john morrison they were elevated to the master class and it was then that the name of vange disappears from the page of history it becomes vanderwater and jason vange the son of bloody vange becomes jason vanderwater the founder of the vanderwater line but that was three hundred years ago and the vanderwaters of today forget their beginnings and imagine that somehow the clay of their bodies is different stuff from the clay in your body and mine and in the bodies of all slaves and i ask you why should a slave become the master of another slave and why should the son of a slave become the master of many slaves i leave these questions for you to answer for yourselves but do not forget that in the beginning the vanderwaters were slaves  and now my brothers i come back to the beginning of my tale to tell you of tom dixons arm roger vanderwaters factory in kingsbury was rightly named hells bottom but the men who toiled in it were men as you shall see women toiled there too and children little children all that toiled there had the regular slave rights under the law but only under the law for they were deprived of many of their rights by the two overseers of hells bottom joseph clancy and adolph munster  it is a long story but i shall not tell all of it to you i shall tell only about the arm it happened that according to the law a portion of the starvation wage of the slaves was held back each month and put into a fund this fund was for the purpose of helping such unfortunate fellowworkmen as happened to be injured by accidents or to be overtaken by sickness as you know with yourselves these funds are controlled by the overseers it is the law and so it was that the fund at hells bottom was controlled by the two overseers of accursed memory  now clancy and munster took this fund for their own use when accidents happened to the workmen their fellows as was the custom made grants from the fund but the overseers refused to pay over the grants what could the slaves do they had their rights under the law but they had no access to the law those that complained to the overseers were punished you know yourselves what form such punishment takesthe fines for faulty work that is not faulty the overcharging of accounts in the companys store the vile treatment of ones women and children and the allotment to bad machines whereon work as one will he starves  once the slaves of hells bottom protested to vanderwater it was the time of the year when he spent several months in kingsbury one of the slaves could write it chanced that his mother could write and she had secretly taught him as her mother had secretly taught her so this slave wrote a round robin wherein was contained their grievances and all the slaves signed by mark and with proper stamps upon the envelope the round robin was mailed to roger vanderwater and roger vanderwater did nothing save to turn the round robin over to the two overseers clancy and munster were angered they turned the guards loose at night on the slave pen the guards were armed with pick handles it is said that next day only half of the slaves were able to work in hells bottom they were well beaten the slave who could write was so badly beaten that he lived only three months but before he died he wrote once more to what purpose you shall hear  four or five weeks afterward tom dixon a slave had his arm torn off by a belt in hells bottom his fellowworkmen as usual made a grant to him from the fund and clancy and munster as usual refused to pay it over from the fund the slave who could write and who even then was dying wrote anew a recital of their grievances and this document was thrust into the hand of the arm that had been torn from tom dixons body  now it chanced that roger vanderwater was lying ill in his palace at the other end of kingsburynot the dire illness that strikes down you and me brothers just a bit of biliousness mayhap or no more than a bad headache because he had eaten too heartily or drunk too deeply but it was enough for him being tender and soft from careful rearing such men packed in cotton wool all their lives are exceeding tender and soft believe me brothers roger vanderwater felt as badly with his aching head or thought he felt as badly as tom dixon really felt with his arm torn out by the roots  it happened that roger vanderwater was fond of scientific farming and that on his farm three miles outside of kingsbury he had managed to grow a new kind of strawberry he was very proud of that new strawberry of his and he would have been out to see and pick the first ripe ones had it not been for his illness because of his illness he had ordered the old farm slave to bring in personally the first box of the berries all this was learned from the gossip of a palace scullion who slept each night in the slave pen the overseer of the plantation should have brought in the berries but he was on his back with a broken leg from trying to break a colt the scullion brought the word in the night and it was known that next day the berries would come in and the men in the slave pen of hells bottom being men and not cowards held a council  the slave who could write and who was sick and dying from the pickhandle beating said he would carry tom dixons arm also he said he must die anyway and that it mattered nothing if he died a little sooner so five slaves stole from the slave pen that night after the guards had made their last rounds one of the slaves was the man who could write they lay in the brush by the roadside until late in the morning when the old farm slave came driving to town with the precious fruit for the master what of the farm slave being old and rheumatic and of the slave who could write being stiff and injured from his beating they moved their bodies about when they walked very much in the same fashion the slave who could write put on the others clothes pulled the broadbrimmed hat over his eyes climbed upon the seat of the wagon and drove on to town the old farm slave was kept tied all day in the bushes until evening when the others loosed him and went back to the slave pen to take their punishment for having broken bounds  in the meantime roger vanderwater lay waiting for the berries in his wonderful bedroomsuch wonders and such comforts were there that they would have blinded the eyes of you and me who have never seen such things the slave who could write said afterward that it was like a glimpse of paradise and why not the labour and the lives of ten thousand slaves had gone to the making of that bedchamber while they themselves slept in vile lairs like wild beasts the slave who could write brought in the berries on a silver tray or platteryou see roger vanderwater wanted to speak with him in person about the berries  the slave who could write tottered his dying body across the wonderful room and knelt by the couch of vanderwater holding out before him the tray large green leaves covered the top of the tray and these the bodyservant alongside whisked away so that vanderwater could see and roger vanderwater propped upon his elbow saw he saw the fresh wonderful fruit lying there like precious jewels and in the midst of it the arm of tom dixon as it had been torn from his body well washed of course my brothers and very white against the bloodred fruit and also he saw clutched in the stiff dead fingers the petition of his slaves who toiled in hells bottom  take and read said the slave who could write and even as the master took the petition the bodyservant who till then had been motionless with surprise struck with his fist the kneeling slave upon the mouth the slave was dying anyway and was very weak and did not mind he made no sound and having fallen over on his side he lay there quietly bleeding from the blow on the mouth the physician who had run for the palace guards came back with them and the slave was dragged upright upon his feet but as they dragged him up his hand clutched tom dixons arm from where it had fallen on the floor  he shall be flung alive to the hounds the bodyservant was crying in great wrath he shall be flung alive to the hounds  but roger vanderwater forgetting his headache still leaning on his elbow commanded silence and went on reading the petition and while he read there was silence all standing upright the wrathful bodyservant the physician the palace guards and in their midst the slave bleeding at the mouth and still holding tom dixons arm and when roger vanderwater had done he turned upon the slave saying  if in this paper there be one lie you shall be sorry that you were ever born  and the slave said i have been sorry all my life that i was born  roger vanderwater looked at him closely and the slave said  you have done your worst to me i am dying now in a week i shall be dead so it does not matter if you kill me now  what do you with that the master asked pointing to the arm and the slave made answer  i take it back to the pen to give it burial tom dixon was my friend we worked beside each other at our looms  there is little more to my tale brothers the slave and the arm were sent back in a cart to the pen nor were any of the slaves punished for what they had done indeed roger vanderwater made investigation and punished the two overseers joseph clancy and adolph munster their freeholds were taken from them they were branded each upon the forehead their right hands were cut off and they were turned loose upon the highway to wander and beg until they died and the fund was managed rightfully thereafter for a timefor a time only my brothers for after roger vanderwater came his son albert who was a cruel master and half mad  brothers that slave who carried the arm into the presence of the master was my father he was a brave man and even as his mother secretly taught him to read so did he teach me because he died shortly after from the pickhandle beating roger vanderwater took me out of the slave pen and tried to make various better things out of me i might have become an overseer in hells bottom but i chose to become a storyteller wandering over the land and getting close to my brothers the slaves everywhere and i tell you stories like this secretly knowing that you will not betray me for if you did you know as well as i that my tongue will be torn out and that i shall tell stories no more and my message is brothers that there is a good time coming when all will be well in the world and there will be neither masters nor slaves but first you must prepare for that good time by learning to read there is power in the printed word and here am i to teach you to read and as well there are others to see that you get the books when i am gone along upon my waythe history books wherein you will learn about your masters and learn to become strong even as they  editors notefrom historical fragments and sketches first published in fifty volumes in 4427 and now after two hundred years because of its accuracy and value edited and republished by the national committee on historical research     a piece of steak  with the last morsel of bread tom king wiped his plate clean of the last particle of flour gravy and chewed the resulting mouthful in a slow and meditative way when he arose from the table he was oppressed by the feeling that he was distinctly hungry yet he alone had eaten the two children in the other room had been sent early to bed in order that in sleep they might forget they had gone supperless his wife had touched nothing and had sat silently and watched him with solicitous eyes she was a thin worn woman of the workingclass though signs of an earlier prettiness were not wanting in her face the flour for the gravy she had borrowed from the neighbour across the hall the last two hapennies had gone to buy the bread  he sat down by the window on a rickety chair that protested under his weight and quite mechanically he put his pipe in his mouth and dipped into the side pocket of his coat the absence of any tobacco made him aware of his action and with a scowl for his forgetfulness he put the pipe away his movements were slow almost hulking as though he were burdened by the heavy weight of his muscles he was a solidbodied stolidlooking man and his appearance did not suffer from being overprepossessing his rough clothes were old and slouchy the uppers of his shoes were too weak to carry the heavy resoling that was itself of no recent date and his cotton shirt a cheap two shilling affair showed a frayed collar and ineradicable paint stains  but it was tom kings face that advertised him unmistakably for what he was it was the face of a typical prizefighter of one who had put in long years of service in the squared ring and by that means developed and emphasized all the marks of the fighting beast it was distinctly a lowering countenance and that no feature of it might escape notice it was cleanshaven the lips were shapeless and constituted a mouth harsh to excess that was like a gash in his face the jaw was aggressive brutal heavy the eyes slow of movement and heavylidded were almost expressionless under the shaggy indrawn brows sheer animal that he was the eyes were the most animallike feature about him they were sleepy lionlikethe eyes of a fighting animal the forehead slanted quickly back to the hair which clipped close showed every bump of a villainouslooking head a nose twice broken and moulded variously by countless blows and a cauliflower ear permanently swollen and distorted to twice its size completed his adornment while the beard freshshaven as it was sprouted in the skin and gave the face a blueblack stain  altogether it was the face of a man to be afraid of in a dark alley or lonely place and yet tom king was not a criminal nor had he ever done anything criminal outside of brawls common to his walk in life he had harmed no one nor had he ever been known to pick a quarrel he was a professional and all the fighting brutishness of him was reserved for his professional appearances outside the ring he was slowgoing easynatured and in his younger days when money was flush too openhanded for his own good he bore no grudges and had few enemies fighting was a business with him in the ring he struck to hurt struck to maim struck to destroy but there was no animus in it it was a plain business proposition audiences assembled and paid for the spectacle of men knocking each other out the winner took the big end of the purse when tom king faced the woolloomoolloo gouger twenty years before he knew that the gougers jaw was only four months healed after having been broken in a newcastle bout and he had played for that jaw and broken it again in the ninth round not because he bore the gouger any illwill but because that was the surest way to put the gouger out and win the big end of the purse nor had the gouger borne him any illwill for it it was the game and both knew the game and played it  tom king had never been a talker and he sat by the window morosely silent staring at his hands the veins stood out on the backs of the hands large and swollen and the knuckles smashed and battered and malformed testified to the use to which they had been put he had never heard that a mans life was the life of his arteries but well he knew the meaning of those big upstanding veins his heart had pumped too much blood through them at top pressure they no longer did the work he had stretched the elasticity out of them and with their distension had passed his endurance he tired easily now no longer could he do a fast twenty rounds hammer and tongs fight fight fight from gong to gong with fierce rally on top of fierce rally beaten to the ropes and in turn beating his opponent to the ropes and rallying fiercest and fastest of all in that last twentieth round with the house on its feet and yelling himself rushing striking ducking raining showers of blows upon showers of blows and receiving showers of blows in return and all the time the heart faithfully pumping the surging blood through the adequate veins the veins swollen at the time had always shrunk down again though each time imperceptibly at first not quiteremaining just a trifle larger than before he stared at them and at his battered knuckles and for the moment caught a vision of the youthful excellence of those hands before the first knuckle had been smashed on the head of benny jones otherwise known as the welsh terror  the impression of his hunger came back on him  blimey but couldnt i go a piece of steak he muttered aloud clenching his huge fists and spitting out a smothered oath  i tried both burkes an sawleys his wife said half apologetically  an they wouldnt he demanded  not a hapenny burke said she faltered  gwan wotd he say  as how e was thinkin sandel ud do ye tonight an as how yer score was comfortable big as it was  tom king grunted but did not reply he was busy thinking of the bull terrier he had kept in his younger days to which he had fed steaks without end burke would have given him credit for a thousand steaksthen but times had changed tom king was getting old and old men fighting before secondrate clubs couldnt expect to run bills of any size with the tradesmen  he had got up in the morning with a longing for a piece of steak and the longing had not abated he had not had a fair training for this fight it was a drought year in australia times were hard and even the most irregular work was difficult to find he had had no sparring partner and his food had not been of the best nor always sufficient he had done a few days navvy work when he could get it and he had run around the domain in the early mornings to get his legs in shape but it was hard training without a partner and with a wife and two kiddies that must be fed credit with the tradesmen had undergone very slight expansion when he was matched with sandel the secretary of the gayety club had advanced him three poundsthe losers end of the purseand beyond that had refused to go now and again he had managed to borrow a few shillings from old pals who would have lent more only that it was a drought year and they were hard put themselves noand there was no use in disguising the facthis training had not been satisfactory he should have had better food and no worries besides when a man is forty it is harder to get into condition than when he is twenty  what time is it lizzie he asked  his wife went across the hall to inquire and came back  quarter before eight  theyll be startin the first bout in a few minutes he said only a tryout then theres a fourround spar tween dealer wells an gridley an a tenround go tween starlight an some sailor bloke i dont come on for over an hour  at the end of another silent ten minutes he rose to his feet  truth is lizzie i aint had proper trainin  he reached for his hat and started for the door he did not offer to kiss herhe never did on going outbut on this night she dared to kiss him throwing her arms around him and compelling him to bend down to her face she looked quite small against the massive bulk of the man  good luck tom she said you gotter do im  ay i gotter do im he repeated thats all there is to it i jus gotter do im  he laughed with an attempt at heartiness while she pressed more closely against him across her shoulders he looked around the bare room it was all he had in the world with the rent overdue and her and the kiddies and he was leaving it to go out into the night to get meat for his mate and cubsnot like a modern workingman going to his machine grind but in the old primitive royal animal way by fighting for it  i gotter do im he repeated this time a hint of desperation in his voice if its a win its thirty quidan i can pay all thats owin with a lump o money left over if its a lose i get naughtnot even a penny for me to ride home on the tram the secretarys give all thats comin from a losers end goodbye old woman ill come straight home if its a win  an ill be waitin up she called to him along the hall  it was full two miles to the gayety and as he walked along he remembered how in his palmy dayshe had once been the heavyweight champion of new south waleshe would have ridden in a cab to the fight and how most likely some heavy backer would have paid for the cab and ridden with him there were tommy burns and that yankee nigger jack johnsonthey rode about in motorcars and he walked and as any man knew a hard two miles was not the best preliminary to a fight he was an old un and the world did not wag well with old uns he was good for nothing now except navvy work and his broken nose and swollen ear were against him even in that he found himself wishing that he had learned a trade it would have been better in the long run but no one had told him and he knew deep down in his heart that he would not have listened if they had it had been so easy big moneysharp glorious fightsperiods of rest and loafing in betweena following of eager flatterers the slaps on the back the shakes of the hand the toffs glad to buy him a drink for the privilege of five minutes talkand the glory of it the yelling houses the whirlwind finish the referees king wins and his name in the sporting columns next day  those had been times but he realized now in his slow ruminating way that it was the old uns he had been putting away he was youth rising and they were age sinking no wonder it had been easythey with their swollen veins and battered knuckles and weary in the bones of them from the long battles they had already fought he remembered the time he put out old stowsher bill at rushcutters bay in the eighteenth round and how old bill had cried afterward in the dressingroom like a baby perhaps old bills rent had been overdue perhaps hed had at home a missus an a couple of kiddies and perhaps bill that very day of the fight had had a hungering for a piece of steak bill had fought game and taken incredible punishment he could see now after he had gone through the mill himself that stowsher bill had fought for a bigger stake that night twenty years ago than had young tom king who had fought for glory and easy money no wonder stowsher bill had cried afterward in the dressingroom  well a man had only so many fights in him to begin with it was the iron law of the game one man might have a hundred hard fights in him another man only twenty each according to the make of him and the quality of his fibre had a definite number and when he had fought them he was done yes he had had more fights in him than most of them and he had had far more than his share of the hard gruelling fightsthe kind that worked the heart and lungs to bursting that took the elastic out of the arteries and made hard knots of muscle out of youths sleek suppleness that wore out nerve and stamina and made brain and bones weary from excess of effort and endurance overwrought yes he had done better than all of them there were none of his old fighting partners left he was the last of the old guard he had seen them all finished and he had had a hand in finishing some of them  they had tried him out against the old uns and one after another he had put them awaylaughing when like old stowsher bill they cried in the dressingroom and now he was an old un and they tried out the youngsters on him there was that bloke sandel he had come over from new zealand with a record behind him but nobody in australia knew anything about him so they put him up against old tom king if sandel made a showing he would be given better men to fight with bigger purses to win so it was to be depended upon that he would put up a fierce battle he had everything to win by itmoney and glory and career and tom king was the grizzled old choppingblock that guarded the highway to fame and fortune and he had nothing to win except thirty quid to pay to the landlord and the tradesmen and as tom king thus ruminated there came to his stolid vision the form of youth glorious youth rising exultant and invincible supple of muscle and silken of skin with heart and lungs that had never been tired and torn and that laughed at limitation of effort yes youth was the nemesis it destroyed the old uns and recked not that in so doing it destroyed itself it enlarged its arteries and smashed its knuckles and was in turn destroyed by youth for youth was ever youthful it was only age that grew old  at castlereagh street he turned to the left and three blocks along came to the gayety a crowd of young larrikins hanging outside the door made respectful way for him and he heard one say to another thats im thats tom king  inside on the way to his dressingroom he encountered the secretary a keeneyed shrewdfaced young man who shook his hand  how are you feelin tom he asked  fit as a fiddle king answered though he knew that he lied and that if he had a quid he would give it right there for a good piece of steak  when he emerged from the dressingroom his seconds behind him and came down the aisle to the squared ring in the centre of the hall a burst of greeting and applause went up from the waiting crowd he acknowledged salutations right and left though few of the faces did he know most of them were the faces of kiddies unborn when he was winning his first laurels in the squared ring he leaped lightly to the raised platform and ducked through the ropes to his corner where he sat down on a folding stool jack ball the referee came over and shook his hand ball was a brokendown pugilist who for over ten years had not entered the ring as a principal king was glad that he had him for referee they were both old uns if he should rough it with sandel a bit beyond the rules he knew ball could be depended upon to pass it by  aspiring young heavyweights one after another were climbing into the ring and being presented to the audience by the referee also he issued their challenges for them  young pronto bill announced from north sydney challenges the winner for fifty pounds side bet  the audience applauded and applauded again as sandel himself sprang through the ropes and sat down in his corner tom king looked across the ring at him curiously for in a few minutes they would be locked together in merciless combat each trying with all the force of him to knock the other into unconsciousness but little could he see for sandel like himself had trousers and sweater on over his ring costume his face was strongly handsome crowned with a curly mop of yellow hair while his thick muscular neck hinted at bodily magnificence  young pronto went to one corner and then the other shaking hands with the principals and dropping down out of the ring the challenges went on ever youth climbed through the ropesyouth unknown but insatiablecrying out to mankind that with strength and skill it would match issues with the winner a few years before in his own heyday of invincibleness tom king would have been amused and bored by these preliminaries but now he sat fascinated unable to shake the vision of youth from his eyes always were these youngsters rising up in the boxing game springing through the ropes and shouting their defiance and always were the old uns going down before them they climbed to success over the bodies of the old uns and ever they came more and more youngstersyouth unquenchable and irresistibleand ever they put the old uns away themselves becoming old uns and travelling the same downward path while behind them ever pressing on them was youth eternalthe new babies grown lusty and dragging their elders down with behind them more babies to the end of timeyouth that must have its will and that will never die  king glanced over to the press box and nodded to morgan of the sportsman and corbett of the referee then he held out his hands while sid sullivan and charley bates his seconds slipped on his gloves and laced them tight closely watched by one of sandels seconds who first examined critically the tapes on kings knuckles a second of his own was in sandels corner performing a like office sandels trousers were pulled off and as he stood up his sweater was skinned off over his head and tom king looking saw youth incarnate deepchested heavythewed with muscles that slipped and slid like live things under the white satin skin the whole body was acrawl with life and tom king knew that it was a life that had never oozed its freshness out through the aching pores during the long fights wherein youth paid its toll and departed not quite so young as when it entered  the two men advanced to meet each other and as the gong sounded and the seconds clattered out of the ring with the folding stools they shook hands and instantly took their fighting attitudes and instantly like a mechanism of steel and springs balanced on a hair trigger sandel was in and out and in again landing a left to the eyes a right to the ribs ducking a counter dancing lightly away and dancing menacingly back again he was swift and clever it was a dazzling exhibition the house yelled its approbation but king was not dazzled he had fought too many fights and too many youngsters he knew the blows for what they weretoo quick and too deft to be dangerous evidently sandel was going to rush things from the start it was to be expected it was the way of youth expending its splendour and excellence in wild insurgence and furious onslaught overwhelming opposition with its own unlimited glory of strength and desire  sandel was in and out here there and everywhere lightfooted and eagerhearted a living wonder of white flesh and stinging muscle that wove itself into a dazzling fabric of attack slipping and leaping like a flying shuttle from action to action through a thousand actions all of them centred upon the destruction of tom king who stood between him and fortune and tom king patiently endured he knew his business and he knew youth now that youth was no longer his there was nothing to do till the other lost some of his steam was his thought and he grinned to himself as he deliberately ducked so as to receive a heavy blow on the top of his head it was a wicked thing to do yet eminently fair according to the rules of the boxing game a man was supposed to take care of his own knuckles and if he insisted on hitting an opponent on the top of the head he did so at his own peril king could have ducked lower and let the blow whiz harmlessly past but he remembered his own early fights and how he smashed his first knuckle on the head of the welsh terror he was but playing the game that duck had accounted for one of sandels knuckles not that sandel would mind it now he would go on superbly regardless hitting as hard as ever throughout the fight but later on when the long ring battles had begun to tell he would regret that knuckle and look back and remember how he smashed it on tom kings head  the first round was all sandels and he had the house yelling with the rapidity of his whirlwind rushes he overwhelmed king with avalanches of punches and king did nothing he never struck once contenting himself with covering up blocking and ducking and clinching to avoid punishment he occasionally feinted shook his head when the weight of a punch landed and moved stolidly about never leaping or springing or wasting an ounce of strength sandel must foam the froth of youth away before discreet age could dare to retaliate all kings movements were slow and methodical and his heavylidded slowmoving eyes gave him the appearance of being half asleep or dazed yet they were eyes that saw everything that had been trained to see everything through all his twenty years and odd in the ring they were eyes that did not blink or waver before an impending blow but that coolly saw and measured distance  seated in his corner for the minutes rest at the end of the round he lay back with outstretched legs his arms resting on the right angle of the ropes his chest and abdomen heaving frankly and deeply as he gulped down the air driven by the towels of his seconds he listened with closed eyes to the voices of the house why dont yeh fight tom many were crying yeh aint afraid of im are yeh  musclebound he heard a man on a front seat comment he cant move quicker two to one on sandel in quids  the gong struck and the two men advanced from their corners sandel came forward fully threequarters of the distance eager to begin again but king was content to advance the shorter distance it was in line with his policy of economy he had not been well trained and he had not had enough to eat and every step counted besides he had already walked two miles to the ringside it was a repetition of the first round with sandel attacking like a whirlwind and with the audience indignantly demanding why king did not fight beyond feinting and several slowly delivered and ineffectual blows he did nothing save block and stall and clinch sandel wanted to make the pace fast while king out of his wisdom refused to accommodate him he grinned with a certain wistful pathos in his ringbattered countenance and went on cherishing his strength with the jealousy of which only age is capable sandel was youth and he threw his strength away with the munificent abandon of youth to king belonged the ring generalship the wisdom bred of long aching fights he watched with cool eyes and head moving slowly and waiting for sandels froth to foam away to the majority of the onlookers it seemed as though king was hopelessly outclassed and they voiced their opinion in offers of three to one on sandel but there were wise ones a few who knew king of old time and who covered what they considered easy money  the third round began as usual onesided with sandel doing all the leading and delivering all the punishment a halfminute had passed when sandel overconfident left an opening kings eyes and right arm flashed in the same instant it was his first real blowa hook with the twisted arch of the arm to make it rigid and with all the weight of the halfpivoted body behind it it was like a sleepyseeming lion suddenly thrusting out a lightning paw sandel caught on the side of the jaw was felled like a bullock the audience gasped and murmured awestricken applause the man was not musclebound after all and he could drive a blow like a triphammer  sandel was shaken he rolled over and attempted to rise but the sharp yells from his seconds to take the count restrained him he knelt on one knee ready to rise and waited while the referee stood over him counting the seconds loudly in his ear at the ninth he rose in fighting attitude and tom king facing him knew regret that the blow had not been an inch nearer the point of the jaw that would have been a knockout and he could have carried the thirty quid home to the missus and the kiddies  the round continued to the end of its three minutes sandel for the first time respectful of his opponent and king slow of movement and sleepyeyed as ever as the round neared its close king warned of the fact by sight of the seconds crouching outside ready for the spring in through the ropes worked the fight around to his own corner and when the gong struck he sat down immediately on the waiting stool while sandel had to walk all the way across the diagonal of the square to his own corner it was a little thing but it was the sum of little things that counted sandel was compelled to walk that many more steps to give up that much energy and to lose a part of the precious minute of rest at the beginning of every round king loafed slowly out from his corner forcing his opponent to advance the greater distance the end of every round found the fight manoeuvred by king into his own corner so that he could immediately sit down  two more rounds went by in which king was parsimonious of effort and sandel prodigal the latters attempt to force a fast pace made king uncomfortable for a fair percentage of the multitudinous blows showered upon him went home yet king persisted in his dogged slowness despite the crying of the young hotheads for him to go in and fight again in the sixth round sandel was careless again tom kings fearful right flashed out to the jaw and again sandel took the nine seconds count  by the seventh round sandels pink of condition was gone and he settled down to what he knew was to be the hardest fight in his experience tom king was an old un but a better old un than he had ever encounteredan old un who never lost his head who was remarkably able at defence whose blows had the impact of a knotted club and who had a knockout in either hand nevertheless tom king dared not hit often he never forgot his battered knuckles and knew that every hit must count if the knuckles were to last out the fight as he sat in his corner glancing across at his opponent the thought came to him that the sum of his wisdom and sandels youth would constitute a worlds champion heavyweight but that was the trouble sandel would never become a world champion he lacked the wisdom and the only way for him to get it was to buy it with youth and when wisdom was his youth would have been spent in buying it  king took every advantage he knew he never missed an opportunity to clinch and in effecting most of the clinches his shoulder drove stiffly into the others ribs in the philosophy of the ring a shoulder was as good as a punch so far as damage was concerned and a great deal better so far as concerned expenditure of effort also in the clinches king rested his weight on his opponent and was loath to let go this compelled the interference of the referee who tore them apart always assisted by sandel who had not yet learned to rest he could not refrain from using those glorious flying arms and writhing muscles of his and when the other rushed into a clinch striking shoulder against ribs and with head resting under sandels left arm sandel almost invariably swung his right behind his own back and into the projecting face it was a clever stroke much admired by the audience but it was not dangerous and was therefore just that much wasted strength but sandel was tireless and unaware of limitations and king grinned and doggedly endured  sandel developed a fierce right to the body which made it appear that king was taking an enormous amount of punishment and it was only the old ringsters who appreciated the deft touch of kings left glove to the others biceps just before the impact of the blow it was true the blow landed each time but each time it was robbed of its power by that touch on the biceps in the ninth round three times inside a minute kings right hooked its twisted arch to the jaw and three times sandels body heavy as it was was levelled to the mat each time he took the nine seconds allowed him and rose to his feet shaken and jarred but still strong he had lost much of his speed and he wasted less effort he was fighting grimly but he continued to draw upon his chief asset which was youth kings chief asset was experience as his vitality had dimmed and his vigour abated he had replaced them with cunning with wisdom born of the long fights and with a careful shepherding of strength not alone had he learned never to make a superfluous movement but he had learned how to seduce an opponent into throwing his strength away again and again by feint of foot and hand and body he continued to inveigle sandel into leaping back ducking or countering king rested but he never permitted sandel to rest it was the strategy of age  early in the tenth round king began stopping the others rushes with straight lefts to the face and sandel grown wary responded by drawing the left then by ducking it and delivering his right in a swinging hook to the side of the head it was too high up to be vitally effective but when first it landed king knew the old familiar descent of the black veil of unconsciousness across his mind for the instant or for the slighest fraction of an instant rather he ceased in the one moment he saw his opponent ducking out of his field of vision and the background of white watching faces in the next moment he again saw his opponent and the background of faces it was as if he had slept for a time and just opened his eyes again and yet the interval of unconsciousness was so microscopically short that there had been no time for him to fall the audience saw him totter and his knees give and then saw him recover and tuck his chin deeper into the shelter of his left shoulder  several times sandel repeated the blow keeping king partially dazed and then the latter worked out his defence which was also a counter feinting with his left he took a halfstep backward at the same time upper cutting with the whole strength of his right so accurately was it timed that it landed squarely on sandels face in the full downward sweep of the duck and sandel lifted in the air and curled backward striking the mat on his head and shoulders twice king achieved this then turned loose and hammered his opponent to the ropes he gave sandel no chance to rest or to set himself but smashed blow in upon blow till the house rose to its feet and the air was filled with an unbroken roar of applause but sandels strength and endurance were superb and he continued to stay on his feet a knockout seemed certain and a captain of police appalled at the dreadful punishment arose by the ringside to stop the fight the gong struck for the end of the round and sandel staggered to his corner protesting to the captain that he was sound and strong to prove it he threw two backairsprings and the police captain gave in  tom king leaning back in his corner and breathing hard was disappointed if the fight had been stopped the referee perforce would have rendered him the decision and the purse would have been his unlike sandel he was not fighting for glory or career but for thirty quid and now sandel would recuperate in the minute of rest  youth will be servedthis saying flashed into kings mind and he remembered the first time he had heard it the night when he had put away stowsher bill the toff who had bought him a drink after the fight and patted him on the shoulder had used those words youth will be served the toff was right and on that night in the long ago he had been youth tonight youth sat in the opposite corner as for himself he had been fighting for half an hour now and he was an old man had he fought like sandel he would not have lasted fifteen minutes but the point was that he did not recuperate those upstanding arteries and that sorely tried heart would not enable him to gather strength in the intervals between the rounds and he had not had sufficient strength in him to begin with his legs were heavy under him and beginning to cramp he should not have walked those two miles to the fight and there was the steak which he had got up longing for that morning a great and terrible hatred rose up in him for the butchers who had refused him credit it was hard for an old man to go into a fight without enough to eat and a piece of steak was such a little thing a few pennies at best yet it meant thirty quid to him  with the gong that opened the eleventh round sandel rushed making a show of freshness which he did not really possess king knew it for what it wasa bluff as old as the game itself he clinched to save himself then going free allowed sandel to get set this was what king desired he feinted with his left drew the answering duck and swinging upward hook then made the halfstep backward delivered the upper cut full to the face and crumpled sandel over to the mat after that he never let him rest receiving punishment himself but inflicting far more smashing sandel to the ropes hooking and driving all manner of blows into him tearing away from his clinches or punching him out of attempted clinches and ever when sandel would have fallen catching him with one uplifting hand and with the other immediately smashing him into the ropes where he could not fall  the house by this time had gone mad and it was his house nearly every voice yelling go it tom get im get im youve got im tom youve got im it was to be a whirlwind finish and that was what a ringside audience paid to see  and tom king who for half an hour had conserved his strength now expended it prodigally in the one great effort he knew he had in him it was his one chancenow or not at all his strength was waning fast and his hope was that before the last of it ebbed out of him he would have beaten his opponent down for the count and as he continued to strike and force coolly estimating the weight of his blows and the quality of the damage wrought he realized how hard a man sandel was to knock out stamina and endurance were his to an extreme degree and they were the virgin stamina and endurance of youth sandel was certainly a coming man he had it in him only out of such rugged fibre were successful fighters fashioned  sandel was reeling and staggering but tom kings legs were cramping and his knuckles going back on him yet he steeled himself to strike the fierce blows every one of which brought anguish to his tortured hands though now he was receiving practically no punishment he was weakening as rapidly as the other his blows went home but there was no longer the weight behind them and each blow was the result of a severe effort of will his legs were like lead and they dragged visibly under him while sandels backers cheered by this symptom began calling encouragement to their man  king was spurred to a burst of effort he delivered two blows in successiona left a trifle too high to the solar plexus and a right cross to the jaw they were not heavy blows yet so weak and dazed was sandel that he went down and lay quivering the referee stood over him shouting the count of the fatal seconds in his ear if before the tenth second was called he did not rise the fight was lost the house stood in hushed silence king rested on trembling legs a mortal dizziness was upon him and before his eyes the sea of faces sagged and swayed while to his ears as from a remote distance came the count of the referee yet he looked upon the fight as his it was impossible that a man so punished could rise  only youth could rise and sandel rose at the fourth second he rolled over on his face and groped blindly for the ropes by the seventh second he had dragged himself to his knee where he rested his head rolling groggily on his shoulders as the referee cried nine sandel stood upright in proper stalling position his left arm wrapped about his face his right wrapped about his stomach thus were his vital points guarded while he lurched forward toward king in the hope of effecting a clinch and gaining more time  at the instant sandel arose king was at him but the two blows he delivered were muffled on the stalled arms the next moment sandel was in the clinch and holding on desperately while the referee strove to drag the two men apart king helped to force himself free he knew the rapidity with which youth recovered and he knew that sandel was his if he could prevent that recovery one stiff punch would do it sandel was his indubitably his he had outgeneralled him outfought him outpointed him sandel reeled out of the clinch balanced on the hair line between defeat or survival one good blow would topple him over and down and out and tom king in a flash of bitterness remembered the piece of steak and wished that he had it then behind that necessary punch he must deliver he nerved himself for the blow but it was not heavy enough nor swift enough sandel swayed but did not fall staggering back to the ropes and holding on king staggered after him and with a pang like that of dissolution delivered another blow but his body had deserted him all that was left of him was a fighting intelligence that was dimmed and clouded from exhaustion the blow that was aimed for the jaw struck no higher than the shoulder he had willed the blow higher but the tired muscles had not been able to obey and from the impact of the blow tom king himself reeled back and nearly fell once again he strove this time his punch missed altogether and from absolute weakness he fell against sandel and clinched holding on to him to save himself from sinking to the floor  king did not attempt to free himself he had shot his bolt he was gone and youth had been served even in the clinch he could feel sandel growing stronger against him when the referee thrust them apart there before his eyes he saw youth recuperate from instant to instant sandel grew stronger his punches weak and futile at first became stiff and accurate tom kings bleared eyes saw the gloved fist driving at his jaw and he willed to guard it by interposing his arm he saw the danger willed the act but the arm was too heavy it seemed burdened with a hundredweight of lead it would not lift itself and he strove to lift it with his soul then the gloved fist landed home he experienced a sharp snap that was like an electric spark and simultaneously the veil of blackness enveloped him  when he opened his eyes again he was in his corner and he heard the yelling of the audience like the roar of the surf at bondi beach a wet sponge was being pressed against the base of his brain and sid sullivan was blowing cold water in a refreshing spray over his face and chest his gloves had already been removed and sandel bending over him was shaking his hand he bore no illwill toward the man who had put him out and he returned the grip with a heartiness that made his battered knuckles protest then sandel stepped to the centre of the ring and the audience hushed its pandemonium to hear him accept young prontos challenge and offer to increase the side bet to one hundred pounds king looked on apathetically while his seconds mopped the streaming water from him dried his face and prepared him to leave the ring he felt hungry it was not the ordinary gnawing kind but a great faintness a palpitation at the pit of the stomach that communicated itself to all his body he remembered back into the fight to the moment when he had sandel swaying and tottering on the hairline balance of defeat ah that piece of steak would have done it he had lacked just that for the decisive blow and he had lost it was all because of the piece of steak  his seconds were halfsupporting him as they helped him through the ropes he tore free from them ducked through the ropes unaided and leaped heavily to the floor following on their heels as they forced a passage for him down the crowded centre aisle leaving the dressingroom for the street in the entrance to the hall some young fellow spoke to him  wy didnt yuh go in an get im when yuh ad im the young fellow asked  aw go to hell said tom king and passed down the steps to the sidewalk  the doors of the publichouse at the corner were swinging wide and he saw the lights and the smiling barmaids heard the many voices discussing the fight and the prosperous chink of money on the bar somebody called to him to have a drink he hesitated perceptibly then refused and went on his way  he had not a copper in his pocket and the twomile walk home seemed very long he was certainly getting old crossing the domain he sat down suddenly on a bench unnerved by the thought of the missus sitting up for him waiting to learn the outcome of the fight that was harder than any knockout and it seemed almost impossible to face  he felt weak and sore and the pain of his smashed knuckles warned him that even if he could find a job at navvy work it would be a week before he could grip a pick handle or a shovel the hunger palpitation at the pit of the stomach was sickening his wretchedness overwhelmed him and into his eyes came an unwonted moisture he covered his face with his hands and as he cried he remembered stowsher bill and how he had served him that night in the long ago poor old stowsher bill he could understand now why bill had cried in the dressingroom
