chapter xxv     chapter xxvi                                    ————     illustrations       i thought i heard a man’s voice     the office boy caught the junior partner     best and prettiest girl in salthaven     it was a comfortable position     immersed in a bundle of papers     a fine show of indignation     were regulating their pace by hers     nothing loath gave a tug     presented him with the bananas     proceeded with almost equal care to assist her mother     mrs willett and mrs chinnery confronted each other     she placed it between his lips with a little jab     to bassett the best of boys     i’m choking     no wonder i thought you was a lady     i came to ask your advice     holding a handkerchief to his bleeding face     i’ve got a bone to pick with you     she said ’nonsense’ he replied softly     he leaned back in his chair     i heard you come in he said in a stealthy whisper     think i’m the most forgetful man in salthaven     i’ve got to go too said the captain     she seated herself on a pile of timber     i don’t like leaving him here     corner of the bank of england     mind i haven’t promised     cut short in his expressions of pleasure     cck he said waggishly     she drew the ring from her finger     it’s to make you leave off loving me     time cried captain sellers     don’t you think captain trimblett is lucky     snatching his hat from its peg     you look very nice dear     you can have a little drop yourself     marvellous piece of jugglery     don’t go he said hastily     wedged under a dressingtable     brought the curtains down with him     waved herself off the fence on to the stones     his cigar fell unheeded to the floor     an enormous fist held just beneath his nose     chapter i     mr john vyner shipowner pushed his chair back from his writingtable and gazed with kindly condescension at the chief clerk as he stood before it with a handful of papers  we shall be able to relieve you of some of your work soon hartley he said slowly mr robert will come into the firm next week the chief clerk bowed  three years at cambridge resumed mr vyner meditatively and two years spent up and down the world studying the business methods of other nations ought to render him invaluable to us  no doubt sir said hartley it is an excellent training  for a time said the shipowner leaning back and placing the tips of his fingers together for a time i am afraid that he will have to have your room later on—ha—if a room should—ha—fall vacant in the building we might consider taking it  yes sir said the other  and of course resumed mr vyner there is one great advantage in your being in the general office which must not be overlooked you can keep an eye on the juniors better  it is cheerful too sir suggested the chief clerk the only thing—  yes said mr vyner somewhat loudly  mr hartley shrank a little i was going to say that it is rather a small room for mr robert he said quickly  it will do for a time said the other  and—and i think i told you sir that there is an unpleasant sm—odour  mr vyner knitted his brows i offered to have that seen to but you said that you didn’t mind it he remarked  just so sir said hartley but i was thinking of mr robert he might not like it it’s very strong at times—very strong indeed  you ought to have had it attended to before said mr vyner with some severity you had better call at gillows’ on your way home and ask them to send a man up first thing tomorrow morning  he drew his chair to the table again and hartley after lingering a moment withdrew to his own room  ten out of his thirtyfive years of service had been passed there and he stifled a sigh as he looked at the neat array of drawers and pigeonholes the window overlooking the bridge and harbour and the stationer’s almanac which hung over the fireplace the japanned letterrack and the gumbottle on the small mantelpiece were old friends  the day’s work completed he walked home in sober thought it was a pleasant afternoon in may but he was too preoccupied to pay any heed to the weather and after informing a man who stopped him to tell him that he had lost a wife six children and a right leg that it was just five minutes past six resumed his way with a hazy idea of having been useful to a fellowcreature  he brightened a little as he left the bustle of the town behind and from sheer force of habit glanced at the trim frontgardens as he passed the cloud lifted still more as he reached his own garden and mentally compared his flowers with those he had just passed  his daughter was out and tea for one was laid in the front room he drew his chair to the table and taking up the teapot which the maid had just brought in poured himself out a cup of tea  he looked round the comfortable room with pleasure after all nobody could take that from him he stirred his tea and had just raised the cup to his lips when he set it down untasted and sat staring blankly before him a low rumble of voices from the kitchen fell unpleasantly on his ear and his daughter joan had left instructions too specific to be misunderstood as to his behaviour in the event of rosa entertaining male company during her absence he coughed twice loudly and was glad to note the disappearance of the rumble pleased with his success he coughed a third time a sonorous cough charged with importance a whispered rumble possibly a suggestion of withdrawal came from the kitchen  only his tea gone the wrong way he heard reassuringly from rosa  the rumble thus encouraged deepened again it became confident and was heard to laugh mr hartley rose and standing on the hearthrug with legs apart resolved to play the man he leaned over and rang the bell the voices stopped then he heard rosa say not him you stay where you are  she came slowly in response to the bell and thrusting a yellow head in at the door gazed at him inquiringly  i—i want a little more hot water said her master mildly  more repeated rosa why i brought you over a pint  i want some more said mr hartley then a bright thought struck him i am expecting miss joan home every minute he added significantly  rosa tossed her head she ain’t coming home till nine she remarked so if it’s only for her you want the hot water you won’t want it  i—i thought i heard a man’s voice he said at last  very good said her master with an attempt at dignity you can go  rosa went whistling mr hartley feeling that he had done all that could be expected of a man sat down and resumed his tea the rumbling from the kitchen as though in an endeavour to make up for lost time became continuous it also became louder and more hilarious pale and determined mr hartley rose a second time and seizing the bellpull rang violently  does anybody want to see me he inquired as rosa’s head appeared  you no was the reply  i thought said her master gazing steadily at the window i thought somebody was inquiring for me  well there hasn’t been said rosa  mr hartley with a magisterial knitting of the brows which had occasionally been found effective with junior clerks affected to ponder  i—i thought i heard a man’s voice he said at last  nobody’s been inquiring for you said rosa calmly if they did i should come in and let you know nobody’s been for you that i’ve heard of and i don’t see how they could come without me knowing it  just so said mr hartley just so  he turned to the mantelpiece for his tobaccojar and rosa after standing for some time at the ready with a hostile stare cleared her throat noisily and withdrew the voices in the kitchen broke out with renewed vehemence mr hartley coughed again—a cough lacking in spirit—and going out at the front door passed through the sideentrance to the garden and tended his plants with his back to the kitchen window  hard at work at the healthful pastime of weeding his troubles slipped from him the path became littered with little tufts of grass and he was just considering the possibility of outflanking the birchbroom which had taken up an advantageous position by the kitchen window when a young man came down the sideentrance and greeted him with respectful enthusiasm  i brought you these he said opening a brown leather bag and extracting a few dried roots i saw an advertisement i forget the name of them but they have beautiful trumpetshaped flowers they are free growers and grow yards and yards the first year  and miles and miles the second said mr hartley regarding them with extraordinary ferocity bindweed is the name and once get it in your garden and you’ll never get rid of it  that wasn’t the name in the advertisement said the other dubiously  i don’t suppose it was said hartley you’ve got a lot to learn in gardening yet saunders  yes sir said the other i’ve got a good teacher though  mr hartley almost blushed and how is your garden getting on he inquired  it’s—it’s getting on said mr saunders vaguely  i must come and have a look at it said hartley  not yet said the young man hastily not yet i shouldn’t like you to see it just yet is miss hartley well  mr hartley said she was and in an abstracted fashion led the way down the garden to where an enormous patch of land—or so it seemed to mr saunders—awaited digging the latter removed his coat and hanging it with great care on an apple tree turned back his cuffs and seized the fork  it’s grand exercise said mr hartley after watching him for some time  grand said mr saunders briefly  as a young man i couldn’t dig enough continued the other but nowadays it gives me a crick in the back  always inquired mr saunders with a slight huskiness  always said mr hartley but i never do it now joan won’t let me  mr saunders sighed at the name and resumed his digging miss hartley out he asked presently in a casual voice  yes she won’t be home till late said the other we can have a fine evening’s work free of interruptions i’ll go and get on with my weeding  he moved off and resumed his task mr saunders with a suppressed groan went on with his digging the ground got harder and harder and his back seemed almost at breakingpoint at intervals he had what gardeners term a straightup and with his face turned toward the house listened intently for any sounds that might indicate the return of its mistress  halfpast eight said hartley at last time to knock off i’ve put a few small plants in your bag for you better put them in in the morning before you start off  mr saunders thanked him and reaching down his coat put it on and followed mr hartley to the house the latter steering him round by the sideentrance accompanied him to the front gate  if you would like to borrow my roller or lawnmower at any time he said cordially i should be very pleased to lend them to you it isn’t very far  mr saunders who would sooner have died than have been seen dragging a roller through the streets thanked him warmly with an idea of prolonging his stay he suggested looking at them  they’re locked up now said mr hartley see them another time goodnight  goodnight said mr saunders i’ll look in tomorrow evening if i may  no use tomorrow mr hartley called after him there will be nobody at home but joan     chapter ii     mr robert vyner entered upon his new duties with enthusiasm the second day he was at the office half an hour before anybody else on the third day the staff competed among themselves for the honour of arriving first and greeted him as respectfully as their feelings would permit when he strolled in at a quarter to eleven the arrival of the senior partner on the day following at a phenomenally early hour for the sake of setting an example to the junior filled them with despair their spirits did not revive until mr john had given up the task as inconvenient and useless  a slight fillip was given to robert’s waning enthusiasm by the arrival of new furniture for his room a large mahogany writingtable full of drawers and pigeonholes gave him a pleasant sense of importance and the revolving chair which went with it afforded a welcome relief to a young and ardent nature twice the officeboy had caught the junior partner with his legs tucked up to avoid collisions whirling wildly around and had waited respectfully at the door for the conclusion of the performance  it goes a bit stiff bassett said the junior partner  yessir said bassett  i’m trying to ease it a bit explained mr robert  yessir said bassett again  mr robert regarded him closely an undersized boy in spectacles with a large head and an air of gravity and old age on his young features which the junior thought somewhat illplaced for such an occasion  i suppose you never twizzle round on your chair bassett he said slowly  bassett shivered at the idea no sir he said solemnly i’ve got my work to do  mr robert sought for other explanations and of course you have a stool he remarked you couldn’t swing round on that  not even if i wanted to sir said the unbending bassett  mr robert nodded and taking some papers from his table held them before his face and surveyed the youth over the top bassett stood patiently to attention  that’s all right said the other thank you  thank you sir said bassett turning to the door  by the way said mr robert eying him curiously as he turned the handle what exercise do you take  exercise sir said bassett  mr robert nodded what do you do of an evening for amusement after the arduous toils of the day are past marbles  no sir said the outraged one if i have any time to spare i amuse myself with a little shorthand  amuse exclaimed the other he threw himself back in his chair and sternly checking its inclination to twirl again sought for a flaw in the armour of this paragon and what else do you do in the way of recreation  i’ve got a vivarium sir  mr robert hesitated but curiosity got the better of his dignity what’s that he inquired  a thing i keep frogs and toads in sir was the reply  mr robert staring hard at him did his honest best to check the next question but it came despite himself are you—are you married bassett he inquired  bassett regarded him calmly no sir he said with perfect gravity i live at home with my mother  the junior partner gave him a nod of dismissal and for some time sat gazing round the somewhat severely furnished office wondering with some uneasiness what effect such surroundings might have on a noble but impressionable temperament he brought round a few sketches the next day to brighten the walls and replated the gumbottle and other useful ornaments by some german beermugs  even with these aids to industry he found the confinement of office somewhat irksome and taking a broad view of his duties gradually relieved bassett of his errands to the docks it was necessary he told himself to get a thorough grasp of the whole business of shipowning in the stokeholds of vyner and son’s’ steamships he talked learnedly on coal with the firemen and quite unaided hit on several schemes for the saving of coal—all admirable except for the fact that several knots per hour would be lost  the thing is to take an allround view he said to captain trimblett of the ss indian chief as he strolled back with that elderly mariner from the ship to the office one day  that’s it sir said the captain  don’t waste and at the same time don’t pinch continued mr robert oracularly  that’s business in a nutshell commented the captain don’t spoil the ship for a ha’porth of tar and on the other hand don’t get leaving the tar about for other people to sit on  but you got it off said robert flushing you told me you had  as far as tar ever can be got off asserted the captain gloomily yes why i put my best trousers on this morning he continued in a tone of vague wonder i’m sure i don’t know it was meant to be i suppose it’s all for some wise purpose that we don’t know of  wise fiddlesticks exclaimed robert shortly—your particular brand of fatalism is the most extraordinary nonsense i ever heard of what it means is that thousands of years ago or millions perhaps was decided that i should be born on purpose to tar your blessed trousers  that and other things said the immovable captain it’s all laid down for us everything we do and we can’t help doing it when i put on those trousers this morning—  oh hang your trousers said robert you said it didn’t matter and you’ve been talking about nothing else ever since  i won’t say another word about it said the captain i remember the last pair i had done a pair o’ white ducks my steward it was one o’ those silly fatheaded staringeyed garping—  go on said the other grimly  nice bright young fellows concluded the captain hastily he got on very well i believe  after he left you i suppose said mr vyner smoothly  yes said the innocent captain he caught a glance of the other’s face and ruminated after i had broken him of his silly habits he added  he walked along smiling and raising his cap with a flourish beamed in a fatherly manner on a girl who was just passing robert replaced his hat and glanced over his left shoulder  who is that he inquired i saw her the other day her face seems familiar to me  joan hartley replied the captain nathaniel hartley’s daughter to my mind the best and prettiest girl in salthaven  eh said the other staring hartley’s daughter why i should have thought—  the best and prettiest girl in salthaven  yes sir said captain trimblett after a pause  nothing concluded robert lamely she doesn’t look like it that’s all  she’s got his nose maintained the captain with the obstinate air of a man prepared to go to the stake for his opinions like as two peas their noses are you’d know them for father and daughter anywhere by that alone  mr vyner assented absently he was wondering where the daughter of the chief clerk got her high looks from  very clever girl continued the captain she got a scholarship and went to college and then when her poor mother died hartley was so lonely that she gave it all up and came home to keep house for him  quite a bluestocking suggested robert  there’s nothing of the bluestocking about her said the captain warmly in fact i shouldn’t be surprised if she became engaged soon  mr vyner became interested oh he said with an instinctive glance over his left shoulder  captain trimblett nodded sagely young fellow of the name of saunders he said slowly  oh said the other again  you might have seen him at wilson’s the shipbroker’s pursued the captain bert saunders his name is rather a dressy youngster perhaps generally wears a pink shirt and a very high standup collar—one o’ those collars that you have to get used to  mr vyner nodded  he’s not good enough for her said the captain shaking his head but then nobody is looked at that way it’s all right  you seem to take a great interest in it said robert  he came to me with his troubles said captain trimblett bunching up his gray beard in his hand reflectively leastways he made a remark or two which i took up acting under my advice he is taking up gardening  mr vyner glanced at him in mystification  hartley is a great gardener explained the other with a satisfied smile what is the result he can go there when he likes so to speak no awkwardness or anything of that sort he can turn up there bold as brass to borrow a trowel and take three or four hours doing it  you’re a danger to society said robert shaking his head  people ought to marry while they’re young said the captain if they don’t like as not they’re crazy to marry in their old age there’s my landlord here at tranquil vale fiftytwo next birthday and over his ears in love he has got it about as bad as a man can have it  and the lady inquired robert  she’s all right said the captain he lowered his voice confidentially it’s peter’s sister that’s the trouble he’s afraid to let her know all we can do is to drop a little hint here and a little hint there so as to prepare her for the news when it’s broken to her  is she married inquired robert pausing as they reached the office  no said captain trimblett widow  mr vyner gave a low whistle when do you sail cap’n he inquired in a voice oily with solicitude  soon as my engineroom repairs are finished i suppose said the other staring  and you—you are giving her hints about courtship and marriage inquired mr vyner in tones of carefullymodulated surprise  she’s a sensible woman said the captain reddening and she’s no more likely to marry again than i am  just what i was thinking said mr vyner  he shook his head and apparently deep in thought turned and walked slowly up the stairs he was pleased to notice as he reached the first landing that the captain was still standing where he had left him staring up the stairs     chapter iii     in a somewhat ruffled state of mind captain trimblett pursued his way toward tranquil vale a row of neat cottages situated about a mile and a half from the town and inhabited principally by retired mariners the gardens which ran down to the river boasted a particularly fine strain of flagstaffs battered figureheads in swanlike attitudes lent a pleasing touch of colour and old boats sawn in halves made convenient arbours in which to sit and watch the passing pageant of the sea  at no 5 the captain paused to pass a perfectly dry boot over a scraper of huge dimensions which guarded the entrance and opening the door finished off on the mat mrs susanna chinnery who was setting tea looked up at his entrance and then looked at the clock  kettle’s just on the boil she remarked  your kettle always is said the captain taking a chair—when it’s time for it to be i mean he added hastily as mrs chinnery showed signs of correcting him  it’s as easy to be punctual as otherwise said mrs chinnery easier if people did but know it  so it is murmured the captain and sat gazing with a sudden wooden expression at a picture opposite of the eruption of vesuvius  peter’s late again said mrs chinnery in tones of hopeless resignation  business perhaps suggested captain trimblett still intent on vesuvius  for years and years you could have set the clock by him continued mrs chinnery bustling out to the kitchen and bustling back again with the kettle now i never know when to expect him he was late yesterday  captain trimblett cleared his throat he saw a man nearly run over he reminded her  yes but how long would that take him retorted mrs chinnery if the man had been run over i could have understood it  the captain murmured something about shock  on friday he was thirtythree minutes late continued the other  friday said the faithful captain friday he stopped to listen to a man playing the bagpipes—a scotchman  that was thursday said mrs chinnery  the captain affected to ponder so it was he said heartily what a memory you have got of course friday he walked back to the office for his pipe  well we won’t wait for him said mrs chinnery taking the head of the table and making the tea if he can’t come in to time he must put up with his tea being cold that’s the way we were brought up  a very good way too said the captain he put a radish into his mouth and munching slowly fell to gazing at vesuvius again it was not until he had passed his cup up for the second time that a short redfaced man came quickly into the room and taking a chair from its place against the wall brought it to the table and took a seat opposite the captain  late again peter said his sister  been listening to a man playing the cornet said mr truefitt briefly  captain trimblett taking the largest radish he could find pushed it into his mouth and sat gazing at him in consternation he had used up two musical instruments in less than a week  you’re getting fond of music in your old age said mrs chinnery tartly but you always are late nowadays when it isn’t music it’s something else what’s come over you lately i can’t think  mr truefitt cleared his throat for speech and then thinking better of it helped himself to some bread and butter and went on with his meal his eyes met those of captain trimblett and then wandered away to the window the captain sprang into the breach  he wants a wife to keep him in order he said with a boldness that took mr truefitt’s breath away  wife exclaimed mrs chinnery peter  she put down her cup and laughed—a laugh so free from disquietude that mr truefitt groaned in spirit  he’ll go off one of these days said the captain with affected joviality you see if he don’t  mrs chinnery laughed again he’s a born bachelor she declared why he’d sooner walk a mile out of his way any day than meet a woman he’s been like it ever since he was a boy when i was a girl and brought friends of mine home to tea peter would sit like a stuffed dummy and never say a word  i’ve known older bachelors than him to get married said the captain i’ve known ’em down with it as sudden as heart disease in a way it is heart disease i suppose  peter’s heart’s all right said mrs chinnery  he might drop down any moment declared the captain  mr truefitt painfully conscious of their regards passed his cup up for some more tea and made a noble effort to appear amused as the captain cited instance after instance of confirmed bachelors being led to the altar  i broke the ice for you today he said as they sat after tea in the little summerhouse at the bottom of the garden smoking  mr truefitt’s gaze wandered across the river yes he said slowly yes  i was surprised at myself said the captain  i was surprised at you said mr truefitt with some energy so far as i can see you made it worse  the captain started i did it for the best my lad he said reproachfully she has got to know some day you can’t be made late by cornets and bagpipes every day  mr truefitt rumpled his short gray hair you see i promised her he said suddenly  i know said the captain nodding and now you’ve promised miss willett  when they brought him home dead said mr truefitt blowing out a cloud of smoke she was just twentyfive pretty she was then cap’n as pretty a maid as you’d wish to see as long as i live susanna and have a home you shall share it’ that’s what i said to her  the captain nodded again  and she’s kept house for me for twentyfive years continued mr truefitt and the surprising thing to me is the way the years have gone i didn’t realize it until i found an old photograph of hers the other day taken when she was twenty men don’t change much  the captain looked at him—at the closeclipped gray whiskers the bluish lips and the wrinkles round the eyes no he said stoutly but she could live with you just the same  the other shook his head susanna would never stand another woman in the house he said slowly she would go out and earn her own living that’s her pride and she wouldn’t take anything from me it’s turning her out of house and home  she’d be turning herself out said the captain  of course there is the chance she might marry again said the other slowly she’s had several chances but she refused ’em all  from what she said one day said the captain i got the idea that she has kept from marrying all these years for your sake  mr truefitt put his pipe down on the table and stared blankly before him that’s the worst of it he said forlornly but something will have to be done i’ve been engaged three weeks now and every time i spend a few minutes with cecilia—miss willett—i have to tell a lie about it  you do it very well said his friend very well indeed  and susanna regards me as the most truthful man that ever breathed continued mr truefitt  you’ve got a truthful look about you said the captain if i didn’t know you so well i should have thought the same  unconscious of mr truefitt’s regards he rose and leaning his arm on the fence at the bottom of the garden watched the river  miss willett thinks she might marry again said mr truefitt picking up his pipe and joining him she’d make an excellent wife for anybody—anybody  the captain assented with a nod  nobody could have a better wife said mr truefitt  the captain who was watching an outwardbound barque nodded again absently  she’s affectionate pursued mr truefitt a wonderful housekeeper a good conversationalist a good cook always punctual always at home always—  the captain surprised at a fluency so unusual turned and eyed him in surprise mr truefitt broke off abruptly and somewhat red in the face expressed his fear that the barque would take the mud if she were not careful captain trimblett agreed and to his friend’s relief turned his back on him to watch her more closely it was a comfortable position with his arms on the fence and he retained it until mr truefitt had returned to the summerhouse     chapter iv     mr robert vyner had been busy all the afternoon and the clock still indicated fifteen minutes short of the time at which he had intended to leave he leaned back in his chair and yielding to the slight rotatory movement of that active piece of furniture indulged in the first twirl for three days bassett or no bassett it was exhilarating and having gone to the limit in one direction he obtained impetus by a clutch at the table and whirled back again a smothered exclamation from the door arrested his attention and putting on the break with some suddenness he found himself looking into the pretty astonished eyes of joan hartley  i beg your pardon she said in confusion i thought it was my father  it—it got stuck said mr vyner springing up and regarding the chair with great disfavour i was trying to loosen it i shall have to send it back i’m afraid it’s badly made there’s no cabinetmaking nowadays  miss hartley retreated to the doorway  i am sorry i expected to find my father here she said it used to be his room  yes it was his room said the young man if you will come in and sit down i will send for him  it doesn’t matter thank you said joan still standing by the door if you will tell me where his room is now i will go to him  he—he is in the general office said robert vyner slowly  miss hartley bit her lip and her eyes grew sombre  don’t go said mr vyner eagerly i’ll go and fetch him he is expecting you  expecting me said the girl why he didn’t know i was coming  perhaps i misunderstood him murmured mr vyner pressure of business he said vaguely indicating a pile of papers on his table hardly know what people do say to me  he pushed a comfortable easychair to the window and the girl after a moment’s hesitation seated herself and became interested in the life outside robert vyner resuming his seat leaned back and gazed at her in frank admiration  nice view down the harbour isn’t it he said after a long pause  miss hartley agreed—and sat admiring it  salthaven is a pretty place altogether i think continued robert i was quite glad to come back to it i like the town and i like the people except for holidays i haven’t been in the place since i was ten  miss hartley feeling that some comment was expected said indeed  you have lived here all your life i suppose said the persevering robert  practically said miss hartley  mr vyner stole a look at her as she sat sideways by the window conscience and his visitor’s manner told him that he ought to go for her father personal inclination told him that there was no hurry for the first time in his experience the office became most desirable place in the world he wanted to sit still and look at her and for some time despite her restlessness obeyed his inclinations she turned at last to ask for her father and in the fraction of a second he was immersed in a bundle of papers knitted brows and pursed lips testified to his absorption he seized a pen and made an endorsement looked at it with his head on one side and struck it out again  my father said miss hartley in a small but determined voice  mr vyner gazed at her in a preoccupied fashion suddenly his face changed  good gracious yes he said springing up and going to the door how stupid of me  he stepped into the corridor and stood reflecting in some circumstances he could be businesslike enough after reflecting for three minutes he came back into the room  he will be in soon he said resuming his seat inwardly he resolved to go and fetch him later on—when the conversation flagged for instance meantime he took up his papers and shook his head over them  i wish i had got your father’s head for business he said ruefully  miss hartley turned on him a face from which all primness had vanished the corners of her mouth broke and her eyes grew soft she smiled at mr vyner and mr vyner pluming himself upon his address smiled back  if i knew half as much as he does he continued i’d—i’d——  miss hartley waited her eyes bright with expectation  i’d repeated mr vyner who had rashly embarked on a sentence before he had seen the end of it have a jolly easy time of it he concluded breathlessly  miss hartley surveyed him in pained surprise i thought my father worked very hard she said with a little reproach in her voice  so he does said the young man hastily but he wouldn’t if he only had my work to do that’s what i meant as far as he is concerned he works far too hard he sets an example that is a trouble to all of us except the officeboy do you know bassett  miss hartley smiled my father tells me he is a very good boy she said  a treasure said robert ’good’ doesn’t describe bassett he is the sort of boy who would get off a ’bus after paying his fare to kick a piece of orange peel off the pavement he has been nourished on copybook headings and ’sanford and merton’ ever read ’sanford and merton’  i—i tried to once said joan  there was no ’trying’ with bassett said mr vyner rather severely he took to it as a duck takes to water by modelling his life on its teaching he won a silver medal for never missing an attendance at school  father has seen it said joan with a smile  even the measles failed to stop him continued robert day by day a little more flushed than usual perhaps he sat in his accustomed place until the whole school was down with it and had to be closed in consequence then and not till then did bassett feel that he had saved the situation  i don’t suppose he knew it poor boy said joan  anyway he got the medal said robert and he has a row of prizes for good conduct i never had one not even a little one i suppose you had a lot  miss hartley maintained a discreet silence  nobody ever seemed to notice my good conduct continued mr vyner still bent on making conversation they always seemed to notice the other kind fast enough but the ’good’ seemed to escape them  he sighed faintly and glancing at the girl who was looking out of the window again took up his pen and signed his blottingpaper  i suppose you know the view from that window pretty well he said putting the paper aside with great care  ever since i was a small girl said joan looking round i used to come here sometimes and wait for father not so much lately and now of course—  mr vyner looked uncomfortable i hope you will come to this room whenever you want to see him he said earnestly he—he seemed to prefer being in the general office  miss hartley busied herself with the window again seemed to prefer she said impatiently under her breath yes  there was a long silence which mr vyner gazing in mute consternation at the vision of indignant prettiness by the window felt quite unable to break he felt that the time had at last arrived at which he might safely fetch mr hartley without any selfupbraidings later on and was just about to rise when the faint tap at the door by which bassett always justified his entrance stopped him and bassett entered the room with some cheques for signature despite his habits the youth started slightly as he saw the visitor and then placing the cheques before mr vyner stood patiently by the table while he signed them  that will do said the latter as he finished thank you  thank you sir said bassett he gave a slow glance at the window and arranging the cheques neatly turned toward the door  will mr hartley be long inquired joan turning round  mr hartley miss said bassett pausing with his hand on the knob mr hartley left half an hour ago  mr vyner who felt the eyes of miss hartley fixed upon him resisted by a supreme effort the impulse to look at her in return  bassett he said sharply  sir said the other didn’t you said mr vyner with a fine and growing note of indignation in his voice—didn’t you tell mr hartley that miss hartley was here waiting for him  no sir said bassett gazing at certain mysterious workings of the junior partner’s face with undisguised amazement i—  do you mean to tell me demanded mr vyner looking at him with great significance that you forgot  no sir said bassett i didn’t—  that will do broke in mr vyner imperiously that will do you can go  but said the amazed youth how could i tell—  that—will—do said mr vyner very distinctly  i don’t want any excuses you can go at once and the next time you are told to deliver a message please don’t forget now go  with a fine show of indignation he thrust the gasping bassett from the room  he rose from his chair and with a fine show of indignation thrust the gasping bassett from the room and then turned to face the girl  i am so sorry he began that stupid boy—you see how stupid he is—  it doesn’t matter thank you said joan it—it wasn’t very important  he doesn’t usually forget things murmured mr vyner i wish now he added truthfully that i had told mr hartley myself  he held the door open for her and still expressing his regret accompanied her downstairs to the door miss hartley somewhat embarrassed and a prey to suspicions which maidenly modesty forbade her to voice listened in silence  next time you come said mr vyner pausing just outside the door i hope—  something dropped between them and fell with a little tinkling crash on to the pavement mr vyner stooped and picking up a pair of clumsily fashioned spectacles looked swiftly up at the office window  bassett he said involuntarily  he stood looking at the girl and trying in vain to think of something to say miss hartley with somewhat more colour than usual gave him a little bow and hurried off     chapter v     smiling despite herself as she thought over the events of the afternoon joan hartley walked thoughtfully homeward indignation at mr vyner’s presumption was mingled with regret that a young man of undeniably good looks and somewhat engaging manners should stoop to deceit the fact that people are considered innocent until proved guilty did not concern her with scarcely any hesitation she summed up against him the only thing that troubled her being what sentence to inflict and how to inflict it she wondered what excuse he could make for such behaviour and then blushed hotly as she thought of the one he would probably advance confused at her own thoughts she quickened her pace in happy ignorance of the fact that fifty yards behind her captain trimblett and her father who had witnessed with great surprise her leavetaking of mr vyner were regulating their pace by hers  she’s a fine girl said the captain after a silence that had endured long enough to be almost embarrassing a fine girl but—  he broke off and completed his sentence by a shake of the head  she must have come for me said hartley and he happened to be standing there and told her i had gone  no doubt said the captain dryly that’s why she went scurrying off as though she had got a train to catch and he stood there all that time looking after her and besides every time he sees me in some odd fashion your name crops up  my name said the other in surprise  your name repeated the captain firmly same as joan’s ain’t it the afterpart of it anyway that’s the attraction talk all round you—and i talk all round you too nobody’d dream you’d got a daughter to hear the two of us talk—sometimes other times if i bring her name in they’d think you’d got nothing else  mr hartley glanced at him uneasily perhaps— he began  there’s no ’perhaps’ about it said the masterful captain if you’re not very careful there’ll be trouble you know what mr john is—he’s got big ideas and the youngster is as obstinate as a mule  it’s all very well said hartley but how can i be careful what can i do besides i dare say you are making mountains of moleheaps she probably hurried off thinking to catch me up  captain trimblett gave a little dry cough ask her he said impressively  i’m not going to put any such ideas into her head said his friend  sound her then said the captain this is the way i look at it we all think he is a very nice fellow don’t we  he is said hartley decidedly  and we all think she’s a splendid girl don’t we continued the other  something of the sort said hartley smiling  there you are then said the captain triumphantly what is more likely than that they should think the same of each other besides i know what he thinks i can read him like a book  you can’t read joan though said the other why she often puzzles me  i can try said the captain i haven’t known her all these years for nothing now don’t tell her we saw her you leave her to me—and listen  better leave her alone said hartley  the captain who was deep in thought waved the suggestion aside he walked the remainder of the way in silence and even after they were in the house was so absorbed in his selfappointed task and so vague in his replies that joan after offering him the proverbial penny for his thoughts suggested to her father in a loud whisper that he had got something in mind  thinking of the ships he has lost she said in a still louder whisper  the captain smiled and shook his head at her  couldn’t lose a ship if i tried he said nudging hartley to call his attention to what was to follow i was saying so to mr robert only yesterday  his voice was so deliberate and his manner so significant that miss hartley looked up in surprise then she coloured furiously as she saw both gentlemen eying her with the air of physicians on the lookout for unfavourable symptoms anger only deepened her colour and an unladylike and unfilial yearning to bang their two foolish heads together possessed her explanations were impossible and despite her annoyance she almost smiled as she saw the concern in the eye the captain turned on her father  saying so only yesterday repeated the former to mr robert  i saw him this afternoon said joan with forced composure i went up to father’s room and found him there why didn’t you tell me you had given up your room father  mr hartley pleaded in excuse that he thought he had told her and was surprised at the vehemence of her denial with a slightly offended air he pointed out that it was a very small matter after all  there is nothing to be annoyed about he said  you went there to see me and not finding me there came down again  yees said joan thoughtfully  just put her head in at the door and fled explained the captain still watching her closely  miss hartley appeared not to have heard him  came down three stairs at a time he continued with a poor attempt at a chuckle  i was there about half an hour waiting for father said joan eying him very steadily i thought that he was in the other office is there anything else i can tell you  the captain collapsed suddenly and turning a red face upon hartley appealed to him mutely for succour  me he spluttered feebly i—i don’t want to know anything your father thought—  i didn’t think anything said hartley with some haste  the captain eyed him reproachfully i thought your father thought— he began and drawing out a large handkerchief blew his nose violently  yes said joan still very erect  that is all said the captain with an air of dignity  he brushed some imaginary atoms from his beard and finding the girl’s gaze still somewhat embarrassing sought to relieve the tension  i’ve known you since you were five he said with inconsequent pathos  i know said joan smiling and putting her hand on his broad shoulder you’re a dear old stupid that is all  always was said the relieved captain from a child  he began with a cheerful countenance to narrate anecdotes of his stupidity until being interrupted by hartley with one or two choice examples that he had forgotten he rose and muttered something about seeing the garden his progress was stayed by a knock at the front door and an intimation from rosa that he was wanted  my bo’sun he said reentering the room with a letter excuse me  he broke the seal and turned to hartley with a short laugh peter truefitt he said wants me to meet him at nine o’clock and go home together pretending that he has been here with me peter is improving  but he can’t go on like this forever said his scandalized friend  he’s all right said the captain with a satisfied wink i’m looking after him i’m stagemanager i’ll see——  his voice faltered and then died away as he caught miss hartley’s eye and noticed the air of artless astonishment with which she was regarding him  always was from a child she quoted  the captain ignored her  i’ll just give walters a note he said turning to hartley with some dignity you don’t mind his waiting  he turned to a small writingtable and with an air of preoccupation assumed for miss hartley’s benefit began to try a pen on his thumbnail hartley going to the door sent the boatswain off to the kitchen for a glass of ale  or perhaps you prefer tea he added thoughtfully  ale will do sir said mr walters humbly  he walked to the kitchen and pushing the door open softly went in rosa jelks who was sitting down reading put aside her book and smiled welcome  sit down she said patronizingly sit down  i was going to said mr walters i’m to ’ave a glass of ale  say ’please’ said rosa shaking her yellow locks at him and rising to take a glass from the dresser  she walked into the scullery humming a tune and the pleasant sound of beer falling into a glass fell on the boatswain’s ears he stroked his small black moustache and smiled  would you like me to take a sip at the glass first inquired rosa coming back carefully with a brimming glass just to give it a flavour  mr walters stared at her in honest amazement after a moment he remarked gruffly that the flavour of the ale itself was good enough for him rosa’s eyes sparkled  just a sip she pleaded  go on then said mr walters grudgingly  chin chin said rosa  the boatswain’s face relaxed then it hardened suddenly and a dazed look crept into his eyes as rosa drinking about twothirds of the ale handed him the remainder  that’s for your impudence she said sharply i don’t like beer  mr walters still dazed finished the beer without a word and placed the glass on the table a faint sigh escaped him but that was all  bear said rosa making a face at him  she looked at his strong lean face and powerful figure approvingly but the bereaved boatswain took no notice  bear said rosa again  she patted her hair into place and in adjusting a hairpin permitted a long thick tress to escape to her shoulder she uttered a little squeal of dismay  false ain’t it inquired mr walters regarding her antics with some amazement  false exclaimed rosa certainly not here tug  she presented her shoulder to the boatswain and he nothing loath gave a tug animated by the loss of twothirds of a glass of beer the next instant a loud slap rang through the kitchen  and i’d do it again for two pins said the outraged damsel as she regarded him with watering eyes brute  she turned away and pink with annoyance proceeded to arrange her hair in a small cracked glass that hung by the mantelpiece  i ’ad a cousin once said mr walters thoughtfully that used to let her ’air down and sit on it tall gal too she was  so can i snapped rosa rolling the tress up on her finger holding it in place and transfixing it with a hairpin  h’m said the boatswain  what d’ye mean by that demanded rosa sharply do you mean to say i can’t  you might if you cut it off first conceded mr walters  cut it off said rosa scornfully here look here  she dragged out her hairpins and with a toss of her head sent the coarse yellow locks flying then straightening them slightly she pulled out a chair and confronted him triumphantly and at that moment the frontroom bell rang  that’s for you said mr walters pointedly  rosa who was already back at the glass working with feverish haste made no reply the bell rang again and a third time rosa finally answering it in a coiffure that looked like a hastily constructed bird’s nest  there’s your letter she said returning with a face still flushed take it and go  thankee said the boatswain was they very frightened  take it and go repeated rosa with cold dignity your young woman might be expecting you pity to keep her waiting  i ain’t got a young woman said mr walters slowly  you surprise me said rosa with false astonishment  i never would ’ave one said the boatswain rising and placing the letter in his breastpocket i’ve got along all right for thirty years without ’em and i ain’t going to begin now  you must have broke a lot of hearts with disappointment said rosa  i never could see anything in young wimmen said the boatswain musingly silly things most of ’em always thinking about their looks especially them as haven’t got none  he took up the empty glass and toyed with it thoughtfully  it’s no good waiting said rosa you won’t get no more beer not if you stay here all night  so long said the boatswain still playing with the glass so long i know one or two that’ll ’ave a fit pretty near when i tell ’em about you sitting on your ’air  he put up his left arm instinctively but miss jelks by a supreme effort maintained her calmness her eyes and colour were beyond her control but her voice remained steady  so long she said quietly she took the glass from him and smiled if you like to wait a moment i’ll get you a little drop more she said graciously  here’s luck said mr walters as she returned with the glass he drank it slowly and then wiping his lips with the back of his hand stood regarding her critically  well so long he said again and before the astonished maiden could resist placed a huge arm about her neck and kissed her  you do that again if you dare she gasped indignantly as she broke loose and confronted him the idea  i don’t want to do it agin said the boatswain i’ve ’ad a glass of ale and you’ve ’ad a kiss now we’re quits  he wiped his mouth on the back of his hand again and walked off with the air of a man who has just discharged an obligation he went out the back way and rosa to whom this sort of man was an absolutely new experience stood gazing after him dumbly recovering herself she followed him to the gate and with a countenance on which amazement still lingered stood watching his tall figure up the road     chapter vi     work said mr robert vyner severely as he reclined in a deckchair on the poop of the indian chief and surveyed his surroundings through halfclosed eyes work it’s no good sitting here idling while the world’s work awaits my attention  captain trimblett who was in a similar posture a yard away assented he also added that there was nothing like it  there’s no play without work continued mr vyner in a spirit of selfadmonition  the captain assented again you said something about work half an hour ago he remarked  and i meant it said mr vyner only in unconscious imitation i dozed off what i really want is for somebody to take my legs somebody else my shoulders and waft me gently ashore  i had a cook o’ mine put ashore like that once said captain trimblett in a reminiscent voice only i don’t know that i would have called it ’wafting’ and so far as my memory goes he didn’t either he had a lot to say about it too  mr vyner with a noisy yawn struggled out of his chair and stood adjusting his collar and waistcoat  if i couldn’t be a chrysalis he said slowly as he looked down at the recumbent figure of the captain do you know what i would like to be  i’ve had a very hard day’s work said the other defensively as he struggled into a sitting posture—very hard and i was awake half the night with the toothache  that isn’t an answer to my question said mr vyner gently but never mind try and get a little sleep now try and check that feverish desire for work which is slowly very very slowly wearing you to skin and bone think how grieved the firm would be if the toothache carried you off one night why not go below and turn in now it’s nearly five o’clock  couldn’t sleep if i did replied the captain gravely besides i’ve got somebody coming aboard to have tea with me this afternoon  all right i’m going said robert reassuringly nobody i know i suppose  no said the captain not exactly he added with a desire of being strictly accurate  mr vyner became thoughtful the captain’s reticence coupled with the fact that he had made two or three attempts to get rid of him that afternoon was suspicious he wondered whether joan hartley was the expected guest the captain’s unwillingness to talk whenever her name came up having by no means escaped him and once or twice the captain had with unmistakable meaning dropped hints as to the progress made by mr saunders in horticulture and other pursuits at the idea of this elderly mariner indulging in matrimonial schemes with which he had no sympathy he became possessed with a spirit of vindictive emulation  it seems like a riddle you’ve excited my curiosity he said as he threw himself back in the chair again and looked at the gulls wheeling lazily overhead let me see whether i can guess—i’ll go as soon as i have  ’tisn’t worth guessing said captain trimblett with a touch of brusqueness  don’t make it too easy pleaded mr vyner guess number one a lady  the captain grunted  a widow continued mr vyner in the slow rapt tones of a clairvoyant the widow  what do you mean by the widow demanded the aroused captain  the one you are always talking about replied mr vyner winking at the sky  me said the captain purpling i don’t talk about her you don’t hear me talk about her i’m not always talking about anybody i might just have mentioned her name when talking about truefitt’s troubles that’s all  that’s what i meant said robert vyner with an air of mild surprise  well it’s not her said the captain shortly  somebody i know but not exactly mused robert somebody i know but—let me think  he closed his eyes in an effort of memory and kept them shut so long that the captain anxious to get him away before his visitor’s arrival indulged in a loud and painful fit of coughing mr vyner’s eyes remained closed  any more guesses inquired the captain loudly  mr vyner slept on gulls mewed overhead a rattle of cranes sounded from the quays and a conversation—mostly in hoarse roars—took place between the boatswain in the bows and an elderly man ashore but he remained undisturbed then he sprang up so suddenly that he nearly knocked his chair over and the captain turning his head after him in amaze saw joan hartley standing at the edge of the quay  before he could interfere mr vyner holding her hand with anxious solicitude was helping her aboard poised for a moment on the side of the ship she sprang lightly to the deck and the young man relinquishing her hand with some reluctance followed her slowly toward the captain  ten minutes later by far the calmest of the three he sat at tea in the small but comfortable saloon how he got there captain trimblett could not exactly remember mr vyner had murmured something about a slight headache due in his opinion to the want of a cup of tea and even while talking about going home to get it had in an abstracted fashion drifted down the companionway  i feel better already he remarked as he passed his cup up to miss hartley to be refilled it’s wonderful what a cup of tea will do  it has its uses said the captain darkly  he took another cup himself and sat silent and watchful listening to the conversation of his guests a slight appearance of reserve on miss hartley’s part assumed to remind mr vyner of his bad behaviour on the occasion of their last meeting was dispelled almost immediately modesty tinged with respectful admiration was in every glance and every note of his voice when she discovered that a man who had asked for his tea without sugar had drunk without remark a cup containing three lumps she became thoughtful  why didn’t you tell me she asked in concern  modesty and mr vyner—never boon companions—parted company  i thought you had given me the wrong cup he said simply  the explanation seemed to captain trimblett quite inadequate he sat turning it over in his mind and even the rising colour in miss hartley’s cheek did not serve to enlighten him but he was glad to notice that she was becoming reserved again mr vyner noticed it too and raging inwardly against a tongue which was always striving after his undoing began with a chastened air to criticise the architecture of the new chapel in porter street architecture being a subject of which the captain knew nothing he discussed it at great length somewhat pleased to find that both his listeners were giving him their undivided attention  he was glad to notice when they went up on deck again that his guests had but little to say to each other and with a view to keeping them apart as much as possible made no attempt to detain her when joan rose and said that she must be going she shook hands and then turned to mr vyner  oh i must be going too said that gentleman  he helped her ashore and with a wave of his hand to captain trimblett set off by her side at the bridge where their ways homeward diverged joan half stopped but mr vyner gazing straight ahead kept on  fine chap captain trimblett he said suddenly  he is the kindest man i know said joan warmly  mr vyner sang his praises for three hundred yards secretly conscious that his companion was thinking of ways and means of getting rid of him the window of a confectioner’s shop at last furnished the necessary excuse  i have got a little shopping to do she said diving in suddenly goodby  the ’goodby’ was so faint that it was apparent to her as she stood in the shop and gave a modest order for chocolates that he had not heard it she bit her lip and after a glance at the figure outside added to her order a large one for buns she came out of the shop with a bag overflowing with them  let me said mr vyner hastily  miss hartley handed them over at once and walking by his side strove hard to repress malicious smiles she walked slowly and gave appraising glances at shop windows pausing finally at a greengrocer’s to purchase some bananas mr vyner with the buns held in the hollow of his arm watched her anxiously and his face fell as she agreed with the greengrocer as to the pity of spoiling a noble bunch he was displaying insufficiently draped in a brownpaper bag it took mr vyner’s other arm  you are quite useful said miss hartley with a bright smile  mr vyner returned the smile and in bowing to an acquaintance nearly lost a bun he saved it by sheer sleight of hand and noting that his companion was still intent on the shops wondered darkly what further burdens were in store for him he tried to quicken the pace but miss hartley was not to be hurried  i must go in here i think she said stopping in front of a draper’s i sha’n’t be long  mr vyner took his stand by the window with his back to the passersby and waited at the expiration of ten minutes he peeped in at the door and saw miss hartley at the extreme end of the shop thoughtfully fingering bales of cloth he sighed and catching sight of a small boy regarding him had a sudden inspiration  here would you like some buns old chap he cried  the child’s eyes glistened  take ’em said mr vyner thankfully don’t drop ’em  he handed them over and stood smiling benevolently as the small boy with both arms clasped round the bag went off hugging it to his bosom another urchin who had been regarding the transaction with speechless envy caught his eye he beckoned him to him and with a few kind words and a fatherly admonition not to make himself ill presented him with the bananas then he drew a deep breath and with a few kind words he presented him with the bananas assuming an expression of gravity befitting the occasion braced himself for the inevitable encounter  five minutes later miss hartley bearing a large and badlytied parcel came smiling out to him the smile faded suddenly and she stood regarding him in consternation  why— she began where—  mr vyner eyed her carefully i gave ’em away he said slowly two poor hungry little chaps stood looking at me i am awfully fond of children and before i knew what i was doing—  i’ve no doubt said joan bitterly as she realized her defeat i’ve no doubt  mr vyner leaned toward the parcel allow me he murmured politely  thank you til carry it myself said joan sharply  her taste for shopping had evaporated and clutching her parcel she walked rapidly homeward an occasional glance at her companion did not quite satisfy her that he was keeping his sense of humour under proper control there was a twitching of his lips which might she felt in a little time become contagious she averted her head  that’s all right said mr vyner with a sigh of relief i was half afraid that i had offended you     chapter vii     to the great relief of mr truefitt’s imagination his sister suddenly ceased from all comment upon the irregularity of his hours unprepared by the suddenness of the change he recited mechanically for the first day or two the reasons he had invented for his lateness but their reception was of so chilling a nature that his voice was scarcely audible at the finish indeed when he came home one evening with a perfectly true story of a seaman stabbed down by the harbour mrs chinnery yawned three times during the narration and captain trimblett shook his head at him  true or not said the latter after mrs chinnery had left the room it doesn’t matter it isn’t worth while explaining when explanations are not asked for  do you think she knows inquired mr truefitt with bated voice  she knows something replied the captain i believe she knows all about it else she wouldn’t keep so quiet why not tell her straight out tell her when she comes in and get it over she’s got to know some day  poor susan said mr truefitt with feeling i’m afraid she’ll feel it it’s not nice to have to leave home to make room for somebody else and she won’t stay in it with another woman i’m certain  here she comes said the captain getting up i’ll go out for a little stroll and when i come back i shall expect to find you’ve made a clean breast of it  mr truefitt put out a hand as though to detain him and then thinking better of it nodded at him with an air of great resolution and puffed furiously at his pipe under cover of clouds of smoke he prepared for the encounter  closing the door gently behind him the captain after a moment’s indecision drifted down the road a shower of rain had brought out sweet odours from the hedgerow opposite and a touch of salt freshened the breeze that blew up the river most of the inhabitants of the vale were in bed and the wet road was lonely under the stars he walked as far as a little bridge spanning a brook that ran into the river and seating himself on the low parapet smoked thoughtfully his mind went back to his own marriage many years before and to his children whom he had placed on his wife’s death with a second cousin in london an unusual feeling of loneliness possessed him he smoked a second pipe and then knocking the ashes out on the bridge walked slowly homeward  mr truefitt who was sitting alone looked up as he entered and smiled vaguely  all right queried the captain closing the door and crossing to a chair  right as ninepence said mr truefitt i’ve been worrying myself all this time for nothing judging by her manner she seemed to think it was the most natural and proper thing in the world  so it is said the captain warmly  she talked about it as calmly as though she had a brother married every week continued mr truefitt i don’t suppose she has quite realized it yet  i don’t know that i have said the captain this has been the only home i’ve had for the last ten years and i feel leaving it what must it be for her  mr truefitt shook his head  i’m beginning to feel old said the captain old and lonely changes like this bring it home to one  he took out his pouch and shaking his head solemnly began to fill his pipe again  you ought to follow my example said mr truefitt eagerly  too old said the captain  nonsense said the other and the older you get the lonelier you’ll feel mind that  i shall go and live with my boys and girls when i leave the sea said the captain  they’ll probably be married themselves by that time said his comforter  he rose and going to an old corner cupboard took out a bottle of whiskey and a couple of glasses and put them on the table the captain helping himself liberally emptied his glass to miss willett  she’s coming to tea on friday with her mother said mr truefitt  captain trimblett took some more whiskey and solemnly toasted mrs willett he put his glass down and lighting his pipe which had gone out beamed over at his friend  are there any more in the family he inquired  there’s an uncle said mr truefitt slowly and——  one at a time said the captain stopping him with one hand raised while he helped himself to some more whiskey with the other the uncle  he drank the third glass slowly and sinking back in his chair turned to his friend with a countenance somewhat flushed and wreathed in smiles  who else he inquired  no more tonight said mr truefitt firmly as he got up and put the bottle back in the cupboard he came back slowly and resuming his seat gazed in a meditative fashion at his friend  talking about your loneliness— he began  my loneliness repeated the captain staring at you were talking about feeling lonely mr truett reminded him  he proceeded with almost equal care to assist her mother  so i was said the captain so i was you’re quite right but it’s all gone now it’s wonderful what a little whiskey will do  wonderful what a lot will do said mr truefitt with sudden asperity you were talking about your loneliness and i was advising you to get married  so you were said the captain nodding at him goodnight  he went off to bed with a suddenness that was almost disconcerting thus deserted mr truefitt finished his whiskey and water and his head full of plans for the betterment of everybody connected with him blew out the lamp and went upstairs  owing possibly to his efforts in this direction captain trimblett and mrs chinnery scarcely saw him until friday afternoon when he drove up in a fly and after handing out miss willett with great tenderness proceeded with almost equal care to assist her mother the latter a fragile little old lady was at once conducted to a chair and having been comfortably seated was introduced to mrs chinnery  it’s a long way she said as her daughter divested her of her bonnet and shawl but cissie would insist on my coming and i suppose after all it’s only right i should  of course mother said miss willett hurriedly  right is right continued the old lady after all is said and done and i’m sure mr truefitt has been to ours often enough  mr truefitt coughed and the captain—a loyal friend—assisted him  night after night said the old lady during a brief interval  mr truefitt still coughing slightly began to place chairs at a table on which as the captain presentlyproved to his own dissatisfaction there was not even room for a pair of elbows at the last moment the seating arrangements had to be altered owing to a leg of the table which got in the way of mrs willett’s the captain in his anxiety to be of service lowered a leaf of the table too far and an avalanche of food descended to the floor  it don’t matter said mrs chinnery in a voice that belied her words captain trimblett is always doing something like that the last time we had visitors he—  kept on eating the cake after she had shaken her head at me interrupted the captain who was busy picking up the provisions  nothing of the kind cried mrs chinnery who was in no mood for frivolity i shouldn’t think of doing such a thing she added turning to mrs willett as the lady allowed herself to be placed in a more convenient position it’s all captain trimblett’s nonsense  mrs willett listened politely it is annoying though she remarked  he might eat all the cake in the house for what i care said mrs chinnery turning very red and raising her voice a little  as a matter of fact i don’t like cake said the captain who was becoming uncomfortable  perhaps it was something else said the excellent mrs willett with the air of one assisting to unravel a mystery  mrs chinnery who was pouring out tea glared at her in silence she also spared a glance for captain trimblett which made that gentleman seriously uneasy with an idea of turning the conversation into safer and more agreeable channels he called the old lady’s attention to a pencil drawing of a ruined castle which adorned the opposite wall mrs willett’s first remark was that it had no roof  it’s a ruin said the captain done by mrs chinnery  the faded blue eyes behind the goldrimmed spectacles inspected it carefully done when she was a child—of course said mrs willett  eighteen said mrs chinnery in a deep voice  i’m no judge of such things said the old lady shaking her head i only know what i like but i dare say it’s very clever  she turned to help herself from a plate that the captain was offering her and finding that it contained cake said that she would prefer bread and butter  not that i don’t like cake she said as a rule i am rather partial to it  well have some now said the unfortunate captain trying to avoid mrs chinnery’s eye  bread and butter please said mrs willett with quiet decision  the captain passed it and after a hopeless glance at mr truefitt and miss willett who were deep in the enjoyment of each other’s society returned to the subject of art  if i could draw like that ma’am he said with a jerk of his head toward the ruined castle i should give up the sea  mrs willett inspected it again even going to the length of taking off her glasses and polishing them with a view to doing perfect justice to the subject would you really she said when she had finished  the captain made no reply he sat appalled at the way in which the old lady was using him to pay off some of the debt that she fancied was due to mrs chinnery  you must see some of my daughter’s pictures she said turning to him fruit and birds mostly in oil colours but then of course she had good masters there’s one picture—let me see  she sat considering and began to reel off the items on her fingers as she enumerated them there’s a plate of oranges with a knife and fork a glass a bottle two and a half walnuts and bits of shell threequarters of an apple a pipe a cigar a bunch of grapes and a green parrot looking at it all with his head on one side  and very natural of him too murmured mrs chinnery  it’s coming here interposed mr truefitt suddenly it belongs to mrs willett but she has given it to us i wonder which will be the best place for it  the old lady looked round the room it will have to hang there she said pointing to the eruption of vesuvius where that beehive is  bee— exclaimed the startled captain he bent toward her and explained  oh well it don’t matter said the old lady i thought it was a beehive—it looks like one and i can’t see what’s written under it from here but that’s where cecilia’s picture must go  she made one or two other suggestions with regard to the rearrangement of the pictures and then having put her hand to the plough proceeded to refurnish the room and for her own private purposes she affected to think that mr truefitt’s taste was responsible for the windowcurtains  mother has got wonderful taste said miss willett looking round all over salthaven her taste has become a—a—  byword suggested mrs chinnery  proverb said miss willett are you feeling too warm mother she asked eying the old lady with sudden concern  a little said mrs willett i suppose it’s being used to big rooms i always was one for plenty of space it doesn’t matter—don’t trouble  it’s no trouble said captain trimblett who was struggling with the window how is that he inquired opening it a little at the top and returning to his seat  there is a draught down the back of my neck said mrs willett but don’t trouble about me if the others like it if i get a stiff neck cecilia can rub it for me when i get home with a little oil of camphor  yes mother said miss willett  i once had a stiff neck for three weeks said mrs willett  the captain rose again and with a compassionate glance at mr truefitt closed the window  one can’t have everything in this world said the old lady it ought to be a very cosey room in winter you can’t get too far away from the fire i mean  it has done for us for a good many years now said mrs chinnery i’ve never heard peter complain  he’d never complain said mrs willett with a fond smile at her prospective soninlaw why he wouldn’t know he was uncomfortable unless somebody told him  mrs chinnery pushed back her chair with a grating noise strangely in harmony with her feelings and after a moment’s pause to control her voice suggested that the gentlemen should take the visitors round the garden while she cleared away—a proposal accepted by all but mrs willett  i’ll stay here and watch you she said  captain trimblett accompanied mr truefitt and miss willett into the garden and after pointing out the missing beauties of a figurehead in the next garden but one and calling attention to the geraniums next door left the couple to themselves side by side in the little arbour they sat gazing on to the river and conversing in low tones of their future happiness  for some time the captain idled about the garden keeping as far away from the arbour as possible and doing his best to suppress a decayed but lively mariner named captain sellers who lived two doors off among other infirmities the latter was nearly stonedeaf and after giving up as hopeless the attempt to make him understand that mr truefitt and miss willett were not the captain at last sought shelter in the house  he found the table clear and a bowl of flowers placed in the exact centre on opposite sides of the room each with her hands folded in her lap and both sitting bolt upright mrs willett and mrs chinnery confronted each other with a muttered reference to his ship the captain took up his stick and fled  he spent the evening in the billiardroom of the golden fleece and did not return until late a light in the room upstairs and a shadow on the blind informed him that mrs chinnery had retired he stepped in quietly and closed the door behind him mr truefitt a picture of woe was sitting in his usual place at the corner of the stove and a suppertable loaded with food was untouched  gone inquired the captain scenting disaster  some time ago said mr truefitt they wouldn’t stay to supper i wish you had been here to persuade them  i wish i had said the captain untruthfully  he gave utterance to a faint sigh in token of sympathy with mr truefitt’s evident distress and drew a chair to the table he shook his head and with marvellous accuracy considering that his gaze was fastened on a piece of cold beef helped himself to a wedge of steakpie he ate with an appetite and after pouring out and drinking a glass of ale gazed again at the forlorn figure of mr truefitt  words he breathed in a conspirator’s whisper  the other shook his head no they were very polite he replied slowly  the captain nearly emitted a groan he checked it with two square inches of piecrust  a misunderstanding said mr truefitt  the captain said ah it was all he could say for the moment  a misunderstanding said the other i misled mrs willett he added in a tense whisper  good heavens said the captain  she had always understood—from me continued mr truefitt that when i married susanna would go i always thought she would anybody who knew susanna would have thought so you would—wouldn’t you  in the ordinary way—yes said the captain but circumstances alter cases  it came out—in conversation said the hapless mr truefitt that susanna wouldn’t dream of leaving me it also came out that mrs willett wouldn’t dream of letting cecilia marry me till she does what’s to be done  the captain took a slice of beef to assist thought you must have patience he said sagely  patience said mr truefitt with unusual heat patience be d—d i’m fiftytwo and cecilia’s thirtynine  time flies said the captain who could think of nothing else to say  mr truefitt looked at him almost savagely then he sank back in his chair  it’s a pity susanna doesn’t get married again he said slowly so far as i can see that’s the only way out of it cecilia said so to me just as she was leaving  did she said the captain he looked thoughtful and mr truefitt watched him anxiously for some time he seemed undecided and then with the resolute air of a man throwing appearances to the winds he drew an uncut tongue toward him and cut off a large slice     chapter viii     nearly a week had elapsed since robert vyner’s failure to give satisfaction as a light porter and in all that time despite his utmost efforts he had failed to set eyes on joan hartley in the hope of a chance encounter he divided his spare time between the narrow crooked streets of salthaven and the deck of the indian chief but in vain in a mysterious and highly unsatisfactory fashion miss hartley seemed to have vanished from the face of the earth  in these circumstances he manifested a partiality for the company of mr hartley that was a source of great embarrassment to that gentleman whose work rapidly accumulated while he sat in his old office discussing a wide range of subjects on all of which the junior partner seemed equally at home and inclined to air views of the most unorthodox description he passed from topic to topic with bewildering facility and one afternoon glided easily and naturally from death duties to insect powder and from that to maggots in rosebuds almost before his bewildered listener could take breath from rosebuds he discoursed on gardening—a hobby to which he professed himself desirous of devoting such few hours as could be spared from his arduous work as a member of the firm  i hear that your garden is the talk of salthaven he remarked  mr hartley justly surprised protested warmly  that’s what i heard said mr vyner doggedly  mr hartley admitted that his borders were good he also gave favourable mention to his roses  my favourite flower said mr vyner with enthusiasm  i’ll bring you a bunch tomorrow if you will let me said mr hartley rising and turning toward the door  the other stopped him with outstretched hand no don’t do that he said earnestly i hate cutting flowers it seems such a—a—desecration  mr hartley quite unprepared for so much feeling on the subject gazed at him in astonishment  i should like to see them too said robert musingly very much  the chief clerk with a little deprecatory cough got close to the door as a dim idea that there might be something after all in captain trimblett’s warnings occurred to him  yours are mostly standard roses aren’t they said the persevering robert  mostly was the reply  mr vyner regarded him thoughtfully i suppose you don’t care to let people see them for fear they should learn your methods he said at last  mr hartley coming away from the door almost stuttered in his haste to disclaim such ungenerous sentiments i am always glad to show them he said emphatically and to give any information i can  i should like to see them some time murmured robert  the other threw caution to the winds any time he said heartily  mr vyner thanked him warmly and having got what he wanted placed no further obstacles in the way of his withdrawal he bought a book entitled roses and how to grow them the same afternoon and the next evening called to compare his knowledge with mr hartley’s  mr hartley was out miss hartley was out but at rosa’s invitation he went in to await their return at her further suggestion—due to a habit she had of keeping her ears open and a conversation between her master and captain trimblett on the previous evening—he went into the garden to see the flowers  the other one’s there said rosa simply as she showed him the way  mr vyner started but a glance at rosa satisfied him that there was all to lose and nothing to gain by demanding an explanation which she would be only too ready to furnish with an air of cold dignity he strolled down the garden  a young man squatting in a painful attitude at the edge of a flowerbed paused with his trowel in the air and eyed him with mingled consternation and disapproval after allowing nearly a week to elapse since his last visit mr saunders having mustered up sufficient courage to come round for another lesson in horticulture had discovered to his dismay that both mr hartley and his daughter had engagements elsewhere that his evening should not be given over to disappointment entirely however the former had set him a long and arduous task before taking his departure  don’t let me interrupt you said mr vyner politely as the other rose and straightened himself what are you doing—besides decapitating worms  putting in these plants said mr saunders resentfully  mr vyner eyed them with the eye of a connoisseur and turning one over with his stick shook his head disparagingly for some time he amused himself by walking up and down the garden inspecting the roses and then lighting a cigarette threw himself at full length on to a garden bench that stood near mr saunders and watched him at work  fascinating pursuit he remarked affably  mr saunders grunted mr vyner blew out a thin thread of smoke toward the sky and pondered  fine exercise i wish i could get fond of it he remarked  perhaps you could if you tried said the other without looking round  after all said mr vyner thoughtfully after all perhaps it does one just as much good to watch other people at it my back aches with watching you and my knees are stiff with cramp i suppose yours are too  mr saunders made no reply he went on stolidly with his work until reaching over too far with the trowel he lost his balance and pitched forward on to his hands somewhat red in the face he righted himself and knocking the mould off his hands started once more  try try try again quoted the admiring onlooker  perhaps you’d like to take a turn said mr saunders looking round and speaking with forced politeness  mr vyner shook his head and helping himself to another cigarette proffered the case to the worker and on that gentleman calling attention to the grimy condition of his hands stuck one in his mouth and lit it for him considerably mollified by these attentions the amateur gardener resumed his labours with a lighter heart  joan hartley returning half an hour later watched them for some time from an upper window and then with a vague desire to compel the sprawling figure on the bench to get up and do a little work came slowly down the garden  you are working too hard mr saunders she remarked after mr vyner had shaken hands and the former had pleaded the condition of his  he likes it said mr vyner  at any rate it has got to be finished said mr saunders  miss hartley looked at them and then at the work done and the heap of plants still to go in she stood tapping the ground thoughtfully with her foot  i expect that we are only interrupting him by standing here talking to him said robert vyner considerately no doubt he is wishing us anywhere but here only he is too polite to say so  ignoring mr saunders’s fervent protestations he took a tentative step forward as though inviting miss hartley to join him but she stood firm  will you give me the trowel please she said with sudden decision  before mr saunders could offer any resistance she took it from him and stooping gracefully prepared to dig mr vyner interposed with some haste  allow me he said  miss hartley placed the trowel in his hands at once and with her lips curved in a slight smile stood watching his efforts by almost imperceptible degrees she drew away from him and attended by the devoted mr saunders sauntered slowly about the garden the worker glaring sideways watched them as they roamed from flower to flower the low murmur of their voices floated on the still air and once or twice he heard miss hartley laugh with great distinctness  apparently engrossed with his task mr vyner worked cheerfully for ten minutes the hand that held the trowel was so far fairly clean and he was about to use it to take out a cigarette when he paused and a broad smile spread slowly over his features he put down the trowel and burrowing in the wet earth with both hands regarded the result with smiling satisfaction the couple came toward him slowly and mr saunders smiled in his turn as he saw the state of the other’s hands  i beg your pardon said mr vyner standing up as miss hartley came close i wish you would do something for me  yes said joan  i want a cigarette  the girl looked puzzled yes she said again  mr vyner grave as a judge held up his disgraceful hands they are in a case in the inside pocket of my coat he said calmly  miss hartley drew back a pace perhaps mr saunders could help you she said hastily  mr vyner shook his head his hands are worse than mine he said mournfully  he held up his arm so that his coat opened a little more and miss hartley after a moment’s hesitation thrust a small hand into his pocket and drew out the case  to open it you press the catch said mr vyner  miss hartley pressed and the case flew open she stood holding it before him and mr vyner with a helpless gesture again exhibited his hands  if you would complete your kindness by putting one in my mouth he murmured  for a few moments she stood in a state of dazed indecision then slowly extracting a cigarette from the case she placed it between his lips with a little jab that made it a failure as a smoke from the first mr saunders who had been watching events with a brooding eye hastily struck a match and gave him a light and mr vyner with an illconcealed smile bent down to his work again he was pleased to notice that though the conversation between the others still proceeded after a fitful fashion miss hartley laughed no more  he worked on steadily and trampled ground and broken plants bore witness to his industry he was just beginning to feel that he had done enough gardening for that day when the return of mr hartley brought welcome relief the astonishment of the latter at finding this new and unlookedfor assistance was at first almost beyond words when he could speak he thanked him brokenly for his trouble and depriving him of his tools took him indoors to wash  he means well he said slowly after mr vyner had at last taken his departure he means well but i am afraid mr john wouldn’t like it  miss hartley flushed we didn’t ask him to come she said with spirit  no said her father plucking at his beard and regarding her with a troubled expression no i’m afraid that he is one of those young men that don’t want much asking     chapter ix     owing possibly to the unaccustomed exercise but probably to more sentimental reasons robert vyner slept but poorly the night after his labours he had explained his absence at the dinnertable by an airy reference to a long walk and a disquisition on the charms of the river by evening an explanation which both mr vyner and his wife had received with the silence it merited it was evident that his absence had been the subject of some comment but his father made no reference to it as they smoked a cigar together before retiring  he awoke early in the morning and after a vain attempt to get to sleep again rose and dressed nobody else was stirring and going quietly downstairs he took up a cap and went out  except for a labouring man or two tramping stolidly to work the streets were deserted the craft anchored in the river seemed asleep and he stood for some time on the bridge idly watching the incoming tide he lit his pipe and then with a feeble endeavour to feel a little surprise at the fact discovered that he was walking in the direction of mr hartley’s house  his pace slackened as he neared it and he went by gazing furtively at the drawn blinds of the front windows a feeling of regret that joan hartley should be missing such a delightful morning would not be denied in imagination he saw himself strolling by her side and pointing out to her the beauties of the most unfrequented portions of the river bank a sudden superstitious trust in fate—caught possibly from captain trimblett—made him turn and walk slowly past the house again with an idea of giving fate another chance he repeated the performance in all he passed eight times and was about to enter upon the ninth when he happened to look across the road and saw to his annoyance the small figure of bassett speeding toward him  he is not down yet sir said bassett respectfully  mr vyner suppressed his choler by an effort  oh he said stiffly well  bassett drew back in confusion i—i saw you walk up and down several times looking at the house sir and i thought it my duty to come and tell you he replied  mr vyner regarded him steadfastly thank you he said at last and how is it that you are out at such an early hour prowling about like a raging lion looking for its breakfast  i wasn’t sir said bassett i shall have my breakfast when i get home at eight o’clock i always get up at six then i make sure of two hours in the fresh air  and what time do you close your eyes on the world and its vanities inquired mr vyner with an appearance of great interest  i always go to bed as the clock strikes ten sir said the youth  and suppose—suppose the clock should be wrong one day suggested the other would you apprehend any lasting injury to your constitution  it couldn’t be sir said bassett i wind it myself  mr vyner regarded him more thoughtfully than before i can foresee he said slowly that you will grow up a great and good and wise man unless—  yes sir said bassett anxiously  unless somebody kills you in the meantime concluded mr vyner it is not fair to tempt people beyond their strength bassett even a verdict of ’justifiable homicide’ might not quite ease the slayer’s conscience  no sir said the perplexed youth  mr vyner suddenly dropped his bantering air  how was it i didn’t see you he demanded sternly  i don’t think you looked my side of the road sir said bassett you were watching mr hartley’s windows all the time and besides i was behind that hedge  he pointed to a welltrimmed privet hedge in a front garden opposite  behind the hedge repeated the other sharply what were you there for  watching a snail sir replied bassett  a what inquired mr vyner raising his voice  a snail sir repeated the youth i’ve got a book on natural history and i’ve just been reading about them i saw this one as i was passing and i went inside to study its habits they are very interesting little things to watch—very  fortified by the approval of a conscience that never found fault he met the searchlight gaze that the junior partner turned upon him without flinching quite calm although somewhat puzzled by the other’s manner he stood awaiting his pleasure  yes said robert vyner at last very interesting indeed i should think but you have forgotten one thing bassett when secreted behind a hedge watching one of these diverting little—er——  gasteropodous molluscs sir interjected bassett respectfully  exactly said the other just the word i was trying to think of when behind a hedge watching them it is always advisable to whistle as loudly and as clearly as you can  i never heard that sir said bassett more and more perplexed it’s not in my book but i remember once reading when i was at school that spiders are sometimes attracted by the sound of a flute  a flute would do said mr vyner still watching him closely but a cornet would be better still goodmorning  he left bassett gazing after him roundeyed and carefully refraining from looking at hartley’s windows walked on at a smart pace as he walked he began to wish that he had not talked so much a vision of bassett retailing the conversation of the morning to longer heads than his own in the office recurring to him with tiresome persistency and on the other hand he regretted that he had not crossed the road and made sure that there was a snail  busy with his thoughts he tramped on mechanically until pausing on a piece of high ground to admire the view he was surprised to see that the town lay so far behind at the same time sudden urgent promptings from within bore eloquent testimony to the virtues of early rising and exercise as aids to appetite with ready obedience he began to retrace his steps  the business of the day was just beginning as he entered the outskirts of the town again blinds were drawn aside and maidservants busy at front doors by the time he drew near laurel lodge—the name was the choice of a former tenant—the work of the day had begun in real earnest instinctively slackening his pace he went by the house with his eyes fastened on the hedge opposite being so intent on what might perhaps be described as a visual alibi for bassett’s benefit in case the lad still happened to be there that he almost failed to notice that hartley was busy in his front garden and that joan was standing by him he stopped short and bade them goodmorning  mr hartley dropped his tools and hastened to the gate goodmorning he said nervously i hope that there is nothing wrong i went a little way to try and find you  find me echoed mr vyner reddening as a suspicion of the truth occurred to him  bassett told me that you had been walking up and down waiting to see me continued hartley  i dressed as fast as i could but by that time you were out of sight  facial contortions in sympathy with the epithets he was mentally heaping upon the head of bassett disturbed for a moment the serenity of mr vyner’s countenance a rapid glance at miss hartley helped him to regain his composure  i don’t know why the boy should have been so officious he said slowly i didn’t want to see you i certainly passed the house on my way oh yes and then i thought of going back—i did go a little way back—then i altered my mind again i suppose i must have passed three times  i was afraid there was something wrong said hartley i am very glad it is all right i’ll give that lad a talking to he knocked us all up and said that you had been walking up and down for twentythree minutes  the generous colour in mr vyner’s cheeks was suddenly reflected in miss hartley’s their eyes met and feeling exceedingly foolish he resolved to put a bold face on the matter  bassett is unendurable he said with a faint laugh and i suspect his watch still i must admit that i did look out for you because i thought if you were stirring i should like to come in and see what sort of a mess i made last night was it very bad  nno said hartley no it perhaps requires a little attention half an hour or so will put it right  i should like to see my handiwork by daylight said robert  hartley opened the gardengate and admitted him and all three passing down the garden stood gravely inspecting the previous night’s performance it is to be recorded to mr vyner’s credit that he coughed disparagingly as he eyed it  father says that they only want taking up and replanting said joan softly and the footmarks caked over and the mould cleared away from the path except for that your assistance was invaluable  i—i didn’t quite say that said hartley mildly  you ought to have then said robert severely i had no idea it was so bad you’ll have to give me some lessons and see whether i do better next time or perhaps miss hartley will she seems to be all right so far as the theory of the thing goes  hartley smiled uneasily and to avoid replying moved off a little way and became busy over a rosebush  will you inquired mr vyner very softly i believe that i could learn better from you than from anybody i should take more interest in the work one wants sympathy from a teacher  miss hartley shook her head you had better try a three months’ course at dale’s nurseries she said with a smile you would get more sympathy from them than from me  i would sooner learn from you persisted robert  i could teach you all i know in half an hour said the girl  mr vyner drew a little nearer to her you overestimate my powers he said in a low voice you have no idea how dull i can be i am sure it would take at least six months  that settles it then said joan i shouldn’t like a dull pupil  mr vyner drew a little nearer still perhaps—perhaps ’dull’ isn’t quite the word he said musingly  it’s not the word i should— began joan and stopped suddenly  thank you murmured mr vyner it’s nice to be understood what word would you use  miss hartley apparently interested in her father’s movements made no reply  painstaking suggested mr vyner assiduous attentive devoted  miss hartley walking toward the house affected not to hear ’a fragrant smell of coffee delicately blended with odour of grilled bacon came from the open door and turned his thoughts to more mundane things mr hartley joined them just as the figure of rosa appeared at the door breakfast is quite ready miss she announced  she stood looking at them and mr vyner noticed an odd strained appearance about her left eye which he attributed to a cast a closer inspection made him almost certain that she was doing her best to wink  i laid for three miss she said with great simplicity you didn’t say whether the gentleman was going to stop or not and there’s no harm done if he don’t  mr hartley started and in a confused fashion murmured something that sounded like an invitation mr vyner in return murmuring something about goodness and not troubling them promptly followed joan through the french windows of the small diningroom  it’s awfully kind of you he said heartily as he seated himself opposite his host as a matter of fact i’m half famished  he made a breakfast which bore ample witness to the truth of his statement a meal with long intervals of conversation to hartley who usually breakfasted in a quarter of an hour and was anxious to start for the office it became tedious in the extreme and his eyes repeatedly sought the clock he almost sighed with relief as the visitor took the last piece of toast in the rack only to be plunged again into depression as his daughter rang the bell for more unable to endure it any longer he rose and murmuring something about getting ready quitted the room  i’m afraid i’m delaying things remarked mr vyner looking after him apologetically  miss hartley said not at all and as a mere piece of convention considering that he had already had four cups offered him some more coffee to her surprise he at once passed his cup up she looked at the coffeepot and for a moment thought enviously of the widow’s cruse  only a little please he said i want it for a toast  a toast said the girl  mr vyner nodded mysteriously it is a solemn duty he said impressively and i want you to drink it with me are you ready ’bassett the best of boys’  joan hartley looking rather puzzled laughed and put the cup to her lips robert vyner put his cup down and regarded her intently  do you know why we drank his health he inquired  no  because said robert pausing for a moment to steady his voice because if it hadn’t been for his officiousness i should not be sitting here with you  he leaned toward her do you wish that you had not drunk it he asked  joan hartley raised her eyes and looked at him so gravely that the mischief with which he was trying to disguise his nervousness died out of his face and left it as serious as her own for a moment her eyes clear and truthful met his  no she said in a low voice  and at that moment rosa burst into the room with two pieces of scorched bread and placed them upon the table unasked she proffered evidence on her own behalf and with great relish divided the blame between the coal merchant the baker and the stove mr hartley entered the room before she had done herself full justice and vyner obeying a glance from joan rose to depart     chapter x     mr vyner spent the remainder of the morning in a state of dreamy exaltation he leaned back in his chair devising plans for a future in which care and sorrow bore no part and neglected the pile of work on his table in favour of writing the name joan vyner on pieces of paper which he afterward burnt in the grate at intervals he jumped up and went to the window in the faint hope that joan might be passing and once in the highest of high spirits vaulted over his table removing ink from his carpet afterward by means of blottingpaper was only an agreeable diversion  by midday his mood had changed to one of extreme tenderness and humility and he began to entertain unusual misgivings as to his worthiness he went home to lunch depressed by a sense of his shortcomings but on his return his soaring spirits got the better of him again filled with a vast charity his bosom overflowing with love for all mankind he looked about to see whom he could benefit and bassett entering the room at that moment was sacrificed without delay robert vyner was ashamed to think that he should have left the lad’s valuable services unrewarded for so long  it’s a fine afternoon bassett he said leaning back and regarding him with a benevolent smile  beautiful sir said the youth  too fine to sit in a stuffy office continued the other put on you hat and go out and enjoy yourself  sir said the amazed bassett  take a half holiday said vyner still smiling  thank you sir said bassett but i don’t care for holidays and besides i’ve got a lot of work to do  do it tomorrow said vyner go on—out you go  it can’t be done tomorrow sir said the youth almost tearfully i’ve got all the letters to copy and a pile of other work and besides i shouldn’t know what to do with myself if i went  mr vyner eyed him in astonishment i’m sorry to find a tendency to disobedience in you bassett he said at last i’ve noticed it before and as to saying that you wouldn’t know what to do with yourself it’s a mere idle excuse  what time have i got to go sir asked bassett resignedly  time exclaimed the other now at once avaunt  the boy stood for a moment gazing at him in mute appeal and then moving with laggard steps to the door closed it gently behind him a sudden outbreak of four or five voices all speaking at once that filtered through the wall satisfied mr vyner that his orders were being obeyed  horrified at the grave charge of disobedience bassett distributed his work and left with what the junior clerk—whom he had constituted residuary legatee—considered unnecessary and indecent haste the latter gentleman indeed to the youth’s discomfiture accompanied him as far as the entrance and spoke eloquently upon the subject all the way downstairs his peroration consisted almost entirely of a repetition of the words lazy fathead  with this hostile voice still ringing in his ears bassett strolled aimlessly about the streets of his native town he spent some time at a stall in front of a secondhand bookshop and was just deep in an enthralling romance entitled story of a lump of coal when a huge hand was laid upon his shoulder and he turned to meet the admiring gaze of mr walters  more booklarning said the boatswain in tones of deep respect it’s a wonder to me that that head of yours don’t bust  heads don’t burst said bassett the brain enlarges with use the same as muscles with exercise they can’t burst  i only wish i had arf your laming said mr walters just arf and i should be a very different man to wot i am now well so long  where are you going inquired the youth replacing the book  seven trees replied the other displaying a small parcel i’ve got to take this over there for the skipper how far do you make it  four miles said bassett i’ll come with you if you like  wot about the office inquired the boatswain in surprise  bassett explained and a troubled expression appeared on the seaman’s face as he listened he was thinking of the last conversation he had had with the youth and the hearty way in which he had agreed with him as to the pernicious action of malt and other agreeable liquors on the human frame he remembered that he had committed himself to the statement that wild horses could not make him drink before six in the evening and then not more than one halfpint  it’s a long walk for a ’ot day he said slowly it might be too much for you  oh no i’m a good walker said bassett  might be too much for that head of yours said mr walters considerately  i often walk farther than that was the reply  mr walters drew the back of his hand across a mouth which was already dry and resigned himself to his fate he had lied quite voluntarily and pride told him that he must abide by the consequences and eight miles of dusty road lay between him and relief he strode along stoutly and tried to turn an attentive ear to a dissertation on fieldmice at the end of the first mile he saw the sign of the fox and hounds peeping through the trees and almost unconsciously slackened his pace as he remembered that it was the last inn on the road to seven trees  it’s very ’ot he murmured mopping his brow with his sleeve and i’m as dry as a bone  i’m thirsty too said bassett but you know the cure for it don’t you  o’ course i do said the boatswain and nearly smacked his lips  soldiers do it on the march said bassett  i’ve seen ’em said mr walters grinning  a leaden bullet is the best thing said bassett stooping and picking up a pebble which he polished on his trousers but this will do as well suck that and you won’t be troubled with thirst  the boatswain took it mechanically and after giving it another wipe on his own trousers placed it with great care in his mouth bassett found another pebble and they marched on sucking  my thirst has quite disappeared he said presently how’s yours  worse and worse said mr walters gruffly  it’ll be all right in a minute said bassett perhaps i had the best pebble if it isn’t perhaps we could get a glass of water at a cottage athough it isn’t good to drink when you are heated  mr walters made no reply but marched on marvelling at his lack of moral courage bassett quite refreshed took out his pebble and after a grateful tribute to its properties placed it in his waistcoat pocket for future emergencies  by the time they had reached seven trees and delivered the parcel mr walters was desperate the flattering comments that bassett had made upon his commonsense and virtue were forgotten pleading fatigue he sat down by the roadside and with his eyes glued to the open door of the pedlar’s rest began to hatch schemes of deliverance  a faint smell of beer and sawdust perceptible even at that distance set his nostrils aquiver then he saw an old labourer walk from the bar to a table bearing a mug of foaming ale human nature could endure no more and he was just about to throw away a hardearned character for truth and sobriety when better thoughts intervened with his eyes fixed on the small figure by his side he furtively removed the pebble from his mouth and then with a wild cry threw out his arms and clutched at his throat  what’s the matter cried bassett as the boatswain sprang to his feet  the stone cried mr walters in a strangulated voice it’s stuck in my throat  bassett thumped him on the back like one possessed cough it up he cried put your finger down cough  the boatswain waved his arms and gurgled i’m choking he moaned and dashed blindly into the inn followed by the alarmed boy  pot—six ale he gasped banging on the little counter  the landlord eyed him in speechless amazement  six ale repeated the boatswain pot quick grr  you be off said the landlord putting down a glass he was wiping and eying him wrathfully how dare you come into my place like that what do you mean by it  he has swallowed a pebble said bassett hastily  if he’d swallowed a brick i shouldn’t be surprised said the landlord seeing the state he’s in i don’t want drunken sailors in my place and what’s more i won’t have ’em  drunk said the unfortunate boatswain raising his voice me why i ain’t—  out you go said the landlord in a peremptory voice and be quick about it i don’t want people to say you got it here  got it wailed mr walters got it i tell you i ain’t had it i swallowed a stone  if you don’t go out said the landlord as mr walters in token of good faith stood making weird noises in his throat and rolling his eyes i’ll have you put out how dare you make them noises in my bar will—you—go  mr walters looked at him looked at the polished nickel taps and the neat row of mugs on the shelves then without a word he turned and walked out  has it gone down inquired bassett presently as they walked along  wot said the boatswain thoughtlessly  the pebble  i s’pose so said the other sourly  i should think it would be all right then said the boy foreign bodies even of considerable size are often swallowed with impunity how is your thirst now  the boatswain stopped dead in the middle of the road and stood eying him suspiciously but the mild eyes behind the glasses only betrayed friendly solicitude he grunted and walked on  by the time the fox and hounds came in sight again he had resolved not to lose a reputation which entailed suffering he clapped the boy on the back and after referring to a claspknive which he remembered to have left on the grass opposite the pedlar’s rest announced his intention of going back for it he did go back as far as a bend in the road and after watching bassett out of sight hastened with expectant steps into the inn  he rested there for an hour and much refreshed walked slowly into salthaven it was past seven o’clock and somewhat at a loss how to spend the evening he was bending his steps toward the lobster pot a small inn by the quay when in turning a corner he came into violent collision with a fashionably attired lady  i beg pardon ma’am he stammered i’m very sorry i didn’t see where i was—why halloa yaller wig  miss jelks drew back and rubbing her arm eyed him haughtily  fancy you in a ’at like that pursued the astonished boatswain no wonder i thought you was a lady well and ’ow are you  my health is very well i thank you returned miss jelks stiffly  that’s right said the boatswain heartily  conversation came suddenly to a standstill and they stood eying each other awkwardly  it’s a fine evening said mr walters at last  beautiful said rosa  they eyed each other again thoughtfully  you hurt my arm just now said rosa rubbing it coquettishly you’re very strong aren’t you  middling said the boatswain  very strong i should say said rosa you’ve got such a broad chest and shoulders  the boatswain inflated himself  and arms continued miss jelks admiringly arms like—like—  blocks o’ wood suggested the modest mr walters squinting at them complacently  or iron said rosa well goodby it’s my evening out and i mustn’t waste it  where are you going inquired the boatswain  miss jelks shook her head i don’t know she said softly  you can come with me if you like said mr walters weighing his words carefully a little way i ain’t got nothing better to do  miss jelks’s eyes flashed then with a demure smile she turned and walked by his side they walked slowly up the street and mr walters’s brows grew black as a series of troublesome coughs broke out behind a glance over his shoulder showed him three tavern acquaintances roguishly shaking their heads at him  arf a second he said stopping i’ll give ’em something to cough about  rosa clutched his arm not now not while you are with me she said primly  just one smack urged the boatswain  he looked round again and clenched his fists as his friends with their arms fondly encircling each other’s waists walked mincingly across the road he shook off the girl’s arm and stepped off the pavement as with little squeals fondly believed to be feminine they sought sanctuary in the red lion  they’re not worth taking notice of said rosa  she put a detaining hand through his arm again and gave it a little gentle squeeze a huge feather almost rested on his shoulder and the scent of eaudecologne assailed his nostrils he walked on in silent amazement at finding himself in such a position  it’s nice to be out said rosa ignoring a feeble attempt on his part to release his arm you’ve no idea how fresh the air smells after you’ve been shut up all day  you’ve got a comfortable berth though haven’t you said mr walters  fairish said rosa there’s plenty of work but i like work—housework  the boatswain said oh  some girls can’t bear it said rosa but then as i often say what are they going to do when they get married  ah said the boatswain with an alarmed grunt and made another attempt to release his arm  oh i beg your pardon said rosa making a pretence of freeing him i’m afraid i’m leaning on you but i sprained my ankle yesterday and i thought—  all right said mr walters gruffly  thank you said rosa and leaned on him heavily housework is the proper thing for girls she continued with some severity every girl ought to know how to keep her husband’s house clean and cook nicely for him but there—all they think about is love what did you say  nothing said mr walters hastily i didn’t say a word  i don’t understand it myself said rosa takings an appraising glance at him from under the brim of her hat i can’t think why people want to get married when they’re comfortable  me neither said the boatswain  being friends is all right said rosa meditatively but falling in love and getting married always seemed absurd to me  me too said mr walters heartily  with a mind suddenly at ease he gave himself over to calm enjoyment of the situation he sniffed approvingly at the eaudecologne and leaned heavily toward the feather apparently without either of them knowing it his arm began to afford support to miss jelks’s waist they walked on for a long time in silence  some men haven’t got your sense said rosa at last with a sigh there’s a young fellow that brings the milk—nice young fellow i thought he was—and all because i’ve had a word with him now and again he tried to make love to me  oh did he said mr walters grimly what’s his name  it don’t matter said rosa i don’t think he’ll try it again  still i might as well learn ’im a lesson said the boatswain i like a bit of a scrap  if you are going to fight everybody that tries to take notice of me you’ll have your work cut out said miss jelks in tones of melancholy resignation and i’m sure it’s not because i give them any encouragement and as for the number that ask me to walk out with them—well there  mr walters showed his sympathy with such a state of affairs by a pressure that nearly took her breath away they sat for an hour and a half on a bench by the river discussing the foolishness of young men  if any of them chaps trouble you again he said as they shook hands at the gate of laurel lodge you let me know do you have sunday evening out too     chapter xi     i have been knocking for the last ten minutes said hartley as he stood one evening at the open door of no 5 tranquil vale and looked up at captain trimblett  i was in the summerhouse said the captain standing aside to let him enter  alone queried the visitor  alone yes of course said the captain sharply why shouldn’t i be peter’s courting—as usual  and mrs chinnery inquired the other  she’s away for a day or two replied the captain friends at marsham  he stopped in the small kitchen to get some beer and glasses and with the bottle gripped under his arm and a glass in each hand led the way to the summerhouse  i came to ask your advice said hartley as he slowly filled his pipe from the pouch the captain pushed toward him  joan inquired the captain who was carefully decanting the beer  mr hartley nodded  robert vyner pursued the captain  hartley nodded again  what did i tell you inquired the other placing a full tumbler before him i warned you from the first i told you how it would be i——  it’s no good talking like that said hartley with feeble irritation you’re as bad as my poor old grandmother she always knew everything before it happened—at least she said so afterward what i want to know is how is it to be stopped he has been round three nights running  your grandmother is dead i suppose said the offended captain gazing at the river else she might have known what to do  i’m sorry said hartley apologetically but i am so worried that i hardly know what i’m saying  that’s all right said the captain amiably he drank some beer and leaning back on the seat knitted his brows thoughtfully  he admired her from the first he said slowly i saw that does she like him i wonder  it looks like it was the reply  the captain shook his head they’d make a fine couple he said slowly as fine as you’d see anywhere it’s fate again perhaps he was meant to admire her perhaps millions of years ago——  yes yes i know said hartley hastily but to prevent it  fate can’t be prevented said the captain who was now on his favourite theme think of the millions of things that had to happen to make it possible for those two young people to meet and cause this trouble that’s what i mean if only one little thing had been missing one little circumstance out of millions joan wouldn’t have been born you wouldn’t have been born  mr hartley attempted to speak but the captain laying down his pipe extended an admonitory finger  to go back only a little way he said solemnly your father had the measles hadn’t he  i don’t know—i believe so said hartley  good said the captain and he pulled through ’em else you wouldn’t have been here again he happened to go up north to see a friend who was taken ill while on a journey and met your mother there didn’t he  hartley groaned  if your father’s friend hadn’t been taken ill said the captain with tremendous solemnity as he laid his forefinger on his friend’s knee where would you have been  i don’t know said hartley restlessly and i don’t care  nobody knows said the other shaking his head the thing is as you are here it seems to me that things couldn’t have been otherwise they were all arranged when your father went up north in that lighthearted fashion i don’t suppose he thought for a moment that you’d be sitting here today worrying over one of the results of his journey  of course he didn’t exclaimed hartley impatiently how could he look here trimblett when you talk like that i don’t know where i am if my father hadn’t married my mother i suppose he would have married somebody else  my idea is that he couldn’t said the captain obstinately if a thing has got to be it will be and there’s no good worrying about it take a simple example some time you are going to die of a certain disease—you can only die once—and you’re going to be buried in a certain grave—you can only be buried in one grave try and think that in front of you there is that one particular disease told off to kill you at a certain date and in one particular spot of all this earth there is a grave waiting to be dug for you at present we don’t know the date or the disease or the grave but there they are all waiting for you that is fate what is the matter where are you going  home said hartley bitterly as he paused at the door i came round to you for a little help and you go on in a way that makes my flesh creep goodby  wait a bit said the captain detaining him wait a bit let’s see what can be done  he pulled the other back into his seat again and fetching another bottle of beer from the house to stimulate invention sat evolving schemes for his friend’s relief the nature of which reflected more credit upon his ingenuity than his wisdom  but after all he said as hartley made a third attempt to depart what is the good the very steps we take to avoid disaster may be the ones to bring it on while you are round here getting advice from me robert vyner may be availing himself of the opportunity to propose  hartley made no reply he went out and walked’ up and down the garden inspecting it the captain who was no gardener hoped that the expression of his face was due to his opinion of the flowers  you must miss mrs chinnery said hartley at last  no said the captain almost explosively not at all why should i  it can’t be so homelike without her said hartley stooping to pull up a weed or two  just the same said the other emphatically we have a woman in to do the work and it doesn’t make the slightest difference to me—not the slightest  how is truefitt inquired hartley  the captain’s face darkened peter’s all right he said slowly he’s not treated me—quite well he added after a little hesitation  it’s natural he should neglect you a bit as things are said his friend  neglect said the captain bitterly i wish he would neglect me he’s turning out a perfect busybody and he’s getting as artful as they make ’em i never would have believed it of peter never  hartley waited  i met cap’n walsh the other night said trimblett we hadn’t seen each other for years and we went into the golden fleece to have a drink you know what walsh is when he’s ashore and he’s a man that won’t be beaten he had had four tries to get a ’cocktail’ right that he had tasted in new york and while he was superintending the mixing of the fifth i slipped out the others were all right as far as i could judge but that’s walsh all over  well said hartley  i came home and found peter sitting all alone in the dumps continued the captain he has been very down of late and what was worse he had got a bottle of whiskey on the table that’s a fatal thing to begin and partly to keep him company but mainly to prevent him drinking more than was good for him i helped him finish the bottle—there wasn’t much in it  well said hartley again as the captain paused  he got talking about his troubles said the captain slowly you know how things are and like a fool i tried to cheer him up by agreeing with him that mrs chinnery would very likely make things easy for him by marrying again in fact so far as i remember i even helped him to think of the names of one or two likely men he said she’d make anybody as good a wife as a man could wish  so she would said hartley looking at him with sudden interest in fact i have often wondered—  he went on talking like that continued the captain hastily and out of politeness and good feeling i agreed with him what else could i do then—i didn’t take much notice of it because as i said he was drinking whiskey—he—he sort of wondered why—why—  why you didn’t offer to marry her interrupted hartley  the captain nodded it took my breath away he said impressively and i lost my presence of mind instead of speaking out plain i tried to laugh it off—just to spare his feelings—and said i wasn’t worthy of her  what did he say inquired hartley curiously after another long pause  nothing replied the captain not a single word he just gave me a strange look shook my hand hard and went off to bed i’ve been uneasy in my mind ever since i hardly slept a wink last night and peter behaves as though there is some mysterious secret between us what would you do  mr hartley took his friend’s arm and paced thoughtfully up and down the garden  why not marry her he said at last  because i don’t want to said the captain almost violently  you’d be safer at sea then said the other  the ship won’t be ready for sea for weeks yet said captain trimblett dolefully she’s going on a timecharter and before she is taken over she has got to be thoroughly overhauled as fast as they put one thing right something else is found to be wrong  go to london and stay with your children for a bit then said hartley give out that you are only going for a day or two and then don’t turn up till the ship sails  the captain’s face brightened i believe vyner would let me go he replied i could go in a few days’ time at any rate and by the way—joan  eh said hartley  write to your brotherinlaw at highgate and send her there for a time said the captain write and ask him to invite her keep her and young vyner apart before things go too far  i’ll see how things go for a bit said hartley slowly it’s awkward to write and ask for an invitation and where do your ideas of fate come in they come in all the time said the captain with great seriousness very likely my difficulty was made on purpose for us to think of a way of getting you out of yours or it might be joan’s fate to meet somebody in london at her uncle’s and marry him if she goes we might arrange to go up together so that i could look after her  i’ll think it over said his friend holding out his hand i must be going  i’ll come a little way with you said the captain leading the way into the house i don’t suppose peter will be in yet but he might and i’ve had more of him lately than i want  he took up his hat and opening the door followed hartley out into the road the evening was warm and they walked slowly the captain still discoursing on fate and citing various instances of its working which had come under his own observation he mentioned among others the case of a mate of his who found a wife by losing a leg the unfortunate seaman falling an easy victim to the nurse who attended him  he always put it down to the effects of the chloroform concluded the captain but my opinion is it was to be  he paused at hartley’s gate and was just indulging in the usual argument as to whether he should go indoors for a minute or not when a man holding a handkerchief to his bleeding face appeared suddenly round the corner of the house and making a wild dash for the gate nearly overturned the owner  it looks like our milkman said hartley recovering his balance and gazing in astonishment after the swiftly retreating figure i wonder what was the matter with him  he would soon know what was the matter with him if i got hold of him said the wrathful captain  hartley opened the door with his key and the captain still muttering under his breath passed in rosa’s voice raised in expostulation sounded loudly from the kitchen and a man’s voice also raised was heard in response  sounds like my bo’sun said the captain staring as he passed into the front room what’s he doing here  hartley shook his head  seems to be making himself at home said the captain fidgeting he’s as noisy as if he was in his own house  i don’t suppose he knows you are here said his friend mildly  captain trimblett still fidgeted well it’s your house he said at last if you don’t mind that lanky son of a gun making free i suppose it’s no business of mine if he made that noise aboard my ship—  red of face he marched to the window and stood looking out fortified by his presence hartley rang the bell  is there anybody in the kitchen he inquired as rosa answered it i fancied i heard a man’s voice  the milkman was here just now said rosa and eying him calmly departed  the captain swung round in wrathful amazement  by— he spluttered i’ve seen—well—by—brrr——— can i ring for that d——d bo’sun o’ mine  certainly said hartley  the captain crossed to the fireplace and seizing the bellhandle gave a pull that made the kitchen resound with wild music after a decent interval apparently devoted to the allaying of masculine fears rosa appeared again  did you ring sir she inquired gazing at her master  send that bo’sun o’ mine here at once said the captain gruffly  rosa permitted herself a slight expression of surprise bo’sun sir she asked politely  yes  the girl affected to think oh you mean mr walters she said at last  send him here said the captain  rosa retired slowly and shortly afterward something was heard brushing softly against the wall of the passage it ceased for a time and just as the captain’s patience was nearly at an end there was a sharp exclamation and mr walters burst suddenly into the room and looked threateningly over his shoulder at somebody in the passage  what are you doing here demanded captain trimblett loudly  mr walters eyed him uneasily and with his cap firmly gripped in his left hand saluted him with the right then he turned his head sideways toward the passage the captain repeated his question in a voice if anything louder than before  the strained appearance of mr walters’s countenance relaxed  come here for my baccybox wot i left here the other day he said glibly when you sent me  what were you making that infernal row about then demanded the captain  mr walters cast an appealing glance toward the passage and listened acutely i was—grumbling because—i couldn’t—find it he said with painstaking precision  grumbling repeated the captain that ugly voice of yours was enough to bring the ceiling down what was the matter with that man that burst out of the gate as we came in eh  the boatswain’s face took on a wooden expression  he—his nose was bleeding he said at last  i know that said the captain grimly but what made it bleed  for a moment mr walters looked like a man who has been given a riddle too difficult for human solution then his face cleared again  he—he told me—he was object—subject to it he stammered been like it since he was a baby  he shifted his weight to his other foot and shrugged eloquently the shoulder near the passage  what did you do to him demanded the captain in a low stern voice  me sir said mr walters with clumsy surprise me sir i—i—all i done—all i done—was ta put a doorkey down his back  doorkey roared the captain  to—to stop the bleeding sir said mr walters looking at the floor and nervously twisting his cap in his hands it’s a oldfashioned—  that’ll do exclaimed the captain in a choking voice that’ll do i don’t want any more of your lies how dare you come to mr hartley’s house and knock his milkman about eh how dare you what do you mean by it  mr walters fumbled with his cap again i was sitting in the kitchen he said at last sitting in the kitchen—hunting ’igh and low for my baccybox—when this ’ere miserable insulting chap shoves his head in at the door and calls the young lady names  names said the captain frowning and waving an interruption from hartley aside what names  mr walters hesitated again and his brow grew almost as black as the captain’s  ’rosylips’ he said at last and i give ’im such a wipe acrost—  out you go cried the wrathful captain out you go and if i hear your pretty little voice in this house again you’ll remember it i can tell you d’ye hear scoot  mr walters said thank you and retiring with an air of great deference closed the door softly behind him  there’s another of them said captain trimblett subsiding into a chair and from little things i had heard here and there i thought he regarded women as poison fate again i suppose he was made to regard them as poison all these years for the sake of being caught by that towheaded wench in your kitchen     chapter xii     by no means insensible to the difficulties in the way joan hartley had given no encouragement to mr robert vyner to follow up the advantage afforded him by her admission at the breakfasttable her father’s uneasiness coupled with the broad hints which captain trimblett mistook for tactfulness only confirmed her in her resolution and mr vyner in his calmer moments had to admit to himself that she was right—for the present at any rate meantime they were both young and with the confidence of youth he looked forward to a future in which his father’s wellknown views on social distinctions and fitting matrimonial alliances should have undergone a complete change as to his mother she merely seconded his father’s opinions and with admiration born of love and her marriage vows filed them for reference in a memory which had on more than one occasion been a source of great embarrassment to a man who had not lived for over fifty years without changing some of them  deeply conscious of his own moderation it was therefore with a sense of annoyance that mr robert vyner discovered that captain trimblett was actually attempting to tackle him upon the subject which he considered least suitable for discussion they were sitting in his office and the captain in pursuance of a promise to hartley after two or three references to the weather and a long account of an uninteresting conversation with a policeman began to get on to dangerous ground  i’ve been in the firm’s service a good many years now he began  i hope you’ll be in as many more said vyner regarding him almost affectionately  hartley has been with you a long time too continued trimblett slowly we became chums the first time we met and we’ve been friends ever since not just fairweather friends but close and hearty else i wouldn’t venture to speak to you as i’m going to speak  mr vyner looked up at him suddenly his face hard and forbidding then as he saw the embarrassment in the kindly old face before him his anger vanished and he bent his head to hide a smile  fire away he said cordially  i’m an old man began the captain solemnly  nonsense interrupted robert breezily old man indeed a man is as old as he feels and i saw you the other night outside the golden fleece with captain walsh—  i couldn’t get away from him said the captain hastily  so far as i could see you were not trying continued the remorseless robert you were instructing him in the more difficult and subtle movements of a hornpipe and i must say i thought your elasticity was wonderful—wonderful  it was just the result of an argument i had with him said the captain looking very confused and i ought to have known better but as i was saying i am an old man and—  but you look so young protested mr vyner  old man repeated the captain ignoring the remark old age has its privileges and one of them is to give a word in season before it is too late  ’a stitch in time saves nine quoted robert with an encouraging nod  and i was speaking to hartley the other day continued the captain he hasn’t been looking very well of late and as far as i can make out he is a little bit worried over the matter i want to speak to you about  robert vyner’s face hardened again for a moment he leaned back in his chair and playing with his watchchain regarded the other intently then he smiled maliciously  he told me he said nodding  told you repeated the captain in astonishment  mr vyner nodded again and bending down pretended to glance at some papers on his table  greenfly he said gravely he told me that he syringes early and late he will clear a tree as he thinks and while he has gone to mix another bucket of the stuff there are several generations born bassett informs me that a greenfly is a grandfather before it is half an hour old so you see it is hopeless quite  captain trimblett listened with illconcealed impatience i was thinking of something more important than greenflies he said emphatically  yes said vyner thoughtfully  it was evident that the old sailor was impervious to hints rendered unscrupulous by the other’s interference and at the same time unwilling to hurt his feelings mr vyner bethought himself of a tale to which he had turned an unbelieving ear only an hour or two before  of course i quite forgot he said apologetically how stupid of me i hope that you’ll accept my warmest congratulations and be very very happy i can’t tell you how pleased i am but for the life of me i can’t see why it should worry hartley  congratulations said the captain eying him in surprise what about  your marriage replied robert i only heard of it on my way to the office and your talking put it out of my head  me said captain trimblett going purple with suppressed emotion my marriage i’m not going to be married not at all  what do you mean by ’not at all inquired mr vyner looking puzzled it isn’t a thing you can do by halves  i’m not going to be married at all said the captain raising his voice i never thought of such a thing who—who told you  a little bird said robert with a simpering air  captain trimblett took out a handkerchief and after blowing his nose violently and wiping his heated face expressed an overpowering desire to wring the little bird’s neck  who was it he repeated  a little bird of the name of sellers—captain sellers replied robert i met him on my way here hopping about in the street simply brimming over with the news  there isn’t a word of truth in it said the agitated captain i never thought of such a thing that old mischiefmaking mummy must be mad—stark starin’ mad  dear me said robert regretfully he seems such a dear old chap and i thought it was so nice to see a man of his age so keenly interested in the loveaffairs of a younger generation anybody might have thought you were his own son from the way he talked of you  i’ll ’son’ him said the unhappy captain vaguely  he is very deaf said robert gently and perhaps he may have misunderstood somebody perhaps somebody told him you were not going to be married funny he shouts so isn’t it most deaf people speak in a very low voice  did he shout that inquired captain trimblett in a quivering voice  bawled it replied mr vyner cheerfully but as it isn’t true i really think that you ought to go and tell captain sellers at once there is no knowing what hopes he may be raising he is a fine old man but perhaps after all he is a wee bit talkative  captain trimblett who had risen stood waiting impatiently until the other had finished and then forgetting all about the errand that had brought him there departed in haste mr vyner went to the window and a broad smile lit up his face as he watched the captain hurrying across the bridge with a blessing on the head of the most notorious old gossip in salthaven he returned to his work  possessed by a single idea captain trimblett sped on his way at a pace against which both his age and his figure protested in vain by the time he reached tranquil vale he was breathless and hardly able to gasp his inquiry for captain sellers to the old housekeeper who attended the door  he’s asitting in the garden looking at his flowers she replied will you go through  captain trimblett went through his head was erect and his face and eyes blazing a little old gentleman endowed with the far sight peculiar to men who have followed the sea who was sitting in a deckchair at the bottom of the garden glimpsed him and at once collapsed by the time the captain reached the chair he discovered a weaselfaced shrunken old figure in a snuffcoloured suit of clothes sunk in a profound slumber he took him by the arms and shook him roughly  yes halloa what’s matter inquired captain sellers half waking  captain trimblett arched his hand over his mouth and bent to an ear apparently made of yellow parchment  cap’n sellers he said in a stern thrilling voice i’ve got a bone to pick with you  the old man opened his eyes wide and sat blinking at him i’ve been asleep he said with a senile chuckle how do cap’n trimblett  i’ve got a bone to pick with you repeated the other  eh said captain sellers putting his hand to his ear  a—bone—to—pick—with—you said the incensed trimblett raising his voice what do you mean by it  eh said captain sellers freshly  what do you mean by saying things about me bawled trimblett how dare you go spreading false reports about me i’ll have the law of you  captain sellers smiled vaguely and shook his head  i’ll prosecute you bellowed captain trimblett you’re shamming you old fox you can hear what i say plain enough you’ve been spreading reports that i’m going to—  he stopped and looked round just in time attracted by the volume of his voice the housekeeper had come to the back door two faces appeared at the nextdoor windows and the back of mr peter truefitt was just disappearing inside his summerhouse  i know you are talking said captain sellers plaintively because i can see your lips moving it’s a great affliction—deafness  he fell back in his chair again and with a crafty old eye cocked on the windows next door fingered a scanty tuft of white hair on his chin and smiled weakly captain trimblett controlled himself by an effort and selecting a piece of paper from a bundle of letters in his pocket made signs for a pencil captain sellers shook his head then he glanced round uneasily as trimblett with an exclamation of satisfaction found an inch in his waistcoatpocket and began to write he nodded sternly at the paper when he had finished and handed it to captain sellers  the old gentleman received it with a pleasant smile and extricating himself from his chair in a remarkable fashion considering his age began to fumble in his pockets he went through them twice and his countenance now lighted by hope and now darkened by despair conveyed to captain trimblett as accurately as speech could have done the feelings of a man to whom all reading matter without his spectacles is mere dross  i can’t find my glasses said captain sellers at last lowering himself into the chair then he put his hand to his ear and turned toward his visitor try again he said encouragingly  captain trimblett eyed him for a moment in helpless wrath and then turning on his heel marched back through the house and after standing irresolute for a second or two entered his own the front room was empty and from the silence he gathered that mrs chinnery was out he filled his pipe and throwing himself into an easychair sought to calm his nerves with tobacco while he tried to think out his position his meditations were interrupted by the entrance of mr truefitt and something in the furtive way that gentleman eyed him as he came into the room only served to increase his uneasiness  very warm said truefitt  the captain assented and with his eyes fixed on the mantelpiece smoked in silence  i saw you talking to captain sellers just now said mr truefitt after a long pause  aye said the captain you did  his eyes came from the mantelpiece and fixed themselves on those of his friend mr truefitt in a flurried fashion struck a match and applied it to his empty pipe  i’ll have the law of him said the captain fiercely he has been spreading false reports about me  reports repeated mr truefitt in a husky voice  he has been telling everybody that i am about to be married thundered the captain  mr truefitt scratched the little bit of gray whisker that grew by his ear  i told him he said at last  you exclaimed the amazed captain but it isn’t true  mr truefitt turned to him with a smile intended to be arch and reassuring the result owing to his nervousness was so hideous that the captain drew back in dismay  it’s—it’s all right said mr truefitt at last ah if it hadn’t been for me you might have gone on hoping for years and years without knowing the true state of her feelings toward you  what do you mean demanded the captain gripping the arms of his chair  sellers is a little bit premature said mr truefitt coughing there is nothing settled yet of course i told him so perhaps i oughtn’t to have mentioned it at all just yet but i was so pleased to find that it was all right i had to tell somebody  what are you—talking about gasped the captain  mr truefitt looked up and by a strong effort managed to meet the burning gaze before him  i told susanna he said with a gulp  told her told her what roared the captain  told her that you said you were not worthy of her replied mr truefitt very slowly and distinctly  the captain took his pipe out of his mouth and laying it on the table with extreme care listened mechanically while the clock struck five  what did she say he inquired hoarsely after the clock had finished  mr truefitt leaned over and with a trembling hand patted him on the shoulder  she said ’nonsense’ he replied softly  the captain rose and putting on his cap—mostly over one eye—put out his hands like a blind man for the door and blundered out into the street     chapter xiii     mr vyner wants to see you sir said bassett as hartley coming in from a visit to the harbour hung his hat on a peg and began to change into the old coat he wore in the office mr john he has rung three times  the chief clerk changed his coat again and after adjusting his hair in the little piece of unframed glass which he had bought in the street for a penny thirty years before hastened to the senior partner’s room  mr vyner who was rinsing his hands in a little office washstand that stood in the corner looked round at his entrance and after carefully drying his hands on a soft towel seated himself at his big writing table and leaning back sat thoughtfully regarding his fingernails his large white freckled hands were redolent of scented soap and together with his too regular teeth his bald head and white sidewhiskers gave him an appearance of almost aggressive cleanliness  i rang for you several times he said looking up with a frown  i have just come back from wilson’s said hartley you told me to see them today  mr vyner said yes and caressing his shaven chin in his hand appeared to forget the other’s existence  how long have you been with us he inquired at last  thirtyfive years sir said hartley studying his face with sudden anxiety  a long time said the senior partner dryly a long time  a pleasant time sir ventured the other in a low voice  mr vyner’s features relaxed and took on—after some trouble—an appearance of benevolence  i hope so he said in patronizing tones i hope so vyner and son have the name for being good masters i have never heard any complaints  he pushed his chair back and throwing one leg over the other looked down at his patentleather boots the benevolent expression had disappeared  thirtyfive years he said slowly h’m i had no idea it was so long you have—ha—no family worth mentioning  one daughter said hartley his lips going suddenly dry  just so just so said the senior partner he looked at his boots again and she is old enough to earn her own living or she might marry you are in a fortunate position  hartley still watching him anxiously bowed  in the event for instance continued mr vyner in careless tones— in the event of your retiring from the service of vyner and son there is nobody that would suffer much that is a great consideration—a very great consideration  hartley unable to speak bowed again  change continued mr vyner with the air of one uttering a new but indisputable fact—change is good for us all so long as you retain your present position there is of course a little stagnation in the office the juniors see their way barred  he took up a paperknife and balancing it between his fingers tapped lightly with it on the table  is your daughter likely to be married soon he inquired looking up suddenly  hartley shook his head nno i don’t think so he said thickly  the senior partner resumed his tapping  that is a pity he said at last with a frown of course you understand that vyner and son are not anxious to dispense with your services—not at all in certain circumstances you might remain with us another ten or fifteen years and then go with a good retiring allowance at your present age there would be no allowance do you understand me  the chief clerk tried to summon a little courage little dignity  i am afraid i don’t he said in a low voice it is all so sudden i—i am rather bewildered mr vyner looked at him impatiently  he leaned back in his chair and watched his chief clerk closely  i said just now he continued in a hard voice that vyner and son are not anxious to dispense with your services that is in a way a figure of speech mr robert knows nothing of this and i may tell you—as an old and trusted servant of the firm—that his share as a partner is at present but nominal and were he to do anything seriously opposed to my wishes such as for instance—such as a—ha—matrimonial alliance of which i could not approve the results for him would be disastrous do you understand  in a slow troubled fashion hartley intimated that he did he began to enter into explanations and was stopped by the senior partner’s uplifted hand  that will do said the latter stiffly i have no doubt i know all that you could tell me it is—ha—only out of consideration for your long and faithful service that i have—ha—permitted you a glimpse into my affairs—our affairs i hope now that i have made myself quite clear  he leaned back in his chair and twisting the paperknife idly between his fingers watched his chief clerk closely  wouldn’t it be advisable— began hartley and stopped abruptly at the expression on the other’s face i was thinking that if you mentioned this to mr robert—  certainly not said mr vyner with great sharpness certainly not  anger at having to explain affairs to his clerk and the task of selecting words which should cause the least loss of dignity almost deprived him of utterance  this is a private matter he said at last strictly between ourselves i am master here and any alteration in the staff is a matter for myself alone i do not wish—in fact i forbid you to mention the matter to him unfortunately we do not always see eye to eye he is young and perhaps hardly as worldly wise as i could wish  he leaned forward to replace the paperknife on the table and after blowing his nose with some emphasis put the handkerchief back in his pocket and sat listening with a judicial air for anything that his chief clerk might wish to put before him  it would be a great blow to me to leave the firm said hartley after two ineffectual attempts to speak i have been in it all my life—all my life at my age i could scarcely hope to get any other employment worth having i have always tried to do my best i have never—  yes yes said the other interrupting with a wave of his hand that has been recognized your remuneration has i believe been in accordance with your—ha—services and i suppose you have made some provision  hartley shook his head very little he said slowly my wife was ill for years before she died and i have had other expenses my life is insured so that in case of anything happening to me there would be something for my daughter but that is about all  and in case of dismissal said the senior partner with some cheerfulness the insurance premium would of course only be an extra responsibility it is your business of course but if i were—ha—in your place i should—ha—marry my daughter off as soon as possible if you could come to me in three months and tell me—  he broke off abruptly and sitting upright eyed his clerk steadily  that is all i think he said at last oh no mention of this of course in the office—i have no desire to raise hopes of promotion in the staff that may not be justified i may say that i hope will not be justified  he drew his chair to the table and with a nod of dismissal took up his pen hartley went back to his work with his head in a whirl and for the first time in twenty years cast a column of figures incorrectly thereby putting a great strain on the diplomacy of the junior who made the discovery  he left at his usual hour and free from the bustle of the office tried to realize the full meaning of his interview with mr vyner he thought of his pleasant house and garden and the absence of demand in salthaven for dismissed clerks of over fifty his thoughts turned to london but he had grown up with vyner and son and had but little to sell in the open market walking with bent head he cannoned against a passerby and looking up to apologize caught sight of captain trimblett across the way standing in front of a jeweller’s window  a tall sinewy man in a serge suit whom hartley recognized as captain walsh was standing by him his attitude was that of an indulgent policeman with a refractory prisoner and twice hartley saw him lay hold of the captain by the coatsleeve and call his attention to something in the window anxious to discuss his affairs with trimblett hartley crossed the road  ah here’s hartley said the tall captain with an air of relief as captain trimblett turned and revealed a hot face mottled and streaked with red make him listen to reason he won’t do it for me  what’s the matter inquired hartley listlessly  a friend o’ mine said captain walsh favouring him with a hideous wink a great friend o’ mine is going to be married and i want to give him a wedding present before i go i sail tomorrow  well ask him what he’d like said trimblett making another ineffectual attempt to escape don’t bother me  i can’t do that said walsh with another wink it’s awkward besides which his modesty would probably make him swear that he wasn’t going to be married at all in fact he has told me that already i want you to choose for him tell me what you’d like and no doubt it’ll please him what do you say to that cruetstand  d———m the cruetstand said trimblett wiping his hot face  all right said the unmoved walsh with his arm firmly linked in that of his friend what about a toastrack that one  i don’t believe in weddingpresents said trimblett thickly never did i think it’s an absurd custom and if your friend says he isn’t going to be married surely he ought to know  shyness rejoined captain walsh—pure shyness he’s one of the best i know his idea his idea is to be married on the quiet and without any fuss but it isn’t coming off no sir now suppose it was you—don’t be violent i only said suppose—how would that picklejar strike you  i know nothing about it said captain trimblett raising his voice besides i can’t take the responsibility of choosing for another man i told you so before  captain walsh paid no heed his glance roved over the contents of the window  trimblett’s a terror he said in a serene voice turning to hartley i don’t know what it’s like walking down the high street looking into shopwindows with a fretful porcupine but i can make a pretty good guess  you should leave me alone then said trimblett wrenching his arm free weddingpresents have no interest for me  that’s what he keeps saying said walsh turning to hartley again and when i referred just now—in the most delicate manner—to love’s young dream i thought he’d ha’ bust his boilers  as far as hartley could see captain trimblett was again within measurable distance of such a catastrophe for a moment he struggled wildly for speech and then coming to the conclusion that nothing he could say would do him any good he swung on his heel and walked off hartley with a nod to walsh followed  that idiot has been pestering me for the last halfhour said captain trimblett after walking for some distance in wrathful silence i wonder whether it would be brought in murder if i wrung old sellers’s neck i’ve had four people this morning come up and talk to me about getting married at least they started talking  turn a deaf ear said hartley  deaf ear repeated the captain i wish i could the last few days i’ve been wishing that i hadn’t got ears it’s all truefitt’s doing he’s hinting now that i’m too bashful to speak up and that weakheaded cecilia willett believes him if you could only see her fussing round and trying to make things easy for me as she considers you’d wonder i don’t go crazy  we’ve all got our troubles said hartley shaking his head  the indignantcaptain turned and regarded him fiercely  i am likely to leave vyner and son said the other slowly after thirtyfive years  the wrath died out of the captain’s face and he regarded his old friend with looks of affectionate concern in grim silence he listened to an account of the interview with mr vyner  you know what it all means he said savagely as hartley finished  i—i think so was the reply  it means said the captain biting his words—it means that unless joan is married within three months so as to be out of robert vyner’s way you will be dismissed the firm it saves the old man’s pride a bit putting it that way and it’s safer too and if robert vyner marries her he will have to earn his own living with luck he might get thirty shillings a week  i know said the other  get her to town as soon as possible continued the captain impressively he paused a moment and added with some feeling that’s what i’m going to do i spoke to mr vyner about it today we will go up together and i’ll look after her  i’ll write tonight said hartley not that it will make any difference so far as i can see  it’s a step in the right direction at any rate retorted the captain it keeps her out of young vyner’s way and it shows john vyner that you are doing your best to meet his views and it might make him realize that you have got a little pride too  partly to cheer hartley up and partly to avoid returning to tranquil vale he spent the evening with him and being deterred by the presence of miss hartley from expressing his opinion of john vyner indulged instead in a violent tirade against the tyranny of wealth lured on by the highly interested joan he went still further and in impassioned words committed himself to the statement that all men were equal and should have equal rights only hesitating when he discovered that she had been an unwilling listener on an occasion when he had pointed out to an offending seaman certain blemishes in his family tree he then changed the subject to the baneful practice of eavesdropping  by the time he reached home it was quite late there was no moon but the heavens were bright with stars he stood outside for a few moments listening to the sound of voices within and then moved perhaps by the quiet beauty of the night strolled down to the river and stood watching the lights of passing craft midnight sounded in the distance as he walked back  the lamp was still burning but the room was empty he closed the door softly behind him and stood eying with some uneasiness a large and untidy brownpaper parcel that stood in the centre of the table from the crumpled appearance of the paper and the clumsily tied knots it had the appearance of having been opened and fastened up again by unskilled hands the sense of uneasiness deepened as he approached the table and stood with his head on one side looking at it  he turned at the sound of a light shuffling step in the kitchen the door opened gently and the head of mr truefitt was slowly inserted glimpses of a shirt and trousers and the rumpled condition of the intruder’s hair suggested that he had newly risen from bed  i heard you come in he said in a stealthy whisper  yes said the captain  there was no address on it said mr truefitt indicating the parcel by a nod it was left by somebody while we were out and on opening it we found it was for you at least partly i thought i ought to tell you  it don’t matter said the captain with an effort  mr truefitt nodded again i only wanted to explain how it was he said goodnight  he closed the door behind him and the captain after eying the parcel for some time drew a claspknife from his pocket and with trembling fingers cut the string and stripped off the paper the glistening metal of the largest electroplated saladbowl he had ever seen met his horrified gaze in a hypnotized fashion he took out the fork and spoon and balanced them in his fingers a small card at the bottom of the bowl caught his eye and he bent over and read it—  with hearty congratulations and best wishes to captain and mrs trimblett from captain michael walsh  for a long time he stood motionless then crumpling the card up and placing it in his pocket he took the bowl in his arms and bore it to his bedroom wrapped again in its coverings it was left to languish on the top of the cupboard behind a carefully constructed rampart of old cardboard boxes and wornout books     chapter xiv     mr hartley’s idea warmly approved by captain trimblett was to divulge the state of affairs to his daughter in much the same circuitous fashion that mr vyner had revealed it to him he had not taken into account however the difference in temper of the listeners and one or two leading questions from joan brought the matter to an abrupt conclusion she sat divided between wrath and dismay  you—you must have misunderstood him she said at last with a little gasp he could not be so mean and tyrannical and ridiculous  her father shook his head there is no room for misunderstanding he said quietly still i have got three months to look about me and i don’t suppose we shall starve  miss hartley expressed the wish—as old as woman—to give the offender a piece of her mind she also indulged in a few general remarks concerning the obtuseness of people who were unable to see when they were not wanted by which her father understood her to refer to vyner junior  i was afraid you cared for him he said awkwardly  i exclaimed joan in the voice of one unable to believe her ears oh father i am surprised at you i never thought you would say such a thing  mr hartley eyed her uneasily  why should you think anything so absurd continued his daughter with some severity  mr hartley with much concern began to cite a long list of things responsible for what he freely admitted was an unfortunate mistake on his part his daughter listened with growing impatience and confusion and as he showed no signs of nearing the end rose in a dignified fashion and quitted the room she was back however in a minute or two and putting her arm on his shoulder bent down and kissed him  i had no idea you were so observant she remarked softly  i don’t think i am really said the conscientious man if it hadn’t been for trimblett—  miss hartley interrupting with spirit paid a tribute to the captain that ought to have made his ears burn  i ought to have been more careful all these years said her father presently if i had this would not have mattered so much prodigality never pays—  joan placed her arm about his neck again prodigality she said with a choking laugh you don’t know the meaning of the word and you have had to help other people all your life after all perhaps you and captain trimblett are wrong mr vyner can’t be in earnest it is too absurd  yes he is said hartley sitting up with a sudden air of determination but then so am i i am not going to be dictated to in this fashion my private affairs are nothing to do with him i—i shall have to tell him so  don’t do anything yet said joan softly as she resumed her seat by the way—  well said her father after a pause  that invitation from uncle william was your doing continued joan levelling an incriminating finger at him  trimblett’s idea said her father anxious to give credit where it was due his idea was that if you were to go away for a time robert vyner would very likely forget all about you  i’m not afraid of that said joan with a slight smile i mean—i mean—what business has captain trimblett to concern himself about my affairs  i know what you mean said hartley in a low voice  he got up and crossing to the window stood looking out on his beloved garden his thoughts went back to the time over twenty years ago when he and his young wife had planted it he remembered that in those faroff days she had looked forward with confidence to the time when he would be offered a share in the firm for a moment he felt almost glad——  i suppose that captain trimblett is right said joan who had been watching him closely and i’ll go when you like  her father came from the window yes he said and stood looking at her  i am going out a little way said joan suddenly  hartley started and glanced instinctively at the clock yes he said again  his daughter went upstairs to dress and did her best to work up a little resentment against being turned out of her home to avoid a caller whom she told herself repeatedly she had no wish to see her reflections were cut short by remembering that time was passing and that mr vyner’s punctuality in the matter of these calls was of a nature to which the office was a stranger  she put on her hat and running downstairs opened the door and went out at the gate she paused and glancing right and left saw robert vyner approaching he bowed and quickened his pace  father is indoors she said with a friendly smile as she shook hands  it’s a sin to be indoors an evening like this said robert readily are you going for a walk  a little way i am going to see a friend said joan goodby  goodby said mr vyner and turned in at the gate while joan a little surprised at his docility proceeded on her way she walked slowly trying in the interests of truth to think of some acquaintance to call upon then she heard footsteps behind gradually gaining upon her  i really think i’m the most forgetful man in salthaven said mr robert vyner in tones of grave annoyance as he ranged alongside i came all this way to show your father a book on dahlias and now i find i’ve left it at the office what’s a good thing for a bad memory  punish yourself by running all the way i should think replied joan it might make you less forgetful next time  mr vyner became thoughtful not to say grave i don’t know so much about running he said slowly i’ve had an idea for some time past that my heart is a little bit affected  joan turned to him swiftly i’m so sorry she faltered i had no idea and the other night you were rolling the grass why didn’t you speak of it before  her anxiety was so genuine that mr vyner had the grace to feel a little bit ashamed of himself  when i say that my heart is affected i don’t mean in the way of—of disease he murmured  is it weak inquired the girl  mr vyner shook his head  well what is the matter with it  mr vyner sighed i don’t know he said slowly it is not of long standing i only noticed it a little while ago the first time i had an attack i was sitting in my office—working let me see i think it was the day you came in there to see your father yes i am sure it was  miss hartley walked on looking straight before her  since then pursued mr vyner in the mournful tones suited to the subject it has got gradually worse sometimes it is in my mouth sometimes—if i feel that i have offended anybody—it is in my boots  miss hartley paid no heed  it is in my boots now said the invalid plaintively tight boots too do you know what i was thinking just now when you looked at me in that alarmed compassionate way  not alarmed muttered miss hartley  i was thinking pursued mr vyner in a rapt voice i was thinking what a fine nurse you would make talking of heart troubles put it in my mind i suppose fancy being down for a month or two with a complaint that didn’t hurt or take one’s appetite away and having you for a nurse  i think that if you are going to talk nonsense— began joan half stopping  i’m not said the other in alarm i’ve quite finished i have indeed  he stole a glance at the prim young figure by his side and his voice again developed a plaintive note if you only knew what it was like he continued to be mewed up in an office all day with not a soul to speak to and the sun shining perhaps you’d make allowances  i saw you down by the harbour this morning said the girl  harbour said the other pretending to reflect—this morning  joan nodded yes you were lounging about—in the sunshine—smoking a cigarette then you went on to the indian chief and stood talking for oh quite a long time to captain trimblett then—  yes breathed mr vyner as she paused in sudden confusion what did i do next  miss hartley shook her head i only saw you for a moment she said  mr vyner did not press the matter he talked instead on other subjects but there was a tenderness in his voice for which miss hartley told herself her own thoughtlessness was largely responsible she trembled and walked a little faster then with a sense of relief she saw captain trimblett approaching them his head was bent in thought and his usual smile was missing as he looked up and saw them  i wanted to see you he said to joan i’m off to london tomorrow  tomorrow repeated the girl in surprise  twelvethirty train said the captain looking shrewdly from one to the other i’m just off home there are one or two matters i must attend to before i go and i wanted to talk to you  i will come with you said joan quickly i haven’t seen mrs chinnery for a long time she nodded to mr vyner and held out her hand goodby  goodby said that gentleman he shook hands reluctantly and his amiable features took on a new expression as he glanced at the captain  try and cheer him up he said with an air of false concern it’s only for a little while cap’n you’ll soon be back and—you know the old adage  yes said the captain guardedly  although of course there are several said mr vyner thoughtfully i wonder whether we were thinking of the same one  i dare say said the other hastily  i was thinking of ’absence makes the heart grow fonder’—of the indian chief said the ingenuous robert was that the one you were thinking of  the captain’s reply was inaudible as he turned and bore off miss hartley the young man stood for some time watching them and as joan and her burly companion disappeared round the corner shook his head and set off home  he’ll sober down as he gets older said the captain after they had proceeded some way in silence i’m glad i met you your father told me you were going to london and i was thinking we might go up together it’s odd we should both be going quite a coincidence  in more ways than one said joan father told me you had arranged it together i quite know why i am going  the captain coughed  i know why you are going too said joan  the captain coughed again and muttered something about children and business  and if i’m going tomorrow i had better get back and pack continued the girl  plenty of time in the morning said the captain it’ll make the time pass it’s a mistake to stow your things away too soon—a great mistake  i would sooner do it though said joan pausing 170  you come along to tranquil vale said captain trimblett with forced joviality never mind about your packing stay to supper and i’ll see you home afterward  miss hartley eyed him thoughtfully  why she inquired  pleasure of your company said the captain  why said miss hartley again  the captain eyed her thoughtfully in his turn  i—i haven’t told ’em i’m going yet he said slowly it’ll be a little surprise to them perhaps miss willett will be there she’s a silly thing she and peter might make a duet about it if you are there——  i’ll take care of you said joan with a benevolent smile you’ll be safe with me what a pity you didn’t bring your little troubles to me at first  the captain turned a lurid eye upon her and then realizing that silence was more dignified and certainly safer than speech said nothing he walked on with head erect and turned a deaf ear to the faint sounds which miss hartley was endeavouring to convert into coughs  mrs chinnery who was sitting alone in the front room rose and greeted her with some warmth as she entered and the usual reproachful question put and answered as to the length of time since her last visit took her hat from her and went upstairs with it an arch smile from miss hartley during her absence was met by the ungrateful captain with a stony stare  i came to bid you goodby said joan as mrs chinnery returned i am off to london tomorrow  london said mrs chinnery  i am going to stay with an uncle replied joan  quite a coincidence isn’t it said the captain averting his gaze from the smiling face of miss hartley and trying to keep his voice level  coincidence said mrs chinnery staring at him  i’ve got to go too said the captain with what he fondly imagined was a casual smile got to run up and see my boys and girls just a flying visit there and back so we are going together  you said the astonished mrs chinnery why didn’t you tell me why i’ve got nothing ready serves me right for putting things off  the captain began to murmur something about an urgent letter but mrs chinnery who had opened the cupboard and brought out a workbasket containing several pairs of the thick woollen socks that formed the captain’s usual wear was almost too busy to listen she threaded a needle and drawing a sock over her left hand set to work on a gaping wound that most women would have regarded as mortal  mr truefitt and mrs willett entered from the garden just as the captain was explaining for the third time  children are not ill i hope said mr truefitt with ill concealed anxiety  no said the captain  mrs willett had seated herself by the side of mrs chinnery ventured to pat that lady’s busy hand  he will soon be back she murmured  he will look after that said mr truefitt with a boisterous laugh won’t you cap’n  miss willett sat regarding captain trimblett with a pensive air she was beginning to regard his diffidence and shyness as something abnormal hints of the most helpful nature only seemed to add to his discomfort and she began to doubt whether he would ever muster up sufficient resolution to put an end to a situation that was fast becoming embarrassing to all concerned  of course she said suddenly it is only right that you should run up and see your children first i hadn’t thought of that  first repeated the captain his face flooding with colour as he realized the inward meaning of the remark what do you mean by first  his voice was so loud that miss willett sat up with a start and looked round nervously  miss willett means before you sail said joan gently before that lady could speak how pleased they will be to see you  aye aye said the captain regaining his composure by an effort  what a lot of things he will have to tell them murmured the persevering miss willett have you ever seen them she inquired turning to mrs chinnery  no was the reply  how strange said miss willett with a reproachful glance at the captain i expect you’ll like them very much when you do  sure to chimed in mr truefitt susanna was always partial to children  i’m sure she is said miss willett regarding the industrious mrs chinnery affectionately how fortunate  she rose as she spoke and screwing her face up at joan with great significance asked her whether she wouldn’t care to see the garden  very much said joan come along she added turning to the captain now come and show me that rosebush you have been talking about so much  captain trimblett rose with an alacrity that mystified miss willett more than ever and having gained the garden found so many things to show miss hartley and so much to talk about that supper was on the table before he had finished fearful of being left alone with miss willett he stuck to his young protector so closely that in going in at the door he trod on her heel miss hartley entered the room limping and having gained her seat sat eying him with an expression in which pain and reproachful mirth struggled for the mastery  what a delightful evening she said in an affected voice as the captain walked home with her about an hour later i have enjoyed myself tremendously  the captain uttered an impatient exclamation  it reminded me of the old fable of the lion and the mouse continued joan  the captain grunted again and in a voice that he vainly endeavoured to render polite said that he did not know what she was talking about     chapter xv     mr robert vyner received the news of miss hartley’s sudden departure with an air of polite interest the secrecy of the affair and the fact that she had gone with captain trimblett convinced him that it was no casual visit and he mused bitterly on the strange tendency of seafaring people to meddle with the affairs of others an attempt to ascertain from hartley the probable duration of her visit and other interesting particulars as they sat together in the young man’s office yielded no satisfaction  she made up her mind to go rather suddenly didn’t she he inquired  hartley said yes and murmured something about taking advantage of the opportunity of going up with captain trimblett she is very fond of the captain he added  is she staying near him asked vyner without looking up from his work  the chief clerk who was anxious to get away said no and eyed him uneasily  i hope that london will agree with her continued robert politely is she staying in a healthy part  very said the other  mr vyner bent over his work again and scowled diabolically at an innocent letter which said that his instructions should have immediate attention which do you consider a healthy part he said presently  mr hartley after some reflection said there were many districts which merited that description he mentioned eleven and was discoursing somewhat learnedly on drainage and soils when he noticed that the young man’s attention was wandering with a muttered reference to his work he rose and quitted the room  day succeeded day in tiresome waiting and mr robert vyner leaning back in his chair regarded with a hostile eye the pile of work that accumulated on his table as he sat dreaming of joan hartley in a species of waking nightmare he would see her beset by hordes of respectful but persistent admirers he manifested a craving for mr hartley’s society and discovering by actual experience that melancholy as the house was without its mistress all other places were more melancholy still contrived to its owner’s great discomfort to spend a considerable number of his evenings there  he’s a pattern to all of you said rosa to mr walters who sat in the kitchen one evening cautiously watching mr vyner through a small hole in the muslin blind  mr walters grunted  i believe he worships the ground she treads on said rosa in exalted tones  mr walters grunted again and her colour rose for nearly a fortnight she had not spoken to any other man—at least to the boatswain’s knowledge—and she fully realized the cloying effect of security upon a man of his temperament  last night i saw him standing for half an hour looking into a shop she said softly what shop do you think it was  mr walters’s face took on an obstinate expression butcher’s he hazarded at last  butcher’s repeated rosa with scorn what should he want to look in a butcher’s for it was hickman’s the jeweller’s  the boatswain said oh and devoted himself with renewed interest to his task of watching mr vyner miss jelks’s conversation for some time past had circled round engagementrings a subject which brought him face to face with the disagreeable side of flirtation  more fool him he said without looking round  rosa gazed fixedly at the back of his head she was far too sensible not to have noticed the gradual waning of his passion and she chided herself severely for having dropped her usual tactics at the same time she realized that she was not alone to blame in the matter the gilded youth of salthaven after one or two encounters with mr walters having come to the conclusion that a flirtation with her was a temptation to be avoided  most men are fools she said calmly a young fellow i met the other evening—the night you couldn’t come out—went on like a madman just because i wouldn’t promise to meet him again  pity i didn’t see ’im said mr walters grimly  oh said rosa losing her head why  i’d ha’ give ’im something to make a fuss about said the boatswain that’s all  it’s not his fault said rosa softly he couldn’t help himself he told me so quite the gentleman—quite you ought to see the way he raises his hat and his head is covered all over with little short curls  like a nigger said mr walters with disappointing calmness  he removed his eye from the window and taking out his pipe began to fill it from a small metal box rosa compressing her lips watched him with a sardonic smile  got anything to do this evening she inquired  no said the other  well i have said rosa with a bright smile so i’ll say goodevening  mr walters rose and replacing a box of matches in his pocket stood watching her with his mouth open  don’t hurry she said at last  the boatswain sat down again  i mean when you get outside explained the girl  mr walters gazed at her in slow perplexity and then breathing heavily walked out of the kitchen like a man in a dream his suspicions were aroused and with an idea that a little bloodletting would give him relief he wasted the entire evening lying in wait for a goodlooking gentlemanly young man with curly hair  miss jelks waited for his appearance the following evening in vain several evenings passed but no boatswain and it became apparent at last that he had realized the perils of his position anger at his defection was mingled with admiration for his strength of mind every time she looked in the glass  she forged her weapons slowly a new hat was ready but a skirt and coat still languished at the dressmaker’s she waited until they came home and then dressing her hair in a style which owed something to a fashionpaper and something to her lack of skill sallied out to put matters on a more satisfactory footing  it was early evening and the street fairly full but for some time she wandered about aimlessly twice she smiled at young men of her acquaintance and they smiled back and went on their way the third she met with a smile so inviting that against his better sense he stopped and after a nervous glance round made a remark about the weather  beautiful said rosa have you been ill mr filer  ill said the young man staring no why  haven’t seen you for such a long time said miss jelks swinging her parasol i’ve been wondering what had become of you i was afraid you were ill  mr filer caressed his moustache i haven’t seen you about he retorted  i haven’t been out lately said the girl it’s so lonely walking about by yourself that i’d sooner sit indoors and mope  mr filer stood blinking thoughtfully i s’pose you’re going to meet a friend he said at last  no said rosa i s’pose you are  mr filer said no in his turn  two minutes later in a state of mind pretty evenly divided between trepidation and joy he found himself walking by her side  they chose at first the quietest streets but under miss jelks’s guidance drifted slowly back to the town  to her annoyance the boatswain was nowhere to be seen and the idea of wasting the evening in the society of mr filer annoyed her beyond measure she became moody and vague in her replies to his sallies seated herself on a pile of timber and motioned the young man to join her and finally with the forlorn hope that mr walters might be spending the evening aboard ship strolled on to the quay  work was over and they had the place to themselves  she seated herself on a pile of timber and motioning the young man to join her experienced a sudden thrill as she saw the head of mr walters protruding tortoiselike over the side of the indian chief which lay a little way below them fearful that mr filer should see it she directed his attention to two small boys who were disporting themselves in a ship’s boat and with her head almost on his shoulder blotted out the steamer with three feathers and a bunch of roses  it was a beautiful evening but mr filer failed to understand why she should slap his hand when he said so he could hardly open his mouth without being requested to behave himself and getting another tiny slap greatly encouraged by this treatment he ventured to pass his left arm round her waist and in full view of the choking boatswain imprison both her hands in his  miss jelks endured it for two minutes and then breaking away gave him a playful little prod with her parasol and fled behind a warehouse uttering faint shrieks mr filer gave chase at once in happy ignorance that his rival had nearly fallen overboard in a hopeless attempt to see round the corner flesh and blood could stand it no longer and when the couple emerged and began to walk in a more sober fashion toward the town an infuriated boatswain followed a little in the rear  mr filer saw him first and with a sudden sinking at his heart dropped his light banter and began to discourse on more serious subjects he attempted to widen the distance between them but in vain a second glance showed him mr walters close behind with a face like that of two destroying angels rolled into one trembling with fright he quickened his pace and looked round eagerly for means of escape his glance fell on a confectioner’s window and muttering the word ice he dashed in followed in a more leisurely fashion by miss jelks  i was just feeling like an ice she said as she took a seat at a little marbletopped table she put her hat straight in a mirror opposite and removing her gloves prepared for action  mr filer ate his ice mechanically quite unaware of its flavour then as nothing happened he plucked up courage and began to talk his voice shook a little at first but was gradually getting stronger when he broke off suddenly with his spoon in midair and gazed in fascinated horror at a disc of greenishyellow nose that pressed against the shopwindow the eyes behind it looked as though they might melt the glass  he put his spoon down on the table and tried to think miss jelks finished her ice and sat smiling at him  could you—could you eat another he faltered  miss jelks said that she could try and remarked casually that she had once eaten thirteen and had shared the usual superstition concerning that number ever since  aren’t you going to have one too she inquired when the fresh ice arrived  mr filer shook his head and trying hard to ignore the face at the window said that he was not hungry he sat trembling with agitation and desirous of postponing the encounter with the boatswain as long as possible kept ordering ices for miss jelks until that lady in justice to herself declined to eat any more  i can’t finish this she said you’ll have to help me  she took up a generous spoonful and in full view of the face at the window leaned across the table and put it into mr filer’s unwilling mouth with a violent shudder he saw the boatswain leave the window and take up a position in front of the door miss jelks drew on her gloves and with another glance in the mirror as she rose turned to leave mr filer made no attempt to follow  ain’t you ready said miss jelks pausing  i’m not feeling very well said the young man desperately as he passed his hand across his forehead it’s the ice i think—i’m not used to ’em  perhaps the air will do you good said rosa  mr filer shook his head whatever good the air might do him would he felt certain be counteracted by the treatment of the boatswain  don’t wait for me he said with a faint sad smile i might be here for hours i’ve been like it before  i can’t leave you like this said rosa why—she turned suddenly and her face lit up with a smile—here’s mr walters how fortunate he’ll be able to help you home  no—don’t trouble gasped mr filer as the boatswain came into the shop and prepared to render first aid by moistening his palms and rubbing them together it’s very kind of you but i shall be all right if i’m left alone i’d rather be left alone—i would indeed  you’d better let the gentleman help you home urged the shopkeeper he looks strong  mr filer shuddered  and you can lean on me said rosa softly  mr filer shuddered again and with surprising energy considering his invalid condition gripped the iron frame of the table with his legs and clutched the top with his hands  i don’t like leaving him here said rosa hesitating  neither don’t i growled the boatswain ’owever i s’pose i’ll run against ’im sooner or later  he escorted rosa to the door and after a yearning glance at mr filer followed her out and walked by her side in silence  poor fellow said rosa at last how generous he is i believe he’d give me anything i asked for  mr walters started and bending his brows muttered something about giving mr filer more than he asked for  oh yes i dare say retorted rosa turning on him with sudden heat i’m not to speak to anybody to please you you leave my friends alone what’s it got to do with you  i see you said mr walters darkly i see you from the ship you little thought as ’ow i was a watching your little games  miss jelks stopped and drawing herself up regarded him haughtily  i didn’t ask you for your company mr walters she said sharply so you can take yourself off as soon as you like  she turned and walked off in the opposite direction and mr walters after a moment’s hesitation turned and followed they walked in this fashion for some distance then the boatswain quickening his pace caught her roughly by the arm  i want to show you something he growled  miss jelks eyed him disdainfully  in ’ere said the other pointing to the same jeweller’s window that had been the cause of so much discomfort to captain trimblett  well said the girl her eyes sparkling  for answer the gentle swain took her by the elbows and propelled her into the shop and approaching the counter gazed disagreeably at the shopman  i want a ring for this young lady he said reddening despite himself a good ’un—one o’ the best  the man turned to the window and after a little careful groping unhooked a velvet card studded with rings rosa’s eyes shone but she drew off her glove with a fine show of unwillingness at the boatswain’s command  try that on he said pointing to a ring  miss jelks placed it on the third finger of her left hand and holding it up to the light gazed at it entranced  ’ow much said the boatswain jerking his head  that’s a very nice ring said the assistant  twenty— he referred to a tiny label on the card twentyfive pounds  the boatswain’s jaw dropped and both listeners made noble efforts to appear unconscious that his breathing was anything out of the ordinary  take it off he said as soon as he could speak take it off at once  it’s too large said rosa with a sigh  she drew it off and turning to a case the jeweller placed before her tried on several more suited at last she held up her hand with the ring on it for mr walters’s inspection  it fits beautifully she said softly as the boatswain scratched the back of his neck  a very nice ring that said the assistant a queen might wear it  take it off cried mr walters hastily  seventeen shillings and sixpence said the jeweller almost as quickly  i like it better than the other said rosa  it is better said the boatswain in a relieved voice  he counted out the money and turning a deaf but blushing ear to the jeweller’s glowing description of his weddingrings led the way outside rosa took his arm and leaned on it heavily  fancy we are engaged now she said squeezing his arm and looking up at him  mr walters who seemed to be in a state of considerable perturbation made no reply  fancy you being in such a hurry continued rosa with another squeeze  it’s a failing of mine said the boatswain still staring straight before him always was     chapter xvi     joan hartley’s ideas of london gathered from books and illustrated papers were those of a town to which her uncle and aunt were utter strangers mr william carr knew cornhill and the adjacent district thoroughly and thirty or forty years before had made periodical descents upon the westend he left home at halfpast eight every morning and returned every evening at five minutes to six except on saturdays when he returned at ten minutes past three and spent his half holiday in the diningroom reading an early edition of the evening paper any paragraphs relating to royalty were read aloud to his wife who knew not only all the members of the english royal family by name but also those dignitaries abroad who had the happiness to be connected with it in marriage she could in all probability have given the king himself much useful information as to the ages and fourth and fifth christian names of some of the later and more remote members of his family  her day was as regular and methodical as her husband’s the morning was devoted to assisting and superintending the general servant for the time being after dinner at one o’clock she retired upstairs to dress and went down to the shops to make a few purchases returning in good time to give her husband tea the early part of the evening was devoted to waiting for supper the latter part to waiting for bed  during the first week of joan’s visit an agreeable thrill was communicated to the household by preparations for an evening or perhaps an afternoon and evening in town the event came off—in the third week of her stay—on a wet thursday afternoon mrs carr and joan got wet walking to the omnibus and wetter still waiting at one corner of the bank of england for mr carr who was getting wet at another  mr carr who was in holiday attire was smoking a large cigar in honour of the occasion which he extinguished upon entering an omnibus and relighted at the zoological gardens by the aid of careful manipulation and the rain it lasted him until evening they wound up an eventful day at a theatre and mr carr being anxious to do the thing well took them all the way home in a fourwheeler a little sum in mental arithmetic which he worked on the way and submitted to the cabman at the end of the journey was found to be wrong  the outing was not repeated mrs carr went about for a day or two with the air of one who had returned from a long and fatiguing expedition and her husband when he returned from business the day following and changed into his slippers paid such a warm tribute to the joys and comforts of home that his niece abandoned all ideas of any further jaunts wearied by the dulness and the monotony of the streets she began to count the days till her return her father’s letters made no mention of it but the salthaven news in them only increased her eagerness  she returned one day from a solitary ramble on hampstead heath to find that salthaven or a whiff of it had come to her a deep voice too well known to be mistaken fell on her ears as she entered the front door and hastening to the drawingroom she found her aunt entertaining captain trimblett to afternoon tea one large hand balanced a cup and saucer the other held a plate his method of putting both articles in one hand while he ate or drank might have excited the envy of a practised juggler when joan entered the room she found her aunt with her eyes riveted on a piece of the captain’s buttered toast that was lying face downward on the carpet carrying on a disjointed conversation  i just looked in said the captain as joan almost embraced him mind the tea  looked in echoed joan  one tram three buses—one of ’em a mistake—and my own legs said the captain i had no idea it was so far  people have no idea how far out we really are said mrs carr looking round with a satisfied smile i’ve noticed it before did you find the air different captain trimblett  very said the captain with a sudden gasp as he caught sight of the piece of toast very fine air very fine very—quite strong  he shifted his feet restlessly and the toast disappeared for a moment mrs carr thought that the floor had opened and swallowed it up realizing that the day of useful miracles had passed she gazed fixedly at his left foot  well said the captain turning a relieved face to joan how is the round of gayety are you tired of being a butterfly yet i suppose after this salthaven won’t be good enough for you  there’s nothing like life for young people said mrs carr give them plenty of life and that’s all they want  miss hartley whose back was toward her aunt made a grimace  it’s very natural said the captain  miss hartley made a further effort—one that she had relinquished at the age of ten—but the captain intent upon a bite missed it  in my young days all i thought of was gadding about said mrs carr smiling i wasn’t very strong either it was just my spirits kept me up but i used to suffer for it afterward  we all do said the captain politely  by a feat of absolute legerdemain he took out his handkerchief and brushed some crumbs from his beard his cup slid to the edge of the saucer and peeped over but throwing the spoon overboard righted itself just in time somewhat pleased with himself he replaced the handkerchief and drinking the remainder of his tea thankfully handed the crockery to joan after which with a mind relieved hesat and spun his marvelling hostess a few tales of the sea  he left under plea of business before mr carr’s return and with a reference to the family likeness obtaining between omnibuses asked joan to see him safe aboard he accompanied the request with such a distortion of visage that she rightly concluded that he wished for an opportunity to speak to her alone  you’re looking better he said when they got outside a year or two in london will be the making of you  a year or two echoed the startled joan i’ve had quite enough of it already thank you i’ve never been so dull  you haven’t got used to the change yet said the captain indulgently that’s natural but in another month i expect you’ll have quite a different tale to tell  i am going home next weak said miss hartley in a decided voice  captain trimblett coughed  why shouldn’t i inquired the girl in reply  the captain coughed again  i should think the carrs would be glad to have you he replied becoming suddenly busy with his handkerchief especially as they have got no children and a year or two with them in town would give you a—a sort of finish  you have heard something from my father exclaimed joan turning on him  he—he wrote said the captain  did he suggest my staying here  no said the captain putting his handkerchief away with great care no i can’t say he did but he has had another interview with mr john vyner and it seems that the old gentleman is quite taking it for granted that you have left salthaven for good he was quite genial to your father  did father undeceive him inquired the girl  he didn’t say rejoined the other my idea is he didn’t but it’s only my idea mind  for some time miss hartley walked on in disdainful silence she broke it at last in favour of mr vyner senior  talking won’t alter facts though said the admiring captain shaking his head  the girl paid no heed  now if you only stayed here for a little while said the captain persuasively say a couple of years no doubt things would right themselves anything might happen in two years mind it’s not your father’s idea it’s mine i’d do anything for him he has done me many a good turn in his time and i want to pay him back  miss hartley softening somewhat thanked him  and what is two years at your time of life continued the captain brightly nothing why i’m going away for that time as a matter of course  i want to go home said joan i feel that i can’t breathe in this dreary place you wouldn’t like me to die would you  certainly not said the captain promptly  you would sooner die yourself wouldn’t you said joan with a sly glance at him  the captain said yes with all the comfortable assurance of a healthy man living in a civilized country then he started as miss hartley turned suddenly and pinched his arm  eh cried the captain rubbing it  i don’t want you to die for me said joan with a little laugh but i was thinking over things the other day and i got an idea of how you could help me if you would i gave it up however i felt sure you wouldn’t do it but if you say you would die for me—  when i said ’die’— began the captain uneasily  i’m not going to ask you to do anything as dreadful as that continued joan at least i don’t think it is but the beauty of it is it is something you can do i am going back to salthaven but to make everybody comfortable and happy i thought of going back under a new name that’s the idea  new name repeated the puzzled captain  joan nodded and turned a somewhat flushed face in his direction  a new name she repeated my father will be left undisturbed mr john vyner will be satisfied and mr robert—  yes said the captain after a pause  nothing said the girl  but i don’t understand said the captain what good will changing your name do  wait till you hear it retorted the girl with an amused glance at him  i am waiting said the other somewhat shortly  you’ll see at once when i tell you said joan and i’m sure you won’t mind i am going back to salthaven under the name of mrs trimblett  the captain stopped suddenly in his stride and with a bewildered air strove to rally his disordered faculties alarm and consternation choked his utterance  poor dear said joan with another giggle don’t be alarmed it’s the best thing that could happen to you it will prevent all other attempts on your freedom  i can take a joke said the captain finding his speech at last i can take a joke as well as most men but this is going a trifle too far  but i’m not joking said the girl i’m going back as mrs trimblett i am indeed don’t look so frightened i’m not going to marry you really only pretend as the children say  you don’t know what you’re talking about exclaimed the astonished captain  putting aside your feelings—and mine said joan it’s a good thing for everybody else isn’t it we mustn’t consider ourselves—that would be selfish  the captain shook his head in angry amazement  i suppose when you said just now that you would do anything for father you didn’t mean it then said joan and when you said you’d die for me you—  i tell you interrupted the captain violently it’s impossible i never heard of such a thing  it’s quite possible declared the girl i shall go back home and you must get back to salthaven just in time to sail mr vyner will be so pleased at the news he will let you stay away as long as you like i am sure  and what about when i come back demanded the captain  when you come back said joan slowly—just before in fact—i shall tell the truth and give people to understand that i did it to oblige you—to prevent somebody else marrying you against your will  oh said the captain struggling nobly with his feelings oh you will  tomorrow continued joan i will buy the weddingring i know that that ought to be your business but i’ll get it because i know where i can get one cheap i saw some the other day rolled gold they are called eighteenpence each  the captain choked  have you considered he said loftily as soon as he was capable of speech that it would be a lie  joan nodded carelessly  a lie repeated captain trimblett in a thrilling voice  yes said joan i remember i heard you tell father once that if you had a sovereign for every lie you had told you would be able to give up the sea so you had better do it you can do it better than i can  captain trimblett threw his hands apart with a sudden supreme gesture  i won’t listen to another word he said hotly i should never hear the end of it where are those omnibuses  we are not near them yet was the reply we have been walking away from them when you have listened to reason i will take you to them  the captain closed his lips obstinately he would have closed his ears too if he could but unable to do that quickened his pace in a forlorn attempt to outdistance her she plied him with arguments and entreaties but in vain he was immovable finally in a trembling voice she said that it didn’t matter and apologized for troubling him with her concerns  i would do anything in reason my dear said the mollified captain  it doesn’t matter repeated the girl  it’s quite impossible said the captain gently it’s really an outrageous idea you’ll see it yourself by and by  miss hartley thanked him and taking out a handkerchief dabbed her eyes gently and made a pathetic attempt to smile  don’t say any more about it she pleaded i have no doubt you are right only when you said you would do anything for us i—i thought you meant it i see how uncomfortable it might be for you i ought to have thought of that before  the unfortunate captain turned crimson but glancing at the spectacle of resignation by his side managed to keep his temper under restraint  i’m not thinking of myself at all he growled  perhaps you are without knowing it suggested miss hartley in a voice free from all trace of personal feeling i thought that you would have done a little thing like that for me—and father i’m sorry i was mistaken however i shall go back to salthaven in any case  she dabbed a perfectly dry eye again and watched the captain closely with the other  i suppose there will be trouble she continued meditatively still that will be your fault i have done all i could do  she walked on in pained silence and paid no heed to the explanations and arguments by which the captain sought to justify his refusal he began to get confused and rambling in his defence and finally to terminate an embarrassing interview grunted out something about thinking it over a moment later a radiant and admiring young woman was flattering him up to the skies  mind i only said i would think it over said the captain regarding her indignantly  of course said joan i quite understand that and you will write and break the news to father won’t you  no i’m hanged if i do answered the captain  never mind then i’ll do it said the girl hastily i shall just write and tell him that i have changed my name to trimblett people have a right to change their name if they like lots of them do it make haste you’ll lose your omnibus i shall never forget your kindness—never  mind panted the captain as she hurried him along it—isn’t—settled i am only going to think it over  i don’t know what we should have done without you continued joan there isn’t another man in the world would be so kind i am sure if you were only thirty or forty years younger i would marry you in reality  mind said the captain grasping the rail of the omnibus and pausing with his foot on the step i haven’t—promised  i’ll write and tell you when i’ve done it said joan i’ll take all the responsibility goodby goodby  the conductor hoisted him aboard and he slowly mounted the stairs he paused at the top to wave a feeble hand and then subsiding heavily into a seat sat thinking out a long and polite letter of refusal     chapter xvii     joan hartley’s letter to her father was not so easy to write as she had imagined she tore up draft after draft and at last in despair wrote him a brief and dutiful epistle informing him that she had changed her name to tremblett she added—in a postscript—that she expected he would be surprised and having finished her task sat trying to decide whether to commit it to the post or the flames  it was a question that occupied her all the evening and the following morning found her still undecided it was not until the afternoon when a letter came from captain trimblett declining in violent terms and at great length to be a party to her scheme that she made up her mind the information that he had been recalled to salthaven on the day following only served to strengthen her resolution and it was with a feeling of almost pious thankfulness that she realized the advantages of such an arrangement she went out and posted her letter to her father and then with a mind at ease wrote a nice letter to captain trimblett full of apologies for her precipitancy and regretting that he had not informed her before of what she called his change of mind she added that after mature deliberation she had decided not to return to salthaven until after he had sailed  captain trimblett got the letter next morning and hurrying off to the nearest postoffice filled up a telegraphform with a few incisive words dashed off at white heat he destroyed six forms before he had arrived at what he considered a happy mean between strength and propriety and then at the lady clerk’s earnest request altered one of the words of the seventh a few hours later he was on his way to salthaven  it was late when he arrived and the office of vyner and son was closed he went on to laurel lodge and after knocking and ringing for some time in vain walked back to the town and went on board his ship the new crew had not yet been signed on and mr walters the only man aboard was cut short in his expressions of pleasure at the captain’s return and sent ashore for provisions  time you went to sea again said the captain a little later as the boatswain went on his hands and knees to recover the pieces of a plate he had dropped  i wish i’d gone a month ago sir said mr walters shore’s no place for a sailorman  the captain grunted and turning suddenly surprised the eye of mr walters fixed upon him with an odd puzzled expression that he had noticed before that evening mr walters caught in the act ducked from sight and recovered a crumb that was trying to pass itself off as a piece of china  what are you staring at me for demanded the captain  me sir said the boatswain i wasn’t staring  he rose with his hands full of pieces and retreated to the door almost against his will he stole another glance at the captain and blinked hastily at the gaze that met his own  if i’ve got a smut on my nose— began the captain ferociously  no sir said mr walters disappearing  come here roared the other  the boatswain came back reluctantly  if i catch you making those faces at me again said the captain whom the events of the last day or two had reduced to a state of chronic illtemper i’ll—i’ll——  yessir said mr walters cheerfully i——  he disappeared again but his voice came floating down the companionladder i ’ope—you’ll accept—my good—wishes  captain trimblett started as though he had been stung and his temperature rose to as near boiling point as science and the human mechanism will allow twice he opened his mouth to bellow the boatswain back again and twice his courage failed him he sat a picture of wrathful consternation until his gaze falling on a bottle of beer he emptied it with great rapidity and pushing his plate away and lighting his pipe sat trying to read a harmless meaning into mr walters’s infernal congratulations  he rose early next morning and set off for laurel lodge a prey to gloom which the furtive glances of mr walters had done nothing to dissipate hartley was still in his bedroom when he arrived but rosa showed him into the diningroom and having placed a chair sped lightly upstairs  i’ve told him she said returning in a breathless condition and smiling at him  the captain scowled at her  and he says he’ll be down in a minute  very good said the captain with a nod of dismissal  miss jelks went as far as the sideboard and taking out a tablecloth proceeded to set the breakfast regarding the captain with unaffected interest as she worked  he ain’t been very well the last day or two she said blandly  the captain ignored her  seems to have something on his mind continued miss jelks with a toss of her head as she placed the sugarbowl and other articles on the table  the captain regarded her steadily for a moment and then turning took up a newspaper  i should think he never was what you’d call a strong man murmured miss jelks he ain’t got the look of it  the captain’s temper got the better of him who are you talking about he demanded turning sharply  miss jelks’s eyes shone but there was no hurry and she smoothed down a corner of the tablecloth before replying  your fatherinlaw sir she said with a faint air of surprise  captain trimblett turned hastily to his paper again but despite his utmost efforts a faint wheezing noise escaped him and fell like soft music on the ears of miss jelks in the hope that it might be repeated or that manifestations more gratifying still might be vouchsafed to her she lingered over her task and coughed in an aggressive fashion at intervals  she was still busy when hartley came downstairs and stopping for a moment at the doorway stood regarding the captain with a look of timid disapproval the latter rose and with a significant glance in the direction of rosa shook hands and made a remark about the weather  when did you return inquired hartley trying to speak easily  last night said the other i came on here but you were out  hartley nodded and they sat eying each other uneasily and waiting for the industrious rosa to go the captain got tired first and throwing open the french windows slipped out into the garden and motioned to hartley to follow  joan wrote to you he said abruptly as soon as they were out of earshot  yes said the other stiffly  understand it wasn’t my fault said the captain warmly i wash my hands of it i told her not to  indeed said hartley with a faint attempt at sarcasm it was no concern of mine of course  the captain turned on him sharply and for a moment scathing words hung trembling on his lips he controlled himself by an effort  she wrote to you he said slowly and instead of waiting to see me or communicating with me you spread the news all over the place  nothing of the kind said hartley as a matter of fact it’s not a thing i am anxious to talk about up to the present i have only told rosa  only repeated the choking captain only only told rosa where was the towncrier what in the name of commonsense did you want to tell her for  she would have to be told sooner or later said hartley staring at him and it seemed to me better to tell her before joan came home i thought joan would prefer it and if you had heard rosa’s comments i think that you’d agree i was right  the captain scarcely listened well it’s all over salthaven by now he said resignedly  he seated himself on the bench with his hands hanging loosely between his knees and tried to think in any case he saw himself held up to ridicule and he had a strong feeling that to tell the truth now would precipitate a crisis between vyner and his chief clerk the former would probably make a fairly accurate guess at the circumstances responsible for the rumour and act accordingly he glanced at hartley standing awkwardly before him and not without a sense of selfsacrifice resolved to accept the situation  yes rosa had to be told he said philosophically fate again you can’t avoid it  hartley took a turn or two up and down the path  the news came on me like a—like a thunderbolt he said pausing in front of the captain i hadn’t the slightest idea of such a thing and if i say what i think—  don’t interrupted the captain warmly what’s the good  when were you married inquired the other where were you married  joan made all the arrangements said the captain rising hastily ask her  but— said the astonished hartley  ask her repeated the captain walking toward the house and flinging the words over his shoulder i’m sick of it  he led the way into the diningroom and at the other’s invitation took a seat at the breakfasttable and sat wondering darkly how he was to get through the two days before he sailed hartley ill at ease poured him out a cup of coffee and called his attention to the bacondish  i can’t help thinking he said as the captain helped himself and then pushed the dish toward him—i can’t help thinking that there is something behind all this that there is some reason for it that i don’t quite understand  the captain started never mind he said with gruff kindness  but i do mind persisted the other i have got an idea that it has been done for the benefit—if you can call it that—of a third person  the captain eyed him with benevolent concern nonsense he said uneasily nothing of the kind we never thought of you  i wasn’t thinking of myself said hartley staring but i know that joan was uneasy about you although she pretended to laugh at it i feel sure in my own mind that she has done this to save you from mrs chinnery if it hadn’t—  he stopped suddenly as the captain uttering a strange gasping noise rose and stood over him for a second or two the captain stood struggling for speech then stepping back with a suddenness that overturned his chair he grabbed his cap from the sideboard and dashed out of the house the amazed mr hartley ran to the window and with some uneasiness saw his old friend pelting along at the rate of a good five miles an hour  breathing somewhat rapidly from his exertions the captain moderated his pace after the first hundred yards and went on his way in a state of mind pretty evenly divided between wrath and selfpity he walked in thought with his eyes fixed on the ground and glancing up too late to avoid him saw the harbourmaster approaching  captain trimblett composing his features to something as near his normal expression as the time at his disposal would allow gave a brief nod and would have passed on he found his way however blocked by sixteen stone of harbourmaster while a big red cleanshaven face smiled at him reproachfully  how are you said trimblett jerkily  the harbourmaster who was a man of few words made no reply he drew back a little and regarding the captain with smiling interest rolled his head slowly from side to side  well well well he said at last  captain trimblett drew himself up and regarded him with a glance the austerity of which would have made most men quail it affected the harbourmaster otherwise  c—ck he said waggishly and drove a forefinger like a petrified sausage into the other’s ribs  the assault was almost painful and before the captain could recover the harbourmaster having exhausted his stock of witticisms both verbal and physical passed on highly pleased with himself  it was only a sample of what the day held in store for the captain and before it was half over he was reduced to a condition of raging impotence the staff of vyner and son turned on their stools as one man as he entered the room and regarded him openeyed for the short time that he remained there mr vyner senior greeted him almost with cordiality and for the second time in his experience extended a big white hand for him to shake  i have heard the news captain he said in extenuation  captain trimblett bowed and in response to an expression of good wishes for his future welfare managed to thank him he made his escape as soon as possible and meeting robert vyner on the stairs got a fleeting glance and a nod which just admitted the fact of his existence  the most popular man in salthaven for the time being he spent the best part of the day on board his ship heedless of the fact that numerous acquaintances were scouring the town in quest of him one or two hardy spirits even ventured on board and leaving with some haste bemoaned as they went the change wrought by matrimony in a hitherto amiable and civilspoken mariner  the one drop of sweetness in his cup was the news that mrs chinnery was away from home for a few days and after carefully reconnoitring from the bridge of the indian chief that evening he set off to visit his lodgings he reached tranquil vale unmolested and entering the house with a rather exaggerated air of unconcern nodded to mr truefitt who was standing on the hearthrug smoking and hung up his cap mr truefitt after a short pause shook hands with him  she’s away he said in a deep voice  she who faltered the captain  susanna replied mr truefitt in a deeper voice still  the captain coughed and selecting a chair with great care slowly seated himself  she left you her best wishes continued mr truefitt still standing and still regarding him with an air of severe disapproval  much obliged murmured the captain  she would do it added mr truefitt crossing to the window and staring out at the road with his back to the captain and she said something about a silverplated butterdish but in the circumstances i said ’no’ miss willett thought so too  how is miss willett inquired the captain anxious to change the subject  all things considered she’s better than might be expected replied mr truefitt darkly  captain trimblett said that he was glad to hear it and finding the silence becoming oppressive inquired affectionately concerning the health of mrs willett and learned to his discomfort that she was in the same enigmatical condition as her daughter  and my marriage is as far off as ever concluded mr truefitt some people seem to be able to get married as often as they please and others can’t get married at all  it’s all fate said the captain slowly it’s all arranged for us  mr truefitt turned and his colour rose  your little affair was arranged for you i suppose he said sharply  it was said the captain with startling vehemence  mr truefitt who was lighting his pipe looked up at him from lowered brows and then crossing to the door took his pipe down the garden to the summerhouse     chapter xviii     this time tomorrow night said mr walters as he slowly paced a country lane with miss jelks clinging to his arm i shall be at sea  miss jelks squeezed his arm and gave vent to a gentle sigh two years’ll soon slip away she remarked it’s wonderful how time flies how much is twice three hundred and sixtyfive  and you mind you behave yourself said the boatswain hastily remember your promise mind  of course i will said rosa carelessly  you’ve promised not to ’ave your evening out till i come back the boatswain reminded her weekdays and sundays both and it oughtn’t to be no ’ardship to you gals wot’s going to be married don’t want to go gadding about  of course they don’t said rosa i shouldn’t enjoy being out without you neither and i can get all the fresh air i want in the garden  and cleaning the winders said the thoughtful boatswain  miss jelks who held to a firm and convenient belief in the likeness between promises and piecrusts smiled cheerfully  unless i happen to be sent on an errand i sha’n’t put my nose outside the front gate she declared  you’ve passed your word said mr walters slowly and that’s good enough for me besides which i’ve got a certain party wot’s promised to keep ’is eye on you and let me know if you don’t keep to it  eh said the startled rosa who is it  never you mind who it is said mr walters judicially it’s better for you not to know then you can’t dodge ’im he can keep his eye on you but there’s no necessity for you to keep your eye on ’im i don’t mind wot he does  miss jelks maintained her temper with some difficulty but the absolute necessity of discovering the identity of the person referred to by mr walters if she was to have any recreation at all during the next two years helped her  he’ll have an easy job of it she said at last with a toss of her head  that’s just wot i told ’im said the boatswain he didn’t want to take the job on at first but i p’inted out that if you behaved yourself and kept your promise he’d ’ave nothing to do and likewise if you didn’t it was only right as ’ow i should know besides which i gave ’im a couple o’ carved peach stones and a warclub that used to belong to a sandwich islander and took me pretty near a week to make  miss jelks looked up at him sideways be a bit of all right if he comes making up to me himself she said with a giggle i wonder whether he’d tell you that  he won’t do that said the boatswain with a confident smile he’s much too wellbehaved ’sides which he ain’t old enough  miss jelks tore her arm away you’ve never been and set that oldfashioned little shrimp bassett on to watch me she said shrilly  never you mind who it is growled the discomfited boatswain it’s got nothing to do with you all you’ve got to know is this any time ’e sees you out—this party i’m talking of—he’s going to log it he calls it keeping a dairy but it comes to the same thing  i know what i call it said the offended maiden and if i catch that little horror spying on me he’ll remember it  he can’t spy on you if you ain’t out said the boatswain that’s wot i told ’im and when i said as you’d promised he saw as ’ow it would be all right i’m going to try and bring him ’ome a shark’s tooth  goin’ to make it inquired rosa with a sniff  and might i ask she inquired as the amorous boatswain took her arm again might i ask who is going to watch you  me said the boatswain regarding her with honest amazement i don’t want no watching men don’t  in—deed said miss jelks and why not  they don’t like it said mr walters simply  miss jelks released her arm again and for some time they walked on opposite sides of the lane her temper rose rapidly and at last tearing off her glove she drew the ring from her finger and handed it to the boatswain  there you are she exclaimed take it  mr walters took it and after a vain attempt to place it on his little finger put it in his waistcoatpocket and walked on whistling  we’re not engaged now explained rosa  aye aye said the boatswain cheerfully only walking out  nothing of the kind said rosa i sha’n’t have nothing more to do with you you’d better tell bassett  what for demanded the other  what for repeated rosa why there’s no use him watching me now  why not demanded mr walters  miss jelks caught her breath impatiently because it’s got nothing to do with you what i do now she said sharply i can go out with who i like  ho said the glaring mr walters ho can you so that’s your little game is it here—  he fumbled in his pocket and producing the ring caught miss jelks’s hand in a grip that made her wince and proceeded to push it on her little finger now you behave yourself else next time i’ll take it back for good  miss jelks remonstrated but in vain the boatswain passed his left arm about her waist and when she became too fluent increased the pressure until she gasped for breath much impressed by these signs of affection she began to yield and leaning her head against his shoulder voluntarily renewed her vows of seclusion  she went down to the harbour next day to see him off and stood watching with much interest the bustle on deck and the prominent share borne by her masterful admirer to her thinking captain trimblett stiff and sturdy on the bridge played but a secondary part she sent the boatswain little signals of approval and regard a proceeding which was the cause of much subsequent trouble to a newly joined ab who misunderstood their destination the warps were thrown off a bell clanged in the engineroom the screw revolved and a gradually widening piece of water appeared between the steamer and the quay men on board suspended work for a moment for a last gaze ashore and no fewer than six unfortunates responded ardently to the fluttering of her handkerchief she stood watching until the steamer had disappeared round a bend in the river and then with a sense of desolation and a holiday feeling for which there was no outlet walked slowly home  she broke her promise to the boatswain the following evening for one thing it was her evening out and for another she felt that the sooner the bassett nuisance was stopped the better it would be for all concerned if the youth failed to see her she was the gainer to the extent of an evening in the open air and if he did not she had an idea that the emergency would not find her unprepared  she walked down to the town first and spent some time in front of the shopwindows tiring of this she proceeded to the harbour and inspected the shipping and then with the feeling strong upon her that it would be better to settle with bassett at her own convenience she walked slowly to the small street in which he lived and taking up a position nearly opposite his house paced slowly to and fro with the air of one keeping an appointment she was pleased to observe after a time a slight movement of the curtains opposite and satisfied that she had attained her ends walked off the sound of a street door closing saved her the necessity of looking round  at first she strolled slowly through the streets but presently increasing her pace resolved to take the lad for a country walk at tranquil vale she paused to tie up her bootlace and satisfying herself that bassett was still in pursuit set off again  she went on a couple of miles farther until turning the sharp corner of a lane she took a seat on the trunk of a tree that lay by the side and waited for him to come up she heard his footsteps coming nearer and nearer and with a satisfied smile noted that he had quickened his pace he came round the corner at the rate of over four miles an hour and coming suddenly upon her was unable to repress a slight exclamation of surprise the check was but momentary and he was already passing on when the voice of miss jelks uplifted in sorrow brought him to a standstill  oh master bassett she cried i am surprised i couldn’t have believed it of you  bassett squeezing his hands together stood eying her nervously  and you so quiet too continued rosa but there you quiet ones are always the worst  the boy peering at her through his spectacles made no reply  the idea of a boy your age falling in love with me said rosa modestly lowering her gaze  what squeaked the astonished bassett hardly able to believe his ears  falling in love and dogging my footsteps said rosa with relish and standing there looking at me as though you could eat me  you must be mad said bassett in a trembling voice stark staring mad  it’s to make you leave off loving me she explained  don’t make it worse said rosa kindly i suppose you can’t help it and ought to be pitied for it really now i know why it was you winked at me when you came to the house the other day  winked gasped the horrified youth me  i thought it was weakness of sight at the time said the girl but i see my mistake now i am sorry for you but it can never be i am another’s  bassett utterly bereft of speech stood eying her helplessly  don’t stand there making those sheep’s eyes at me said rosa try and forget me was it love at first sight or did it come on gradual like  bassett moistening his tongue shook his head  am i the first girl you ever loved inquired rosa softly  no said the boy i mean—i have never been in—love i don’t know what you are talking about  do you mean to say you are not in love with me demanded rosa springing up suddenly  i do said bassett blushing hotly  then what did you follow me all round the town for and then down here  bassett who was under a pledge of secrecy to the boatswain and moreover had his own ideas as to the reception the truth might meet with preserved an agonized silence  it’s no good said rosa eying him mournfully you can’t deceive me you are head over heels and the kindest thing i can do is to be cruel to you—for your own sake  she sprang forward suddenly and before the astounded youth could dodge dealt him a sharp box on the ear as he reeled under the blow she boxed the other  it’s to make you leave off loving me she explained and if i ever catch you following me again you’ll get some more besides which i shall tell your mother  she picked up her parasol from the trunk and after standing regarding him for a moment with an air of offended maidenhood walked back to the town bassett after a long interval returned by another road     chapter xix     joan hartley returned to salthaven a week after captain trimblett’s departure and with a lively sense of her inability to satisfy the curiosity of her friends spent most of the time indoors to evade her father’s inquiries she adopted other measures and the day after her return finding both her knowledge and imagination inadequate to the task of satisfying him she first waxed impatient and then tearful finally she said that she was thoroughly tired of the subject and expressed a fervent hope that she might hear no more about it any further particulars would be furnished by captain trimblett upon his return  but when i asked him about it he referred me to you said hartley the whole affair is most incomprehensible  we thought it would be a surprise to you agreed joan  it was said her father gloomily but if you are satisfied i suppose it is all right  he returned to the attack next day but gained little information miss hartley’s ideas concerning the various marriage ceremonies were of the vaguest but by the aid of whitaker’s almanack she was enabled to declare that the marriage had taken place by license at a church in the district where trimblett was staying as a help to identification she added that the church was built of stone and that the pewopener had a cough tiresome questions concerning the marriage certificate were disposed of by leaving it in the captain’s pocketbook and again she declared that she was tired of the subject  i can’t imagine what your aunt was thinking about said her father if you had let me write—  she knew nothing about it said joan hastily and if you had written to her she would have thought that you were finding fault with her for not looking after me more it’s done now and if i’m satisfied and captain trimblett is satisfied that is all that matters you didn’t want me to be an old maid did you  mr hartley gave up the subject in despair but miss willett who called a day or two later displayed far more perseverance after the usual congratulations she sat down to discuss the subject at length and subjected joan to a series of questions which the latter had much difficulty in evading for a newly married woman miss willett could only regard her knowledge of matrimony as hazy in the extreme  she don’t want to talk about it said mr truefitt the following evening as he sat side by side with miss willett in the little summerhouse overlooking the river perhaps she is repenting it already  it ought to be a tender memory sighed miss willett i’m sure—  she broke off and blushed  yes said mr truefitt pinching her arm tenderly  never mind breathed miss willett i mean—i was only going to say that i don’t think the slightest detail would have escaped me all she seems to remember is that it took place in a church  it must have been by license i should think said mr truefitt scowling thoughtfully ordinary license i should say i have been reading up about them lately one never knows what may happen  miss willett started  trimblett has not behaved well continued mr truefitt slowly by no means but i must say that he has displayed a certain amount of dash he didn’t allow anything or anybody to come between him and matrimony he just went and did it  he passed his arm round miss willett’s waist and gazed reflectively across the river  and i suppose we shall go on waiting all our lives he said at last we consider other people far too much  miss willett shook her head mother always keeps to her word she said with an air of mournful pride once she says anything she keeps to it that’s her firmness she won’t let me marry so long as mrs chinnery stays here we must be patient  mr truefitt rumpled his hair irritably and for some time sat silent then he leaned forward and in a voice trembling with excitement whispered in the lady’s ear  peter gasped miss willett and drew back and eyed him in trembling horror  why not said mr truefitt with an effort to speak stoutly it’s our affair  miss willett shivered and withdrawing from his arm edged away to the extreme end of the seat and averted her gaze  it’s quite easy whispered the tempter  miss willett still looking out at the door affected not to hear  not a soul would know until afterward continued mr truefitt in an ardent whisper it could all be kept as quiet as possible i’ll have the license ready and you could just slip out for a morning walk and meet me at the church and there you are and it’s ridiculous of two people of our age to go to such trouble  mother would never forgive me murmured miss willett never  she’d come round in time said mr truefitt  never said miss willett you don’t know mother’s strength of mind but i mustn’t stay and listen to such things it’s wicked  she got up and slipped into the garden and with mr truefitt in attendance paced up and down the narrow paths  besides she said after a long silence i shouldn’t like to share housekeeping with your sister it would only lead to trouble between us i am sure  mr truefitt came to a halt in the middle of the path and stood rumpling his hair again as an aid to thought captain sellers who was looking over his fence waved a cheery salutation  fine evening he piped  the other responded with a brief nod  what did you say inquired captain sellers who was languishing for a little conversation  didn’t say anything bawled mr truefitt  you must speak up if you want me to hear you cried the captain it’s one o’ my bad days  truefitt shook his head and placing himself by the side of miss willett resumed his walk three fences away captain sellers kept pace with them  nothing fresh about trimblett i suppose he yelled  truefitt shook his head again  he’s a deep ’un cried sellers—wonderful deep how’s the other one bearing up i ain’t seen her about the last day or two i believe that was all a dodge of trimblett’s to put us off the scent it made a fool of me  mr truefitt with a nervous glance at the open windows of his house turned and walked hastily down the garden again  he quite deceived me continued captain sellers following—quite what did you say  nothing bawled mr truefitt with sudden ferocity  eh yelled the captain leaning over the fence with his hand to his ear  nothing  eh said the captain anxiously speak up what  oh go to—jericho muttered mr truefitt and taking miss willett by the arm disappeared into the summerhouse again where were we when that old idiot interrupted us he inquired tenderly  miss willett told him and nestling within his encircling arm listened with as forbidding an expression as she could command to further arguments on the subject of secret marriages  it’s no use she said at last i mustn’t listen it’s wicked i am surprised at you peter you must never speak to me on the subject again  she put her head on his shoulder and mr truefitt getting a better grip with his arm drew her toward him  think it over he whispered and bent and kissed her  never was the reply  mr truefitt kissed her again and was about to repeat the performance when she started up with a faint scream and pushing him away darted from the summerhouse and fled up the garden mr truefitt red with wrath stood his ground and stared ferociously at the shrunken figure of captain sellers standing behind the little gate in the fence that gave on to the foreshore the captain with a cheery smile lifted the latch and entered the garden  i picked a little bunch o’ flowers for miss willett he said advancing and placing them on the table  who told you to come into my garden shouted the angry mr truefitt  yes all of ’em said captain sellers taking up the bunch and looking at them smell  he thrust the bunch into the other’s face and withdrawing it plunged his own face into it with rapturous sniffs mr truefitt his nose decorated with pollen ravished from a huge lily eyed him murderously  get out of my garden he said with an imperious wave of his hand  i can’t hear what you say said the captain following the direction of the other’s hand and stepping outside sometimes i think my deafness gets worse it’s a great deprivation’’  is it said mr truefitt he made a funnel of both hands and bent to the old man’s willing ear  you’re an artful interfering prying inquisitive old busybody he bellowed can you hear that  say it again said the captain his old eyes snapping  mr truefitt complied  i didn’t quite catch the last word said the captain  busybody yelled mr truefitt busybody b—u—s——  i heard said captain sellers with sudden and alarming dignity take your coat off  get out of my garden responded mr truefitt briefly  take your coat off repeated captain sellers sternly he removed his own after a little trouble and rolling back his shirt sleeves stood regarding with some pride a pair of yellow skinny old arms then he clenched his fists and with an agility astonishing in a man of his years indulged in a series of galvanic little hops in front of the astounded peter truefitt  put your hands up he screamed put ’em up you tailor’s dummy put ’em up you dutchman  go out of my garden repeated the marvelling mr truefitt go home and have some gruel and go to bed  captain sellers paid no heed still performing marvellous things with his feet he ducked his head over one shoulder feinted with his left at mr truefitt’s face and struck with his right somewhere near the centre of his opponent’s waistcoat mr truefitt still gazing at him openmouthed retreated backward and just as the captain’s parchmentlike fist struck him a second time tripped over a watercan that had been left in the path and fell heavily on his back in a flowerbed  time cried captain sellers breathlessly and pulled out a big silver watch to consult as miss willett came hurrying down the garden followed by mrs chinnery  peter wailed miss willett going on her knees and raising his head oh peter  has he hurt you inquired mrs chinnery stooping  no i’m a bit shaken said mr truefitt crossly i fell over that bla—blessed watercan take that old marionette away i’m afraid to touch him for fear he’ll fall to pieces  time panted captain sellers stowing his watch away and resuming his prancing come on lively with it  miss willett uttered a faint scream and thrust her hand out  lor’ bless the man cried mrs chinnery regarding the old gentleman’s antics with much amazement go away go away at once  time cried captain sellers  she stepped forward and her attitude was so threatening that captain sellers hesitated then he turned and picking up his coat began to struggle into it  i hope it will be a lesson to him he said glaring at mr truefitt who had risen by this time and was feeling his back you see what comes of insulting an old seadog  he turned and made his way to the gate refusing with a wave of his hand mrs chinnery’s offer to help him down the three steps leading to the shore with head erect and a springy step he gained his own garden and even made a pretence of attending to a flower or two before sitting down then the deckchair claimed him and he lay a limp bundle of aching old bones until his housekeeper came down the garden to see what had happened to him     chapter xx     for the first week or two after joan hartley’s return mr robert vyner went about in a state of gloomy amazement then the first shock of surprise over he began to look about him in search of reasons for a marriage so undesirable a few casual words with hartley at odd times only served to deepen the mystery and he learned with growing astonishment of the chief clerk’s ignorance of the whole affair a faint suspicion which he had at first dismissed as preposterous persisted in recurring to him and grew in strength every time the subject was mentioned between them his spirits improved and he began to speak of the matter so cheerfully that hartley became convinced that everybody concerned had made far too much of ordinary attentions paid by an ordinary young man to a pretty girl misled by his son’s behaviour mr vyner senior began to entertain the same view of the affair  just a boyish admiration he said to his wife as they sat alone one evening all young men go through it at some time or other it’s a sort of—ha—vaccination and the sooner they have it and get over it the better  he has quite got over it i think said mrs vyner slowly  mr vyner nodded lack of opposition he said with a satisfied air lack of visible opposition at any rate these cases require management many a marriage has been caused by the efforts made to prevent it  mrs vyner sighed her husband had an irritating habit of taking her a little way into his confidence and then leaving the rest to an imagination which was utterly inadequate to the task  there is nothing like management she said safely and i am sure nobody could have had a better son he has never caused us a day’s anxiety  not real anxiety said her husband—no  mrs vyner averted her eyes when she said gently—when are you going to give him a proper interest in the firm  mr vyner thrust his hands into his trousers pockets and leaned back in his chair i have been thinking about it he said slowly he would have had it before but for this nonsense nothing was arranged at first because i wanted to see how he was going to do his work is excellent—excellent  it was high praise but it was deserved and mr robert vyner would have been the first to admit it his monstrous suspicion was daily growing less monstrous and more plausible it became almost a conviction and he resolved to test it by seeing joan and surprising her with a few sudden careless remarks of the kind that a rising kc might spring upon a particularly difficult witness for various reasons he chose an afternoon when the senior partner was absent and after trying in vain to think out a few embarrassing questions on the way arrived at the house in a condition of mental bankruptcy  the obvious agitation of miss hartley as she shook hands did not tend to put him at his ease he stammered something about congratulations and the girl stammered something about thanks after which they sat still and eyed each other nervously  beautiful day said mr vyner at last and comforted himself with the reflection that the most eminent kc’s often made inane remarks with the idea of throwing people off their guard  miss hartley said yes  i hope you had a nice time in town he said suddenly  very nice said joan eying him demurely  but of course you did said robert with an air of sudden remembrance i suppose captain trimblett knows london pretty well  pretty well repeated the witness  mr vyner eyed her thoughtfully i hope you won’t mind my saying so he said slowly but i was awfully pleased to hear of your marriage i think it is always nice to hear of one’s friends marrying each other  yes said the girl  and trimblett is such a good chap continued mr vyner he is so sensible for his age  he paused expectantly but nothing happened  so bright and cheerful he explained  miss hartley still remaining silent he broke off and sat watching her quietly to his eyes she seemed more charming than ever there was a defiant look in her eyes and a halfsmile trembled round the corners of her mouth he changed his seat for one nearer to hers and leaning forward eyed her gravely her colour deepened and she breathed quickly  don’t—don’t you think captain trimblett is lucky she inquired with an attempt at audacity  mr vyner pondered no he said at last  miss hartley caught her breath  how rude she said after a pause lowering her eyes  no it isn’t said robert  really remonstrated miss hartley  i think that i am luckier than he is said robert in a low voice at least i hope so shall i tell you why  no said joan quickly  mr vyner moistened his lips  perhaps you know he said unsteadily  joan made no reply  you do know said robert  miss hartley looked up with a sudden careless laugh  it sounds like a conundrum she said gayly but it doesn’t matter i hope you will be lucky  i intend to be said robert  my hus—husband said joan going very red would probably use the word ’fate’ instead of ’luck’  it is a favourite word of my wife’s said robert gravely ah what a couple they would have made  who inquired joan eying him in bewilderment  my wife and your husband said robert i believe they were made for each other  miss hartley retreated in good order i think you are talking nonsense she said with some dignity  yes said robert with a smile groundbait  what said joan in a startled voice  groundbait  miss hartley made an appeal to his better feelings you are making my head ache she said pathetically i’m sure i don’t know what you are talking about  mr vyner apologized remarking that it was a common fault of young husbands to talk too much about their wives and added as an interesting fact that he had only been married that afternoon miss hartley turned a deaf ear  he spread a little groundbait—of a different kind—before hartley during the next few days and in a short time had arrived at a pretty accurate idea of the state of affairs it was hazy and lacking in detail but it was sufficient to make him give laurel lodge a wide berth for the time being and to work still harder for that share in the firm which he had always been given to understand would be his in the meantime he felt that joan’s marriage de convenance was a comfortable arrangement for all parties concerned  this was still his view of it as he sat in his office one afternoon about a couple of months after captain trimblett’s departure he had met miss hartley in the street the day before and with all due regard to appearances he could not help thinking that she had been somewhat unnecessarily demure in return she had gone away with three crushed fingers and a colour that was only partially due to exercise he was leaning back in his chair thinking it over when his father entered  busy inquired john vyner  frightfully said his son unclasping his hands from the back of his head  i have just been speaking to hartley said the senior partner watching him keenly i had a letter this morning from the trimblett family  eh said his son staring  from the eldest child—a girl named jessie replied the other it appears that a distant cousin who has been in charge of them has died suddenly and she is rather at a loss what to do she wrote to me about sending the captain’s pay to her  yes said his son nodding but what has hartley got to do with it  do with it repeated mr vyner in surprised tones i take it that he is in a way their grandfather  gran— began his son and sat gasping yes of course he said presently of course i hadn’t thought of that of course  from his manner at first hartley appeared to have forgotten it too said mr vyner but he soon saw with me that the children ought not to be left alone the eldest is only seventeen  robert tried to collect his thoughts yes he said slowly  he has arranged for them to come and live with him continued mr vyner  the upper part of his son’s body disappeared with startling suddenness over the arm of his chair and a hand began groping blindly in search of a fallen pen a dangerous rush of blood to the head was perceptible as he regained the perpendicular  was—was hartley agreeable to that he inquired steadying his voice  his father drew himself up in his chair certainly he said stiffly he fell in with the suggestion at once it ought to have occurred to him first besides the relationship he and trimblett are old friends the captain is an old servant of the firm and his children must be looked after they couldn’t be left alone in london  it’s a splendid idea said robert—splendid by far the best thing that you could have done  i have told him to write to the girl tonight said mr vyner he is not sure that she knows of her father’s second marriage and i have told him to take a day or two off next week and go up to town and fetch them it will be a little holiday for him  quite a change for him agreed robert conscious of his father’s scrutiny his face was absolutely unmoved and his voice easy how many children are there  five was the reply—so she says in the letter the two youngest are twins  for the fraction of a second something flickered across the face of robert vyner and was gone  trimblett’s second marriage was rather fortunate for them he said in a matteroffact voice  he restrained his feelings until his father had gone and then with a gasp of relief put his head on the table and gave way to them convulsive tremours assailed him and hilarious sobs escaped at intervals from his tortured frame ejaculations of joan and poor girl showed that he was not entirely bereft of proper feeling  his head was still between his arms upon the table and his body still shaking when the door opened and bassett entered the room and stood gazing at him in a state of mild alarm he stood for a minute diagnosing the case and then putting down a handful of papers crossed softly to the mantelpiece and filled a tumbler with water he came back and touched the junior partner respectfully on the elbow  will you try and drink some of this sir he said soothingly  the startled robert threw up his arm there was a crash of glass and bassett with his legs apart and the water streaming down his face stood regarding him with owlish consternation his idea that the junior partner was suffering from a species of fit was confirmed by the latter suddenly snatching his hat from its peg and darting wildly from the room     chapter xxi     mrs willett sat in her small and overfurnished livingroom in a state of openeyed amazement only five minutes before she had left the room to look for a pair of shoes whose easiness was their sole reason for survival and as a last hope had looked under cecilia’s bed and discovered the parcels three parcels all done up in brown paper and ready for the post addressed in cecilia’s handwriting to—  mrs p truefitt  findlater’s private hotel  finsbury circus london  she smoothed her capstrings down with trembling hands and tried to think the autumn evening was closing in but she made no attempt to obtain a light her mind was becoming active and the shadows aided thought at ten o’clock her daughter returning from tranquil vale was surprised to find her still sitting in the dark  why haven’t you had any supper she inquired lighting the gas  i didn’t want any said her mother blinking at die sudden light  miss willett turned and pulled down the blinds then she came back and standing behind her mother’s chair placed a hand upon her shoulder  it—it will be lonely for you when i’ve gone mother she said smoothing the old lady’s lace collar  gone repeated mrs willett gone why has that woman consented to go at last  miss willett shrank back no she said trembling but—  you can’t marry till she does said mrs willett gripping the arms of her chair not with my consent at any rate remember that i’m not going to give way she must  miss willett said yes mother in a dutiful voice and then avoiding her gaze took a few biscuits from the sideboard  there’s a difference between strength of mind and obstinacy continued mrs willett it’s obstinacy with her—sheer obstinacy and i am not going to bow down to it—there’s no reason why i should  miss willett said no mother  if other people like to bow down to her said mrs willett smoothing her dress over her knees that’s their lookout but she won’t get me doing it  she went up to bed and lay awake half the night and rising late next morning in consequence took advantage of her daughter’s absence to peer under the bed the parcels had disappeared she went downstairs with her faded but alert old eyes watching cecilia’s every movement  when does mr truefitt begin his holidays she inquired at last  miss willett who had been glancing restlessly at the clock started violently  to—to—today she gasped  mrs willett said oh  i—i was going out with him at eleven—for a little walk said her daughter nervously just a stroll  mrs willett nodded do you good she said slowly what are you going to wear  her daughter still trembling looked at her in surprise this she said touching her plain brown dress  mrs willett’s voice began to tremble it’s—it’s rather plain she said i like my daughter to be nicely dressed especially when she is going out with her future husband go upstairs and put on your light green  miss willett paler than ever gave a hasty and calculating glance at the clock and disappeared  and your new hat mrs willett called after her  she looked at the clock too and then almost as excited as her daughter began to move restlessly about the room her hands shook and going up to the glass over the mantelpiece she removed her spectacles and dabbed indignantly at her eyes by the time cecilia returned she was sitting in her favourite chair a picture of placid and indifferent old age  that’s better she said with an approving nod much better  she rose and going up to her daughter rearranged her dress a little you look very nice dear she paid with a little cough mr truefitt ought to be proud of you goodby  her daughter kissed her and then having got as far as the door came back and kissed her again she made a second attempt to depart and then conscience proving too much for her uttered a stifled sob and came back to her mother  oh i can’t she wailed i can’t  you’ll be late said her mother pushing her away goodby  i can’t sobbed miss willett i can’t do it i’m—i’m deceiving——  yes yes said the old lady hastily tell me another time goodby  she half led and half thrust her daughter to the door  but said the consciencestricken cecilia you don’t under—  a walk will do you good said her mother and don’t cry try and look your best  she managed to close the door on her and her countenance cleared as she heard her daughter open the hall door and pass out standing well back in the room she watched her to the gate uttering a sharp exclamation of annoyance as cecilia with a woebegone shake of the head turned and came up the path again a loud tap at the window and a shake of the head were necessary to drive her off  mrs willett gave her a few minutes’ start and then in a state of extraordinary excitement went upstairs and with fingers trembling with haste put on her bonnet and cape  you’re not going out alone at this time o’ the morning ma’am said the old servant as she came down again  just as far as the corner martha said the old lady craftily  i’d better come with you said the other  certainly not said mrs willett i’m quite strong this morning go on with your stoves  she took up her stick and opening the door astonished martha by her nimbleness at the gate she looked right and left and for the first time in her life felt that there were too many churches in salthaven for several reasons the chief being that cecilia’s father lay in the churchyard she decided to try st peter’s first and having procured a cab at the end of the road instructed the cabman to drive to within fifty yards of the building and wait for her  the church was open and a peep through the swingdoors showed her a small group standing before the altar with her hand on her side she hobbled up the stone steps to the gallery and helping herself along by the sides of the pews entered the end one of them all and sank exhausted on the cushions  the service had just commenced and the voice of the minister sounded with unusual loudness in the empty church mr truefitt and miss willett stood before him like culprits mr truefitt glancing round uneasily several times as the service proceeded twice the old lavendercoloured bonnet that was projecting over the side of the gallery drew back in alarm and twice its owner held her breath and rated herself sternly for her venturesomeness she did not look over again until she heard a little clatter of steps proceeding to the vestry and then with a hasty glance round slipped out of the pew and made her way downstairs and out of the church  her strength was nearly spent but the cabman was on the watch and driving up to the entrance climbed down and bundled her into the cab the drive was all too short for her to compose herself as she would have liked and she met the accusatory glance of martha with but little of her old spirit  i went a little too far she said feebly as the servant helped her to the door  what did i tell you demanded the other and placing her in her chair removed her bonnet and cape and stood regarding her with sour disapproval  i’m getting better said the old lady stoutly  i’m getting my breath back again i—i think i’ll have a glass of wine  yes ’m said martha moving off the redcurrant  redcurrant said mrs willett sharply redcurrant certainly not the port  martha disappeared marvelling to return a minute or two later with the wine and a glass on a tray mrs willett filled her glass and whispering a toast to herself half emptied it  martha she said looking round with a smile  ma’am  if you like to go and get a glass you can have a little drop yourself  she turned and took up her glass again and starting nervously nearly let it fall as a loud crash sounded outside the bewildered martha had fallen downstairs     chapter xxii     joan hartley did not realize the full consequences of her departure from the truth until the actual arrival of the trimblett family which piloted by mr hartley made a triumphant appearance in a couple of station cabs the roofs were piled high with luggage and the leading cabman shared his seat with a brassbound trunk of huge dimensions and extremely sharp corners  a short sturdy girl of seventeen jumped out as soon as the vehicles came to a halt and taking her stand on the curb proceeded to superintend the unloading a succession of hasty directions to the leading cabman one of the most docile of men ended in the performance of a marvellous piece of jugglery with the big trunk which he first balanced for an infinitesimal period of time on his nose and then caught with his big toe  what did you do that for demanded miss trimblett hotly  there is a limit to the patience of every man and the cabman was proceeding to tell her when he was checked by mr hartley  he ought to be locked up said miss trimblett flushing  she took up a bandbox and joined the laden procession of boys and girls that was proceeding up the path to the house still red with indignation she was introduced to joan and putting down the bandbox stood eying her with frank curiosity  i thought you were older she said at last i had no idea father was married again until i got the letter i shall call you joan  you had all better call me that said miss hartley hastily  never more surprised in my life continued miss trimblett however—  she paused and looked about her  this is george she said pulling forward a heavylooking youth of sixteen this is ted he is fourteen—small for his age—and these are the twins dolly and gertrude they’re eleven dolly has got red hair and gerty has got the sweetest temper  the family having been introduced and then summarily dismissed by the arbitrary jessie set out on a tour of inspection while the elders proceeding upstairs set themselves to solve a problem in sleeping accommodation that would have daunted the proprietor of a margate lodginghouse a scheme was at last arranged by which hartley gave up his bedroom to the three misses trimblett and retired to a tiny room under the tiles miss trimblett pointed out that it commanded a fine view  it is the only thing to be done said joan softly  it isn’t very big for three said miss trimblett referring to her own room but the twins won’t be separated i’ve always been used to a room to myself but i suppose it can’t be helped for the present  she went downstairs and walked into the garden the other members of the family were already there and hartley watching them from the diningroom window raised his brows in anguish as he noticed the partiality of the twins for cut flowers  it was as he soon discovered one of the smallest of the troubles that followed on his sudden increase of family his taste in easychairs met with the warm approval of george trimblett and it was clear that the latter regarded the tobaccojar as common property the twins’ belongings—a jointstock affair—occupied the most unlikely places in the house and their quarrels were only exceeded in offensiveness by their noisy and uncouth endearments afterwards painstaking but hopeless attempts on the part of miss trimblett to teach rosa her place added to the general confusion  by the end of a month the trimblett children were in full possession george trimblett owing to the good offices of mr vyner senior had obtained a berth in a shipping firm but the others spent the days at home the parties most concerned being unanimously of the opinion that it would be absurd to go to school before christmas they spoke with great fluency and good feeling of making a fresh start in the new year  interesting children said robert vyner who had dropped in one afternoon on the pretext of seeing how they were getting on i wish they were mine i should be so proud of them  miss hartley who was about to offer him some tea thought better of it and leaning back in her chair regarded him suspiciously  and after all what is a garden for pursued mr vyner as a steady succession of thuds sounded outside and ted hotly pursued by the twins appeared abruptly in the front garden and dribbled a football across the flowerbeds  they are spoiling the garden said joan flushing father is in despair  mr vyner shook his head indulgently girls will be girls he said glancing through the window at gertrude who had thrown herself on the ball and was being dragged round the garden by her heels i’m afraid you spoil them though  miss hartley did not trouble to reply  i saw your eldest boy yesterday at marling’s continued the industrious mr vyner he is getting on pretty well marling tells me he is steady and quiet i should think that he might be a great comfort to you in your old age  in spite of the utmost efforts to prevent it miss hartley began to laugh mr vyner regarded her in pained astonishment  i didn’t intend to be humorous he said with some severity i am fond of children and unfortunately i—i am childless  he buried his face in his handkerchief and removing it after a decent interval found that his indignant hostess was preparing to quit the room  don’t go he said hastily i haven’t finished yet  i haven’t got time to stay and talk nonsense said joan  i’m not going to said robert but i want to speak to you i have a confession to make  confession  mr vyner nodded with sad acquiescence i deceived you grossly the other day he said and it has been worrying me ever since  it doesn’t matter said joan with a lively suspicion of his meaning  pardon me said mr vyner with solemn politeness if i say that it does i—i lied to you and i have been miserable ever since  joan waited in indignant silence  i told you that i was married said mr vyner in thrilling tones i am not  miss hartley who had seated herself rose suddenly with a fair show of temper you said you were not going to talk nonsense she exclaimed  i am not said the other in surprise i am owning to a fault making a clean breast of my sins not without a faint hope that i am setting an example that will be beautifully and bountifully followed  i have really got too much to do to stay here listening to nonsense said miss hartley vigorously  i am a proud man resumed mr vyner and what it has cost me to make this confession tongue cannot tell but it is made and i now in perfect confidence—almost perfect confidence—await yours  i don’t understand you said joan pausing with her hand on the door  having repudiated my dear wife said mr vyner sternly i now ask nay demand that you repudiate captain trimblett—and all his works he added as earsplitting screams sounded from outside  i wish—— began joan in a low voice  yes said robert tenderly  that you would go  mr vyner started and half rose to his feet then he thought better of it  i thought at first that you meant it he said with a slight laugh  i do mean it said joan breathing quickly  robert rose at once i am very sorry he said with grave concern i did not think that you were taking my foolishness seriously  i ought to be amused i know said joan bitterly i ought to be humbly grateful to your father for having those children sent here i ought to be flattered to think that he should remember my existence and make plans for my future  he—he believes that you are married to captain trimblett said robert  fortunately for us said joan dryly  do you mean said robert regarding her fixedly that my father arranged that marriage  joan bit her lip no she said at last  he had something to do with it persisted robert what was it  joan shook her head  well i’ll ask him about it said mr vyner  please don’t said the girl it is my business  you have said so much said robert that you had better say more that’s what comes of losing your temper sit down and tell me all about it please  joan shook her head again  you are not angry with me said mr vyner  no  that’s all right then said robert cheerfully that encourages me to go to still further lengths you’ve got to tell me all about it i forgot to tell you but i’m a real partner in the firm now i’ve got a hard and fast share in the profits—had it last wednesday since when i have already grown two inches in exchange for this confidence i await yours you must speak a little louder if you want me to hear  i didn’t say anything said the girl  you are wasting time then said robert shaking his head and that eldest girl of yours may come in at any moment  despite her utmost efforts miss hartley failed to repress a smile greatly encouraged mr vyner placed a chair for her and took one by her side  tell me everything and i shall know where we are he said in a low voice  i would rather— began miss hartley  yes i know interrupted mr vyner with great gravity but we were not put into this world to please ourselves try again  miss hartley endeavoured to turn the conversation but in vain in less than ten minutes with a little skilful prompting she had told him all  i didn’t think that it was quite so bad as that said robert going very red i am very sorry—very i can’t think what my father was about and i suppose in the first place that it was my fault  yours exclaimed joan  for not displaying more patience said robert slowly but i was afraid of—of being forestalled  miss hartley succeeded in divesting her face of every atom of expression robert vyner gazed at her admiringly  i am glad that you understand me he murmured it makes things easier for me i don’t suppose that you have the faintest idea how shy and sensitive i really am  miss hartley without even troubling to look at him said that she was quite sure she had not  nobody has said robert shaking his head but i am going to make a fight against it i am going to begin now in the first place i want you not to think too hardly of my father he has been a very good father to me we have never had a really nasty word in our lives  i hope you never will have said joan with some significance  i hope not said robert but in any case i want to tell you—  miss hartley snatched away the hand he had taken and with a hasty glance at the door retreated a pace or two from him  what is the matter he inquired in a low voice  miss hartley’s eyes sparkled  my eldest daughter has just come in she said demurely i think you had better go     chapter xxiii     mrs chinnery received the news of her brother’s marriage with a calmness that was a source of considerable disappointment and annoyance to her friends and neighbours to begin with nobody knew how it had reached her and several worthy souls who had hastened to her hotfoot with what they had fondly deemed to be exclusive information had some difficulty in repressing their annoyance their astonishment was increased a week later on learning that she had taken a year’s lease of no 9 tranquil vale which had just become vacant and several men had to lie awake half the night listening to conjectures as to where she had got the money  most of the furniture at no 5 was her own and she moved it in piecemeal captain sellers who had his own ideas as to why she was coming to live next door to him and was somewhat flattered in consequence volunteered to assist and being debarred by deafness from learning that his services were refused caused intense excitement by getting wedged under a dressingtable on the stairs  to inquiries as to how he got there the captain gave but brief replies and those of an extremely sailorly description the whole of his really remarkable powers being devoted for the time being to the question of how he was to get out he was released at length by a man and a saw and mrs chinnery as soon as she could speak gave him a pressing invitation to take home with him any particular piece of the table for which he might have a fancy  he was back next morning with a gluepot and divided his time between boiling it up on the kitchen stove and wandering about the house in search of things to stick its unaccountable disappearance during his absence in another room did much to mar the harmony of an otherwise perfect day first of all he searched the house from top to bottom then screwing up his features he beckoned quietly to mrs chinnery  i hadn’t left it ten seconds he said mysteriously i went into the front room for a bit of stick and when i went back it had gone—vanished i was never more surprised in my life  don’t bother me said mrs chinnery i’ve got enough to do  eh  mrs chinnery who was hot and flustered shook her head at him  it’s a very odd thing said captain sellers shaking his head i never lost a gluepot before in my life—never do you know anything about that charwoman that’s helping you  yes of course said mrs chinnery  the captain put his hand to his ear  yes of course  i don’t like her expression said captain sellers firmly i’m a very good judge of faces and there’s a look an artful look about her eyes that i don’t like it’s my belief she’s got my gluepot stowed about her somewhere and i’m going to search her  you get out of my house cried the overwrought mrs chinnery  not without my gluepot said captain sellers hearing for once take that woman upstairs and search her a gluepot—a hot gluepot—can’t go without hands  frail in body but indomitable in spirit he confronted the accused who having overheard his remarks came in and shook her fist in his face and threatened him with the terrors of the law  a gluepot can’t go without hands he said obstinately if you had asked me for a little you could have had it and welcome but you had no business to take it  take it vociferated the accused what good do you think it would be to me i’ve ’ad eleven children and two husbands and i’ve never been accused of stealing a gluepot before where do you think i could put it  i don’t know said the captain as soon as he understood that’s what i’m curious about you go upstairs with mrs chinnery and if she don’t find that you’ve got that gluepot concealed on you i shall be very much surprised why not own up the truth before you scald yourself  instead of going upstairs the charwoman went to the back door and sat on the step to get her breath and giving way to a sense of humour which had survived the two husbands and eleven children wound up with a strong fit of hysterics captain sellers who watched through the window as she was being taken away said that perhaps it was his fault for putting temptation in her way  mrs chinnery tried to keep her door fast next morning but it was of no use the captain was in and out all day and having found a tin of green paint and a brush among his stores required constant watching the day after mrs chinnery saw her only means of escape and at nine o’clock in the morning with fair words and kind smiles sent him into salthaven for some picturecord he made four journeys that day he came back from the last in a butcher’s cart and having handed mrs chinnery the packet of hooks and eyes for which he had taken a month’s wear out of his right leg bade her a hurried goodnight and left for home on the arm of the butcher  he spent the next day or two in an easychair by the fire but the arrival of mrs willett to complete the furnishing of no 5 from her own surplus stock put him on his legs again as an old neighbour and intimate friend of mr truefitt’s he proffered his services and mrs willett who had an oldfashioned belief in man accepted them his one idea—the pot of paint being to him like a penny in a schoolboy’s pocket—was to touch things up a bit mrs willett’s idea was for him to help hang pictures and curtains  the steps are so rickety they are only fit for a man she screamed in his ear martha has been over with them twice already  captain sellers again referred to the touchingup properties of green paint mrs willett took it from him apparently for the purpose of inspection and he at once set out in search of the gluepot  we’ll do the curtains downstairs first she said to martha upstairs can wait  the captain spent the morning on the steps his difficulties being by no means lessened by the tremolo movement which martha called steadying them twice he was nearly shaken from his perch like an overripe plum but all went well until they were hanging the curtains in the best bedroom when martha stooping to recover a dropped ring shut the steps up like a pair of compasses  the captain who had hold of the curtains at the time brought them down with him and lay groaning on the floor with the help of her mistress who came hurrying up on hearing the fall martha got him on to the bed and sent for the doctor  how do you feel inquired mrs willett eying him anxiously  bad said the captain closing his eyes every bone in my body is broken i believe it feels like it  mrs willett shook her head and sought for words to reassure him keep your spirits up she said encouragingly don’t forget that ’there’s a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft to look after the life of poor jack’  captain sellers opened his eyes and regarded her fixedly he wouldn’t ha’ been sitting there long if that fool martha had been holding the steps he said with extraordinary bitterness  he closed his eyes again and refused to speak until the doctor came then having been stripped and put to bed for purposes of examination he volunteered information as to his condition which twice caused the doctor to call him to order  you ought to be thankful it’s no worse he said severely  the captain sniffed when you’ve done pinching my leg he said disagreeably i’ll put it back into bed again  the doctor relinquished it at once and standing by the bed regarded him thoughtfully  well you’ve had a shock he said at last and you had better stay in bed for a few days  not here said mrs willett quickly my daughter and her husband will be home in a day or two  the doctor looked thoughtful again then he bent and spoke in the captain’s ear  we are going to move you to your own house he said  no you’re not said the other promptly  you’ll be more comfortable there urged the doctor  i’m not going to be moved said captain sellers firmly it might be fatal i had a chap once—fell from aloft—and after he’d been in the saloon for a day or two i had him carried for’ard and he died on the way and he wasn’t nearly as bad as i am  well we’ll see how you are tomorrow said the doctor with a glance at mrs willett  i shall be worse tomorrow said the captain cheerfully but i don’t want to give any trouble send my housekeeper in to look after me she can sleep in the next room  they argued with him until his growing deafness rendered argument useless a certain love of change and excitement would not be denied captain sellers attended by his faithful housekeeper slept that night at no 5 and awoke next morning to find his prognostications as to his condition fully confirmed  i’m aching all over he said to mrs willett i can’t bear to be touched  you’ll have to be moved to your own house said mrs chinnery who had come in at mrs willett’s request to see what could be done we expect my brother home in a day or two  let him come said the captain feebly i sha’n’t bite him  but you’re in his bed said mrs chinnery  eh  in his bed screamed mrs chinnery  i sha’n’t bite him repeated the captain  but he can’t sleep with you said mrs chinnery red with loud speaking  i don’t want him to said captain sellers i’ve got nothing against him and in a general way of speaking i’m not what could be called a particular man—but i draw the line  mrs chinnery went downstairs hastily and held a council of war with mrs willett and martha it was decided to wait for the doctor but the latter when he came could give no assistance  he’s very sore and stiff he said thoughtfully but it’s nothing serious it’s more vanity than anything else he likes being made a fuss of and being a centre of attraction he’s as tough as leather and the most difficult old man i have ever encountered  is he quite right in his head demanded mrs chinnery hotly  the doctor pondered he’s a little bit childish but his head will give more trouble to other people than to himself he said at last be as patient with him as you can and if you can once persuade him to get up perhaps he will consent to be moved  mrs chinnery despite a naturally hot temper did her best but in vain mrs willett was promptly denounced as a murderess and the captain holding forth to one or two callers was moved almost to tears as he reflected upon the ingratitude and hardness of woman an account of the accident in the salthaven gazette which described him as lying at death’s door was not without its effect in confining him to mr truefitt’s bed  the latter gentleman and his wife in blissful ignorance of the accident returned home on the following evening mrs willett and mrs chinnery apprised by letter were both there to receive them and the former after keeping up appearances in a stately fashion for a few minutes was finally persuaded to relent and forgive them both after which mrs truefitt was about to proceed upstairs to take off her things when she was stopped by mrs chinnery  there—there is somebody in your room said the latter  in my room said mrs truefitt in a startled voice  we couldn’t write to you said mrs willett with a little shade of reproach in her voice because you didn’t give us your address captain sellers had an accident and is in your bed  who said the astounded mr truefitt what  mrs willett helped by mrs chinnery explained the affair to him mr truefitt with the exception of a few startled ejaculations listened in sombre silence  well we must use the next room for tonight he said at last and i’ll have him out first thing in the morning  his housekeeper sleeps there said mrs willett shaking her head  and a niece of hers who helps her with him in the little room added mrs chinnery  mr truefitt got up and walked about the room broken remarks about a nice homecoming and galvanized mummies escaped him at intervals mrs willett endured it for ten minutes and then suddenly remembering what was due to a motherinlaw made a successful intervention in a somewhat subdued mood they sat down to supper  the truefitts slept at mrs willett’s that night but mr truefitt was back first thing next morning to take possession of his own house he found captain sellers propped up with pillows eating his breakfast and more than dubious as to any prospects of an early removal  better wait a week or two and see how i go on he said slowly i sha’n’t give any trouble  but you are giving trouble shouted the fuming mr truefitt you’re an absolute nuisance if it hadn’t been for your officiousness it wouldn’t have happened  the captain put his plate aside and drew himself up in the bed  get out of my room he said in a high thin voice  you get out of my bed shouted the incensed mr truefitt i’ll give you ten minutes to dress yourself and get out of my house if you’re not out by then i’ll carry you out  he waited downstairs for a quarter of an hour and then going to the bedroom again discovered that the door was locked through the keyhole the housekeeper informed him that it was the captain’s orders and begged him to go away as the latter was now having his morning’s nap  captain sellers left with flags flying and drums beating three days later to friends and neighbours generally he confided the interesting fact that his departure was hastened by a nightly recurring dream of being bitten by sharks     chapter xxiv     the news that mrs chinnery had taken a house of her own and was anxious to let rooms gave robert vyner an idea which kept him busy the whole of an evening first of all he broached it to hartley but finding him divided between joy and nervousness he took the matter into his own hands and paid a visit to tranquil vale the result of which he communicated with some pride to joan hartley the same afternoon  it was my own idea entirely he said with a feeble attempt to conceal a little natural pride some people would call it an inspiration directly i heard that mrs chinnery was anxious to let rooms i thought of your children—i mentioned the idea to your father and escaped an embrace by a hair’s breadth i was prepared to remind him that ’absence makes the heart grow fonder’ and to follow it up with ’distance lends enchantment to the view’ but it was unnecessary it will be a great thing for mrs chinnery  miss hartley looked thoughtful  and you said robert reproachfully  if father is satisfied— began miss hartley  ’satisfied’ is a cold and inadequate word said robert he was delighted he could not have been more pleased if i had told him that the entire five had succumbed to an attack of croup i left my work to look after itself to come and give you the news  you are very kind said joan after some consideration  it is a good thing for all concerned said robert it is a load off my mind the last time i was here i was interrupted at a most critical moment by the entrance of miss trimblett  and now instead of coming here to see them you will have to go to mrs chinnery’s said joan  when i want to said mr vyner with a forced smile as the twins came rushing into the room yes  the exodus took place three days afterward to the entire satisfaction of all concerned tranquil vale alone regarded the advent of the newcomers with a certain amount of uneasiness the joy of ted and the twins when they found that there was a river at the bottom of the garden threatening to pass all bounds in a state of wild excitement they sat on the fence and waved to passing craft until in an attempt to do justice to a larger ship than usual miss gertrude trimblett waved herself off the fence on to the stones of the foreshore below  captain sellers who had been looking on with much interest at once descended and rendered first aid it was the first case he had had since he had left the sea but after a careful examination he was able to assure the sufferer that she had broken her right leg in two places the discovery was received with howls of lamentation from both girls until dolly blinded with tears happened to fall over the injured limb and received in return such hearty kicks from it that the captain was compelled to reconsider his diagnosis and after a further examination discovered that it was only bent in quite a professional manner he used a few technical terms that completely covered his discomfiture  it was the beginning of a friendship which tranquil vale did its best to endure with fortitude and against which mrs chinnery fought in vain in the company of ted and the twins captain sellers renewed his youth together they discovered the muddiest places on the foreshore and together they borrowed a neighbour’s boat and sailed down the river in quest of adventures with youth at the prow and dimsighted age at the helm they found several news of their doings made hartley congratulate himself warmly on their departure  mrs chinnery is just the woman to manage them he said to joan and truefitt tells me that having children to look after has changed her wonderfully  miss hartley with a little shiver said she could quite understand it  i mean for the better said her father he said she is getting quite young and jolly again and he told me that young saunders is there a great deal miss hartley raised her eyebrows in mute interrogation  he pretends that he goes to see george said her father dropping his voice but truefitt thinks that it is jessie i suppose trimblett won’t mind he always thought a lot of saunders i don’t know whether you ought to interfere  certainly not said joan flushing what has it got to do with me  well i just mentioned it said hartley although i suppose mrs chinnery is mostly responsible while they are with her i am writing to tell trimblett that the children are at tranquil vale when he comes back perhaps he will make other arrangements  very likely said his daughter abruptly or perhaps he will marry mrs chinnery  mr hartley who was at supper put down his knife and fork and sat eying her in very natural amazement marry mrs chinnery he gasped but how can he  i mean said joan with a sudden remembrance of the state of affairs i mean if anything should happen to me  mr hartley finished his supper and drawing his chair up to the fire sat smoking in thoughtful silence  and if anything happens to trimblett perhaps you will marry again he said at last  miss hartley shook her head i am not afraid she said ambiguously  her confidence was put to the test less than a fortnight later by an unexpected visit from mr robert vyner who entering the room in a somewhat breathless condition accepted a chair and sat gazing at her with an air of mysterious triumph  i’m the bearer of important news he announced dispatches from the front you’ll hear all about it from your father when he comes home but i wanted to be the first with it  what is the matter inquired joan  mr vyner looked shocked all important news good or bad should be broken gently he said reproachfully do you know any scotch  scotch said the mystified miss hartley  mr vyner nodded the best laid schemes o’ mice and men gang oft agley he quoted in a thrilling voice do you understand that  i’ll wait till father comes home announced miss hartley with some decision  there are other quotations bearing on the matter in hand said mr vyner thoughtfully but i have forgotten them at present i am thinking of you to the utter exclusion of everything else not that that is anything unusual far from it to cut a long story short captain trimblett has been left behind at san francisco with malaria and the mate has taken the ship on  miss hartley gave a little cry of concern  he has had it before said mr vyner composedly but he seems to have got it bad this time and when he is fit enough he is coming home now what are you going to do  poor captain trimblett said joan i am so sorry  what are you going to do repeated mr vyner impressively his children are at salthaven and he will live here because my father and i had practically decided to give him the berth of ship’s husband after this voyage he will have it a little sooner that’s all appropriate berth for a marrying man like that isn’t it sounds much more romantic than marine superintendent  i made sure that he would be away for at least two years said joan regarding him helplessly  there is nothing certain in this world said mr vyner sedately you should have thought of that before the whole thing is bound to come out now there are only two courses open to you you might marry captain trimblett in reality—  what is the other inquired joan as he paused  the other said mr vyner slowly and lowering his voice the other stands before you all he can urge in his favour is that he is younger than trimblett and as i have said on another occasion with——  if there is nothing more than that in his favour—— said joan turning away  nothing said robert humbly unless—  unless what  unless you know of anything  joan hartley her gaze still averted shook her head  still said mr vyner with an air of great thoughtfulness a paragon would be awful to live with awful fancy marrying bassett for instance fancy being married to a man you could never find fault with  there is a third course open to me said joan turning round i could go away  mr vyner got up slowly and took a step toward her would you—would you sooner go away than stay with me he said in a low voice  i—i don’t want to go away said joan after a long pause  mr vyner took two more steps  i’m so fond of salthaven added joan hastily  so am i said robert it seems to me that we have a lot of ideas in common don’t you think it would simplify matters if you stayed at salthaven and married me  joan eyed him gravely i don’t think it would simplify matters with your father she said slowly  mr vyner’s fourth and last step took him to her chair  is that your only objection he murmured bending over her  i might think of others—in time said joan  mr vyner bent a little lower but so slowly that miss hartley was compelled to notice it she got up suddenly and confronted him he took both her hands in his but so gently that she offered no resistance  that is a bargain he said trying to steady his voice i will soon arrange matters with my father  joan smiled faintly and shook her head  you’ll see said robert confidently i’ve been a good son to him and he knows it and i always have had my own way i’m not going to alter now it wouldn’t be good for him  you are holding my hands said joan  i know said mr vyner i like it  he released them reluctantly and stood looking at her miss hartley after a brave attempt to meet his gaze lowered her eyes for a time neither of them spoke  i’m as bad as trimblett said robert at last i am beginning to believe in fate it is my firm opinion that we were intended for each other i can’t imagine marrying anybody else can you  miss hartley still looking down made no reply     chapter xxv     robert vyner walked home slowly trying as he went to evolve a scheme which should in the first place enable him to have his own way and in the second to cause as little trouble as possible to everybody as a result of his deliberations he sought his father whom he found enjoying a solitary cup of tea and told him that he had been to hartley’s with the news of captain trimblett’s illness he added casually that mrs trimblett was looking remarkably well and he spoke feelingly of the pleasure afforded to all rightminded people at being able to carry a little sympathy and consolation into the homes of the afflicted  mr vyner senior sipped his tea she has got her father and the children if she wants sympathy he said gruffly  robert shook his head it’s not quite the same thing he said gravely  the children ought to be with her said his father i never understood why they should have gone to mrs chinnery still that’s not my affair  it was to assist mrs chinnery for one thing said robert and besides they were awfully in the way  he heard his father put his teacup down and felt rather than saw that he was gazing at him with some intentness with a preoccupied air he rose and left the room  satisfied with the impression he had made he paid another visit to hartley’s on the day following and then despite joan’s protests became an almost daily visitor his assurance that they were duty visits paid only with a view to their future happiness only served to mystify her the fact that hartley twice plucked up courage to throw out hints as to the frequency of his visits and the odd glances with which his father favoured him satisfied him that he was in the right path  for a fortnight he went his way unchecked and apparently blind to the growing stiffness of his father every time the subject was mentioned spoke freely of mrs trimblett and the beautiful resignation with which she endured her husband’s misfortunes his father listened for the most part in silence until coming at last to the conclusion that there was nothing to be gained by that policy he waited until his wife had left the diningroom one evening and ventured a solemn protest  she is a very nice girl said the delighted robert  just so said his father leaning toward a candle and lighting his cigar although perhaps that is hardly the way to speak of a married woman  and we have been friends for a long time said robert  mr vyner coughed dryly  just so he said again  why shouldn’t i go and see her when i like said robert after a pause  she is another man’s wife said his father and it is a censorious world  robert vyner looked down at the cloth if she were not i suppose there would be some other objection he said gloomily  mr vyner laid his cigar on the side of a plate and drew himself up my boy he said impressively i don’t think i deserve that both your mother and myself would—ha—always put your happiness before our own private inclinations  he picked up his cigar again and placing it in his mouth looked the personification of injured fatherhood  do you mean said robert slowly do you mean that if she were single you would be willing for me to marry her  it is no good discussing that said mr vyner with an air of great consideration  but would you persisted his son  mr vyner was a very truthful man as a rule but there had been instances—he added another  yes he said with a slight gasp  robert sprang up with a haste that overturned his coffee and seizing his father’s hand shook it with enthusiasm mr vyner somewhat affected responded heartily  anything possible for you bob he said fervently but this is impossible  his son looked at him i have never known you to go back on your word he said emphatically  i never have said mr vyner  your word is your bond said robert smiling at him and now i want to tell you something  well said the other regarding him with a little uneasiness  she is not married said robert calmly  mr vyner started up and his cigar fell unheeded to the floor  what he said loudly  she is not married repeated his son  mr vyner sank back in his chair again and looking round mechanically for his cigar found it tracing a design on the carpet  d———n he said fervently as he stooped to remove it he tossed it in his plate and leaning back glared at his son  do you mean that she didn’t marry trimblett he inquired in a trembling voice  yes  mr vyner drew the cigarbox toward him and selecting a cigar with great care nipped off the end and having lighted it sat smoking in silence  this is very extraordinary he said at last watching his son’s eyes  i suppose she had a reason said robert in a matteroffact voice  mr vyner winced he began to realize the state of affairs and sat trembling in impotent then he rose and paced up and down he thought of his veiled threats to hartley the idea that his son should know of them added his anger  you are of full age he said bitterly and have your own income—now  robert flushed and then turned pale  i will give that up if you wish provided you’ll retain hartley he said quietly  mr vyner continued his perambulation smoked furiously and muttered something forcing conditions upon him  i can’t leave hartley in the lurch said he quietly it’s not his fault i can look to myself  mr vyner stopped and regarded him don’t be a fool he said shortly if it wasn’t for mother—  his son repressed a smile by an effort and feel more at ease one of mrs vyner’s privileges was to serve as an excuse for any display of weakness of which her husband might be guilty  this pretended marriage will be a further scandal said mr vyner frowning what are you going to tell people  nothing said robert  do you think it is conducive to discipline to marry the daughter of my chief clerk continued his father  robert shook his head  no he said decidedly i have been thinking of that it would be better to give him a small interest in the firm—equal to his salary say  well aware of the uses of physical exercise at moments of mental stress mr vyner started on his walk again he began to wonder whether after all he ought to consider his wife’s feelings in the matter  she is a very nice girl said robert after watching him for some time i wish you knew her  mr vyner waved the remark away with a large impatient hand  she declines to marry me against your wishes continued his son but now that you have given your consent—  the room suddenly became too small for mr vyner he passed out into the hall and a few seconds later his son heard the library door close with an eloquent bang he shrugged his shoulders and lighting a cigarette sat down to wait he was halfway through his third cigarette when the door opened and his father came into the room again  i have been talking to your mother said mr vyner in a stately fashion she is very much upset of course very she is not strong and i—ha—we came to the conclusion that you must do as you please  he stepped to the table and with a trembling hand helped himself to a whiskey and soda robert took up a glass with a little claret in it  success to the young couple he said cheerfully  mr vyner paused with the glass at his lips and eyed him indignantly then with a wooden expression of face—intended possibly to suggest that he had not heard—took a refreshing drink he placed the glass on the table and turned to see his son’s outstretched hand     chapter xxvi     captain trimblett was back again in his old quarters and already so much improved in health that he was able to repel with considerable vigor the many inquirers who were anxious to be put in possession of the real facts concerning his pretended marriage it was a subject on which the captain was dumb but in some mysterious fashion it came to be understood that it was a device on the part of a selfsacrificing and chivalrous shipmaster to save miss hartley from the attentions of a determined admirer she had met in london it was the version sanctioned—if not invented—by mr robert vyner  it was a source of some little protestation of spirit to miss jelks that the captain had been brought home by his faithful boatswain conduct based on an idea of two years’ absence had to be suddenly and entirely altered she had had a glimpse of them both on the day of their arrival but the fact that mr walters was with his superior officer and that she was with mr filer prevented her from greeting him  in the wrath of his dismissal mr filer met him more than halfway  somebody ’ad to look arter ’im said mr walters referring to the captain as he sat in rosa’s kitchen the following evening and he always ’ad a liking for me besides which i wanted to get ’ome and see you  you have got it bad said rosa with a gratified titter  look arter you i ought to ha’ said retorted mr walters glowering at her and from wot i hear from bassett it’s about time i did  ho said miss jelks taking a deep breath ho really  i had it out of ’im this morning continued mr walters eying her sternly i waited for ’im as he come out of his ’ouse he didn’t want to tell me at first but when he found as ’ow he’d been late for the office if he didn’t he thought better of it  miss jelks leaned back in her chair with a ladylike sneer upon her expressive features  i’ll bassett him she said slowly  and i’ll filer him said mr walters not to be outdone in the coining of verbs  it’s a pity he don’t say them things to my face said rosa i’d soon let him know  he’s going to said the boatswain readily i said we’d meet him on sunday arternoon by kegg’s boathouse then we’ll see wot you’ve got to say for yourself shut that door d’ye want to freeze me  i’ll shut it when you’re gone said rosa calmly make haste else i shall catch cold i’ll go with you on sunday afternoon—just so as you can beg my pardon—and after that i don’t want anything more to do with you you’d try the temper of a saint you would  mr walters looked round the warm and comfortable kitchen and his face fell i ain’t going to judge you till i’ve heard both sides he said slowly and then seeing no signs of relenting in rosa’s face passed out into the black night  he walked down to the rendezvous on sunday afternoon with a welldressed circle miss jelks only spoke to him once and that was when he trod on her dress a nipping wind stirred the surface of the river and the place was deserted except for the small figure of bassett sheltering under the lee of the boathouse he came to meet them and raising a new bowler hat stood regarding miss jelks with an expression in which compassion and judicial severity were pretty evenly combined  tell me afore her wot you told me the other day said mr walters plunging at once into business  i would rather not said bassett adjusting his spectacles and looking from one to the other but in pursuance of my promise i have no alternative  fire away commanded the boatswain  bassett coughed and then in a thin but firm voice complied the list of miss jelks’s misdeeds was a long one and the day was cold but he did not miss a single item miss jelks eying him with some concern as he proceeded began to think he must have eyes at the back of his head the boatswain whose colour was deepening as he listened regarded her with a lurid eye  and you believe it all said rosa turning to him with a pitying smile as bassett concluded his tale why don’t he go on he ain’t finished yet  wot said mr walters with energy  he ain’t told you about making love to me yet said rosa  i didn’t said the youth i shouldn’t think of doing such a thing it was all a mistake of yours  miss jelks uttered a cruel laugh ask him whether he followed me like a pet dog she said turning to the astonished boatswain ask him if he didn’t say he loved the ground my feet trod on ask him if he wanted to take me to marsham fair and cried because i wouldn’t go  eh gasped the boatswain staring at the bewildered bassett  ask him if he didn’t go down on his knees to me in pringle’s lane one day—a muddy day—and ask me to be his continued the unscrupulous rosa ask him if he didn’t say i was throwing myself away on a woodenheaded boatswain with bandy legs  bandy wot ejaculated the choking mr walters as he bestowed an involuntary glower at the limbs in question  i can assure you i never said so said bassett earnestly i never noticed before that they were bandy and i never—  an enormous fist held just beneath his nose stopped him in mad career  if you was only three foot taller and six or seven stone ’eavier said the palpitating boatswain i should know wot to do with you  i assure you— began bassett  if you say another word declared mr walters in grating accents i’ll take you by the scruff of your little neck and drop you in the river and if you tell any more lies about my young woman to a living soul i’ll tear you limb from limb and box your ears arterwards  with a warning shake of the head at the gasping bassett he turned to miss jelks but that injured lady with her head at an alarming angle was already moving away even when he reached her side she seemed unaware of his existence and it was not until the afternoon was well advanced that she deigned to take the slightest notice of his abject apologies  it’s being at sea and away from you that does it he said humbly  and a nasty jealous temper added miss jelks  i’m going to try for a shoreberth said her admirer i spoke to mr vyner—the young one—about it yesterday and he’s going to see wot he can do for me if i get that i shall be a different man  he’d do anything for miss joan said the mollified rosa thoughtfully and if you behave yourself and conquer your wicked jealous nature i might put in a word for you with her myself  mr walters thanked her warmly and with a natural anxiety regarding his future prospects paid frequent visits to learn what progress she was making he haunted the kitchen with the persistency of a blackbeetle and became such a nuisance at last that miss hartley espoused his cause almost with enthusiasm  he is very much attached to rosa but he takes up a lot of her time she said to robert vyner as they were on their way one evening to tranquil vale to pay a visit to captain trimblett  i’ll get him something for rosa’s sake said robert softly i shall never forget that she invited me to breakfast when her mistress would have let me go empty away do you remember  i remember wondering whether you were going to stay all day said joan  it never occurred to me said mr vyner in tones of regret i’m afraid you must have thought me very neglectful  they walked on happily through the dark cold night until the lighted windows of tranquil vale showed softly in the blackness there was a light in the front room of no 5 and the sound of somebody moving hurriedly about followed immediately upon mr vyner’s knock then the door opened and captain trimblett stood before them  come in he said heartily come in i’m all alone this evening  he closed the door behind them and while mr vyner stood gazing moodily at the mound on the table which appeared to have been hastily covered up with a rather soiled towel placed a couple of easy chairs by the fire mr vyner with his eyes still on the table took his seat slowly and then transferring his regards to captain trimblett asked him in a stern vein what he was smiling at joan for  she smiled at me first said the captain  mr vyner shook his head at both of them and at an offer of a glass of beer looked so undecided that the captain after an uneasy glance at the table which did not escape mr vyner went to the kitchen to procure some  i wonder said robert musingly as he turned to the table i wonder if it would be bad manners to—  yes said joan promptly  mr vyner sighed and tried to peer under a corner of the towel i can see a saucer he announced excitedly  miss hartley rose and pointing with a rigid forefinger at her own chair changed places with him  you want to see yourself declared mr vyner  miss hartley scorned to reply  let’s share the guilt continued the other you shut your eyes and raise the corner of the towel and i’ll do the ’peeping’  the return of the unconscious captain with the beer rendered a reply unnecessary  we half thought you would be at number nine he said as the captain poured him out a glass  i’m keeping house this evening said the captain or else i should have been  it’s nice for you to have your children near you said joan softly  captain trimblett assented and it’s nice to be able to give up the sea he said with a grateful glance at vyner i’m getting old and that last bout of malaria hasn’t made me any younger  the youngsters seem to get on all right with mrs chinnery said robert eying him closely  splendidly said the captain i should never have thought that she would have been so good with children she half worships them  not all of them said mr vyner  all of ’em said the captain  twins as well said mr vyner raising his voice  she likes them best of all was the reply  mr vyner rose slowly from his chair she is a woman in a million he said impressively i wonder why—  they’re very good girls said the captain hastily old sellers thinks there is nobody like them  i expect you’ll be making a home for them soon said robert thoughtfully although it will be rather hard on mrs chinnery to part with them won’t it  we are all in the hands of fate said the captain gazing suddenly at his tumbler fate rules all things from the cradle to the grave  he poured himself out a little more beer and lapsing into a reminiscent mood cited various instances in his own career in confirmation it was an interesting subject but time was pressing and mr vyner after a regretful allusion to that part announced that they must be going joan rose and captain trimblett rising at the same moment knocked over his beer and in a moment of forgetfulness snatched the towel from the table to wipe it up the act revealed an electroplated saladbowl of noble proportions a saucer of whitening and some pieces of rag                                    ————
