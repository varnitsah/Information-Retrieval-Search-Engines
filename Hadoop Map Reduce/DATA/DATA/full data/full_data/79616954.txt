lady four generations ago used to say ‘it is a great comfort to think that at the day of judgment we shall know the whole truth about the gowrie conspiracy at last’  since the author as a child read ‘the tales of a grandfather’ and shared king jamie’s disappointment when there was no pot of gold but an armed man in the turret he had supposed that we do know all about the gowrie conspiracy that it was a plot to capture the king carry him to fastcastle and ‘see how the country would take it’ as in the case of the gunpowder plot but just as father gerard has tried to show that the gunpowder affair may have been cecil’s plot so modern historians doubt whether the gowrie mystery was not a conspiracy by king james himself  mr hume brown appears rather to lean to this opinion in the second volume of his ‘history of scotland’ and dr masson in his valuable edition of the ‘register of the privy council’ is also dubious  mr louis barbé in his ‘tragedy of gowrie house’ holds a brief against the king  thus i have been tempted to study this ‘auld misterie’ afresh and have convinced myself that such historians as sir walter scott mr frazer tytler and mr hill burton were not wrong the plot was not the king’s conspiracy but the desperate venture of two very young men  the precise object remains obscure in detail but the purpose was probably to see how a deeply discontented kirk and country ‘would take it’  in working at this fascinatingly mysterious puzzle i have made use of manuscript materials hitherto uncited  the most curious of these the examinations and documents of the ‘country writer’ sprot had been briefly summarised in sir william fraser’s ‘memorials of the earls of haddington’  my attention was drawn to this source by the rev john anderson of the general register house who aided sir william fraser in the compilation of his book  the earl of haddington generously permitted me to have copies made of the documents which lady cecily bailliehamilton was kind enough to search for and rediscover in an enormous mass of documents bequeathed by the learned first earl  on reading the calendars of the hatfield mss i had observed that several letters by the possible conspirator logan of restalrig were in the possession of the marquis of salisbury who was good enough to permit photographs of some specimens to be taken  these were compared by mr anderson with the alleged plotletters of logan at edinburgh while photographs of the plotletters were compared with logan’s authentic letters at hatfield by mr gunton to whose acuteness and energy i owe the greatest gratitude  the results of the comparison settle the riddle of three centuries  the other hitherto unused manuscripts are in no more recondite place than the record office in london and i do not know how they managed to escape the notice of previous writers on the subject  to dr masson’s ‘register of the privy council’ i am indebted for the sequel of the curious adventure of mr robert oliphant whose part in the mystery hitherto overlooked is decisive if we accept the evidence—a point on which the reader must form his own opinion  for copies made at the record office i have to thank the care and accuracy of miss e m thompson  to mr anderson’s learning and zest in this ‘longest and sorest chase’ as king james called his hunt on the morning of the fatal august 5 i am under the deepest obligations  the allurements of a romantic conclusion have never tempted him to leave the strait path of historical impartiality  i have also to thank mr henry paton for his careful copies of the haddington mss extracts from the treasurer’s accounts and other researches  for permission to reproduce the picture of fastcastle by the rev mr thomson of duddingston i have to thank the kindness of mrs blackwoodporter  the painting probably of about 1820 when compared with the photograph of today shows the destruction wrought by wind and weather in the old fortalice  my obligations to sir james balfour paul lyon king of arms for information on points of heraldry ought to be gratefully acknowledged  since this book was written the author has had an opportunity to read an apology for the ruthvens by the late andrew bisset  this treatise is apt to escape observation it is entitled ‘sir walter scott’ and occupies pp 172–303 in ‘essays on historical truth’ long out of print 0a  on many points mr bisset agreed with mr barbé in his ‘tragedy of gowrie house’ and my replies to mr barbé serve for his predecessor  but mr bisset found no evidence that the king had formed a plot against gowrie by a modification of the contemporary conjecture of sir william bowes he suggested that a brawl between the king and the master of ruthven occurred in the turret occasioned by an atrocious insult offered to the master by the king  this hypothesis for various reasons does not deserve discussion  mr bisset appeared to attribute the sprot papers to the combined authorship of the king and sir thomas hamilton which our new materials disprove  a critic who like mr bisset accused the king of poisoning prince henry and many other persons was not an unprejudiced historian     contents

by the sphinx of the past to the curious of the new generations  these questions do not greatly concern the scientific historian who is busy with constitutionmaking statistics progress degeneration in short with human evolution  these high matters these streams of tendency form the staple of history but the problems of personal character and action still interest some inquiring minds  among these enigmas nearly the most obscure ‘the gowrie conspiracy’ is our topic  this affair is one of the haunting mysteries of the past one of the problems that nobody has solved  the events occurred in 1600 but the interest which they excited was so keen that belief in the guilt or innocence of the two noble brothers who perished in an august afternoon was a party shibboleth in the wars of the saints against the malignants the strife of cavaliers and roundheads  the problem has ever since attracted the curious as do the enigma of perkin warbeck the true character of richard iii the real face behind ‘the iron mask’ the identity of the false pucelle and the innocence or guilt of mary stuart  in certain respects the gowrie mystery is necessarily less attractive than that of ‘the fairest and most pitiless queen on earth’  there is no woman in the story  the world of course when the ruthvens died at once acted on the maxim cherchez la femme  the woman in the case men said was the beautiful queen anne of denmark wife of james vi  that fair and frivolous dame ‘very very woman’ certainly did her best by her behaviour to encourage the belief that she was the cause of these sorrows  even so when the bonny earl moray—the tallest and most beautiful man in scotland—died like a lion dragged down by wolves the people sang      he was a brave gallant        and he rode at the ring     and the bonny earl moray        he might have been the king      he was a brave gallant        and he rode at the glove     and the bonny earl moray        he was the queen’s love  on one side was a beautiful queen mated with james vi a pedant and a clown  on the other side were first the bonny earl then the earl of gowrie both young brave handsome both suddenly slain by the king’s friends none knew why  the opinion of the godly of the kirk of the people and even of politicians leaped to the erroneous conclusion that the young men perished like königsmarck because they were beautiful and beloved and because the queen was fair and kind and the king was ugly treacherous and jealous  the rumour also ran at least in tradition that gowrie ‘might have been the king’ an idea examined in appendix a here then was an explanation of the slaying of the ruthvens on the lines dear to romance  the humorous king jamie who if he was not always sensible at least treated his flighty wife with abundance of sense had to play the part of king mark of cornwall to gowrie’s sir tristram  for this theory we shall show no evidence exists and in ‘looking for the woman’ fancy found two men  the queen was alternately said to love gowrie and to love his brother the master of ruthven a lad of nineteen—if she did not love both at once  it is curious that the affair did not give rise to ballads if it did none has reached us  in truth there was no woman in the case and this of course makes the mystery much less exciting than that of mary stuart for whom so many swords and pens have been drawn  the interest of character and of love is deficient  of gowrie’s character and even of his religion apart from his learning and fascination we really know almost nothing  did he cherish that strongest and most sacred of passions revenge had he brooded over it in italy where revenge was subtler and craftier than in scotland  did this passion blend with the vein of fanaticism in his nature  had he been biding his time and dreaming over sea boyish dreams of vengeance and ambition  all this appears not improbable and would if true explain all but evidence is defective  had gowrie really cherished the legacy of revenge for a father slain and a mother insulted had he studied the subtleties of italian crime pondered over an italian plot till it seemed feasible and communicated his vision to the boy brother whom he found at home—the mystery would be transparent                             picture james vi  as to king james we know him well  the babe ‘wronged in his mother’s womb’ threatened by conspirators before his birth terrified by a harsh tutor as a child bullied preached at captured insulted ruled now by debauched favourites now by godly ruffians james naturally grew up a dissembler and betrayed his father’s murderer with a kiss  he was frightened into deceit he could be cruel he became as far as he might a tyrant  but though not the abject coward of tradition james as he himself observed was never the man to risk his life in a doubtful brawl on the chance that his enemies might perish while he escaped  for him a treachery of that kind an affair of sword and dagger fights on staircases and in turrets and chambers in the midst of a town of doubtful loyalty had certainly no attractions  moreover he had a sense of humour  this has been the opinion of our best historians scott mr tytler and mr hill burton but enthusiastic writers have always espoused the cause of the victims the ruthvens so young brave handsome so untimely slain as it were on their own hearthstone  other authors such as dr masson in our own day and mr s r gardiner have abstained from a verdict or have attempted the via media have leaned to the idea that the ruthvens died in an accidental brawl caused by a nervous and motiveless fit of terror on the part of the king  thus the question is unsettled the problem is unsolved  why did the jolly hunt at falkland in the bright august morning end in the sanguinary scuffle in the town house at perth the deaths of the ruthvens the tumult in the town the king’s homeward ride through the dark and dripping twilight the laying of the dead brothers side by side while the old family servant weeps above their bodies and the wailing of the queen and her ladies in falkland palace when the torches guide the cavalcade into the palace court and the strange tale of slaughter is variously told ‘the reports so fighting together that no man could have any certainty’ where lay the actual truth  this problem with which the following pages are concerned is much darker and more complex than that of the guilty ‘casket letters’ attributed to mary queen of scots  the queen did write these in the madness of a criminal passion or she wrote parts of them the rest being garbled or forged  in either case her motives and the motives of the possible forgers are distinct and are human  the queen was in love with one man and hated another to the death or her enemies desired to prove that these were her moods  absolute certainty escapes us but either way motives and purposes are intelligible  not so with the gowrie mystery  the king mary’s son after hunting for four hours rides to visit lord gowrie a neighbour  after luncheon that nobleman and his brother are slain in their own house by the king’s attendants  the king gives his version of the events instantly he never varies from it in any essential point but the story is almost incredible  on the other hand the slain men cannot speak and only one of them if both were innocent could have told what occurred  but one of their apologists at the time produced a version of the events which is beyond all doubt boldly mendacious  it was easy to criticise and ridicule the king’s version but the opposite version hitherto unknown to historians destroys itself by its conspicuous falsehoods  in the nature of the case as will appear no story accounting for such wild events could be easily credible so extraordinary motiveless and inexplicable do the circumstances appear  if we try the theory that the king wove a plot we are met by the fact that his plot could not have succeeded without the voluntary and vehement collaboration of one of his victims a thing that no man could have reckoned on  if we adopt the idea that the victims had laid a trap for the king we have only a vague surmise as to its aim purpose and method  the later light which seemed to fall on the affair as we shall see only darkens what was already obscure  the inconceivable iniquity of the government at a later date reflects such discredit on all concerned on their side that we might naturally though illogically be inclined to believe that from the first the king was the conspirator  but that we shall find was almost or quite a physical impossibility  despite these embroilments i am in this case able to reach a conclusion satisfactory to myself a thing which in the affair of the casket letters and queen mary i was unable to do 7  there is no doubt in my own mind that the earl of gowrie and his brother laid a trap for king james and fell into the pit which they had digged  to what precise end they had plotted to seize the king’s person what they meant to do with him when they had got him must remain matter of conjecture  but that they intended to seize him i have no doubt at all  these pages on so old and vexed a problem would not have been written had i not been fortunate enough to obtain many unpublished manuscript materials  some of these at least clear up the secondary enigma of the sequel of the problem of 1600  different readers will probably draw different conclusions from some of the other documents but perhaps nobody will doubt that they throw strange new lights on scottish manners and morals  the scheme adopted here is somewhat like that of mr browning’s poem ‘the ring and the book’  the personages tell their own stories of the same set of events in which they were more or less intimately concerned this inevitably entails some repetition but i am unable to find any plan less open to objection  it must of course be kept in mind that all the evidence is of a suspicious nature  the king if he were the conspirator or even if innocent had to clear himself and frankly his majesty’s word was not to be relied upon  however he alone was crossexamined by an acute and hostile catechist and that upon oath though not in a court of justice the evidence of his retinue and of some other persons present was also taken on oath three months after the events before a parliamentary committee ‘the lords of the articles’  we shall see that nine years later a similar committee was deceived shamelessly by the king’s government he himself being absent in england  but the nature of the evidence in the second case was entirely different it did not rest on the sworn testimony of a number of nobles gentlemen and citizens but on a question of handwriting comparatio literarum as in the case of the casket letters  that the witnesses in 1600 did not perjure themselves in the trial which followed on the slaughter of the ruthvens is what i have to argue  next we have the evidence taken under torture of three of the slain earl’s retainers three weeks after the events  no such testimony is now reckoned of value but it will be shown that the statements made by the tortured men only compromise the earl and his brother incidentally and in a manner probably not perceived by the deponents themselves  they denied all knowledge of a plot disclaimed belief in a plot by the earl and let out what was suspicious in a casual way without observing the import of their own remarks  finally we have the evidence of the only living man except the king who was present at the central point of the occurrences  that this man was a most false and evasive character that he was doubtless amenable to bribes that he was richly rewarded i freely admit  but i think it can be made probable by evidence hitherto overlooked that he really was present on the crucial occasion and that with all allowances for his character and position his testimony fits into the facts while if it be discarded no hypothesis can account for him and his part in the adventure  in short the king’s tale almost incredible as it appears contains the only explanation which is not demonstrably impossible  to this conclusion let me repeat i am drawn by no sentiment for that unsentimental prince ‘gentle king jamie’  he was not the man to tell the truth ‘if he could think of anything better’  but where other corroboration is impossible by the nature of the circumstances facts corroborate the king’s narrative  his version ‘colligates’ them though extravagant they become not incoherent  no other hypothesis produces coherency each guess breaks down on demonstrated facts     ii  the slaughter of the ruthvens   in the month of august 1600 his majesty the king of scotland james sixth of that name stood in more than common need of the recreation of the chase  things had been going contrary to his pleasure in all directions  ‘his dearest sister’ queen elizabeth as he pathetically said seemed likely ‘to continue as long as sun or moon’ and was in the worst of humours  her minister cecil was apparently more ill disposed towards the scottish king than usual while the minister’s rival the earl of essex had been suggesting to james plans for a military demonstration on the border  money was even more than normally scarce the highlands were more than common unruly stories of new conspiracies against the king’s liberty were flying about and above all a convention of the estates had just refused in june to make a large grant of money to his majesty  it was also irritating that an old and trusted servant colonel stewart wished to quit the country and take english service against the irish rebels  this gentleman sixteen years before had been instrumental in the arrest and execution of the earl of gowrie the new young earl son of the late peer had just returned from the continent to scotland and colonel stewart was afraid that gowrie might wish to avenge his father  therefore he desired to take service in ireland  with all these frets the king needed the refreshment of hunting the buck in his park of falkland  he ordered his own hunting costume it was delivered early in august and which is singular was paid for instantly  green english cloth was the basis of his apparel and five ounces of silver decorated his secondbest ‘socks’  his boots had velvet tops embroidered his best ‘socks’ were adorned with heavy gold embroidery he even bought a new horse  his gentlemen john ramsay john murray george murray and john auchmuty were attired at the royal expense in coats of green cloth like the king 12a  thus equipped the royal party rose early on the morning of tuesday august 5 left the pleasant house of falkland with its strong round towers that had lately protected james from an attack by his cousin wild frank stewart the earl of bothwell and rode to the stables in the park ‘the weather’ says his majesty ‘being wonderful pleasant and seasonable’ 12b  ‘all the jolly hunt was there’ ‘tell true’ and the other hounds were yelping at the limits of their leashes the duke of lennox and the earl of mar friends of james from his youth and honourable men were the chief nobles in the crowd wherein were two or three of the loyal family of erskine cousins of mar and a dr herries remarkable for a club foot  at the stables hacks were discarded hunters were led out men were mounting the king had his foot in the stirrup when a young gentleman the master of ruthven rode swiftly up from the town of falkland  he had trotted over very early from the town house at perth some twelve or fourteen miles away of his brother the earl of gowrie  he was but nineteen years of age tall handsome and brother of the queen’s favourite maid of honour mrs beatrix ruthven  that he was himself one of the gentlemen of the household has often been said but we find no trace of money spent for him in the royal accounts in fact he had asked for the place but had not yet obtained it 13  however if we may believe the royal word which is a matter of choice james ‘loved the young master like a brother’  the master approached the king and entered into conversation with him james’s account of what he had to say must be given later  for the present we may be content with the depositions on oath which were made later at a trial in november by the attendants of the king and other witnesses  among these was the duke of lennox who swore to the following effect  they hunted their buck and killed him  the king in place of trotting back to lunch at the house of falkland to which the progress of the chase had led the sportsmen round in a circle bade the duke accompany him to perth some twelve miles away ‘to speak with the earl of gowrie’  his majesty then rode on  lennox despatched his groom for his sword and for a fresh horse another was sent after the king he then mounted and followed  when he rejoined james the king said ‘you cannot guess what errand i am riding for i am going to get a treasure in perth  the master of ruthven’ ‘mr alexander ruthven’ ‘has informed me that he has found a man with a pitcher full of gold coins of great sorts’  james also asked lennox what he deemed of the master whose manner he reckoned very strange  ‘nothing but an honest discreet gentleman’ said the duke  the king next gave details about the treasure and lennox said he thought the tale ‘unlikely’ as it was more or less  james then bade lennox say nothing on the matter to ruthven who wanted it to be a secret  at about a mile from perth the master galloped forward to warn his brother the earl who met the royal party on foot with some companions near the town 14  this was about one o’clock in the afternoon             picture situation and topography of gowrie house  the royal party of thirteen nobles and gentlemen then entered the earl’s house  it faced the street as the house of falkland also does and at the back had gardens running down to the tay  it is necessary to understand the situation and topography of gowrie house  passing down south street or ‘shoe gait’ the chief street in perth then a pretty little town you found it crossed at right angles by a street called on the left water gate on the right spey gate  immediately fronting you as you came to the end of south street was the gateway of gowrie house the garden wall continuing towards your right  on your left were the houses in water gate occupied by rich citizens and lairds  many will understand the position if they fancy themselves walking down one of the streets which run from the high street at oxford towards the river you then find merton college facing you the street being continued to the left in such old houses as beam hall  the gate of gowrie house fronted you as does the gatetower of merton and led into a quadrangle the front court called the close  behind gowrie house was the garden and behind that ran the river tay as the isis flows behind merton and corpus  entering the quadrangle of gowrie house you found on your right and facing you a pile of buildings like an inverted l ┐  the basement was occupied by domestic offices at the angle of the ┐ was the main entrance  on your right and much nearer to you than the main entrance a door opened on a narrow spiral staircase so dark that it was called the black turnpike                     picture interior of gowrie house  as to the interior entering the main doorway you found yourself in the hall  a door led thence into a smaller diningroom on the left  the hall itself had a door and external stair giving on the garden behind the chief staircase which you entered from the hall led to the great gallery built and decorated by the late earl  this extended above the diningroom and the hall and to the right was separated by a partition and a door from the large upstairs room on the same flat called ‘the gallery chamber’  at the extremity of this chamber on the left hand as you advanced was a door leading into a ‘round’ or turret or little circularshaped ‘study’ of which one window seems to have looked to the gateway the other to the street  people below in the street could see a man looking out of the turret window  a door in the gallery chamber gave on the narrow staircase called ‘the black turnpike’ by which the upper floor might be reached by any one from the quadrangle without entering the main door and going up the broad chief staircase  thus to quote a poet who wrote while gowrie house was extant in 1638      the palace kythes may nam’d be perth’s white hall     with orchards like these of hesperides  the palace was destroyed to furnish a site for a gaol and county buildings in 1807 but the most interesting parts had long been in ruins 18  in 1774 an antiquary mr cant writes that the palace after the forty five was converted into artillery barracks  ‘we see nothing but the remains of its former grandeur’  the coats of arms of ‘the nobility and gentlemen of fortune’ who dwelt in spey gate and water gate were in 1774 still visible on the walls of their houses  a fragment of the old palace is said to exist today in the gowrie inn  into this palace the king was led by gowrie he was taken to the dining chamber on the left of the great hall in the hall itself lennox mar and the rest of the retinue waited and wearied for apparently no dinner had been provided and even a drink for his thirsty majesty was long in coming  gowrie and the master kept going in and out servants were whispered to and sir thomas erskine sent a townsman to buy him a pair of green silk stockings in perth 19  he wanted to dine comfortably  leaving the king’s retinue in the hall and the king in the dining chamber off the hall we may note what up to this point the nobles and gentlemen of the suite had to say at the trial in november about the adventures of that august morning  mar had not seen the master at falkland after the kill mar did not succeed in rejoining james till they were within two or three miles of perth  drummond of inchaffray had nodded to the master at falkland before the master met the king at the stables  he later saw the master in conference for about a quarter of an hour with james outside the stables  the master then left the king inchaffray invited him to breakfast but he declined ‘as his majesty had ordered him to wait upon him’  according to other evidence he had already breakfasted at falkland  inchaffray then breakfasted in falkland town and next rode along the highway towards his own house  on the road he overtook lennox lindores urchill hamilton of grange finlay taylor the king and the master riding perthwards  he joined them and went with them into gowrie house  nobody else among the witnesses did anything but agree with lennox’s account up to this point  but four menials of james for example a cellarer and a porter were at gowrie house in addition to the nobles and gentlemen who gave this evidence  to return to lennox’s tale dinner was not ready for his hungry majesty as we have said till an hour after his arrival was not ready indeed till about two o’clock  he had obviously not been expected or gowrie did not wish it to be known that he was expected and himself had dined before the king’s arrival between twelve and one o’clock  a shoulder of mutton a fowl and a solitary grouse were all that the earl’s caterer could procure except cold meat obviously a poor repast to set before a king  it is said that the earl had meant to leave perth in the afternoon  when james reached the stage of dessert gowrie who had waited on him entered the hall and invited the suite to dine  when they had nearly finished gowrie returned to them in the hall and sent round a gracecup in which all pledged the king  lennox then rose to rejoin the king who now passed with the master across and out of the hall but gowrie said ‘his majesty was gone upstairs quietly some quiet errand’  gowrie then called for the key of the garden on the banks of the tay and he lindores the lame dr herries and others went into the garden where one of them tells us they ate cherries  while they were thus engaged gowrie’s equerry or master stabler a mr thomas cranstoun who had been long in france and had returned thence with the earl in april appeared crying ‘the king has mounted and is riding through the inch’ that is the inch of perth where the famous clan battle of thirty men a side had been fought centuries ago  gowrie shouted ‘horses horses’ but cranstoun said ‘your horse is at scone’ some two miles off on the further side of the tay  why the earl that day kept his horse so remote in times when men of his rank seldom walked we may conjecture later cf p 86 infra  the earl however says lennox affected not to hear cranstoun and still shouted ‘horses’  he and lennox then passed into the house through to the front yard or close and so to the outer gate giving on the street  here lennox asked the porter christie if the king had gone  the porter said he was certain that the king had not left the house  on this point lindores who had been with gowrie and lennox in the garden and accompanied them to the gate added as indeed lennox also did that gowrie now explained to the porter that james had departed by the back gate  ‘that cannot be my lord’ said the porter ‘for i have the key of the back gate’  andrew ray a bailie of perth who had been in the house looking on told the same tale adding that gowrie gave the porter the lie  the porter corroborated all this at the trial and quoted his own speech about the key as it was given by lindores  he had the keys and must know whether the king had ridden away or not  in this odd uncertainty gowrie said to lennox ‘i am sure the king has gone but stay i shall go upstairs and get your lordship the very certainty’  gowrie thereon went from the street door through the court and up the chief staircase of the house whence he came down again at once and anew affirmed to lennox that ‘the king was forth at the back gate and away’  they all then went out of the front gate and stood in the street there talking and wondering where they should seek for his majesty  where was the king  here we note a circumstance truly surprising  it never occurred to the earl of gowrie when dubiously told that the king had ‘loupen on’—and ridden off—to ask where is the king’s horse  if the royal nag was in the earl’s stable then james had not departed again—a thing more astonishing still—it has never occurred to any of the unnumbered writers on the gowrie conspiracy to ask ‘how did the earl if guilty of falsehood as to the king’s departure mean to get over the difficulty about the king’s horse’  if the horse was in the stable then the king had not ridden away as the earl declared  gowrie does not seem to have kidnapped the horse  we do not hear from the king or any one that the horse was missing when the royal party at last rode home  the author is bound in honour to observe that this glaring difficulty about the horse did not occur to him till he had written the first draft of this historical treatise after reading so many others on the subject and yet the eagle glance of mr sherlock holmes would at once have lighted on his majesty’s mount  however neither at the time nor in the last three centuries as far as we know was any one sensible enough to ask ‘how about the king’s horse’  we return to the question ‘where was the king’  some time had elapsed since he passed silently from the chamber where he had lunched through the hall with the master and so upstairs ‘going quietly a quiet errand’ gowrie had explained to the men of the retinue the gentlemen had then strolled in the garden till cranstoun came out to them with the news of the king’s departure  young john ramsay one of james’s gentlemen had met the laird of pittencrieff in the hall and had asked where his majesty was  both had gone upstairs had examined the fair gallery filled with pictures collected by the late earl and had remained ‘a certain space’ admiring it  they thence went into the front yard the close where cranstoun met them and told them that the king had gone  instead of joining the gentlemen whom we left loitering and wondering outside the front gate on the street ramsay ran to the stables for his horse he said and as he waited at the stable door being further from the main entrance than lennox mar and the rest he heard james’s voice ‘but understood not what he spake’ 23  the others on the street just outside the gate being nearer the house than ramsay suddenly heard the king’s voice and even his words  lennox said to mar ‘the king calls be he where he will’  they all glanced up at the house and saw says lennox ‘his majesty looking out at the window hatless his face red and a hand gripping his face and mouth’ the king called ‘i am murdered  treason  my lord of mar help help’ mar corroborated inchaffray saw the king vanish from the window ‘and in his judgment his majesty was pulled perforce in at the same window’ bailie ray of perth saw the window pushed up saw the king’s face appear and heard his cries  murray of arbany who had come to perth from another quarter heard the king  murray seems to have been holding the king’s falcon on his wrist in hall he had later handed the bird to young ramsay  on beholding this vision of the king hatless redfaced vociferous and suddenly vanishing most of his lords and gentlemen and murray of arbany rushed through the gate through the close into the main door of the house up the broad staircase through the long fair gallery and there they were stopped by a locked door  they could not reach the king  finding a ladder they used it as a batteringram but it broke in their hands  they sent for hammers and during some half an hour they thundered at the door breaking a hole in a panel but unable to gain admission  now these facts as to the locked door and the inability of most of the suite to reach the king are denied by no author  they make it certain that if james had contrived a plot against the two ruthvens he had not taken his two nobles mar and lennox and these other gentlemen and murray of arbany into the scheme  he had not even arranged that another of his retinue should bring them from their futile hammerwork to his assistance by another way  for there was another way  young ramsay was not with lennox and the rest when they saw and heard the flushed and excited king cry out of the window  ramsay he says was further off than the rest was at the stable door he heard and recognised james’s voice but saw nothing of him and distinguished no words  he ran into the front yard through the outer gate  lennox and the rest had already vanished within the house ramsay noticed the narrow door in the wall of the house giving on the quadrangle and nearer him than the main door of entrance to reach which he must cross the quadrangle diagonally  he rushed into the narrow doorway ran up a dark corkscrew staircase found a door at the top heard a struggling and din of men’s feet within ‘dang open’ the door caught a glimpse of a man behind the king’s back and saw james and the master ‘wrestling together in each other’s arms’  james had the master’s head under his arm the master ‘almost upon his knees’ had his hand on the king’s face and mouth  ‘strike him low’ cried the king ‘because he wears a secret mail doublet’—such as men were wont to wear on a doubtful though apparently peaceful occasion like a warden’s day on the border  ramsay threw down the king’s falcon which he had taken from murray and bore on his wrist drew his dagger or couteau de chasse and struck the master on the face and neck  the king set his foot on the falcon’s leash and so held it  ramsay might have spared and seized the master instead of wounding him james later admitted that but ‘man’ he said ‘i had neither god nor the devil before me but my own defence’  remember that hammers were thundering on a door hard by and that neither james nor ramsay knew who knocked so loud—enemies or friends  the king then says ramsay pushed the wounded master down the steep narrow staircase up which the young man had run  the man of whom ramsay had caught a glimpse standing behind the king had vanished like a wraith  ramsay went to a window looked out and seeing sir thomas erskine cried ‘come up to the top of the staircase’  where was erskine and what was he doing  he had not followed lennox and mar in their rush back into the house  on hearing james’s cries from the window he and his brother had tried to seize gowrie who had been with the party of lennox and mar  if james was in peril within gowrie’s house they argued naturally that gowrie was responsible  not drawing sword or dagger—daggers indeed they had none—the two erskine brothers rushed on gowrie who was crying ‘what is the matter  i know nothing’ they bore him or nearly bore him to the ground but his retainers separated the stragglers and one a ruthven knocked sir thomas down with his fist  the knight arose and ran into the front court where dr herries asked him ‘what the matter meant’  at this moment erskine heard ramsay cry ‘come up here’ from the top of the narrow dark staircase he says not from the window ramsay may have called from both  erskine who was accompanied by the lame dr herries and by a menial of his brother’s named wilson found the bleeding master near the foot of the stair and shouted ‘this is the traitor strike him’  the stricken lad fell saying ‘alas i had not the wyte of it’ and the three entered the chamber where now were only the king and ramsay  words not very intelligible as reported by erskine we consider them later passed between him and the king  though erskine does not say so they shut james up in the turret opening into the chamber where they were and instantly cranstoun the earl’s equerry entered with a drawn sword followed by gowrie with ‘two swords’ while some other persons followed gowrie  where had gowrie been since the two erskines tried to seize him in the street and were separated from him by a throng of his retainers  why was gowrie whose honour was interested in the king’s safety later in reaching the scene than erskine the limping dr herries and the serving man wilson  the reason appears to have been that after the two erskines were separated from gowrie sir thomas ran straight from the street through the gateway into the front court of the house meeting in the court dr herries who was slow in his movements  but gowrie on the other hand was detained by certain of tullibardine’s servants young tullibardine being present  this at least was the story given under examination by mr thomas cranstoun gowrie’s master stabler while other witnesses mention that gowrie became involved in a struggle and went ‘back from’ his house further up or down the street  young tullibardine present at this fray was the heir of murray of tullibardine and ancestor in the male line of the present duke of atholl  he later married a niece of the earl of gowrie  his father being a man of forty in 1600 young tullibardine must have been very young indeed  the murrays were in perth on the occasion of the marriage of one of their clan an innkeeper  some of their party were in the street and seeing an altercation in which two of the king’s gentlemen were prevented from seizing gowrie they made an ineffectual effort to capture the earl  gowrie ran from them along the street and there ‘drew his two swords out of one scabbard’ says cranstoun 28  the earl had just arrived in scotland from italy where he had acquired the then fashionable method of fencing with twinswords worn in a single scabbard  gowrie then had retreated from the murrays to the house of one macbreck as cranstoun and macbreck himself declared  cranstoun too drew his sword and let his cloak fall asking gowrie ‘what the fray was’  the earl said that ‘he would enter his own house or die by the way’  cranstoun said that he would go foremost ‘but at whom should he strike for he knew not who was the enemy’  he had only seen the erskines collar gowrie then certain murrays interfere and he was entirely puzzled  gowrie did not reply and the pair advanced to the door of the house through a perplexed throng  a servant of gowrie’s placed a steel cap on his head and with some four or five of gowrie’s friends hew moncrieff alexander ruthven harry ruthven and patrick eviot the earl and cranstoun entered the front court  here cranstoun saw the body of a man whether dead or wounded he knew not lying at ‘the old turnpike door’ the entry to the dark narrow staircase up which ramsay had run to the king’s rescue  ‘who lies there’ asked cranstoun  gowrie only replied ‘up the stair’  cranstoun led the way gowrie came next the other four must have followed for several witnesses presently saw them come down again wounded and bleeding  cranstoun found erskine ramsay and herries with drawn swords in the chamber  the king then in the turret he did not see  he taunted herries ramsay and gowrie crossed swords cranstoun dealt he says with herries erskine and perhaps wilson  but though cranstoun ‘nowise knew who followed him’ the four men already named two ruthvens a moncrieff and eviot were in the fray though there was some uncertainty about eviot 30  the position of the king at this moment was unenviable  he was shut up in the little round turret room  on the other side of the door in the chamber swords were clashing feet were stamping  james knew that he had four defenders one of them a lame medical man who or how many their opponents might be he could not know  the air rang with the thunder of hammers on the door of the chamber where the fight raged were they wielded by friends or enemies  from the turret window the king could hear the town bell ringing and see the gathering of the burgesses of perth the friends of their provost gowrie  we know that they could easily muster eight hundred armed men  which side would they take  the murrays as we saw had done nothing except that some of them had crowded round gowrie  meanwhile there was clash of steel stamping of feet noise of hammers while the king in the turret knew not how matters were going  cranstoun only saw his own part of the fight in the chamber  how ramsay and gowrie sped in their duel he knew not  ramsay he says turned on him and ran him through the body herries also struck him  of gowrie he saw nothing he fled when wounded down the turret stair his companions following or preceding him  gowrie in fact had fallen leaving ramsay free to deal with cranstoun  writers of both parties declare that ramsay had cried to gowrie ‘you have slain the king’ that gowrie dropped his points and that ramsay lunged and ran him through the body  erskine says that he himself was wounded in the right hand by cranstoun herries lost two fingers  when ramsay ran gowrie through the earl says erskine fell into the arms of a man whom he himself knew not gowrie’s party retreated but it seems they returned to the head of the narrow staircase and renewed hostilities by pushing swords and halberts under the narrow staircase door  this appears from the evidence of lennox  after pounding at the door so long lennox’s party at last sent robert brown a servant of james’s who had brought the hammers round to discover another way of reaching the king  brown too now went up the narrow staircase and in the gallery chamber he found the king with herries erskine ramsay wilson and the dead earl  he reassured james the hammerers were his friends  they handed says lennox one of the hammers to the king’s party through a shattered panel ‘and they within broke the doors and gave them entry’  at this time halberts and swords were being struck by gowrie’s retainers under the door and through the sides of the door of the chamber this door apparently being that from the chamber to the narrow staircase  murray of arbany who had come into the house at the end of dinner was stricken through the leg by one of these weapons  deacon rhynd of perth saw hew moncrieff striking with ‘a jeddart staff’ a kind of halbert  a voice that of alexander ruthven a cousin of the fallen earl cried ‘for god’s sake my lord tell me how the earl of gowrie does’  ‘he is well  go your way you are a fool you will get no thanks for this labour’ answered lennox and all was silence  alexander ruthven and the rest retreated ruthven rushed to the town rousing the people and rifling shops in search of gunpowder  the king and the nobles knelt in prayer on the bloody floor of the chamber where the dead gowrie lay  for some time the confused mob yelled outside shaking their fists at the king’s party in the window men and women crying ‘come down greencoats ye have committed murder  bloody butchers’  others cried ‘the king is shot’  the exits of the house were guarded by retainers of gowrie—rentoul bissett and others  mar and lennox from the window explained to the mob that the king was well  james showed himself the magistrates and nobles pacified the people who some armed some unarmed were all perplexed whether they were anxious about the king or about their provost the earl  from the evidence of scores of burghers it appears that the tumult did not last long  one man was reaping in the morton haugh  hearing the town bell he hastened in ‘when all the tumult was ceased’ and the magistrates ray and others were sending the people to their houses as also did young tullibardine  a baker hearing the bell went to the town cross and so to gowrie’s house where he met the stream of people coming away another baker was at work and stayed with his loaves otherwise he ‘would have lost his whole baking’  the king represents that it was between seven and eight in the evening before matters were quiet enough for him to ride home to falkland owing to the tumult  the citizens doubtless minimised and james probably exaggerated the proportions and duration of the disturbance                          picture falkland place  this version of that strange affair the slaughter of the ruthvens is taken entirely from the lips of sworn witnesses  we still know no more than we did as to what passed between the moment when james and the master alone left the dining chamber and the moment when the king cried ‘treason’ out of the turret window  the problem is had james lured the master to falkland for the purpose of accompanying him back to perth as if by the master’s invitation and of there craftily begetting a brawl in which gowrie and the master should perish at the hands of ramsay  or had the master with or without his brother’s knowledge lured james to perth for some evil end  the question divided scotland france and england were sceptical as to the king’s innocence  our best historians like mr hill burton and mr tytler side with the king others are dubious or believe that james was the conspirator and that the ruthvens were innocent victims     iii  the king’s own narrative   so far we have not gained any light on the occurrences of the mysterious interval between the moment when the king and alexander ruthven passed alone through the hall after dinner up the great staircase and the moment when the king cried ‘treason’ out of the turret window  in the nature of the case the master being for ever silent only james could give evidence on the events of this interval james and one other man of whose presence in the turret we have hitherto said little as only one of the witnesses could swear to having seen a man there none to having seen him escaping thence or in the tumult  now the word of james was not to be relied on any more than that of the unequalled elizabeth  if we take the king’s word in this case it is from no prejudice in his favour but merely because his narrative seems best to fit the facts as given on oath by men like lennox mar and other witnesses of all ranks it also fits with discrepancies to be noted the testimony of the other man the man who professed to have been with the master and the king in the turret  the evidence of that other man was also subject for reasons which will appear presently to the gravest suspicion  james if himself guilty of the plot had to invent a story to excuse himself the other man had to adopt the version of the king to save his own life from the gibbet  on the other hand james if innocent could not easily have a credible story to tell  if the master was sane it was hardly credible that as james averred he should menace the king with murder in his brother’s house with no traceable preparations either for flight or for armed resistance  in james’s narrative the master is made at least to menace the king with death  however true the king’s story might be his adversaries the party of the kirk and the preachers would never accept it  in lennox’s phrase they ‘liked it not because it was not likely’ emphatically it was not likely but the contradictory story put forward by the ruthven apologist as we shall see was not only improbable but certainly false  there was living at that time a certain mr david calderwood a young presbyterian minister aged twentyfive  he was an avid collector of rumour of talk and of actual documents and his ‘history of the kirk of scotland’ composed at a much later date is wonderfully copious and accurate  as it was impossible for king james to do anything at which calderwood did not carp assigning the worst imaginable motives in every case we shall find in calderwood the sum of contemporary hostile criticism of his majesty’s narrative  but the criticism is negative calderwood’s critics only pick holes in the king’s narrative but do not advance or report any other explanation of the events any complete theory of the king’s plot from the ruthven side  any such story any such hypothesis must be to the full as improbable as the king’s narrative  there is nothing probable in the whole affair every system every hypothesis is difficile à croire  yet the events did occur and we cannot reject james’s account merely because it is ‘unlikely’  the improbabilities however were enormously increased by the king’s theory that the ruthvens meant to murder him  this project not borne out by the king’s own version of ruthven’s conduct would have been insane the ruthvens by murdering james would have roused the whole nation and the kirk itself against them  but if their object was to kidnap james to secure his person to separate him from his ministers who were either secretly catholics or indifferents and to bring in a new administration favourable to kirk or church then the ruthvens were doing what had several times been done and many times attempted  james had been captured before even in his own palace while scores of other plots to take him for instance when hunting in falkland woods remote from his retinue had been recently planned and had failed  to kidnap the king was the commonest move in politics but as james thought or said that the idea at gowrie house was to murder him his tale even if true could not be easily credible  the first narrative was drawn up at falkland in the night of august 5 early on august 6 the letter reached the chancellor in edinburgh and the contents of the letter were repeated orally by the secretary of state elphinstone later lord balmerino to nicholson the english resident at the court of holyrood  nicholson on the same day reported what he remembered of what the secretary remembered of the falkland letter to cecil  yet though at third hand nicholson’s written account of the falkland letter of august 5 38 contains the same version as james later published with variations so few and so unessential that it is needless to dwell upon them they may safely be attributed to the modifications which a story must suffer in passing through the memories of two persons whatever the amount of truth in his narrative the king had it ready at once in the form to which he adhered and on which he voluntarily underwent severe crossexamination on oath by mr robert bruce one of the edinburgh ministers a point to which we return  james declares in a later narrative printed and published about the end of august 1600 that the master when he first met him at falkland made a very low bow which was not his habit  the master then said their conference we saw occupied a quarter of an hour that while walking alone on the previous evening he had met a cloaked man carrying a great pot full of gold in large coined pieces  ruthven took the fellow secretly to gowrie house ‘locked him in a privy derned house and after locking many doors on him left him there and his pot with him’  it might be argued that as the man was said to be locked in a house and as james was not taken out of gowrie house to see him james must have known that when he went upstairs with the master he was not going to see the prisoner  the error here is that in the language of the period a house often means a room or chamber  it is so used by james elsewhere in this very narrative and endless examples occur in the letters and books of the period  ruthven went on to explain what greatly needed explanation that he had left perth so early in the morning that james might have the first knowledge of this secret treasure concealed hitherto even from gowrie james objected that he had no right to the gold which was not treasure trove  ruthven replied that if the king would not take it others would  james now began to suspect very naturally that the gold was foreign coin  indeed what else could it well be  coin from france italy or spain brought in often by political intriguers was the least improbable sort of minted gold to be found in poor old scotland  in the troubles of 1592–1596 the supplies of the catholic rebels were in spanish money whereof some was likely enough to be buried by the owners  james then fancied that jesuits or others had brought in gold for seditious purposes ‘as they have ofttimes done before’  sceptics of the period asked how one pot of gold could cause a sedition  the question is puerile  there would be more gold where the potful came from if catholic intrigues were in the air  james then asked the master ‘what kind of coin it was’  ‘they seemed to be foreign and uncouth’ unusual ‘strokes of coin’ said ruthven and the man he added was a stranger to him  james therefore suspected that the man might be a disguised scottish priest the few of them then in scotland always wore disguises as they tell us in their reports to their superiors 40  the king’s inferences as to popish plotters were thus inevitable though he may have emphasised them in his narrative to conciliate the preachers  his horror of ‘practising papists’ at this date was unfeigned  he said to the master that he could send a servant with a warrant to gowrie and the magistrates of perth to take and examine the prisoner and his hoard contemporaries asked why he did not ‘commit the credit of this matter to another’  james had anticipated the objection  he did propose this course but ruthven replied that if others once touched the money the king ‘would get a very bad account made to him of that treasure’  he implored his majesty to act as he advised and not to forget him afterwards  this suggestion may seem mean in ruthven but the age was not disinterested nor was ruthven trying to persuade a highsouled man the king was puzzled and bored ‘the morning was fair the game already found’ the monarch was a keen sportsman so he said that he would think the thing over and answer at the end of the hunt  granting james’s notorious love of disentangling a mystery granting his love of money and of hunting i agree with mr tytler in seeing nothing improbable in this narration  if the master wanted to lure the king to perth i cannot conceive a better device than the tale which according to the king he told  the one improbable point considering the morals of the country was that ruthven should come to james in place of sharing the gold with his brother  but ruthven we shall see had possibly good reasons known to james for conciliating the royal favour and for keeping his brother ignorant  moreover to seize the money would not have been a safe thing for ruthven to do the story would have leaked out questions would have been asked  james had hit on the only plausible theory to account for a low fellow with a pot of gold he must be ‘a practising papist’  james could neither suppose nor expect others to believe that he supposed one pot of foreign gold enough ‘to bribe the country into rebellion’  but the pot and the prisoner supplied a clue worth following  probabilities strike different critics in different ways  mr tytler thinks james’s tale true and that he acted in character  that is my opinion his own the reader must form for himself  ruthven still protested  this hunt of gold was well worth a buck  the prisoner he said might attract attention by his cries a very weak argument but ruthven was quite as likely to invent it on the spur of the moment as james was to attribute it to him falsely on cool reflection finally if james came at once gowrie would then be at the preaching tuesdays thursdays and sundays were preaching days and the royal proceedings with the captive would be undisturbed  now on the hypothesis of intended kidnapping this was a wellplanned affair  if james accepted ruthven’s invitation he with three or four servants would reach gowrie house while the town of perth was quiet nothing would be easier than to seclude him seize his person and transport him to the seaside either by tay or down the north bank of that river or in disguise across fife to the firth of forth in the retinue of gowrie before alarm was created at falkland  gowrie had given out so his friends declared that he was to go that night to dirleton his castle near north berwick 42 a strong hold manned and provisioned  could he have carried the king in disguise across fife to elie dirleton was within a twelve miles sail on summer seas  had james’s curiosity and avarice led him to ride away at once with ruthven and three or four servants the plot might have succeeded  we must criticise the plot on these lines  thus if at all had the earl and his brother planned it  but fate interfered the unexpected occurred—but the plot could not be dropped  the story of the pot of gold could not be explained away  the king with royal rudeness did not even reply to the new argument of the master  ‘without any further answering him’ his majesty mounted ruthven staying still in the place where the king left him  at this moment inchaffray as we saw met ruthven and invited him to breakfast but he said that he was ordered to wait on the king  at this point james’s narrative contains a circumstance which confessedly was not within his own experience  he did not know he says that the master had any companion  but from the evidence of another he learned that the master had a companion indeed two companions  one was andrew ruthven about whose presence nobody doubts the other one andrew henderson was not seen by james at this time however the king says on henderson’s own evidence that the master now sent him about seven o’clock to warn gowrie that the king was to come really it seems that henderson was despatched rather later during the first check in the run  it was allimportant to the king’s case to prove that henderson had been at falkland and had returned at once with a message to gowrie for this would demonstrate that in appearing to be unprepared for the king’s arrival as he did gowrie was making a false pretence  it was also important to prove that the ride of ruthven and henderson to falkland and back had been concealed by them from the people at gowrie house  now this was proved  craigengelt gowrie’s steward who was tortured tried convicted and hanged deponed that going up the staircase just after the king’s arrival he met the master booted and asked ‘where he had been’  ‘an errand not far off’ said the master concealing his long ride to falkland 44a  again john moncrieff a gentleman who was with gowrie asked henderson who had returned to perth much earlier than the king’s arrival where he had been and he said ‘that he had been two or three miles above the town’ 44b  henderson himself later declared that gowrie had told him to keep his ride to falkland secret 44c  the whole purpose of all this secrecy was to hide the fact that the ruthvens had brought the king to perth and that gowrie had early notice by about 10 am of james’s approach from henderson  therefore to make out that henderson had been in falkland and had given gowrie early notice of james’s approach though gowrie for all that made no preparations to welcome james was almost necessary for the government  they specially questioned all witnesses on this point  yet not one of their witnesses would swear to having seen henderson at falkland  this disposes of the theory of wholesale perjury  the modern apologist for the ruthvens mr louis barbé writes ‘we believe that henderson perjured himself in swearing that he accompanied alexander’ the master ‘and andrew ruthven when    they rode to falkland  we believe that henderson perjured himself when he asserted on oath that the master sent him back to perth with the intelligence of the king’s coming’ 45  on the other hand george hay lay prior of the famous chartreux founded by james i in perth deponed that henderson arrived long before gowrie’s dinner and peter hay corroborated  but hay averred that gowrie asked henderson ‘who was at falkland with the king’  it would not follow that henderson had been at falkland himself  john moncrieff deponed that gowrie said nothing of henderson’s message but sat at dinner feigning to have no knowledge of the king’s approach till the master arrived a few minutes before the king  mr rhynd gowrie’s tutor deponed that andrew ruthven the master’s other companion in the early ride to falkland told him that the master had sent on henderson with news of the king’s coming  if henderson had been at falkland he had some four hours’ start of the king and his party and must have arrived at perth and spoken to gowrie long before dinner he himself says at 10 am dinner was at noon or on this day half an hour later  yet gowrie made no preparations for welcoming the king  it is obvious that though the hays and moncrieff both saw henderson return booted from a ride somewhere or other at an early hour none of them could prove that he had ridden to falkland and back  there was in fact no evidence that henderson had been at falkland except his own and that of the poor tortured tutor rhynd to the effect that andrew ruthven had confessed as much to him  but presently we shall find that while modern apologists for gowrie deny that henderson had been at falkland the contemporary ruthven apologist insists that he had been there  to return to james’s own narrative he asserts henderson’s presence at falkland but not from his own knowledge  he did not see henderson at falkland  ruthven says james sent henderson to gowrie just after the king mounted and followed the hounds  here it must be noted that henderson himself says that ruthven did not actually despatch him till after he had some more words with the king  this is an instance of james’s insouciance as to harmonising his narrative with henderson’s or causing henderson to conform to his  ‘cooked’ evidence collusive evidence would have avoided these discrepancies  james says that musing over the story of the pot of gold he sent one naismith a surgeon he had been with james at least since 1592 to bring ruthven to him during a check and told ruthven that he would after the hunt come to perth  james thought that this was after the despatch of henderson but probably it was before to judge by henderson’s account  during this pause the hounds having hit on the scent again the king was left behind but spurred on  at every check the master kept urging him to make haste so james did not tarry to break up the deer as usual the kill was but two bowshots from the stables and the king did not wait for his sword or his second horse which had to gallop a mile before it reached him  mar lennox and others did wait for their second mounts some rode back to falkland for fresh horses some dragged slowly along on tired steeds and did not rejoin james till later  ruthven had tried james says to induce him to refuse the company of the courtiers  three or four servants he said would be enough  the others ‘might mar the whole purpose’  james was ‘half angry’ he began to entertain odd surmises about ruthven  one was ‘it might be that the earl his brother had handled him so hardly that the young gentleman being of a high spirit had taken such displeasure as he was become somewhat beside himself’  but why should gowrie handle his brother hardly  the answer is suggested by an unpublished contemporary manuscript ‘the true discovery of the late treason’ 48a c  ‘some offence had passed betwixt the said mr alexander ruthven’ the master ‘and his brother for that the said alexander both of himself and by his majesty’s mediation had craved of the earl his brother the demission and release of the abbey of scone which his majesty had bestowed upon the said earl during his life     his suit had little success’ 48b  if this be fact and there is no obvious reason for its invention james might have reason to suspect that gowrie had ‘handled his brother hardly’ scone being a valuable estate well worth keeping  to secure the king’s favour as to scone ruthven had a motive as james would understand for making him and not gowrie acquainted with the secret of the treasure  thus the unpublished manuscript casually explains the reason of the king’s suspicion that the earl might have ‘handled the master hardly’  on some such surmise james asked lennox who corroborates whether he thought the master quite ‘settled in his wits’  lennox knew nothing but good of him as he said in his evidence but ruthven observing their private talk implored james to keep the secret and come alone with him—at first—to see the captive and the treasure  james felt more and more uneasy but he had started and rode on while the master now despatched andrew ruthven to warn gowrie  within a mile of perth the master spurred on his weary horse and gave the news to gowrie who despite the messages of henderson and andrew ruthven was at dinner unprepared for the royal arrival  however gowrie met james with sixty men four says the ruthven apologist  james’s train then consisted of fifteen persons  others must have dropped in later they had no fresh mounts but rested their horses the king says and let them graze by the way  they followed because learning that james was going to perth they guessed that he intended to apprehend the master of oliphant who had been misconducting himself in angus  thus the king accounts for the number of his train  an hour passed before dinner james pressed for a view of the treasure but the master asked the king not to converse with him then as the whole affair was to be kept secret from gowrie  if the two brothers had been at odds about the lands of scone the master’s attitude towards his brother might seem intelligible a point never allowed for by critics unacquainted with the manuscript which we have cited  at last the king sat down to dinner gowrie in attendance whispering to his servants and often going in and out of the chamber  the master too was seen on the stairs by craigengelt  if gowrie’s behaviour is correctly described it might be attributed to anxiety about a royal meal so hastily prepared  but if gowrie had plenty of warning from henderson as i do not doubt that theory is not sufficient  if engaged in a conspiracy gowrie would have reason for anxiety  the circumstances owing to the number of the royal retinue were unfavourable yet as the story of the pot of gold had been told by ruthven the plot could not be abandoned  james even ‘chaffed’ gowrie about being so pensive and distrait and about his neglect of some little points of scottish etiquette  finally he sent gowrie into the hall with the gracecup for the gentlemen and then called the master he sent gowrie apparently that he might slip off with the master as that gentleman wished  ‘his majesty desired mr alexander to bring sir thomas erskine with him who’ ruthven ‘desiring the king to go forward with him and promising that he should make any one or two follow him that he pleased to call for desiring his majesty to command publicly that none should follow him’  this seems to mean james and the master were to cross the hall and go upstairs james or the master for him bidding no one follow the master according to balgonie did say that the king would be alone while presently the master should return and privately beckon on one or two to join the king  the master’s excuse for all this was the keeping from gowrie and others for the moment of the secret of the prisoner and the pot of gold  now if we turn back to sir thomas erskine’s evidence we find that when he joined james in the chamber after the slaying of the master he said ‘i thought your majesty would have concredited more to me than to have commanded me to await your majesty at the door if you thought it not meet to have taken me with you’  the king replied ‘alas the traitor deceived me in that as in all else for i commanded him expressly to bring you to me and he returned back as i thought to fetch you but he did nothing but steik shut the door’  what can these words mean  they appear to me to imply that james sent the master back according to their arrangement to bring erskine that the master gave erskine some invented message about waiting at some door that he then shut a door between the king and his friends but told the king that erskine was to follow them  erskine was beyond doubt in the street with the rest of the retinue before the brawl in the turret reached its crisis when gowrie had twice insisted that james had ridden away  in any case to go on with james’s tale he went with ruthven up a staircase the great staircase ‘and through three or four rooms’—‘three or four sundry houses’—‘the master ever locking behind him every door as he passed and so into a little study’—the turret  this is perplexing  we nowhere hear in the evidence of more than two doors in the suite which were locked  the staircase perhaps gave on the long gallery with a door between them  the gallery gave on a chamber which had a door the door battered by lennox and mar and the chamber gave on a turret which had a door between it and the chamber  we hear in the evidence of no other doors or of no other locked doors however in the latin indictment of the ruthvens ‘many doors’ are insisted on  as all the evidence tells of opposition from only one door—that between the gallery and the chamber of death—james’s reason for talking of ‘three or four doors’ must be left to conjecture  ‘the true discourse’ ms gives but the gallery chamber and turret but appears to allow for a door between stair and gallery which the master ‘closed’ while he ‘made fast’ the next door that between gallery and chamber one thomas hamilton 52a who writes a long letter ms to a lady unknown also speaks of several doors on the evidence of the king and some of the lords  this manuscript has been neglected by historians 52b  leaving this point we ask why a man already suspicious like james let the master lock any door behind him  we might reply that james had dined and that ‘wine and beer produce a careless state of mind’ as a writer on cricket long ago observed  we may also suppose that till facts proved the locking of one door at least for about that there is no doubt james did not know that any door was locked  on august 11 the rev mr galloway in a sermon preached before the king and the populace at the cross of edinburgh says that the master led the monarch upstairs ‘and through a trans’ a passage ‘the door whereof so soon as they had entered chekit to with ane lok then through a gallery whose door also chekit to through a chamber and the door thereof chekit to also’ and thence into the turret of which he ‘also locked the door’ 53  were the locks that ‘chekit to’ spring locks and was james unaware that he was locked in  but ramsay before the affray had wandered into ‘a gallery very fair’ and unless there were two galleries he could not do this if the gallery door was locked  lennox and mar and the rest speak of opposition from only one door  while we cannot explain these things that door at least between the gallery and the gallery chamber excluded james from most of his friends can the reader believe that he purposely had that door locked we know not how or by whom on the system of compelling gowrie to ‘come and be killed’ by way of the narrow staircase  could we see gowrie house and its ‘secret ways’ as it then was we might understand this problem of the locked doors  contemporary criticism as minutely recorded by calderwood found no fault with the number of locked doors but only asked ‘how could the king’s fear but increase perceiving mr alexander’ the master ‘ever to lock the doors behind them’  if the doors closed with spring locks of which the principle had long been understood and used the king may not have been aware of the locking  the problem cannot be solved we only disbelieve that the king himself had the door locked to keep his friends out and let gowrie in  note—the abbey of scone  on page 48 we have quoted the statement that james had bestowed on gowrie the abbey of scone ‘during his life’  this was done in 1580 registrum magni sigilli vol iii  no 3011  on may 25 1584 william fullarton got this gift the first earl of gowrie and his children being then forfeited  but on july 23 1586 the gowrie of the day was restored to all his lands and the earldom of gowrie included the old church lands of scone reg mag sig iv no 695 no 1044  how then did john third earl of gowrie hold only ‘for his life’ the commendatorship of the abbey of scone as is stated in s p scot  eliz vol lxvi  no 50     iv  the king’s narrative—ii  the man in the turret   we left james entering the little ‘round’ or ‘study’ the turret chamber  here at last he expected to find the captive and the pot of gold  and here the central mystery of his adventure began  his majesty saw standing ‘with a very abased countenance not a bondman but a freeman with a dagger at his girdle’  ruthven locked the door put on his hat drew the man’s dagger and held the point to the king’s breast ‘avowing now that the king behoved to be at his will and used as he list swearing many bloody oaths that if the king cried one word or opened a window to look out that dagger should go to his heart’  if this tale is true murder was not intended unless james resisted the king was only being threatened into compliance with the master’s ‘will’  ruthven added that the king’s conscience must now be burthened ‘for murdering his father’ that is for the execution of william earl of gowrie in 1584  his conviction was believed to have been procured in a dastardly manner later to be explained  james was unarmed and obviously had no secret coat of mail in which he could not have hunted all day perhaps  ruthven had his sword as for the other man he stood ‘trembling and quaking’  james now made to the master the odd harangue reported even in nicholson’s version of the falkland letter of the same day  as for gowrie’s execution the king said he had then been a minor he was eighteen in 1584 and gowrie was condemned ‘by the ordinary course of law’—which his friends denied james had restored he said all the lands and dignities of the house two of ruthven’s sisters were maids of honour  ruthven had been educated by the revered mr rollock he ought to have learned better behaviour if the king died he would be avenged gowrie could not hope for the throne  the king solemnly promised forgiveness and silence if ruthven let him go  ruthven now uncovered his head and protested that the king’s life should be safe if he made no noise or cry in that case ruthven would now bring gowrie to him  ‘why’ asked james ‘you could gain little by keeping such a prisoner’  ruthven said that he could not explain gowrie would tell him the rest  turning to the other man he said ‘i make you the king’s keeper till i come again and see that you keep him upon your peril’  he then went out and locked the door  the person who later averred that he had been the man in the turret believed that ruthven never went far from the door  james believed indeed averred that he ran downstairs and consulted gowrie  if there was an armed man in the turret he was either placed there by the king to protect him while he summoned his minions by feigned cries of treason or he was placed there by gowrie to help the master to seize the king  in the latter case the master’s position was now desperate in lieu of an ally he had procured a witness against himself  great need had he to consult gowrie but though gowrie certainly entered the house went upstairs and returned to lennox with the assurance that james had ridden away it is improbable that he and his brother met at this moment james however avers that they met ruthven running rapidly downstairs but this was mere inference on the king’s part  james occupied the time of ruthven’s absence in asking the man of the turret what he knew of the conspiracy  the man replied that he knew nothing he had but recently been locked into the little chamber indeed while ruthven was threatening the man says james was trembling and adjuring the master not to harm the king  james having sworn to ruthven that he would not open the window himself now characteristically asked the man to open the window ‘on his right hand’ if the king had his back to the turret door the window on his right opened on the courtyard the window on his left opened on the street the man readily opened the window says the king and the person claiming to be the man deponed later that he first opened what the king declared to be the wrong window but before he could open the other in came the master who ‘casting his hands abroad in desperate manner said “he could not mend it his majesty behoved to die”’  instead of stabbing james however he tried to bind the royal hands with a garter ‘swearing he behoved to be bound’  a garter was later picked up on the floor by one of the witnesses graham of balgonie and secured by sir thomas erskine 58  a struggle then began james keeping the master’s right hand off his swordhilt the master trying to silence james with his left hand  james dragged the master to the window which the other man had opened  in the latin indictment of the dead ruthvens james opens the window himself  the turret man said in one of two depositions that he stretched across the wrestlers and opened the window  the retinue and gowrie were passing as we know or loitering below gowrie affected not to hear the cries of treason lennox mar and the rest rushed up the great staircase  meanwhile struggling with the master james had brought him out of the turret into the chamber so he says though more probably the master brought him  they were now near the door of the chamber that gave on the narrow staircase and james was ‘throwing the master’s sword out of his hand thinking to have stricken him therewith’ when ramsay entered and wounded the master who was driven down the stairs and there killed by erskine and herries  gowrie then invaded the room with seven others james was looking for the master’s sword 59 which had fallen but he was instantly shut into the turret by his friends and saw none of the fight in which gowrie fell  after that lennox and the party with hammers were admitted and—the tumult appeased—james rode back through a dark rainy night to falkland         picture the gallery chamber and the turret gowrie house     v  henderson’s narrative   the man in the turret had vanished like a ghost  henderson on the day after the tragedy was also not to be found  like certain ruthvens hew moncrieff eviot and others who had fought in the deathchamber or been distinguished in the later riot henderson had fled  he was though a retainer of gowrie a member of the town council of perth and ‘chamberlain’ or ‘factor’ of the lands of scone then held by gowrie from the king  to find any one who had seen him during the tumult was difficult or impossible  william robertson a notary of perth examined in november before the parliamentary committee said then that he only saw gowrie with his two drawn swords and seven or eight companions in the forecourt of the house and so ‘being afraid he passed out of the place’  the same man earlier on september 23 when examined with other citizens of perth had said that he followed young tullibardine and some of his men who were entering the court ‘to relieve the king’ 60  he saw the master lying dead at the foot of the stair and saw henderson ‘come out of the said turnpike over the master’s belly’  he spoke to henderson who did not answer  he remembered that murray of arbany was present  arbany before the parliamentary committee in november said nothing on this subject nor did robertson  his evidence would have been important had he adhered to what he said on september 23  but oddly enough if he perjured himself on the earlier occasion september 23 he withdrew his perjury when it would have been useful to the king’s case in the evidence given before the lords of the articles in november  mr barbé perhaps misled by the sequence of versions in pitcairn writes ‘apparently it was only when his memory had been stimulated by the treatment of those whose evidence was found to be favourable to the king that the wily notary recalled the details by which he intended to corroborate henderson’s statement    ’ 61a  the reverse is the case the wily notary did not offer at the trial in november the evidence which he had given in september at the examination of the citizens of perth  it may perhaps be inferred that perjury was not encouraged but depressed 61b  despite the premiums on perjury which ruthven apologists insist on not one witness would swear to having seen henderson during or after the tumult  yet he instantly fled with others who had been active in the brawl and remained in concealment  calderwood the earnest collector of contemporary gossip and documents assures us that when the man in the turret could not be found the first proclamation identified him with a mr robert oliphant a ‘black grim man’ but that oliphant proved his absence from perth  one gray and one lesley were also suspected and one younger hiding when sought for it is said was killed  but we have no copy of the proclamation as to mr robert oliphant  to mr robert oliphant who had an alibi we shall return for this gentleman though entirely overlooked by our historians was probably at the centre of the situation p 71 infra  meanwhile whatever henderson had done he mysteriously vanished from gowrie house during or after the turmoil ‘following darkness like a dream’  nobody was produced who could say anything about seeing henderson after moncrieff and the hays saw him on his return from falkland at about ten o’clock in the morning of august 5  by august 12 henderson was still in hiding and was still being proclaimed for with others of whom mr robert oliphant was not one they were moncrieff eviot and two ruthvens 63a  but on august 11 at the cross of edinburgh in presence of the king his chaplain the rev patrick galloway gave news of henderson  mr galloway had been minister of perth and a fierce presbyterian of old      blow galloway the trumpet of the lord  exclaimed a contemporary poet  but james had tamed galloway he was now the king’s chaplain he did not blow the trumpet of the lord any longer and i fear was capable of anything  he had a pension calderwood tells us from the lands of scone and knew henderson who as chamberlain or steward paid the money  in his exciting sermon galloway made a dramatic point  henderson was found and henderson was the man in the turret  galloway had received a letter from henderson in his own hand any listener who knew henderson’s hand might see the letter  henderson tells his tale therein galloway says that it differs almost nothing from the king’s story of which he had given an abstract in his discourse and he adds that henderson stole downstairs while ramsay was engaged with the master 63b  henderson being now in touch with galloway probably received promise of his life and of reward for he came in before august 20 and at the trial in november was relieved of the charge of treason and gave evidence  here we again ask why did henderson take to flight  what had he to do with the matter  none fled but those who had been seen sword in hand in the fatal chamber or stimulating the populace to attack the king during the tumult  andrew ruthven who had ridden to falkland with henderson and the master did not run away no proclamation for him is on record  nobody swore to seeing henderson like his fellow fugitives armed or active yet he fled and skulked  manifestly henderson had in one way or other been suspiciously concerned in the affair  he had come in and was at falkland by august 20 when he was examined before the chancellor montrose the king’s advocate sir thomas hamilton sir george hume of spot later earl of dunbar and others in the king’s absence  he deponed that on the night of august 4 gowrie bade him and andrew ruthven ride early to falkland with the master and return if the master ordered him so to do with a message  at falkland they went into a house 64 and the master sent him to learn what the king was doing he came back with the news the master talked with the king then told henderson to carry to gowrie the tidings of the king’s visit ‘and that his majesty would be quiet’  henderson asked if he was to start at once ruthven told him to wait till he spoke to the king again  they did speak at a gap in a wall during the check in the run ruthven returned to henderson sent him off and henderson reached perth about ten o’clock  gowrie on his arrival left the company he was with the two hays and here george hay’s evidence makes gowrie ask henderson ‘who was with the king at falkland’  hay said that gowrie then took henderson into another room  henderson says nothing about a question as to the king’s company asked in presence of hay a compromising and improbable question if gowrie wished to conceal the visit to falkland  apart gowrie put some other questions to henderson as to how the king received the master  henderson then went to his house an hour later gowrie bade him put on his secret coat of mail and plate sleeves as he had to arrest a highlander  henderson did as commanded at twelve the steward told him to bring up dinner as craigengelt the caterer was ill  dinner began at halfpast twelve at the second course the master entered andrew ruthven had arrived earlier  the company rose from table and henderson who was not at the moment in the room heard them moving and thought that they were ‘going to make breeks for maconilduy’ that is to catch the highlander  finding he was wrong he threw his steel gauntlet into the pantry and sent his boy to his house with his steel cap  he then followed gowrie to meet the king and after he had fetched ‘a drink’ which james says ‘was long in coming’ the master bade him ask mr rhynd gowrie’s old tutor for the key of the gallery which rhynd brought to the master  gowrie then went up and spoke with the master and after some coming and going henderson was sent to the master in the gallery  thither gowrie returned and bade henderson do whatever the master commanded  the king says that gowrie came and went from the room during his dinner  the master next bade henderson enter the turret and locked him in  he passed the time in terror and in prayer  there follows the story of the entry of james and the master and henderson now avers that he ‘threw’ the dagger out of the master’s hand he declares that the master said that he wanted ‘a promise from the king’ on what point gowrie would explain  the rest is much as in the king’s account but henderson was ‘pressing to have opened the window’ he says when the master entered for the second time with the garter to bind the king’s hands  during the struggle henderson removed the master’s hand from the king’s mouth and opened the window  the master said to him ‘wilt thou not help  woe betide thee thou wilt make us all die’ 67a  henderson’s later deposition at the trial in november was mainly but not without discrepancies to the same effect as his first  he said that he prayed when alone in the turret but omits the statement previously made by him that he deprived ruthven of his dagger a very improbable tale told falsely at first no doubt as robertson the notary at first invented his fable about meeting with henderson coming out of the dark staircase  this myth robertson narrated when examined in september but omitted it in the trial in november  henderson now explained about his first opening the wrong window but he sticks to it that he took the garter from ruthven of which james says nothing  he vows that he turned the key of the door on the staircase so that ramsay could enter whereas ramsay averred that he himself forced the door  mr hudson james’s resident at the court of england who in october 1600 interviewed both henderson and the king says that in fact the master had not locked the door on his reentry 67b  henderson slunk out when ramsay came in he adds that it was his steel cap which was put on gowrie’s head by a servant there was plenty of evidence that a steel cap was thus put on  one singular point in henderson’s versions is this after ruthven in deference to james’s harangue in the turret had taken off his hat the king said ‘what is it ye crave man if ye crave not my life’  ‘sir it is but a promise’ answered ruthven  the king asked ‘what promise’ and ruthven said that his brother would explain  this tale looks like a confusion made by henderson’s memory in a passage in james’s narrative ‘his majesty inquired what the earl would do with him since if his majesty’s life were safe according to promise they could gain little in keeping such a prisoner’  ruthven then in james’s narrative said ‘that the earl would tell his majesty at his coming’  it appears that the word ‘promise’ in the royal version occurring at this point in the story clung to henderson’s memory and so crept into his tale  others have thought that the ruthvens wished to extort from james a promise about certain money which he owed to gowrie  but to extort a promise by secluding and threatening the king would have been highly treasonable and dangerous nor need james have kept a promise made under duress  perhaps few persons who are accustomed to weigh and test evidence who know the weaknesses of human memories and the illusions which impose themselves upon our recollections will lay great stress on the discrepancies between henderson’s first deposition in august his second in november and the statement of the king  in the footnote printed below 69a hudson explains the origin of certain differences between the king’s narrative and henderson’s evidence given in august hudson declares that james boasted of having taken the dagger out of ruthven’s hands which in fact james does not do in his published narration and that henderson claimed to have snatched the dagger away ‘to move mercy by more merit’  it is clear that james would not accept his story of disarming ruthven henderson omits that in his second deposition  for the rest james who was quite clever enough to discover the discrepancies let them stand at the end of his own printed narrative with the calm remark that if any differences existed in the depositions they must be taken as ‘uttered by the deponer in his own behouf for obtaining of his majesty’s princely grace and favour’ 69b henderson’s first deposition was one of these which james printed with his own narrative and thus treated en prince  he was not going to harmonise his evidence with henderson’s or henderson’s with his  on the other hand from the first henderson had probably the opportunity to frame his confession on the falkland letter of august 5 to the chancellor and the provost of edinburgh and later on the printed narrative officially issued at the close of august 1600  he varied when he did vary in hopes of ‘his majesty’s princely grace and favour’ and he naturally tried to make out that he was not a mere trembling expostulating caitiff  he clung to the incident of the garter which he snatched from the master’s hand  henderson had no royal model for his account of how he came to be in the turret which james could only learn from himself  now that is the most incredible part of henderson’s narrative  however secret the ruthvens may have desired to be how could they trust everything to the chance that the town councillor of perth upper footman and chamberlain of scone would act the desperate part of seizing a king without training and without warning  but was henderson unwarned and uninstructed or did he fail after ample instruction  that is the difficult point raised by the very curious case of mr robert oliphant which has never been mentioned i think by the many minute students of this bewildering affair     vi  the strange case of mr robert oliphant   suppose that men like the ruthvens great and potent nobles had secretly invited their retainer andrew henderson to take the rôle of the armed man in the turret what could henderson have done  such proposals as this were a danger dreaded even by the most powerful  thus in march 1562 james hepburn the wicked earl of bothwell procured through john knox a reconciliation with his feudal enemy arran  the brain of arran was already it seems impaired  a few days after the reconciliation he secretly consulted knox on a delicate point  bothwell he said had imparted to him a scheme whereby they should seize queen mary’s person and murder her secretary lethington and her halfbrother lord james stuart later earl of moray  arran explained to knox that if ever the plot came to light he would be involved in the crime of guilty concealment of foreknowledge of treason  but if he divulged the plan bothwell would challenge him to trial by combat  knox advised secrecy but arran now far from sane revealed the real or imagined conspiracy  to a man like henderson the peril in simply listening to treasonable proposals from the ruthvens would be even greater  if he merely declined to be a party and kept silence or fled he lost his employment as gowrie’s man and would be ruined  if the plot ever came to light he would be involved in guilty concealment of foreknowledge  if he instantly revealed to the king what he knew his word would not be accepted against that of gowrie he would be tortured to get at the very truth and probably would be hanged by way of experiment to see if he would adhere to his statement on the scaffold—a fate from which henderson in fact was only saved by the king  what then if the gowries offered to henderson the rôle of the man in the turret could henderson do  he could do what according to james and to himself he did he could tremble expostulate and assure the king of his ignorance of the purpose for which he was locked up ‘like a dog’ in the little study  that this may have been the real state of affairs is not impossible  we have seen that calderwood mentions a certain mr robert oliphant mr means master of arts as having been conjectured at immediately after the tragedy as the man in the turret  he must therefore have been and he was a trusted retainer of gowrie  but oliphant at once proved an alibi he was not in perth on august 5  his name never occurs in the voluminous records of the proceedings  he is not like henderson among the persons who fled and for whom search was made as far as the documents declare though calderwood says that he was described as a ‘black grim man’ in ‘the first proclamation’  if so it looks ill for james as henderson was a brown fair man  in any case oliphant at once cleared himself  but we hear of him again though historians have overlooked the fact among the acts of caution of 1600—that is the records of men who become sureties for the good behaviour of others—is an entry in the privy council register for december 5 1600 73  ‘mr alexander wilky in the canongate for john wilky tailor there 200l not to harm john lyn also tailor there further to answer when required touching his john wilky’s pursuit of lyn for revealing certain speeches spoken to him by mr robert oliphant anent his foreknowledge of the treasonable conspiracy of the late john sometime earl of gowrie’  thus robert oliphant ma had spoken to tailor lyn or so lyn had declared about his own foreknowledge of the plot lyn had blabbed tailor wilky had ‘pursued’ or attacked lyn and alexander wilky who was bailie of the canongate enters into recognisances to the amount of 200l that john wilky shall not further molest lyn  now what had oliphant said  on the very day december 5 when alexander wilky became surety for the good behaviour of john wilky nicholson the english resident at holyrood described the facts to robert cecil 74a  nicholson says that at a house in the canongate mr robert oliphant was talking of the gowrie case  he was a man who had travelled and he inveighed against the unfairness of scottish procedure in the case of cranstoun  we have seen that mr thomas cranstoun gowrie’s equerry first brought to lennox and others in the garden the report that the king had ridden away  we have seen that he was deeply wounded by ramsay just before or after gowrie fell  unable to escape he was taken examined tortured tried on august 22 and on august 23 hanged at perth  he had invaded and wounded herries and thomas erskine and had encouraged the mob to beleaguer the back gate of gowrie house against the king’s escape  he had been in france he said since 1589 had come home with gowrie but he swore had not spoken six words with the ruthvens during the last fortnight 74b  this is odd as he was their master stabler and as they by their friends’ account had been making every preparation to leave for dirleton which involved arrangements about their horses  in any case mr robert oliphant in a house in the canongate in november or early december 1600 declared that cranstoun who he said knew nothing of the conspiracy had been hanged while henderson who was in the secret and had taken the turret part escaped and retained his position as chamberlain of scone  henderson at the critical moment had ‘fainted’ said oliphant that is had failed from want of courage  oliphant went on to say that he himself had been with gowrie in paris februarymarch 1600 and that both in paris and at home in scotland later gowrie had endeavoured to induce him to take the part later offered to henderson  he had tried but in vain to divert gowrie’s mind from his dangerous project  this talk of oliphant’s leaked out through lyn as we know and oliphant says nicholson ‘fled again’ 75  of oliphant we learn no more till about june 1608  at that time the king in england heard a rumour that he had been connected with the conspiracy  a captain patrick heron 76 obtained a commission to find oliphant and arrested him at canterbury he was making for dover and for france  heron seized oliphant’s portable property ‘eight angels two half rosenobles one double pistolet two french crowns and a half one albertus angel two english crowns one turkish piece of gold two gold rings and a loose stone belonging to one three netherland dollars one piece of four royals two quart decuria seven pieces of several coins of silver two purses one sword one trunk one “mail” and two budgetts’  oliphant himself lay for nine months in ‘the gate house of westminster’ but heron ‘careless to justify his accusation and discovering his aim in that business’ writes the king ‘presently departed from hence’  ‘we have tried the innocency of mr robert oliphant’ james goes on ‘and have freed him from prison’  the scottish privy council is therefore ordered on march 6 1609 to make heron restore oliphant’s property  on may 16 1609 heron was brought before the privy council in edinburgh and was bidden to make restitution  he was placed in the tolbooth but released by lindsay the keeper of the prison  in march 1610 oliphant having again gone abroad heron expressed his readiness to restore the goods except the trunk and bags which he had given to the english privy council who restored them to robert oliphant  the brother of robert oliphant of bauchiltoun represented him in his absence and in 1611 robert got some measure of restitution from heron  we know no more of mr robert oliphant 77  his freedom of talk was amazing but perhaps he had been drinking when he told the story of his connection with the plot  by 1608 nothing could be proved against him in london in 1600 had he not fled from edinburgh in december something might have been extracted  we can only say that his version of the case is less improbable than henderson’s  henderson—if approached by gowrie as oliphant is reported to have said that he was—could not divulge the plot could not like oliphant a gentleman leave perth and desert his employment  so perhaps he drifted into taking the rôle of the man in the turret  if so he had abundance of time to invent his most improbable story that he was shut up there in ignorance of the purpose of his masters  henderson was not always of the lamblike demeanour which he displayed in the turret  on march 5 1601 nicholson reports that ‘sir hugh herries’ the lame doctor ‘and henderson fell out and were at offering of strokes’ whence ‘revelations’ were anticipated  they never came and for all that we know herries may have taunted henderson with oliphant’s version of his conduct  he was pretty generally suspected of having been in the conspiracy and of having failed from terror and then betrayed his masters while pretending not to have known why he was placed in the turret  it is remarkable that herries did not appear as a witness at the trial in november  he was knighted and rewarded every one almost was rewarded out of gowrie’s escheats or forfeited property  but that was natural whether james was guilty or innocent and we repeat that the rewards present or in prospect did not produce witnesses ready to say that they saw henderson at falkland or in the tumult or in the turret  why men so freely charged with murderous conspiracy and false swearing were so dainty on these and other essential points the advocates of the theory of perjury may explain  how james treated discrepancies in the evidence we have seen  his account was the true account he would not alter it he would not suppress the discrepancies of henderson except as to the dagger  witnesses might say this or that to secure the king’s princely favour  let them say the king’s account is true  this attitude is certainly more dignified and wiser than the easy method of harmonising all versions before publication  meanwhile if there were discrepancies they were held by sceptics to prove falsehood if there had been absolute harmony that would really have proved collusion  on one point i suspect suppression at the trial  almost all versions aver that ramsay or another said to gowrie ‘you have slain the king’ and that gowrie who certainly did not mean murder then dropped his points and was stabbed of this nothing is said at the trial by any witnesses     vii  the contemporary ruthven vindication   we now come to the evidence which is most fatally damaging to the two unfortunate ruthvens  it is the testimony of their contemporary vindication  till a date very uncertain a tradition hung about perth that some old gentlemen remembered having seen a vindication of the ruthvens written at the time of the events 80  antiquaries vainly asked each other for copies of this valuable apology  was it printed and suppressed by royal order  did it circulate only in manuscript  in 1812 a mr panton published a vehement defence of the ruthvens speaking of the king’s narrative he says ‘in a short time afterwards a reply or counter manifesto setting forth the matter in its true light written by some friend of the ruthven family made its appearance  the discovery of this performance would now be a valuable acquisition but there is no probability that any such exists as the government instantly ordered the publication to be suppressed    ’  the learned and accurate lord hailes writing in the second half of the eighteenth century 1757 says ‘it appears by a letter of sir john carey governor’ really deputy governor ‘of berwick to cecil 4th september 1600 that some treatise had been published in scotland in vindication of gowrie’  that ‘treatise’ or rather newsletter unsigned and overlooked by our historians as far as my knowledge goes is extant in the record office 81  we can identify it as the document mentioned by carey to cecil in his letter of september 4 1600  carey was then in command of berwick the great english frontier fortress for his chief ‘the brave lord willoughby’ was absent on sick leave  on september 4 then from berwick carey wrote to sir robert cecil ‘i have thought good to send you such’ information ‘as i have received out of scotland this morning on both sides both on the king’s part and the earl’s part that you may read them both together’  now we possess a manuscript ‘the verie maner of the erll of gowrie and his brother their death quha war killit at perth the fyft of august by the kingis servanttis his majestie being present’  this paper is directed to ‘my lord governor’ and as carey was acting for ‘my lord governor’ lord willoughby at berwick he received and forwarded the document to cecil  this is the vindication at least i know no other and no printed copy though nicholson writes that a ‘book on the ruthven side was printed in england’ october 28 1600  the manuscript is in bad condition in parts illegible acids appear to have been applied to it  the story however from the gowrie side can be easily made out  it alleges that ‘on saturday august 1’ really august 2 the lame dr herries came on some pretext to gowrie’s house ‘this man by my lord was convoyed through the house and the secret parts shown him’  now there was no ‘secret part’ in the house as far as the narratives go the entry to the narrow staircase was inconspicuous but was noticed by ramsay and of course was familiar to gowrie and his men  on tuesday the fatal day according to the ruthven vindication gowrie’s retainers were preparing to go with him ‘to lothian’ that is to dirleton a castle of his on the sea hard by north berwick  the narrator argues as all the friends of the ruthvens did that if gowrie had intended any treason his men would not have been busy at their houses with preparations for an instant removal  the value of this objection is null  if gowrie had a plot it probably was to carry the king to dirleton with him in disguise                          picture dirleton castle  the master the apology goes on whom the king had sent for ‘divers times before and on august 5’ rode early to falkland accompanied by andrew ruthven and andrew henderson  none of james’s men nor james himself as we have remarked saw henderson at falkland and modern opponents of the king deny as the aforesaid mr panton does that he was there  here they clash with ‘the verie manner’ c issued at the time by gowrie’s defenders  it avers that the master and his two men did not intend to return from falkland to perth  they meant to sleep at falkland on the night of the fifth and meet gowrie next day august 6 ‘at the waterside’ and cross with him to the south coast of the firth of forth thence riding on as other friendly accounts allege to dirleton near north berwick  ‘and andrew henderson’s confessions testified this’  as published they do nothing of the sort  the master ‘took his lodging in falkland for this night’  hearing that james was to hunt the master breakfasted and went to look for him  after a conversation with james he bade henderson ride back to perth and tell gowrie that ‘for what occasion he knew not’ the king was coming  now after they all arrived at perth the master told gowrie’s caterer craigengelt that the king had come ‘because robert abercrombie that false knave had brought the king there to make his majesty take order for his debt’ 83   this fact was stated by craigengelt himself under examination  if ruthven spoke the truth he did know the motive or pretext of the king’s coming which the apologist denies  but ruthven was not speaking the truth he told craigengelt as we saw that he had been ‘on an errand not far off’  as to the debt james owed gowrie a large sum with accumulated interest for expenses incurred by gowrie’s father when lord treasurer of scotland 1583–1584  james in june 1600 as we shall see gave gowrie a year’s respite from the pursuit of his father’s creditors hoping to pay him in the meanwhile  whether this exemption would not have defended gowrie from robert abercromby whether james would act as debt collector for robert abercromby a burgess of edinburgh the king’s saddler the reader may decide  but the master gave to craigengelt this reason for james’s unexpected arrival though his contemporary apologist says as to james’s motive for coming to perth that the master ‘knew nothing’  henderson having cantered off with his message james rode to perth nothing is said by the apologist of the four hours spent in hunting ‘accompanied by sixty horsemen of whom thirty came a little before him’ no trace of either the sixty or the thirty appears anywhere in the evidence  no witness alludes to the arrival of any of the king’s party in front of him  on hearing from henderson of the king’s approach says the vindication gowrie who was dining ordered a new meal to be prepared  all the other evidence shows that henderson came back to perth long before gowrie dined and that nevertheless gowrie made no preparations at all  gowrie with four others then met the king on the inch of perth says the apologist  james kissed him when they met the kiss of judas we are to understand  he entered the house and all the keys were given to james’s retainers  the porter as we saw really had the keys and gowrie opened the garden gate with one of them  the apologist is mendacious  dinner was soon over  james sent the master to bid ramsay and erskine ‘follow him to his chamber where his majesty sir thomas erskine john ramsay dr herries and mr wilson being convened slew the master and threw him down the stair how and for what cause they know best themselves’  of course it is absolutely certain that the master did not bring the other three men to james in the chamber where the master was first wounded  undeniably herries ramsay and erskine were not brought by the master at james’s command to this room  they did not enter it till after the cries of ‘treason’ were yelled by james from the window of the turret  a servant of james’s says the apologist now brought the news that the king had ridden away  cranstoun gowrie’s man really did this as he admitted  gowrie the author goes on hearing of james’s departure called for his horse and went out into the street  there he stood ‘abiding his horse’  now cranstoun as he confessed had told gowrie that his horse was at scone two miles away  by keeping his horses there gowrie made it impossible for him to accompany the royal retinue as they went on their useless errand p 21 supra  in the street gowrie ‘hears his majesty call on him out at the chamber window “my lord of gowrie traitors has murdered your brother already and ye suffer me to be murdered also”’  nobody else heard this and if gowrie heard it how inept it was in him to go about asking ‘what is the matter’  he was occupied thus while lennox mar and the others were rushing up the great staircase to rescue the king  james according to the ruthven apologist had told gowrie what the matter was his brother was slain and slain by erskine who while the earl asked ‘what is the matter’ was trying to collar that distracted nobleman  the master had brought erskine to the king says the apologist erskine had slain the master yet simultaneously he tried to seize gowrie in the street  erskine was in two places at once the apology is indeed ‘a valuable acquisition’  gowrie and cranstoun and they alone the apologist avers were now permitted by james’s servants to enter the house  we know that many of james’s men were really battering at the locked door and we know that others of gowrie’s people besides cranstoun entered the house and were wounded in the scuffle  cranstoun himself says nothing of any opposition to their entry to the house after gowrie drew his two swords  cranstoun according to the apologist first entered the chamber alone and was wounded and drawn back by gowrie—which cranstoun in his own statement denies  after his wounds he fled he says seeing no more of gowrie  then according to the apologist gowrie himself at last entered the chamber the king’s friends attacked him but he was too cunning of fence for them  they therefore parleyed and promised to let him see the king who was in the turret  gowrie dropped his points ramsay stabbed him he died committing his soul to god and declaring that he was a true subject  this narrative we are told by its author is partly derived from the king’s men partly from the confessions of cranstoun craigengelt and baron accused of having been in the chamberfight and active in the tumult  all these three were tried and hanged  the apologist adds that james’s companions will swear to whatever he pleases  this was unjust ramsay would not venture to recognise the man of whom he caught a glimpse in the turret and nobody pretended to have seen henderson at falkland though the presence of henderson at falkland and in the chamber was an essential point  but among the king’s crew of perjurers not a man swore to either fact  what follows relates to gowrie’s character ‘he had paid all his father’s debts’ which most assuredly he had not done  as to the causes of his taking off they are explained by the apologist but belong to a later part of the inquiry  such was the contemporary vindication of gowrie sent to carey at berwick for english reading and forwarded by carey to cecil  the narrative is manifestly false on the points which we have noted  it is ingeniously asserted by the vindicator that a servant of james brought the report that he had ridden away  it is not added that the false report was really brought by cranstoun and twice confirmed by gowrie once after he had gone to make inquiry upstairs  again the apologist never even hints at the locked door of the gallery chamber whereat mar lennox and the rest so long and so vainly battered  who locked that door and why  the subject is entirely omitted by the apologist  on the other hand the apologist never alludes to the murrays who were in the town  other writers soon after the events and in our own day allege that james had arranged his plot so as to coincide with the presence of the murrays in perth  what they did to serve him we have heard  john murray was wounded by a ruthven partisan after the earl and master were dead  some murrays jostled gowrie before he rushed to his death  young tullibardine helped to pacify the populace  that is all  nothing more is attributed to the murrays and the contemporary apologist did not try to make capital out of them  though the narrative of the contemporary apologist for the ruthvens appears absolutely to lack evidence for its assertions it reveals on analysis a consistent theory of the king’s plot  it may not be verifiable in fact it cannot be true but there is a theory a system which we do not find in most contemporary or in more recent arguments james by the theory is intent on the destruction of the ruthvens  his plan was to bring the master to falkland and induce the world to believe that it was the master who brought him to perth  the master refuses several invitations at last on his way to dirleton he goes to falkland taking with him andrew ruthven and andrew henderson  the old apologist asserts what modern vindicators deny that henderson was at falkland  then the master sends henderson first andrew ruthven later to warn gowrie that for some unknown reason the king is coming  to conceal his bloody project though the apologist does not mention the circumstance james next passes four hours in hunting  to omit this certain fact is necessary for the apologist’s purpose  the king sends thirty horsemen in front of him and follows with thirty more  after dinner he leaves the hall with the master but sends him back for erskine wilson and ramsay  james having secured their help and next lured the master into a turret the minions kill ruthven and throw his body downstairs one of them simultaneously is in the street  james has previously arranged that one of his servants shall give out that the king has ridden away this he does announce at the nick of time though gowrie’s servant did it so that gowrie shall go towards the stables where he expects to find his horse though he knows it is at scone thus coming within earshot of the turret window  thence james shouts to gowrie that traitors are murdering him and have murdered the master  now this news would bring not only gowrie but all the royal retinue to his majesty’s assistance  but as not knowing the topography of the house the retinue james must have calculated will run up the main stairs to rescue the king  their arrival would be inconvenient to the king as the nobles would find that james has only friends with him not traitors so the king has had the door locked we guess though we are not told this by the apologist to keep out lennox mar and the rest  gowrie however has to be admitted and killed and gowrie knowing the house will come the king calculates by the dark stair and the unlocked door therefore james’s friends in the street will let him and cranstoun enter the house these two alone and no others with them  they knowing the narrow staircase go up that way naturally  as naturally gowrie lets cranstoun face the danger of four hostile swords alone  waiting till cranstoun is disabled gowrie then confronts alone the same murderous blades is disarmed by a ruse and is murdered  this explanation has a method a system  unfortunately it is contradicted by all the evidence now to be obtained from whatever source it comes retainers of gowrie companions of james or burgesses of perth  we must suppose that gowrie with his small force of himself and cranstoun both fencers from the foreign schools would allow that force to be cut off in detail one by one  we must suppose that erskine was where he certainly was not in two places at once and that ramsay and herries and he unseen left the hall and joined the king on a message brought by the master unmarked by any witness  we must suppose that the king’s witnesses who professed ignorance on essential points perjured themselves on others in batches  but if we grant that mar lennox and the rest—gentlemen servants retainers and menials of the ruthvens and citizens of perth—were abandoned perjurers on some points while scrupulously honourable on others equally essential the narrative of the ruthven apologist has a method a consistency which we do not find in modern systems unfavourable to the king  for example the modern theories easily show how james trapped the master  he had only to lure him into a room and cry ‘treason’  then even if untutored in his part some hotheaded young man like ramsay would stab ruthven  but to deal with gowrie was a more difficult task he would be out in the open surrounded by men like lennox and mar great nobles and his near kinsmen  they would attest the innocence of the earl  they must therefore be separated from him lured away to attack the locked door while gowrie would stand in the street asking ‘what is the matter’ though james had told him and detained by the murrays till they saw fit to let him and cranstoun go within the gate alone  then knowing the topography gowrie and cranstoun would necessarily make for the murderchamber by the dark stair and perish  the royal wit never conceived a subtler plot it is much cleverer than that invented by mr g p r james in his novel ‘gowrie’  nothing is wrong with the system of the apologist except that the facts are false and the idea a trifle too subtle while instead of boldly saying that the king had the gallery chamber locked against his friends the apologist never hints at that circumstance  we have to help the contemporary vindicator out by adding the detail of the locked door which he did not see how to account for and therefore omitted and by explaining that the king had it locked himself that lennox mar and the rest might not know the real state of the case and that gowrie might be trapped through taking the other way by the narrow staircase  an author so conspicuously mendacious as he who wrote the apology for english consumption is unworthy of belief on any point  it does not follow that henderson was really at falkland because the apologist says that he was  but it would appear that this vindicator could not well deny the circumstance and that to work it conveniently into his fable he had to omit the king’s hunting and to contradict the hays and moncrieff by making henderson arrive at perth after twelve instead of about ten o’clock  the value of the apology so long overlooked is to show how very poor a case was the best that the vindicator of the ruthvens was able to produce  but no doubt it was good enough for people who wished to believe 93     viii  the theory of an accidental brawl   so far the king’s narrative is least out of keeping with probability  but had james been insulted menaced and driven to a personal struggle as he declared  is the fact not that finding himself alone with ruthven and an armed man or no armed man if you believe that none was there james lost his nerve and cried ‘treason’ in mere panic  the rest followed from the hot blood of the three courtiers and the story of james was invented after the deaths of the gowries to conceal the truth and to rob by forfeiture the family of ruthven  but james had certainly told lennox the story of ruthven and the pot of gold before they reached perth  if he came with innocent intent he had not concocted that story as an excuse for coming  we really must be consistent  mr barbé a recent ruthven apologist says that the theory of an accidental origin of ‘the struggle between james and ruthven may possibly contain a fairly accurate conjecture’ 94  but mr barbé also argues that james had invented the pot of gold story before he left falkland that if james was guilty ‘the pretext had been framed’—the myth of the treasure had been concocted—‘long before their meeting in falkland and was held in readiness to use whenever circumstances required’  if so then there is no room at all for the opinion that the uproar in the turret was accidental but mr barbé’s meaning is that james thus forced a quarrel on ruthven  for there was no captive with a pot of gold nor can accident have caused the tragedy if ruthven lured james to falkland with the false tale of the golden hoard that tale confided by james to lennox on the ride to perth was either an invention of the king’s—in which case james is the crafty conspirator whom mr bruce in 1602 did not believe him to be as shall be shown—or it is true that ruthven brought james to perth by the feigned story—in which case ruthven is a conspirator  i reject for reasons already given the suggestion that lennox perjured himself when he swore that james told him about ruthven’s narrative as to the captive and his hoard  for these reasons alone there is no room for the hypothesis of accident either james or ruthven was a deliberate traitor  if james invented the pot of gold he is the plotter if ruthven did ruthven is guilty  there is no via media no room for the theory of accident  the via media the hypothesis of accident was suggested by sir william bowes who wrote out his theory in a letter to sir john stanhope from bradley on september 2 1600  bowes had been english ambassador in scotland probably with the usual commission to side with the king’s enemies and especially much as elizabeth loathed her own puritans with the party of the kirk  his coach had been used for the kidnapping of an english gentleman then with james while the governor of berwick supplied a yacht in case it seemed better to carry off the victim by sea 1599 consequently bowes was unpopular and needed and got a guard of forty horsemen for his protection  he was no friend as may be imagined of the king  bowes had met preston whom james sent to elizabeth with his version of the gowrie affair  bowes’s theory of it all was this james the master ‘and one other attending’ the man of the turret were alone in a chamber of gowrie house  speech arose about the late earl of gowrie ruthven’s father whether by occasion of his portrait on the wall or otherwise ‘the king angrily said he was a traitor whereat the youth showing a grieved and expostulatory countenance and haplie scotlike words the king seeing himself alone and without weapon cried treason’  the master placed his hand on james’s mouth and knelt to deprecate his anger but ramsay stabbed him as he knelt and gowrie was slain preston said after ramsay had made him drop his guard by crying that the king was murdered  the tale of the conspiracy was invented by james to cover the true state of the case 96  this bowes only puts forth as a working hypothesis  it breaks down on the king’s narrative to lennox about ruthven’s captive and hoard  it breaks down on ‘one other attending’—the man in the turret—whatever else he may have been he was no harmless attendant  it breaks down on the locked door between the king and lennox and mar which bowes omits  it is ruined by gowrie’s repeated false assurances that the king had ridden away which bowes ignores  the third hypothesis the via media is impossible  there was a deliberate plot on one side or the other  to make the theory of bowes quite clear his letter is appended to this section 97     ix  contemporary clerical criticism   the most resolute sceptics as to the guilt of the ruthvens were the edinburgh preachers  they were in constant opposition to the king and the young gowrie was their favourite nobleman  as to what occurred when the news of the tragedy reached edinburgh early on july 6 we have the narrative of mr robert bruce then the leader of the presbyterians  his own version is printed in the first volume of the bannatyne club miscellany and is embodied with modifications and without acknowledgment as references to such sources were usually omitted at that period in calderwood’s history  it is thus better to follow mr bruce’s own account as far as it goes  the preachers heard the ‘bruit’ or rumour of the tragedy by nine o’clock on the morning of august 6  by ten o’clock arrived a letter from james to the privy council the preachers were called first ‘before the council of the town’ and the king’s epistle was read to them  ‘it bore that his majesty was delivered out of a peril and therefore that we should be commanded to go to our kirks convene our people ring bells and give god praises’  while the preachers were answering the privy council sent for the provost and some of the town council  the preachers then went to deliberate in the east kirk and decided ‘that we could not enter into the particular defence of’ the existence of ‘the treason seeing that the king was silent of the treason in his own letter and the reports of courtiers varied among themselves’  this is not easily intelligible  the letter from falkland of which nicholson gives an account on august 6 was exceedingly ‘particular as to the treason’  it is my impression based mainly on the burgh records quoted by pitcairn that the letter with full particulars cited by nicholson was written more or less officially by the notary david moysie who was at falkland and that the king’s letter was brief only requiring thanksgiving to be offered  yet nicholson says that the letter with details written by the king he seems to think was meant for the preachers as well as for the privy council cf p 38 note  the preachers in any case were now brought before the privy council and desired by montrose the chancellor to go to church and thank god for the king’s ‘miraculous delivery from that vile treason’  they replied that ‘they could not be certain of the treason’ but would speak of delivery ‘from a great danger’  or they would wait and when quite sure of the treason would blaze it abroad  ‘they’ the council ‘said it should be sufficient to read his majesty’s letter’  this appears to mean that the preachers would content the lords by merely reading james’s letter aloud to the public  ‘we answered that we could not read his letter’ aloud to the people ‘and doubt of the truth of it  it would be better to say generally “if the report be true”’  the preachers would have contented the lords by merely reading james’s letter aloud to their congregations  but this they declined to do they wished in the pulpit to evade the royal letter and merely to talk conditionally of the possible truth of the report or ‘bruit’  this appears to have been a verbal narrative brought by graham of balgonie which seemed to vary from the long letter probably penned by moysie  at this moment the rev david lindsay who had been at falkland and had heard james’s story from his own mouth arrived  he therefore was sent to tell the tale publicly at the cross  the council reported to james that the six edinburgh preachers ‘would in no ways praise god for his delivery’  in fact they would only do so in general terms  on august 12 james took the preachers to task  bruce explained that they could thank and on sunday had thanked god for the king’s delivery but could go no further into detail ‘in respect we had no certainty’ ‘had you not my letter’ asked the king  bruce replied that the letter spoke only ‘of a danger in general’  yet the letter reported by nicholson was ‘full and particular’ but that letter the preachers seem to have regarded as unofficial  ‘could not my council inform you of the particulars’ asked the king  the president fyvie later chancellor dunfermline said that they had assured the preachers of the certainty of the treason  on this bruce replied that they had only a report brought orally by balgonie and a letter by moysie an edinburgh notary then at falkland and that these testimonies ‘fought so together that no man could have any certainty’  the secretary elphinstone later lord balmerino denied the discrepancies  james now asked what was the preachers’ present opinion  they had heard the king himself the council and mar  bruce replied that as a minister he was not fully persuaded  four of the preachers adhered to their scepticism  two hewat and robertson now professed conviction the other four were forbidden to preach under pain of death and forbidden to come within ten miles of edinburgh  they offered terms but these were refused  the reason of james’s ferocity was that the devout regarded the preachers as the mouthpieces of god and so if they doubted his word the king’s character would to the godly seem no better than that of a mendacious murderer  from a modern point of view the ministers if doubtful had a perfect right to be silent and one of them hall justly objected that he ought to wait for the verdict in the civil trial of the dead ruthvens  we shall meet this hall and hewatt one of the two ministers who professed belief in very strange circumstances later p 217  here it is enough to have explained the king’s motives for severity  in september the recalcitrants came before the king at stirling  all professed to be convinced one after inquiries in fife except bruce we learn what happened next from a letter of his to his wife  he had heard from one who had been at craigengelt’s execution august 23 that craigengelt had then confessed that henderson had told him how he was placed by gowrie in the turret 103  bruce had sent to verify this moreover he would believe if henderson were hanged and adhered to his deposition to the last a pretty experiment  the comptroller asked ‘will you believe a condemned man better than the king and council’  mr bruce admitted that such was his theory of the grammar of assent  ‘if henderson die penitently i will trust him’  later as we shall see this pleasing experiment was tried in another case but though the witness died penitently and clinging to his final deposition not one of the godly sceptics was convinced  ‘but henderson saved the king’s life’ replied the comptroller to mr bruce  ‘as to that i cannot tell’ said mr bruce and added that if henderson took the dagger from ruthven he deserved to die for not sheathing it in ruthven’s breast  henderson later we know withdrew his talk of his seizure of the dagger which james had never admitted  james now said that he knew not what became of the dagger  ‘suppose’ said the comptroller ‘henderson goes back from that deposition’  ‘then his testimony is the worse’ said mr bruce  ‘then it were better to keep him alive’ said the comptroller but mr bruce insisted that henderson would serve james best by dying penitently james said that bruce made him out a murderer  ‘if i would have taken their lives i had causes enough’ his meaning is unknown ‘i need not have hazarded myself so’  by the ‘causes’ can james have meant gowrie’s attempts to entangle him in negotiations with the pope 104  these were alleged by mr galloway in a sermon preached on august 11 in the open air before the king and the populace of edinburgh see infra p 128  mar wondered that bruce would not trust men who like himself heard the king cry and saw the hand at his throat  mr bruce said that mar might believe ‘as he were there to hear and see’  he was left to inform himself but calderwood says that the story about craigengelt’s dying confession was untrue  bruce had frankly given the lie to the king and mar though he remarked that he had never heard mar and lennox tell the tale ‘out of their own mouths’  mar later september 24 most solemnly assured mr bruce by letter that the treason ‘in respect of that i saw’ was a certain fact  this he professed ‘before god in heaven’  meanwhile mr hall was restored to his edinburgh pulpit and mr bruce after a visit to restalrig a place close to edinburgh and leith went into banishment 105a  if he stayed with the laird of restalrig he had as will presently appear a strange choice in friends pp 148–167  a later letter of bruce’s now takes up the tale  in 1601 bruce was in london when mar was there as james’s envoy  they met and bruce said he was content to abide by the verdict in the gowrie trial of november 1600 what he boggled at henceforward was a public apology for his disbelief an acceptance from the pulpit of the king’s veracity as to the events in london bruce had found that the puritans as to the guilt of essex which was flagrant were in the same position as himself regarding the guilt of gowrie 105b  but they bowed to the law and so would he—‘for the present’  the puritans in england would not preach that they were persuaded of the guilt of essex nor would bruce preach his persuasion of the guilt of gowrie ‘from my knowledge and from my persuasion’  he assured mar ‘that it was not possible for any man to be fully persuaded or to take on their conscience but so many as saw and heard’  however bruce is selfcontradictory  he would be persuaded if henderson swung for it adhering to his statement  such were mr brace’s theories of evidence he added that he was not fully persuaded that there was any hell to go to yet probably he scrupled not to preach ‘tidings of damnation’  he wanted to be more certain of gowrie’s guilt than he was that there is hellfire  ‘spiteful taunts’ followed mar’s repartee to the argument about hell being obvious  bruce must have asserted the existence of hell from the pulpit though not ‘fully persuaded’ of hell  so why not assert the king’s innocence  bruce returned later to scotland and met the king in april 1602  now he said according to calderwood that he was ‘resolved’ that is convinced  what convinced him  mar’s oath  ‘how could he swear’ asked james ‘he neither saw nor heard’—that is what passed between james the man in the turret and the master  ‘i cannot tell you how he could swear but indeed he swore very deeply’ said bruce and reported the oath which must have been a fine example  james took bruce’s preference of mar’s oath to his own word very calmly  bruce was troubled about the exact state of affairs between james and the master  ‘doubt ye of that’ said the king ‘then ye could not but count me a murderer’ ‘it followeth not if it please you sir’ said mr robert ‘for ye might have had some secret cause’ 107a  strange ethics  a man may slay another without incurring the guilt of murder if he has ‘a secret cause’  bruce probably referred to the tattle about a love intrigue between gowrie or ruthven and the king’s wife  even now james kept his temper  he offered his whole story to bruce for crossexamination  ‘mr robert uttered his doubt where he found occasion  the king heard him gently and with a constant countenance which mr robert admired’  but mr robert would not preach his belief would not apologise from the pulpit  ‘i give it but a doubtsome trust’ he said  again on june 24 1602 james invited crossexamination  bruce asked how he could possibly know the direction of his majesty’s intention when he ordered ramsay to strike the master  ‘i will give you leave to pose me’ interrogate me said james 107b  ‘had you a purpose to slay my lord’—that is gowrie  ‘as i shall answer to god i knew not that my lord was slain till i saw him in his last agony and was very sorry yea prayed in my heart for the same’  ‘what say ye then concerning mr alexander’  ‘i grant i was art and part in mr alexander’s slaughter for it was in my own defence’  ‘why brought you not him to justice seeing you should have god before your eyes’  ‘i had neither god nor the devil man before my eyes but my own defence’  ‘here the king began to fret’ and no wonder  he frankly said that ‘he was one time minded to have spared mr alexander but being moved for the time the motion’ passion ‘prevailed’  he swore in answer to a question that in the morning he loved the master ‘as his brother’  bruce was now convinced that james left falkland innocent of evil purpose but as he was in a passion and revengeful while struggling with the master ‘he could not be innocent before god’  here we leave mr bruce  he signed a declaration of belief in james’s narrative public apologies in the pulpit he would not make  he was banished to inverness and was often annoyed and ‘put at’ james reckoning him a firebrand  the result on the showing of the severe and hostile calderwood is that in bruce’s opinion in june 1602 james was guiltless of a plot against the ruthvens  the king’s crime was not that strangely complicated project of a double murder to be inferred from the ruthven apology but words spoken in the heat of blood  betrayed captured taunted insulted struggling with a subject whom he had treated kindly james cried to ramsay ‘strike low’  he knew not the nature and extent of the conspiracy against him he knew not what knocking that was at the door of the chamber and he told ramsay to strike we have no assurance that the wounds were deadly  this is how the matter now appeared to mr bruce  the king swore very freely to the truth of his tale and that influenced bruce but the king’s candour as to what passed in his own mind when he bade ramsay strike ruthven is more convincing to a modern critic than his oaths for some reason bruce’s real point that he was satisfied of the king’s innocence of a plot but not satisfied as regards his yielding to passion when attacked is ignored by the advocates of the ruthvens  mr barbé observes ‘what slight success there ever was remained on bruce’s side for in one conference he drew from the king the confession that he might have saved ruthven’s life and brought him to justice’  that confession shows unexpected candour in james but does not in the slightest degree implicate him in a conspiracy and of a conspiracy even the rigid bruce now acquitted the king  mr pitcairn at first a strong king’s man in an appendix to his third volume credits bruce with the best of the argument  this he does illogically because the king never ceased to persecute bruce whom he thought a firebrand  however wicked this conduct of james may have been it in no way affects the argument as to his guilt in the conspiracy  of that mr bruce acquitted the king calderwood’s words vi 156 are ‘mr robert by reason of his oaths thought him innocent of any purpose that day in the morning to slay them yet because he confessed he had not god or justice before his eyes but was in a heat and mind to revenge he could not be innocent before god and had great cause to repent and to crave mercy for christ’s sake’ the thing is perfectly clear  bruce acquitted james of the infamous plot against the ruthvens 110   what then was the position of the ruthvens if the king was not the conspirator  obviously they were guilty whether james at a given moment was carried away by passion or not     x  popular criticism of the day   calderwood has preserved for us the objections taken by sceptics to the king’s narrative 111  first the improbability of a murderous conspiracy by youths so full of promise and presbyterianism as gowrie and his brother  to gowrie’s previous performances we return later  the objection against a scheme of murder hardly applies to a plan for kidnapping a king who was severe against the kirk  the story of the pot of gold and the king’s desire to inspect it and the captive who bore it personally and the folly of thinking that one pot of gold could suffice to disturb the peace of the country are next adversely criticised  we have already replied to the criticism p 40 the story was well adapted to entrap james vi  the improbabilities of ruthven’s pleas for haste need not detain us the king did not think them probable  next it was asked ‘why did james go alone upstairs with ruthven’  he may have had wine enough to beget valour or as he said he may have believed that he was being followed by erskine  the two reasons may well have combined  ‘why did not gowrie provide better cheer if forewarned’ by henderson it was asked  to give the impression we reply that he was taken by surprise and that the king came uninvited and unexpected  ‘why did ruthven aim a dagger at james and then hold parley’  because he wanted to frighten the king into being ‘at his will’  ‘how could ruthven trust the king with the armed man alone in the turret’  what else could he do  he locked them in and was through the failure of the man in a quandary which made clear reflection necessary—and impossible  ‘it was strange that the man had not been trained in his task’  if oliphant is correctly reported he had been trained but ‘fainted’  ‘why bind the king with a garter’  in helpless pursuit of the forlorn idea of capturing him  ‘why execute the enterprise when the courtiers were passing the window’  ruthven could not have known that they were coming at that moment it was gowrie’s illtimed falsehoods to the effect that the king had ridden away which brought them there  gowrie had not allowed for henderson’s failure  ‘how could the king struggle successfully with the stalwart master’  he fought for his life and ruthven probably even then did not wish to injure him bodily  ‘why was not the master made prisoner’  james answered this question when ‘posed’ by mr bruce  his blood was up and he said ‘strike’  ‘the earl likewise might after he was stricken have been preserved alive’  perhaps—by miracle he died instantly  the discrepancies as to the dagger and the opening of the window we have already treated also the locking and unlocking or leaving unlocked of the chamber door giving on the dark staircase after ruthven’s last hurried entrance p 69  there follow arguments to be later considered about the relations between james and the earl previous to the tragedy and a statement with no authority cited that james had written to gowrie’s uncle to meet him at perth on august 5 implying that james had made up his mind to be there and did not go on ruthven’s sudden invitation  ‘the earl and cranstoun were alone with the four in the fatal chamber the others who were wounded there went up after gowrie’s death’  it may be so but the bulk of the evidence is on the other side  ‘it is reported’ that henderson was eating an egg in the kitchen and went into the town when the fray arose  it is also denied on oath by gowrie’s cook who added that he was ‘content to be hanged’ if it could be proved 114  the ruthven apologist ms says that henderson was waiting on the lords who dined in the hall and was there when the king’s servant brought the news that the king had ridden away  ‘the master’s sword after his death was found rusted tight in his scabbard’  the master must have been a very untidy gallant  no authority is cited for the story  the murrays who were well rewarded were in perth ‘whether of set purpose let the reader judge’  by all means let the reader judge  the king knew henderson so the anonymous goodman of pitmillie said but did not recognise the man in the turret  it was reported that patrick galloway the king’s chaplain induced henderson to pretend to be the man in the turret  as to the good man of pitmillie calderwood did not even know his name this is mere gossip  again calderwood who offers these criticisms does not ask why of all concerned henderson was the only man that fled who had not been seen in connection with the fray and the tumult  if he was not the man of the turret and if andrew ruthven who also had ridden to falkland did not abscond why did henderson  as to the man in the turret if not a retainer of ruthven he was a minion of james or there was no man at all  if there was no man at all could james be so absurd as to invent him on the off chance that somebody anybody would turn up and claim to have been the man  that is frankly incredible  but if james managed to insert a man into the turret he was not so silly as not to have his man ready to produce in evidence  yet henderson could not be produced he had fled and certainly had not come in by august 12 when he was proclaimed  that james had introduced and suborned henderson and that henderson fled to give tone and colour to his narrative is not among the most probable of conjectures  i do not find that this desperate hypothesis was put forward at the time  it could not be for apologists averred 1 that henderson was eating an egg in the kitchen 2 that he was waiting on the gentlemen in the hall at the moment when by the desperate hypothesis he was by some machination of james in the turret 3 there is a third myth a perth tradition that henderson had been at scone all day and first heard the tragic news when all was over as on his return he crossed the bridge over tay  as it is incredible that there was no man in the turret at all and that james took the outside chance that somebody anybody would claim to be the man the assailants of the king must offer a working hypothesis of this important actor in the drama  my own fancy can suggest none  was he in four places at once in the kitchen in the hall on the bridge and in the turret  if he was in the kitchen in the hall or on the bridge why did he instantly abscond  if james put him in the turret why did he fly  the king’s word i repeat was the word that no man could rely on  but among competing improbabilities the story which was written on the night of august 5 and to which he adhered under bruce’s crossexamination is infinitely the least improbable  the master of gray an abominable character not in scotland when the events occurred reported not from scotland that lennox had said that if put on his oath ‘he could not say whether the practice proceeded from gowrie or the king’  sept 30 1600                          picture falkland palace  the master of gray wrote from chillingham on the english side of the border where he was playing the spy for cecil  often he played the double spy for england and for rome  lennox may well have been puzzled he may have said so but the report rests on the evidence of one who did not hear his words who wished to flatter the scepticism of james’s english enemies and whose character though on one point he is unjustly accused reeks with infamy  that of james does not precisely ‘smell sweet and blossom in the dust’ but if the question arises whether a man of james’s position age and temperament or whether a young man with the antecedents which we are about to describe was the more likely to embark on a complicated and dangerous plot—in james’s case involving two murders at inestimable personal risk—it is not unnatural to think that the young man is the more likely to ‘have the wyte of it’     xi  the king and the ruthvens   having criticised the contemporary criticism of the gowrie affair we must look back and examine the nature of gowrie’s ancestral and personal relations with james before the day of calamity  there were grounds enough for hatred between the king and the earl whether such hatred existed or not in a kind of hereditary feud and in political differences  as against james’s grandmother mary of guise the grandfather of gowrie lord ruthven had early joined the reformers who opposed her in arms  later in 1566 it was gowrie’s grandfather who took the leading part in the murder of riccio  he fled to england and there died soon after his exploit beholding it was said a vision of angels  his son gowrie’s father also one of the riccio murderers when mary was imprisoned in loch leven june 1567 was in charge of her but was removed ‘as he began to show great favour to her and gave her intelligence’ 118  mary herself through the narrative of nau her secretary declares that ruthven then a married man persecuted her by his lust  he aided lindsay in extorting her abdication at loch leven such was his record as regards mary james too had little reason to love him  the early reign of james in scotland was a series of court revolutions all of the same sort  james was always either unwillingly under nobles who were allies of elizabeth and who used the kirk as their instrument or under vicious favourites who delivered him from these influences when morton fell in 1581 the king was under d’aubigny lennox a false protestant and secret catholic intriguer and arran captain james stewart a free lance and in religion an indifferent  lennox entangled james in relations with the guises and catholic powers gowrie and the protestant nobles being threatened by arran and lennox captured james in an insulting manner at gowrie’s castle of ruthven  he came as a guest for hunting he remained a prisoner  1582  the kirk approved and triumphed james waited and dissembled while gowrie was at the head of the government  in june 1583 james by a sudden flight to st andrews castle where his friends surrounded him shook himself free of gowrie who however secured a pardon for his share in james’s capture in the ‘raid of ruthven’ of 1582  lennox being dead the masterful and unscrupulous arran now again ruled the king and a new lennox came from france the duke of lennox who was present at the tragedy of august 5 1600  the lords who had lost power by james’s escape to st andrews now conspired anew  angus mar and others were to march on stirling gowrie was waiting at dundee april 1584  arran knew of the plot and sent colonel stewart to arrest gowrie  after holding his house against stewart’s men the earl was taken and carried to edinburgh  the other lords his allies failed and fled  gowrie was brought to trial  he had a pardon for the raid of ruthven he had done nothing ostensible in the recent rising which followed his capture at dundee  nevertheless he was tried condemned executed and forfeited  there exists a manuscript of the date which at least shows what gowrie’s friends thought of the method by which his conviction was procured  arran and sir robert melville it is said visited him in prison and advised him to make his peace with james  how was that to be done  gowrie entreated for the kind offices of melville and arran  they advised him to write to the king confessing that he had been in several conspiracies against his person which he could reveal in a private interview  ‘i should confess an untruth’ said gowrie ‘and frame my own indictment’  the letter the others urged being general would move the king’s curiosity he would grant an interview at which gowrie might say that the letter was only an expedient to procure a chance of stating his own case  gowrie naturally rejected so perilous a practice  ‘you must confess the foreknowledge of these things’ said arran ‘or you must die’  gowrie replied that if assured of his life he would take the advice arran gave his word of honour that gowrie should be safe  he wrote the letter he received no answer but was sent to stirling  he was tried nothing was proved against him and arran produced his letter before the court  gowrie was called confessed to his handwriting and told the tale of arran’s treachery which he repeated to the people from the scaffold  this is briefly the statement of a newsletter to england written as usual against the government and in the protestant interest 121a  a manuscript in the british museum gives a somewhat different version 121b  one charge against gowrie we learn was that of treasonable intercommuning with hume of godscroft an envoy of the earl of angus who before gowrie’s arrest was arranging a conspiracy  this charge was perfectly true  godscroft in his history of the douglases ii 317–318 describes the circumstances and mentions the very gallery whose door resisted lennox and mar on august 5 1600  godscroft rode from the earl of angus to gowrie in his house at perth  ‘looking very pitifully upon his gallery where we were walking at that time which he had but newly built and decored with pictures he brake out into these words having first fetched a deep sigh  “cousin” says he “is there no remedy  et impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit  barbarus has segetes”  whereupon godscroft was persuaded of his sincerity and at his return persuaded the earl of angus thereof also’  so the plot went on gowrie pretending that he meant to leave the country says his accomplice godscroft while both the court and the conspirators were uncertain as to his trimming intentions  he trimmed too long he was taken the plot exploded and failed  gowrie was thus within the danger of the law for treasonably concealing foreknowledge of the conspiracy  according to the british museum ms gowrie now told the jury that he was being accused on the strength of his own letter treacherously extorted under promise of life by montrose doune maitland melville colonel stewart and the captain of dumbarton not by arran  in gowrie’s letter of confession to the king as printed by spottiswoode he does not mention godscroft but another intriguer erskine  however in this letter he certainly confesses his concern with the conspiracy  but says the ms the nobles charged by gowrie with having betrayed him under promise of life denied the accusations on oath  gowrie himself according to another copy of the ms denied knowing hume of godscroft if he did he spoke untruly teste godscroft  however matters really stood the earl’s friends at all events believed that he had been most cruelly and shamefully betrayed to the death and as the king was now eighteen they would not hold him guiltless  these were not the only wrongs of the ruthvens  while the power of arran lasted and it was on the whole welcome to james though he had moments of revolt the family of ruthven was persecuted  the widow of gowrie was a daughter see appendix a of henry stewart lord methven who as a young man had married margaret sister of henry viii widow of james iv and divorced from the earl of angus  as this lady our gowrie’s mother knelt to implore the pity of james in the street after her lord’s death arran pushed her aside and threw her down  he received the earl’s forfeited estate and castle of dirleton near north berwick  in october 1585 arran fell in his turn angus mar and others drove him into retirement  james acquiesced his relations with the house of mar remained most friendly  the house of ruthven was now restored to its lands and dignities in 1586 the new earl being james who died in early youth  he was succeeded by his brother the gowrie of our tragedy who was born about 1577  he had many sisters the eldest mary married the earl of atholl a stewart in january 1580  lady gowrie was thus motherinlaw of the earl of atholl who died at gowrie house in august 1594  her granddaughter dorothea daughter of atholl and mary ruthven sister of our gowrie in 1604 married that young tullibardine who was in perth at the tragedy of august 5 1600  lady atholl is said to have opposed the marriage  another sister of gowrie sophia married before 1600 she was dead by that time the duke of lennox who was at the slaughter of the ruthvens  another sister beatrix was maid of honour to james’s queen and later married hume of cowdenknowes hence come the earls of home  gowrie had two younger brothers patrick and william who fled to england from his castle of dirleton the day after the tragedy and were forfeited and persecuted by james patrick was long imprisoned in the tower  the new earl john the victim of 1600 does not come into public notice till 1592 when he was elected provost of perth  he went to edinburgh university his governor was the respected mr rollock  here a curious fact occurs  on august 12 1593 young gowrie read his thesis for his master’s degree  three weeks earlier on july 24 the wild francis stewart earl of bothwell had captured in holyrood his king who was half dressed and untrussed  james at the time was suspected of favouring the catholic earls of the north huntly errol and a new unpresbyterian angus  the king was on ill terms with the kirk england had secretly abetted bothwell the clan of stewart including lennox lent aid and countenance but bothwell’s success was due to gowrie’s mother the widow of the decapitated earl and to his sister lady atholl  bothwell entered lady gowrie’s house adjoining the palace spent the night there stole into holyrood by a passageway left open by lady atholl and appeared before the king sword in hand when his majesty was half dressed  meanwhile our gowrie reading for his thesis may not have been uninterested in the plot of his mother and sister  this was in a way the second successful ruthven plot to seize the king the first was the raid of ruthven  the new success was not enduring  james shook off bothwell in september 1593 and in october gowrie’s brotherinlaw atholl with our gowrie himself entered into alliance with bothwell against king james and offered their services to queen elizabeth  james moved out against atholl gowrie and the master of montrose who were at castle doune intending to join hands with bothwell and seize the king  but bothwell found the plan impracticable atholl fled gowrie and the master of montrose were pursued and taken  no harm was done to them their excuses were accepted but young gowrie and atholl continued to conspire  in april 1594 atholl signing for himself and gowrie and bothwell signing for his associates wrote a manifesto to the kirk they were in arms they said for protestant purposes and wished commissioners from among the preachers to attend them and watch their proceedings 126  bothwell then took action he made a demonstration in arms against edinburgh but the forces of atholl and gowrie did not arrive and bothwell retreated  atholl was threatened for this affair but pardoned by the king and died in august  in the same month gowrie informed the town council of perth that he was going to study abroad  they retained him in the position of provost  he went with his tutor mr rhynd to padua an university where protestantism was protected by the toleration of the republic of venice and where there was an angloscottish ‘nation’ among the students  in ‘the return from parnassus’ a satirical play of 1601 we find gullio the admirer of shakespeare professing to have studied at padua  gowrie is said to have been elected rector but i cannot find his name in the lists  he does appear in the roll of scottish scholars some of them characterised unlike the english scholars by personal marks  most have scars on the face or hand archibald douglas has a scar on the brow from left to right  james lindsay of gowrie’s year 1596–1597 has also a scar on his brow  next him is andrew keith with a scar on his right hand and then dominus ioannes ruthuen scotus cum signo albo in mento ‘with a white mark on his chin’  then we have his luckless tutor mr rhynd who was tortured scotus cum ledigine super facie robert ker of newbattle ‘kerrus de heubattel’ is another of gowrie’s college companions  all were students of law  magic was not compulsory at padua though gowrie was said to have studied that art 127a  concerning gowrie’s behaviour at padua but a single circumstance is known  probably through one of his fellowstudents douglas ker keith lindsay or another the report reached scotland that the young earl had left in padua ‘a strange relique’ an emblematic figure emblazoned and had made on the subject a singular remark  the emblematic figure represented ‘a blackamoor reaching at a crown with a sword in a stretched posture’ the remark of gowrie ‘the earl’s own mot’ was to the effect that the emblem displayed in umbra or foreshadowed what was to be done in facto  this emblem was secured at padua in 1609 by sir robert douglas who had heard of it in scotland and it was sent to king james 127b  if such ideas were in gowrie’s mind he showed no signs of them in an early correspondence with the king  in 1595 james wrote ‘a most loving letter’ to gowrie the earl replied in a tone of gratitude  at the same time gowrie wrote to a preacher in perth extolling the conduct of an english fanatic who had thrown down and trampled on the host at rome  he hoped he said when he returned to scotland ‘to amend whatever is amiss for lack of my presence’ 128a nevertheless on december 25 1598 nicholson informed cecil that gowrie had been converted to catholicism 128b  in the venice despatches and vatican transcripts i find no corroboration  gowrie appears to have visited rome the ruthven apologist declares that he was there ‘in danger for his religion’  galloway on august 11 1600 in presence of the king and the people of edinburgh vowed that gowrie since his return from italy had laboured to make james ‘revolt from religion at least in inward sincerity to entertain purpose with the pope and he himself promised to furnish intelligence’  if so gowrie was indeed ‘a deep dissimulate hypocrite’  galloway’s informant must have been the king  if gowrie did or said anything to colour the story it may have been for the purpose of discovering by pretending to approve of them these intrigues with rome of which james was constantly being accused  a new complexity is added here by a list of scottish catholic nobles ready to join an invading spanish force which the earl of bothwell handed in to philip iii of spain at a date not absolutely certain  at a time conjectured at by major hume as 1600 bothwell laid before the spanish ministry a scheme for an invasion of scotland  he made another more elaborate proposal at a date which to all seeming was july 1601 in the appended list of scottish catholic nobles appear the names of the earl of gowrie and of ‘baron rastellerse’ that is logan of restalrig but in 1601 there was no earl of gowrie the title was extinct the lands were forfeited and gowrie’s natural heir william ruthven his brother was a poor student at cambridge  could bothwell refer to him who was no catholic  can he have handed in in 1601 an earlier list of 1600 without deleting the name of the dead gowrie  as to gowrie’s real creed bothwell must have known the truth through home a reluctant convert to presbyterianism who went from paris to brussels to meet bothwell leaving gowrie in paris just before home and gowrie openly and as it was said bothwell secretly returned to scotland in april 1600  was the gowrie conspiracy a bothwellian plot 129a  we know little more about gowrie after his letters of 1595 till on august 18 1599 colville reports to cecil that the party of the kirk who were now without a leader among the greater nobles intend to summon home the earl 129b  he is said to have stayed for three months at geneva with beza the famous reformer who was devoted to him  he was in paris in february and march 1600  the english ambassador neville recommended gowrie to cecil as ‘a man of whom there may be exceeding good use made’  elizabeth and cecil were then on the worst terms with james  at paris gowrie would meet lord home who as we have said and shall prove in a later connection had an interview with the exiled bothwell still wandering plotting and threatening descents on scotland p 206  on april 3 gowrie was in london 130a  he was very well received ‘a cabinet of plate’ it is said was given to him by elizabeth what else passed we do not know  in may gowrie returned to scotland and rode into edinburgh among a cavalcade of his friends  according to sir john carey writing to cecil from berwick on may 29 james displayed jealousy of gowrie ‘giving him many jests and pretty taunts’ on his reception by elizabeth and ‘marvelling that the ministers met him not’ 130b calderwood adds a rumour that james talking of gowrie’s entry to edinburgh said ‘there were more with his father when he went to the scaffold’  again as the earl leaned on the king’s chair at breakfast james talked of dogs and hawks and made an allusion to the death of riccio in which gowrie’s father and grandfather took part  these are rumours it is certain that the king june 20 gave gowrie a year’s respite from pursuit of his creditors to whom he was in debt for moneys owed to him by the crown expenditure by the late earl of gowrie when in power 1583 131a  it is also certain that gowrie opposed the king’s demands for money in a convention of june 21 131b  but so did lord president fyvie who never ceased to be james’s trusted minister and later chancellor under the title of earl of dunfermline calderwood reports that after gowrie’s speech sir david murray said ‘yonder is an unhappy man they are but seeking occasion of his death which now he has given’  this is absurd fyvie and the laird of easter wemyss opposed the king as stoutly and no harm followed to them fyvie rising steadily and he had opposed the king yet more sturdily before to the highest official position  calderwood adds a silly tale of dr herries  beatrix ruthven laughed at his lame leg he looked in her palm and predicted a great disaster  the same anecdote with of course another subject is told of gowrie’s own prediction that a certain man would come to be hanged which was fulfilled  gowrie had been at perth before the convention at holyrood of june 21  to perth he returned thence some time in july about the 20th 131c he went to his castle of strabran in atholl to hunt whether his brother the master remained with him continuously till the earl’s return to perth on saturday august 2 i know not how to ascertain  if there is anything genuine in the plotletters produced eight years later the master once or twice visited edinburgh in july but that may have been before going to strabran  concerning the master a romantic story of unknown source but certainly never alluded to in the surviving gossip of the day was published late in the eighteenth century by lord hailes  ‘a report is handed down that lord gowrie’s brother received from the queen a ribbon which she had got from the king that mr alexander went into the king’s garden at falkland on a sultry hot day and lay down in a shade and fell asleep his breast being open the king passed that way and discovered part of the ribbon about his neck below his cravat upon which he made quick haste into the palace which was observed by one of the queen’s ladies who passed the same way  she instantly took the ribbon from his neck went a near way to the queen’s closet where she found her majesty at her toilet whom she requested to lay the ribbon in a drawer’  james entered and asked to be shown the ribbon  the queen produced it and james retired muttering ‘devil tak’ me but like is an ill mark’  legend does not say when or in what year this occurred  but the fancy of authors has identified the queen’s lady with beatrix ruthven and has added that the master in disgrace though undetected retired with gowrie to strabane or strabran  history has no concern with such fables  it is certain however or at least contemporary letters aver that queen anne of denmark was grieved and angered by the slaying of the gowries  on october 21 1600 carey writing to cecil from woodrington mentions this and the tattle to the effect that as the queen is about to have a child charles i ‘she shall be kept as prisoner ever after’ was the master supposed to be father of the queen’s child  carey goes on ‘there is a letter found with a bracelet in it sent from the queen to the earl of gowrie to persuade him to leave his country life and come to court assuring him that he should enjoy any contents that court could afford’ 133  can some amorous promise underlie this as in the case of mr pickwick’s letter to mrs bardell about the warmingpan  ‘this letter the king hath’ says carey  was it with gowrie not the master that the queen was in love  she was very fond of beatrix ruthven and would disbelieve in the guilt of her brothers hence these tears and that anger of the queen  but james also says calderwood was as anxious as carey declares that the queen was to bring gowrie to falkland  ‘when the earl was in strabran fifteen days before the fact the king wrote sundry letters to the earl desiring him to come and hunt with him in the wood of falkland which letters were found in my lord’s pocket at his death as is reported but were destroyed’ 134a  so james was not jealous both he and the queen were inviting gowrie to their country house the queen adding the gift of a bracelet  she may have worked it herself like the bracelet which queen mary is said to have sent to bothwell  all this is the idlest gossip  but it is certain that on one occasion at the end of july ‘close letters’ were sent from the court at edinburgh to atholl and gowrie and later to inchaffray and the master the first three are in bothwell’s list of catholics ready to meet the spanish invaders  the fact of the letters appears from the treasurer’s accounts where the money paid to the boy who carried the letters is recorded without dates of the days of the month  the boy got 33 shillings scots for the journey from edinburgh to the earls of gowrie and atholl 24 for the other two which he carried from falkland  craigengelt in his deposition ‘denies that during my lord’s being in strabran neither yet in perth after his coming from strabran he knew any man or page to come from court to my lord or that he commanded to give them any meat or drink’ 134b  no conclusion as to james’s guilt can be drawn either from the fact that he wrote to atholl inchaffray the master and gowrie at the end of july or from the circumstance that craigengelt professed to know nothing about any messenger  james might write to ask the earl to hunt we cannot guess what he had to say at the same time to atholl or inchaffray or the master  he may even have written about the affair of the abbey of scone if it is true that the master wished to get it from his brother  we really cannot infer that as the ruthvens would not come and be killed when invited at falkland james went to kill them at perth  even if he summoned the master for august 5 intending to make it appear that the master had asked him to come to perth the master need not have arrived before seven in the morning when the king went and hunted for four hours  what conceivable reason had the master if innocent for leaving perth at 4 am and visiting his sovereign at seven in the morning  as to the coming of the gowries to perth from strabran or strabane before the tragedy we only know what craigengelt stated  his language is not lucid  ‘depones that my lords being in strabrand alexander ruthven’ a kinsman ‘came from dunkeld to my lord  and that upon friday august 1 my lord commanded captain ruthven to ride and tell my lady’ gowrie’s mother ‘that he was to come and captain ruthven met my lord at the ferryboat and rode back to dunkeld with my lord where he’ gowrie ‘having supped returned to his bed at trochene the deponer being in his company’  where at the end of july was lady gowrie  was she within a day’s ride of her sons  was she at perth  we know that she was at dirleton castle near north berwick on august 6  had she left the neighbourhood of perth between the 1st and 5th of august  captain ruthven seems to have ridden to lady gowrie and back again to dunkeld with gowrie  if so and i can make no other sense of it she was in perthshire on august 1 and went at once to dirleton  did she keep out of the way of the performances of august 5  it is curious that no apologist for gowrie as far as i have observed makes any remark on this perplexing affair of ‘my lady’  we know that she had once already set a successful trap for the king  he had not punished her he took two of her daughters barbara and beatrix into his household and restored to gowrie his inheritance of the lands of scone which as we know had been held by his father  he had written a loving letter to gowrie at padua after the young man had for many months been conspiring against him with his most dangerous enemy the wild earl of bothwell  on the morning of the fatal august 5 gowrie went to sermon  what else he did we learn from john moncrieff who was the earl’s cautioner or guarantee for a large sum due by him to one robert jolly 137  he was also brother of hew moncrieff who fled after having been with gowrie in arms against herries ramsay and erskine  both moncrieffs says john were puzzled when they found that the master had ridden from perth so early in the morning  gowrie says moncrieff did not attend the town council meeting after church he excused himself on account of private affairs  he also sent away george hay who was with him on business when henderson arrived from falkland saying that he had other engagements for the same reason he at first declined to do a piece of business with moncrieff who dined with him and two other gentlemen  ‘he made him to misknow all things’ that is affected to take no notice when andrew ruthven came in and ‘rounded to him’ whispered to him about the king’s approach  then the master entered and gowrie went out to meet the king  the rest we know as far as evidence exists                       picture queen anne of denmark  we now have all the essential facts which rest on fairly good evidence and we ask did the ruthvens lay a plot for the king or did the king weave a web to catch the ruthvens  looking first at character and probable motives we dismiss the gossip about the amorous queen and the jealous king  the tatlers did not know whether to select gowrie or the master as the object of the queen’s passion or whether to allege that she had a polyandrous affection for both at once  the letters of the age hint at no such amour till after the tragedy when tales of the liaison of anne of denmark with the elder or younger ruthven or both arose as a myth to account for the events  the queen no doubt was deeply grieved in a womanly way for the sake of her two maidens beatrix and barbara ruthven  her majesty also in a womanly way had a running feud with mar and the whole house of erskine  to mar certainly one of the few men of honour as well as of rank in scotland james had entrusted his son prince henry the care of the heir to the crown was a kind of hereditary charge of the erskines  the queen had already in her resentment at not having the custody of her son engaged in one dangerous plot against mar she made another quarrel on this point at the time 1603 when the king succeeded to the crown of england  now mar was present at the gowrie tragedy and his cousin sir thomas erskine took part in the deeds hating the erskines devoted to the ruthven ladies and always feebly in opposition to her husband the queen no doubt paraded her grief her scepticism and her resentment  this was quite in keeping with her character and this conduct lent colour to the myth that she loved gowrie or the master or both par amours  the subject is good for a ballad or a novel but history has nothing to make with the legend on which mr g p r james based a romance and mr pinkerton a theory  leaving fable for fact what motives had james for killing both the ruthvens  he had dropped the hereditary feud and had taken no measures against the young earl to punish his conspiracies with bothwell in 1593–1594  of gowrie on his return to scotland in may he may have entertained some jealousy  the earl had been for months in paris caressed by the english ambassador and probably as we have seen in touch with the exiled and ceaselessly conspiring bothwell  in london the earl had been well received by elizabeth and by lord willoughby who a year earlier as governor of berwick had insulted james by kidnapping close to edinburgh an english gentleman ashfield on a visit to the king’s court  guevara a cousin of lord willoughby lured ashfield into the coach of the english envoy bowes and drove him to the frontier lord willoughby had a swift yacht lying off leith in case it was thought better to abduct ashfield by sea  this is an example of english insolence to the scottish king—also of english kidnapping—and lord willoughby the manager had made friends with gowrie in england  thus james who was then on the worst terms short of open war with england may have suspected and disliked the earl who had once already put himself at the service of elizabeth and might do so again  in the april of 1600 rumours of a conspiracy by archibald douglas the infamous traitor douglas of spot one of morton’s brood and john colville—who with bothwell and later independently had caught james had tried to catch him and proposed to essex to catch him again—were afloat colville was in paris at the same time as gowrie bothwell was reported to have come secretly to scotland in april or may and this combination of facts or rumours may have aroused the king’s mistrust  again the kirk was restive the preachers in need of a leader were said by colville to have summoned gowrie home 140a  moreover there were persons about james—for example colonel stewart—who had reason to dread the earl’s vengeance for his father  the ruthven apologist mentions this fact and the predilection of the kirk for gowrie among the motives for destroying him  once more there are hints very vague that in 1593 bothwell aimed at changing the dynasty 140b  the fable that gowrie was a maternal grandson of margaret tudor widow of james iv by henry stewart lord methven her third husband and that gowrie was thus a candidate for the succession to the english throne perhaps also for the hand of arabella stuart may conceivably have existed  compare appendix a  again gowrie had sided with the burgesses and minor barons as against the nobles by refusing a grant of money to james in the convention of june 1600 and james owed money to gowrie as he did to most people  but we have already seen that an exemption had been granted to gowrie for a year from pursuit of creditors as far that is as regarded his father’s debts 80000l scots june 20 1600  the college of justice refused to grant any new legal summonses of creditors against gowrie and suspended all that were extant  mr barbé accuses the king of ‘utter and unblushing disregard for common truth and common honesty’  be this as it may the exemption granted to gowrie was not regarded by his father’s creditors as extending to his mother after his dishonoured death  on november 1 1600 lady gowrie implored elphinstone the secretary to bring her suit for relief before the king  the security for these debts was on her ‘conjunct fee lands’ and creditors because i suppose the gowrie estates were about to be forfeited pressed lady gowrie who of course had no exemption  we know nothing as to the success of lady gowrie’s petition but we have seen that her daughters married very well  i presume that gowrie not his mother had previously paid interest on the debts ‘he had already paid many sums of money’  james had already restored to gowrie the valuable lands of scone 142  however taking things as the king’s adversaries regard them the cumulative effect of these several grudges and of the mystery of gowrie’s catholicism would urge james to lay his very subtle plot  he would secretly call young ruthven to falkland by six in the morning of august 5 he would make it appear that ruthven had invited him to perth he would lure the youth to a turret managing to be locked in with him and an armed man he would post ramsay below the turret window and warn him to run up the dark staircase at the king’s cry of treason  by the locked door he would exclude lennox and mar while his minions would first delay gowrie’s approach by the narrow stairs and then permit him to enter with only one companion cranstoun  he would cause a report of his own departure to be circulated exactly at the right moment to bring gowrie under the turret window and within reach of his cries  this plot requires the minutest punctuality everything must occur at the right moment and all would have been defeated had gowrie told the truth about the king’s departure or even asked ‘where is the king’s horse’  or gowrie might have stood in the streets of perth and summoned his burgesses in arms  the king and the courtiers with their dead man would have been beleaguered without provisions in gowrie’s house  was james the man on the strength of the grudges which we have carefully enumerated to risk himself unarmed in this situation  as to how he managed to have the door locked so as to exclude the majority of his suite who can conjecture  how again did he induce gowrie to aver and that after making inquiry that he had ridden homewards  i cannot believe that any sane man or monarch from the motives specified would or could have laid and that successfully the plot attributed to the king  turning to gowrie we find that his grudges against james may have been deep and many  if revengeful he had the treacherous method of his father’s conviction and the insults to his mother to punish  for a boy of seventeen he had already attempted a good deal in 1593–1594  his mother had set him an example of kingcatching and it looks as if his mother had been near him in perth while he was at strabane  if ambitious and devoted to elizabeth and england as he had been gowrie had motives for a new raid of ruthven the unceasing desire of the english government  he might if successful head a new administration resting on the support of england and the kirk  such a change was due in the natural course of things  or quite the reverse if a secret catholic he might hand the king over to bothwell  thus gowrie may well have wished to revenge his father his mother had once already helped to betray james to an attack of the most insulting nature he himself was strong for the kirk over which james was playing the despot or he desired toleration for catholics he had been well received in england where all such plots—their name was legion—had always been fostered he was very young and he risked everything  only his method was new—that of strict secrecy  he had previously spoken to mr cowper minister of perth in a general way about the failure of plots for lack of deep secrecy and through the admission of too many confederates  cowper told this to spottiswoode at falkland  mr rhynd gowrie’s tutor told cowper and the comptroller ‘unrequired’ not under torture nor in answer to a question under examination that gowrie when abroad several times said that ‘he was not a wise man that having the execution of a high and dangerous purpose communicated the same to any but himself’  as to this secrecy we must remember that gowrie was very young that in italy he may have heard or read of romantic and crafty plots and may long have dreamed as robert oliphant’s reported allegation declared of some such scheme as that in which he failed  we must remember too that james’s own account at least suggests a plan quite feasible  to bring james to gowrie house early in the day when the townsmen were at kirk to bring him with only three or four attendants then to isolate him and carry him off was far from impossible they might hurry him disguised to dirleton a castle garrisoned and provisioned according to carey who reports the version of gowrie’s friends  a scottish judge gibson the ancestor of sir thomas gibsoncarmichael was later carried from leith sands across the border with perfect success  a fault of the plan was that once undertaken it could not be dropped even though james came late and well attended  ruthven could not tell the king that his story about a captive and a pot of gold was false  to do that would have subjected him to a charge of treason  he could have only one motive for thus deceiving his majesty  thus the plot had to go on even under circumstances very unfavourable  there was no place for repentance  thus considered the conspiracy looks like the plot of a romance not without meritorious points but painfully amateurish  as proof of gowrie’s guilt the evidence i think distinctly proves that he intentionally concealed from those about him the ride of his brother henderson and andrew ruthven to perth that he concealed his knowledge derived from henderson of the king’s approach and that ruthven concealed from craigengelt on his return his long ride to falkland saying that he had been on ‘an errand not far off’  moncrieff swore that henderson gave him a similar answer  asked by moncrieff where he had been he said ‘he had been two or three miles above the town’  henderson corroborated moncrieff’s evidence on this point  there can have been no innocent motive for all this secrecy  it would have been natural for gowrie to order luncheon for the king to be prepared as soon as henderson arrived  finally the earl’s assertions that james had ridden away assertions repeated after he had gone upstairs to inquire and make sure are absolutely incompatible with innocence  they could have only one motive to induce the courtiers to ride off and leave the king in his hands  what was to happen next  who can guess at the plot of such a plotter it is perhaps least improbable that the king was to be conveyed secretly by sea or across fife to dirleton in the first place  gowrie may have had an understanding with guevara at berwick  james himself told nicholson that a large english ship had hovered off the coast refusing communication with the shore  bothwell again now desperate may have lately been nearer home than was known finally fastcastle the isolated eyrie on its perpendicular rock above the northern sea may have been at gowrie’s disposal  i am disinclined to conjecture being only certain that a young man with gowrie’s past—‘italianate’ and of dubious religion—was more apt to form a wild and daring plot than was his canny senior the king of scots  but that a plot of some kind gowrie had laid i am convinced by his secrecy and by his falsehoods as to the king’s departure  among the traps for the king contrived by bothwell and colville and reported by colville to his english paymasters were schemes quite as wild as that which gowrie probably entertained  the king once in the pious hands of so godly a man as gowrie the party of the kirk or the party of the church would have come in and made themselves useful 147     xii  logan of restalrig   we now arrive at an extraordinary sequel of the gowrie mystery a sequel in which some critics have seen final and documentary proof of the guilt of the ruthvens  others have remarked only a squalid intrigue whereby james’s ministers threw additional disgrace on their master  that they succeeded in disgracing themselves we shall make only too apparent but if the evidence which they handled proves nothing against the ruthvens it does not on that account invalidate the inferences which we have drawn as to their conspiracy  we come to the story of the laird and the country writer  that we may know the laird better a brief description of his home may be introduced  within a mile and a half of the east end of princes street edinburgh lies on the left of the railway to the south a squalid suburb  you drive or walk on a dirty road northeastwards through unambitious shops factories tall chimneys flaming advertisements and houses for artisans  the road climbs a hill and you begin to find on each side of you walls of ancient construction and traces of great old doorways now condemned  on the left are ploughed fields and even clumps of trees with blackened trunks  grimy are the stacks of corn in the farmyard to the left at the crest of the hill  on the right a gateway gives on a short avenue which leads to a substantial modern house  having reached this point in my pilgrimage i met a gentleman who occupies the house and asked if i might be permitted to view the site the other with much courtesy took me up to the house of which only the portion in view from the road was modern  facing the west all was of the old scottish château style with gables narrow windows and a strange bulky chimney on the north bulging out of the wall  the west side of the house stood on the very brink of a steep precipice beneath which lay what is now but a large deep waterhole but at the period of the gowrie conspiracy was a loch fringed with water weeds and a haunt of wild fowl  by this loch restalrig loch the witch more than three centuries ago met the ghost of tam reid who fell in pinkie fight and by the ghost was initiated into the magic which brought her to the stake  i scrambled over a low wall with a deep drop and descended the cliff so as to get a view of the ancient château that faces the setting sun beyond the loch was a muddy field then rows on rows of ugly advertisements then lines of ‘smoky dwarf houses’ and above these clear against a sky of march was the leonine profile of arthur’s seat steam rose and trailed from the shrieking southward trains between the loch and the mountain old and new were oddly met for the château was the home of an ancient race the logans of restalrig ancestors of that last laird with whom our story has to do  their rich lands stretched far and wide their huge dovecot stands sturdy as a little pyramid in a field to the north towards the firth  they had privileges over leith harbour which must have been very valuable they were of royal descent through a marriage of a logan with a daughter of robert ii  but their glory was in their ancestor sir robert logan who fell where the good lord james of douglas died charging the saracens on a field of spain and following the heart of bruce  so barbour sings and to be named by barbour for a deed and a death so chivalrous is honour enough                          picture restalrig house                         picture restalrig village  the logans flourished in their eyrie above the loch of restalrig and intermarried with the best houses sinclairs ogilvys homes and ramsays of dalhousie  it may be that some of them sleep under the muddy floor of st triduana’s chapel in the village of restalrig at the foot of the hill on the eastern side of their old château  this village surrounded by factories is apparently just what it used to be in the days of james vi  the low thickwalled houses with forestairs retain their ancient highpitched redtiled roofs with dormer windows and turn their tall narrow gables to the irregular street  ‘a mile frae embro town’ you find yourself going back three hundred years in time  on the right hand of the road walking eastward what looks like a huge green mound is visible above a high ancient wall  this is all that is left of st triduana’s chapel and she was a saint who came from achaia with st regulus the mythical founder of st andrews  she died at restalrig on october 8 510 and may have converted the celts who then dwelt in a crannog in the loch at all events we hear that in a very dry summer the timbers of a crannog were found in the sandy deposit of the lake margin  the chapel or chapterhouse very dirty and disgracefully neglected has probably a crypt under it and certainly possesses a beautiful groined roof springing from a single short pillar in the centre  the windows are blocked up with stones the exterior is a mere mound of grass like a sepulchral tumulus  on the floor lies broken the gravestone of a lady restalrig who died in 1526  outside is a patchedup church the general assembly of 1560 decreed that the church should be destroyed as ‘a monument of idolatry’ it was a collegiate church with a dean and prebendaries and in 1571 the wrought stones were used to build a new gate inside the netherbow port  the whole edifice was not destroyed but was patched up in 1836 into a presbyterian place of worship  this old village and kirk made up ‘restalrig town’ a place occupied by the english during the siege of leith in 1560  so much of history may be found in this odd corner where the sexton of the kirk speaks to the visitor about ‘the great logan’ meaning that laird who now comes into the sequel of the gowrie mystery  for some thirty years before the date of which we are speaking a robert logan had been laird of restalrig and of the estate of flemington in berwickshire where his residence was the house of gunnisgreen near eyemouth on the berwickshire coast  he must have been a young boy when in 1560 the english forces besieging leith then held by the french for mary of guise pitched their camp at restalrig  in 1573 kirkcaldy of grange and maitland of lethington gallantly held the last strength of the captive mary stuart the castle of edinburgh the fortress was to fall under the guns of the english allies of that earl of gowrie then lord ruthven who was the father of the gowrie of our mystery  on april 17 1573 a compact was made between lord ruthven and drury the english general  one provision was the rest do not here concern us that alexander lord home lethington and robert logan of restalrig if captured ‘shall be reserved to be justified by the laws of scotland’ which means hanged by the neck  but neither on that nor on any other occasion was our logan hanged 152  he somehow escaped death and forfeiture when kirkcaldy was gibbeted after the fall of the castle  in 1577 we find him with lord lindsay and mowbray of barnbogle now dalmeny surety for queen mary’s halfbrother the lord robert stewart who vainly warned darnley to escape from kirk o’ field  lord robert was then confined by the regent morton in linlithgow and logan with the rest was surety in 10000l that he would not attempt to escape  later logan was again surety that lord robert would return after visiting his dominions the orkney islands 153  logan though something of a pirate was clearly a man of substance and of a good house which he strengthened by alliances  one of his wives elizabeth macgill was the daughter of the laird of cranstoun riddell and one of her family was a member of the privy council  from elizabeth logan was divorced she was apparently the mother of his eldest son robert  by the marriage of an ancestor of logan’s with an heiress of the family of hume he acquired the fortress and lands of fastcastle near st abbs on the berwickshire coast  the castle now in ruins is the model of wolfscrag in ‘the bride of lammermoor’  standing on the actual verge of a perpendicular cliff above the sea whence it is said to have been approached by a staircase cut in the living rock it was all but inaccessible and was strongly fortified  though commanded by the still higher cliff to the south under which it nestled on its narrow plateau of rock fastcastle was then practically impregnable and twenty men could have held it against all scotland  around it was and is a roadless waste of bent and dune from which it was severed by a narrow rib of rock jutting seawards the ridge being cut by a cavity which was spanned by a drawbridge  master of this inaccessible eyrie logan was most serviceable to the plotters of these troubled times  his religion was doubtful his phraseology could glide into presbyterian cant but we know that he indifferently lent the shelter of his fastness to the protestant firebrand wild frank stewart earl of bothwell who like carey writing from berwick to cecil reckons logan among catholics or to george ker the catholic intriguer with spain  logan loved a plot for its own sake as well as for chances of booty and promotion  he was a hard drinker and associate of rough yeomen and lairds like ninian chirnside of whitsumlaws bothwell’s emissary to the wizard richard graham yet a man of ancient family and high connections  he seems to have been intimate with the family of sir john cranstoun of cranstoun on one occasion he informs archibald douglas the detested and infamous murderer and deeply dyed traitor that ‘john of cranstoun is the one man now that bears you best good will’  january 1587                      picture fastcastle circ 1820  in january 1600 the year of the gowrie plot we find sir john cranstoun in trouble for harbouring an outlawed mr thomas cranstoun who was with douglas the laird of spot one of bothwell’s allies in all his most desperate raids on the person of king james  in 1592 mr thomas cranstoun was forfeited he was informed against for ‘new conspiracies against his majesty’s life and estate’ and in january 1600 sir john cranstoun was sheltering this dangerous and desperate bothwellian outlaw as was his sonin law mr william cranstoun 155a  now the mr thomas cranstoun who was hanged for his part in the gowrie affair was brother of sir john cranstoun of cranstoun the ally of that other mr thomas cranstoun who was so deep in bothwell’s wild raids on the king’s person  in the spring of 1600 as we have said but must here repeat there were reports that bothwell had secretly returned to scotland and on april 20 1600 just before the date of gowrie’s arrival in edinburgh from london nicholson reports suspected plots of archibald douglas of john colville a ruined bothwellian and a spy and of the laird of spot 155b  this colville had recently hinted to essex that he could do a serviceable enterprise  ‘as for the service i mean to do if matters go to the worst it shall be such god willing—if i lose not my life in doing thereof—as no other can do with a million of gold and yet i shall not exceed the bonds of humanity’ that is he will not murder the king  ‘but for conscience sake and worldly honesty i must first be absolved of my natural allegiance’  april 27 1598 again october 20 1598 156  the point for us to mark is that all these conspirators and violent men bothwell in exile or secretly in scotland colville in 1600 an exile in paris the laird of spot the cranstouns the infamous archibald douglas with richard douglas his nephew and logan of restalrig were united if not by real friendship at least as thucydides says by ‘partnership in desperate enterprises’ and by 1600 were active in a subterranean way  if it is fair to say noscitur a sociis ‘a man is known by the company he keeps’ logan of restalrig bears the mark of the secret conspirator  he had relations with persons more distinguished than his chirnsides and whittingham douglases though they were of near kin to the earl of morton  his mother a daughter of lord gray married lord home after the death of logan’s father  the laird of restalrig was thus a halfbrother of the new lord home a warden of the border and also was first cousin of the beautiful accomplished and infamous master of gray the double spy of england and of rome  logan too like the master had diplomatic ambitions  in 1586 july 29 we find him corresponding with the infamous archibald douglas one of darnley’s murderers whom james had sent in the crisis of his mother’s fate as his ambassador to elizabeth  in 1586 logan with two other logans was on the packed jury which acquitted douglas of darnley’s murder  logan was a retainer of bothwell that meteorlike adventurer and kingcatcher and he asks douglas to try to procure him employment of course as a spy from walsingham the english statesman 157  in october of the same year we find the master of gray writing to douglas thus ‘of late i was forced at restalrig’s suit to pawn some of my plate and the best jewel i had to get him money for his marriage’—his second marriage apparently  by december 1586 we find logan riding to london as part of the suite of the master of gray who was to plead with elizabeth for mary’s life  he was the master’s most intimate confidant and as such in februarymarch 1587 proposed to sell all his secrets to walsingham  nevertheless when gray was driven into exile later in 1587 logan was one of his ‘cautioners’ or sureties  he had been of the party of gowrie’s father during that nobleman’s brief tenure of power in 1582 1583 and when gowrie fell logan was ordered to hand his eyrie of fastcastle over at six hours’ notice to the officers of the king  through the stormy years of bothwell’s repeated raids on james 1592–1594 logan had been his partisan and had been denounced a rebel  later he appears in trouble for highway robbery committed by his retainers  among the diversions of this country gentleman was flat burglary  in december 1593 ‘when nichts are lang and mirk’ the laird helped himself to the platechest of william nesbit of newton  ‘under silence of night he took spuilzie of certain gold and silver to the value of three thousand merks scots’  the executors of nesbit did not bring their action till after logan died in july 1606 ‘in respect the said clandestine deed and fact came not to our knowledge nor light as to who had committed the same’ till just before the action was brought  in 1599 when conspiracies were in the air logan was bound over not to put fastcastle in the hands of his majesty’s enemies and rebels 158  this brief sketch of a turbulent life is derived from logan’s own letters to archibald douglas now among the cecil papers at hatfield from the ‘papers relating to the master of gray’ in which we find logan under a cypher name betraying the master his cousin and ally and from the register of the privy council of scotland in which all that dead world from the king to the crofter may be traced often in circumstances peculiarly private  at that time civil processes of ‘horning’ ‘putting to the horn’ or outlawry were the common resort of creditors against procrastinating debtors  many of the most respectable persons gentlemen and ladies appear in these suits robert abercromby sues a lady of rank for 150l scots  he is the burgess of edinburgh the king’s saddler who as the master of ruthven told craigengelt had brought the king from falkland to perth ‘to take order for his debt’  now the singular thing is that we never find logan of restalrig recorded as under ‘horning’ for debt whereas considering his character we might expect him never to be free from ‘the horn’  on the other hand we know him to have been a lender not a borrower  he was sui profusus  on january 1 1599 cecil had been making inquiries as to logan from lord willoughby commanding at berwick  cecil always had his eyes on border scots likely to be useful in troubling king james  willoughby replies ‘there is sutch a laird of lesterigge as you write of a vain lose man a greate favourer of thefes reputed yet a man of a good clan as they here tearme it and a gud felow’ 159  such was logan of restalrig ‘old rugged and dangerous’  in 1601 may 30 we find him appearing as surety for philip mowbray one of the mowbrays of barnbogle whose sister stood by queen mary at the scaffold and whose brother francis was with the bold buccleuch when he swam ‘that wan water’ of esk and rescued kinmont willie from carlisle castle  this francis mowbray and his brother philip were 1601–1603 mixed up with cecil in some inscrutable spywork and intrigues for the murder of king james  the mowbrays were old friends of logan they had been engaged in privateering enterprises together but could produce no letters of marque  in 1603 francis mowbray abandoned and extradited by cecil was killed in an attempt to escape from edinburgh castle  he had been accused by an italian fencingmaster of a conspiracy to kill james cecil had of course by this time made peace and alliance with james who was on the point of ascending the english throne and he gave up francis  mowbray challenged the italian fencingmaster to judicial combat the italian came down to fight him the lists were actually pitched at holyrood when january 31 1603 francis preferred to try the chance of flight the rope of knotted sheet to which he trusted broke and he was dashed to pieces on the castle rocks 160a  since 1592 mowbray had been corresponding with logan’s friend archibald douglas and offering his services to cecil  to cecil in september 1600 he was again applying regarding elizabeth as his debtor  in 1600 he was in touch with henry locke who had been cecil’s gobetween in his darkest intrigues against james and his agent with bothwell atholl and the gowrie slain on august 5 1600  but in the autumn of 1602 cecil had become the secret ally of james and gave up poor francis a broken tool of his and of elizabeth’s 160b  we have now learned a good deal about logan’s habitual associates and we have merely glanced at a few of the numberless plots against james which were encouraged by the english government  if james was nervously apprehensive of treason he had good cause  but of logan at the moment of the gowrie plot we know nothing from public documents  we do know however on evidence which has previously been in part unpublished in part unobserved that from august 1600 onwards logan was oddly excited and restless  though not in debt—or at least though no record of his ‘horning’ exists—he took to selling his lands restalrig flemington gunnisgreen fastcastle 161  after 1600 he sold them all he wallowed in drink he made his wife wretched with his eldest son he was on ill terms he wandered to london and to france in 1605 and he returned to die of plague it seems in the canongate a landless but a monied man in july 1606  why did logan sell all his lands investing in shipping property  the natural inference at the time was that he had been engaged in ‘some ill turn’ some mysterious conspiracy and people probably certainly if we believe the evidence to follow thought that he had been an accomplice in the gowrie affair  he died and his children by his first wives dissociated themselves from his executorship  the bulk of it was the unpaid part of the purchase money for his lands sold by him to balmerino and dunbar james’s trusted ministers who owed some 33000 marks to the estate  logan had a ‘doer’ or law agent a country writer or notary named sprot who dwelt at eyemouth a hungry creature who did not even own a horse  when logan rode to edinburgh sprot walked thither to join him yet the two were boon companions sprot was always loitering and watching at gunnisgreen always a guest at the great christmas festivals given by the laird to his rough neighbours  the death of logan was a disaster to sprot and to all the parasites of the laird  logan died we saw in july 1606  in april 1608 sprot was arrested by a legal official named watty doig  he had been blabbing in his cups it is said about the gowrie affair certainly most compromising documents apparently in logan’s hand and with his signature were found on sprot’s person  they still bear the worn softened look of papers carried for long in the pockets 162  sprot was examined and confessed that he knew beforehand of the gowrie conspiracy and that the documents in his possession were written by logan to gowrie and other plotters  he was tortured and in part recanted logan he said had not written the guilty letters he himself had forged them  this was all before july 5 1608 while mr robert oliphant lay in prison in london on the same charge of guilty foreknowledge  early in july 1608 the earl of dunbar came from london to edinburgh to deal with the affairs of the kirk  he took sprot out of his dungeon gave him a more wholesome chamber secluded him from gentlemen who came and threatened him or so he said if he made revelations and dunbar provided him with medical attendance the wounds inflicted in ‘the boot’ were healed  for six weeks sprot was frequently examined before members of the privy council and others without torture  what he said the public did not know nor till now have historians been better informed  throughout after july 5 1608 he persisted in declaring logan’s complicity in the gowrie conspiracy and his own foreknowledge  he was tried solely on the evidence of guilty foreknowledge alleged in his own confessions and of extracts given by him from memory only of a letter from gowrie to logan not one of those which he claimed to have forged and another of logan to gowrie both of july 1600  on august 12 sprot was hanged at edinburgh  he repeated his confession of guilt from every corner of the scaffold  he uttered a long religious speech of contrition  once he said he had been nearly drowned but god preserved him for this great day of confession and repentance  but ‘no unbeliever in the guilt of gowrie’ says calderwood ‘was one whit the more convinced’  of course not nor would the death of henderson—which they clamoured for—have convinced them  they said falsely that sprot was really condemned as a forger and having to die took oath to his guilt in the gowrie conspiracy in consideration of promises of help to his wife and family 164  nearly a year later in june 1609 the exhumed remains of logan were brought into court a regular practice in the case of dead traitors and were tried for treason  five letters by logan of july 1600 were now produced  three were from logan to conspirators unnamed and unknown one was to a retainer and messenger of his laird bower who had died in january 1606  these letters were declared by several honourable witnesses to be in logan’s very unusual handwriting and orthography they were compared with many genuine letters of his and no difference was found  the parliamentary committee ‘the lords of the articles’ previously sceptical were convinced by the five letters the evidence to handwriting the energy of the earl of dunbar and the eloquence of the king’s advocate  logan’s children were all forfeited and dunbar saved the money which he owed to logan’s estate  this trial is not alluded to either by calderwood or archbishop spottiswoode in their histories  the five letters produced in the trial of logan exist and have been accepted as authentic by mr tytler and mr hill burton but not by writers who favour the ruthvens  we print all five letters in appendix c  meanwhile what had sprot really said under private examination between july 5 and august 12 1608 when he was executed  this question is to be answered from the hitherto unpublished records in the following chapters  but in common charity the reader must be warned that the exposition is inevitably puzzling and complex  sprot under examination lied often lied variously and perhaps lied to the last  moreover much indeed everything depends here on exact dates and sprot’s are loose as was natural in the circumstances the events of which he spoke being so remote in time  consequently the results of criticism of his confession may here be stated with brevity  the persevering student the reader interested in odd pictures of domestic life and in strange human characters may read on at his own peril  but the actual grains of fact extracted from tons of falsehood may be set down in very few words  the genuine and hitherto unknown confessions of sprot add no absolute certainty as to the existence of a gowrie conspiracy  his words when uncorroborated can have no weight with a jury  he confessed that all the alleged logan papers which up to two days before his death were in possession of the privy council were forgeries by himself  but on august 10 he announced that he had possessed one genuine letter of logan to gowrie dated july 29 1600  that letter our letter iv or a forged copy was then found in his repositories  expert evidence however decides that this document like all the others is in a specious imitation of logan’s hand but that it has other characteristics of sprot’s own hand and was penned by sprot himself  why he kept it back so long why he declared that it alone was genuine we do not know that it is genuine in substance and was copied by sprot from a real letter of logan’s in an imitation of logan’s hand and that if so it proves logan’s accession to the conspiracy is my own private opinion but that opinion is based on mere literary considerations on what is called ‘internal evidence’ and is therefore purely a matter of subjective impression like one’s idea of the possible share of shakespeare in a play mainly by fletcher or another  evidence of this kind is not historical evidence  it follows that the whole affair of sprot and of the alleged logan letters adds nothing certain to the reasons for believing that there was a gowrie conspiracy  as far as sprot and his documents are concerned we know that all as they stand are pure fictitious counterfeits by that unhappy man while as to whether one letter iv and perhaps another i are genuine in substance every reader must form his own opinion on literary grounds and no opinion is of much value  such is a brief summary of the facts but the tenacious inquirer who can follow us through the tangled mazes of sprot’s private confessions will perhaps agree with me that they contain distinguishable grains of fact raising a strong surmise that logan was really involved with gowrie in a plot  yet this again is a subjective impression which may vary with each reader     xiii  the secrets of sprot   the final and deepest mystery of the mysterious gowrie affair rises like a mist from a marsh out of these facts concerning sprot  when he was convicted and hanged persisting in his confessions on august 12 1608 no letters by gowrie or any other conspirator were produced in court extracts however of a letter from gowrie to logan and of one from logan to gowrie were quoted in sprot’s formal indictment  they were also quoted in an official publication an account of sprot’s case prepared by sir william hart the chief justice and issued in 1608 both these documents to which we return are given by mr pitcairn in the second volume of his ‘criminal trials’  but later when the dead logan was tried in 1609 five of his alleged plot letters never publicly mentioned in sprot’s trial were produced by the prosecution and not one of these was identical with the letter of logan cited in the indictment of sprot and in the official account of his trial  there were strong resemblances between logan’s letter quoted but not produced in 1608 and a letter of logan’s produced and attested to be in his handwriting in 1609  but there were also remarkable variations  of these undeniable facts most modern historians who were convinced of the guilt of the ruthvens take no notice though the inexplicable discrepancies between the logan letters quoted in 1608 and the letters produced as his in 1609 had always been matters of comment and criticism  as to the letters of 1609 mr tytler wrote ‘their import cannot be mistaken their authenticity has never been questioned they still exist    ’  now assuredly the letters exist  the five alleged originals were found by mr pitcairn among the warrants of parliament in the general register house in edinburgh and were published by him but without their endorsements in his ‘criminal trials’ in scotland 1832 169  copies of the letters are also ‘bookit’ or engrossed in the records of parliament  these ‘bookit’ transcripts were made carelessly and the old copyist was puzzled by the handwriting and orthography of the alleged originals before him  the controversy about the genuineness of the five letters took new shapes after mr pitcairn discovered those apparently in logan’s hand and printed them in 1832 mr hill burton accepts them with no hint of doubt and if mr tytler was the most learned and impartial mr hill burton was the most sceptical of our historians  yet on this point of authenticity these historians were too hasty  the authenticity of the letters except one no iv was denied by the very man sprot in whose possession most of them were originally found 170  the evidence of his denial has been extant ever since calderwood wrote who tells us clearly on the authority of an older and anonymous history in ms now in the advocates’ library that sprot when first taken april 13–19 1608 accused logan of writing the letters but withdrew the charge under torture and finally when kindly treated by lord dunbar and healed of his wounds declared that he himself had forged all the logan letters save one  yet logan was to sprot’s certain knowledge so sprot persistently declared involved in the gowrie conspiracy  now assuredly this appeared to be an incredible assertion of calderwood or of his ms source  he was a stern presbyterian an enemy of the king who banished him and an intimate friend of the cranstoun family who in 1600 were closely connected with conspirators of their name  thus prejudiced calderwood was believed by mr pitcairn to have made an untrue or confused statement  logan is in a plot sprot knows it and yet sprot forges letters to prove logan’s guilt and these letters found in sprot’s possession prove his own guilty knowledge  there seems no sense in such behaviour  it might have been guessed that sprot knew of logan’s guilt but had no documentary evidence of it and therefore forged evidence for the purpose of extorting blackmail from logan  but by 1608 when sprot was arrested with some of the documents in his pocket logan had been dead for nearly two years  the guess that sprot knew of logan’s treason but forged the proof of it for purposes of blackmailing him was not made by historians  the guess was getting ‘warm’ as children say in their game was very near the truth but it was not put forward by criticism  historians in fact knew that logan would not have stood an attempt at extortion  he was not that kind of man  in 1594 he made a contract with napier of merchistoun the inventor of logarithms  tradition declared that there was a hoard of gold in ‘the place of fastcastle’  napier was to discover it probably by the divining rod and logan was to give him a third of the profits  but napier knowing his man inserted a clause in the deed to the effect that after finding the gold he was to be allowed a free exit from fastcastle  whether he found the hoard or not we do not know  but two years later in letting a portion of his property napier introduced the condition that his tenant should never sublet it to any person of the name of logan  if he found the gold he probably was not allowed to carry off his third share  logan being a resolute character of this kind sprot a cowering creature would not forge letters to blackmail him  he would have been invited to dine at fastcastle  the cliffs are steep the sea is deep and tells no tales  thus where was sprot’s motive for forging letters in logan’s hand and incriminating the laird of restalrig and for carrying them about in his pocket in 1608  but where was his motive for confessing when taken and examined that he did forge the letters if his confession was untrue while swearing to his certain destruction that he had a guilty foreknowledge of the gowrie conspiracy  he might conciliate government and get pardoned as king’s evidence by producing what he called genuine logan letters and thus proving the conspiracy and clearing the king’s character but this he did not do  he swore to the last that logan and he were both guilty so calderwood’s authority rightly reported but that the plot letters were forged by himself to what end calderwood did not say  all this appeared midsummer madness  calderwood it was argued must be in error  a theory was suggested that sprot really knew nothing of the gowrie mystery that he had bragged falsely of his knowledge in his cups that the government pounced on him made him forge the letters of logan to clear the king’s character by proving a conspiracy and then hanged him still confessing his guilt  but mr mark napier a learned antiquary replied in a long appendix to the third volume of the history by the contemporary spottiswoode to this not very probable conjecture by showing that when they tried sprot government produced no letters at all only an alleged account by sprot of two letters unproduced therefore in august 1608 mr napier argued government had no letters if they had possessed them they would infallibly have produced them that seemed sound reasoning  in 1608 government had no plot letters therefore the five produced in the trial of the dead logan were forged for the government by somebody between august 1608 and june 1609  mr napier refused to accept calderwood’s wild tale that sprot while confessing logan’s guilt and his own also confessed to having forged logan’s letters  yet calderwood’s version or rather that of his anonymous authority in ms was literally accurate  sprot in private examinations july 5 august 11 1608 confessed to having forged all the letters but one the important one letter iv logan to gowrie  this confession the government burked  the actual circumstances have remained unknown and are only to be found in the official but suppressed reports of sprot’s private examinations now in the muniment room of the earl of haddington  these papers enable us partly to unravel a coil which without them no ingenuity could disentangle  sir thomas hamilton the king’s advocate popularly styled ‘tam o’ the cowgate’ from his house in that old ‘street of palaces’ was the ancestor of lord haddington who inherits his papers  sir thomas was an eminent financier lawyer statesman and historical collector and inquirer who later became lord binning and finally earl of haddington  as king’s advocate he held and preserved the depositions letters and other documents used in the private examinations of sprot on and after july 5 1608  the records of sprot’s examinations between april 19 and july 5 1600 are not known to be extant  sir thomas’s collection consists of summonses or drafts of summonses for treason against the dead logan 1609  there is also a holograph letter of confession july 5 1608 from sprot to the earl of dunbar there are the records of the private examinations of sprot july 5august 11 1600 and of other persons whom he more or less implicated there are copies by sprot in his ‘course’ that is current handwriting of two of the five letters in logan’s hand or in an imitation of it  these are letters i and iv produced at the posthumous trial of logan in june 1609  finally there are letters in logan’s hand or in an imitation of it addressed to james bower and to one ninian chirnside with allusions to the plot and there is a long memorandum of matters of business also containing hints about the conspiracy in logan’s hand or in an imitation thereof addressed to john bell and james bower  of these compromising papers one a letter to chirnside was found by the rev mr anderson in 1902 torn into thirteen pieces whereof one is missing wrapped up in a sheet of foolscap of the period  mr anderson has placed the pieces together and copied the letter  of all these documents only five letters those published by mr pitcairn were ‘libelled’ or founded on and produced by the government in the posthumous trial of logan 1609  not one was produced before the jury who tried sprot on august 12 1608  he was condemned we said merely on his own confession  in his ‘dittay’ or impeachment and in the official account of the affair published in 1608 were cited fragments of two letters quoted from memory by sprot under private examination  these quotations from memory differ we saw in many places from any of the five letters produced in the trial of 1609 a fact which has aroused natural suspicions  this is the true explanation of the discrepancies between the plot letter cited in sprot’s impeachment and in the government pamphlet on his case and the similar though not identical letter produced in 1609  the indictment and the tract published by government contain merely sprot’s recollections of the epistle from logan to gowrie  the letter iv produced in 1609 is the genuine letter of logan or so sprot seems falsely to swear  this document did not come into the hands of government till after the indictment containing sprot’s quotation of the letter from memory was written or if it did was kept back  all this has presently to be proved in detail  as the government a fact unknown to our historians possessed all the alleged logan letters and papers before sprot was hanged and as at his trial they concealed this circumstance even from archbishop spottiswoode who was present at sprot’s public trial by jury a great deal of perplexity has been caused and many ingenious but erroneous conjectures have been invented  the indictment or ‘dittay’ against sprot on august 12 1608 is a public document but not an honest one it contains the following among other averments  we are told that sprot in july 1600 at fastcastle saw and read the beginning of a letter from logan to gowrie letter iv  logan therein expresses delight at receiving a letter of gowrie’s he is anxious to avenge ‘the macchiavelian massacre of our dearest friends’ the earl decapitated in 1584  he advises gowrie to be circumspect ‘and be earnest with your brother that he be not rash in any speeches touching the purpose of padua’                            picture fastcastle  this letter as thus cited is not among the five later produced in 1609 it is a blurred reminiscence of parts of two of them  the reason of these discrepancies is that the letter is quoted in the indictment not from the document itself which apparently reach the prosecution after the indictment was framed but from a version given from memory by sprot in one of his private examinations  next sprot is told in his indictment that some time later logan asked bower to find this letter which gowrie for the sake of secrecy had returned to bower to be delivered to logan  we know that this was the practice of intriguers after the december riot at edinburgh in 1596 the rev robert bruce writing to ask lord hamilton to head the party of the kirk is said to request him to return his own letter by the bearer  gowrie and logan practised the same method  the indictment goes on to say that bower being unable to read asked sprot to search for logan’s letter to gowrie among his papers that sprot found it ‘abstracted’ it stole it retained it and ‘read it divers times’ a false quotation of the ms confession  sprot really said that he kept the stolen letter iv ‘till’ he had framed on it as a model three forged letters  it contained a long passage of which the ‘substance’ is quoted  this passage as printed in sprot’s indictment is not to be found textually in any of the five letters later produced  it is we repeat merely the version given from memory by sprot at one of his last private examinations before the letter itself came into the hands of government in either form the letter meant high treason  such is the evidence of the indictment against sprot of august 12 1608 in the light of sprot’s real confessions hitherto lying in the haddington muniment room we know the indictment to be a false and garbled document  next on the part of government we have always had a published statement by sir william hart the king’s justice with an introduction by dr george abbot later archbishop of canterbury who was in edinburgh and present when sprot was hanged  this tract was published by bradewood london in 1608 and is reprinted by pitcairn  after a verbose pious and pedantic diatribe abbot comes to the point sprot was arrested in april 1608 first on the strength ‘of some words that fell from himself’ and next ‘of some papers found upon him’ what papers  they are never mentioned in the indictment of sprot  they are never alluded to in the sequel of abbot’s pamphlet containing the official account by sir william hart of sprot’s trial and examinations in mentioning ‘some papers found upon’ sprot dr abbot ‘let the cat out of the bag’ but writers like mr napier and other sceptics of his way of thinking deny that any of the compromising letters were found at all  no letters we say are mentioned by sir william hart in abbot’s tract 1608 as having been produced  archbishop spottiswoode who was present at sprot’s public trial august 12 1608 thought the man one of those insane selfaccusers who are common enough and observes that he did not ‘show the letter’—that of logan to gowrie iv  this remark of spottiswoode an archbishop a converted presbyterian a courtier and an advocate for the king has been a source of joy to all ruthven apologists  ‘spottiswoode saw though the farce’ they say ‘there was no letter at all and courtier and recreant as he was spottiswoode had the honesty to say so in his history’  to this there used to be no reply  but now we know the actual and discreditable truth  the government was in fact engaged in a shameful scheme to which archbishops were better not admitted  they meant to use this letter iv on a later occasion but they also meant to use some of the other letters which sprot unknown to spottiswoode had confessed to be forgeries  the archiepiscopal conscience might revolt at such an infamy spottiswoode might tell the king so the scottish government did not then allow the archbishop or the public to know that they had any logan letters  no letter at all came into open and public court in 1608 hart cites a short one from gowrie to logan  gowrie hopes to see logan or at least to send a trusty messenger ‘anent the purpose you know but rather would i wish yourself to come not only for that errand but for some other thing that i have to advise with you’  there is no date of place or day  this letter harmless enough was never produced in court and mr barbé supposes that it was a concoction of hart’s  this is an unlucky conjecture  the haddington mss prove that sprot really recited gowrie’s letter or professed to do so from memory in one of his private examinations  the prosecution never pretended to possess or produce gowrie’s letter  next hart cites as logan’s answer to gowrie’s first letter which it was not the passages already quoted by the prosecution in sprot’s indictment passages out of a letter of logan’s given by sprot from memory only  hart goes on to describe as if on sprot’s testimony certain movements of the laird’s after he received gowrie’s reply to his own answer to gowrie  logan’s letter as given in 1609 is dated july 29 and it is argued that his movements after receiving gowrie’s reply are inconsistent with any share in the plot which failed on august 5 even if it were so the fact is unimportant for sprot was really speaking of movements at a date much earlier than july 29 he later gave a separate account of what logan was doing at the time of the outbreak of the plot an account not quoted by hart who fraudulently or accidentally confused the dates  and next we find it as good as explicitly stated by hart that this letter of logan’s to gowrie was never produced in open court  ‘being demanded where this above written letter written by restalrig to the earl of gowrie which was returned again by james bower is now  deponeth    that he sprot left the above written letter in his chest among his writings when he was taken and brought away and that it is closed and folded within a piece of paper’ so hart declares in abbot’s tract  he falsified the real facts he could not give the question as originally put to sprot for that involved the publication of the fact that all the letters but one were forged  the question in the authentic private report ran thus ‘demanded where is that letter which restalrig wrote to the earl of gowrie whereupon the said george sprot wrote and forged the missives produced’  august 10  the real letter of logan to gowrie the only genuine letter if in any sense genuine had not on august 10 been produced  the others were in the hands of the government  hart in his tract veils these circumstances  the government meant to put the letters to their own uses on a later occasion at the trial of the dead logan  meanwhile we must keep one fact steadily in mind  when sprot confessed to having forged treasonable letters in logan’s handwriting as calderwood correctly reports that he did confess he did not include among them letter iv logan to gowrie july 29 1600  that letter was never heard of by sprot’s examiners till august 10 and never came into the hands of his examiners till late on august 11 or early on august 12 the day when sprot was hanged  spottiswoode was never made aware that the letter had been produced  why sprot reserved this piece of evidence so long why under the shadow of the gibbet he at last produced it we shall later attempt to explain though with but little confidence in any explanation  meanwhile at sprot’s public trial in 1608 the government were the conspirators  they burked the fact that they possessed plotletters alleged to be by logan  they burked the fact that sprot confessed all these with one or perhaps two exceptions to be forgeries by himself what they quoted as letters of logan and gowrie were merely descriptions of such letters given by sprot from memory of their contents     xiv  the laird and the notary   we have now to track sprot through the labyrinth of his confessions and evasions as attested by the authentic reports of his private examinations between july 5 and the day of his death  it will be observed that while insisting on his own guilt and on that of logan he produced no documentary evidence no genuine letter attributed by him to logan nothing but his own confessed forgeries till the cord was almost round his neck—if he did then  in his confessions he paints with sordid and squalid realism the life of a debauched laird tortured by terror and rushing from his fears to forgetfulness in wine travel and pleasure and to strange desperate dreams of flight  as a ‘human document’ the confessions of sprot are unique for that period  on july 5 1608 sprot in prison wrote in his own ordinary hand the tale of how he knew of logan’s guilt the letter was conveyed to the earl of dunbar who with dunfermline governed scotland under the absent king  the prisoner gave many sources of his knowledge but the real source if any letter iv he reserved till he was certain of death august 10  sprot ‘knew perfectly’ he said on july 5 that one letter from gowrie and one from his brother alexander ruthven reached logan at fastcastle and at gunnisgreen a house hard by eyemouth where sprot was a notary and held cottage land 183  bower carried logan’s answers and ‘long afterwards’ showed sprot ‘the first of gowrie’s letters’ the harmless one about desiring an interview and also a note of logan’s to bower himself ‘which is amongst the rest of the letters produced’  it is no ii but in this confession of july 5 sprot appears to say that gowrie’s innocent letter to logan asking for an interview was the source of his forgeries  ‘i framed them all to the true meaning and purpose of the letter that bower let me see to make the matter more clear by these arguments and circumstances for the cause which i have already’ before july 5 ‘shewn to the lords’—that is for purposes of extorting money from logan’s executors  this statement was untrue  the brief letter to logan from gowrie was not the model of sprot’s forgeries as he later confessed he had another model in a letter of logan to gowrie which he held back till the last day of his life  but in this confession of july 5 sprot admits that he saw not only gowrie’s letter to logan of july 6  1600 a letter never produced but also a ‘direction’ or letter from logan to his retainer bower dated ‘the canongate july 18 1600’  this is our letter ii  had it been genuine then taken with gowrie’s letter to logan it must have aroused sprot’s suspicions  but this letter ii about which sprot told discrepant tales is certainly not genuine  it is dated as we said ‘the canongate july 18 1600’  its purport is to inform bower then at brockholes near eyemouth that logan had received a new letter from gowrie concerning certain proposals already made orally to him by the master of ruthven  logan hoped to get the lands of dirleton for his share in the enterprise  he ends ‘keep all things very secret that my lord my brother’ lord home ‘get no knowledge of our purposes for i’ would ‘rather be eirdit quick’ that is buried alive p 205  now we shall show later the source whence sprot probably borrowed this phrase as to lord home and being eirdit quick which he has introduced into his forged letter  moreover the dates are impossible  the first of the five letters purports to be from logan to an unnamed conspirator addressed as ‘right honourable sir’  it is not certain whether this letter was in the hands of the prosecution before the day preceding sprot’s execution nor is it certain whether it is ever alluded to by sprot under examination  but it is dated from fastcastle on july 18 and tells the unknown conspirator that logan has just heard from gowrie  it follows that logan had heard from gowrie on july 18 at fastcastle that he thence rode to edinburgh and from edinburgh wrote his letter ii to bower bidding bower hasten to edinburgh to consult  this is absurd logan would have summoned bower from fastcastle much nearer bower’s home than edinburgh  again in letter i logan informs the unknown man that he is to answer gowrie ‘within ten days at furthest’  that being so he does not need bower in such a hurry unless it be to carry the letter to the unknown  but in that case he would have summoned bower from fastcastle he would not have ridden to edinburgh and summoned him thence  once more sprot later confessed as we shall see that this letter to bower was dictated to himself by logan and that the copy produced apparently in logan’s hand was forged by him from the letter as dictated to him  he thus contradicted his earlier statement that letter ii was shown to him by bower  he never says that he was in edinburgh with logan on july 18  besides it is not conceivable that by dictating letter ii to sprot logan would have voluntarily put himself in the power of the notary  this is a fair example of sprot’s apparently purposeless lying  his real interest throughout was to persuade the government that he was giving them genuine logan letters  this however he denied with truth yet he lied variously about the nature of his confessed forgeries  sprot was so false that government might conceive his very confession of having forged the letters to be untrue  the skill in handwriting of that age could not detect them for impostures government might deem that he had stolen genuine letters from bower letters which might legitimately be produced as evidence  indeed this charitable view is perhaps confirmed by the extraordinary fact to be later proved that three edinburgh ministers mr hall mr hewat and mr galloway with mr lumisden minister of duddingston were present on occasions when sprot confessed to having forged the letters  yet these four preachers said nothing as far as we hear when the letters confessedly forged were produced as evidence in 1609 to ruin logan’s innocent child  did the preachers think the letters genuine in spite of the confession that they were forged  we shall see later in any case that the contents of the three letters to the unknown and a torn letter when compared with letter iv demonstrate that sprot’s final confession to having forged them on the model of iv is true indeed the fact ought to have been discovered on internal evidence even by critics unaware of his confessions  we now pursue sprot’s written deposition of july 5  he gives as grounds of his knowledge of logan’s guilt certain conversations among logan’s intimates yeomen or ‘bonnet lairds’ or servants from which he inferred that logan was engaged in treason  again just before logan’s death in july 1606 he was delirious and raved of forfeiture  but logan had been engaged in various treasons so his ravings need not refer to the gowrie affair  he had been on bothwell’s enterprises and had privy dealings with ‘percy’ probably thomas percy who in 1602 secretly visited hume of manderston a kinsman of logan  that intrigue was certainly connected merely with james’s succession to the english crown  but one of logan’s retainers when this affair of percy was spoken of among them said according to sprot that the laird had been engaged in treason ‘nearer home’  sprot then writes that ‘about the time of the conspiracy’ logan with matthew logan rode to dundee where they enjoyed a three days’ drinking bout and never had the laird such a surfeit of wine  but this jaunt could not be part of the gowrie plot and probably occurred after its failure  later sprot gave a different version of logan’s conduct immediately before and after gowrie’s death  once more after logan’s death one wallace asked sprot to be silent if ever he had heard of ‘the laird’s conspiracy’  sprot ended by confessing contritely that he had forged all the letters except letter iv ‘to the true meaning and purpose of the letter that bower let me see’ a passage already quoted and a falsehood  what was the ‘cause’ for which sprot forged  it was a purpose to blackmail not logan but logan’s heirs or executors one of whom was lord home  if sprot wanted to get anything out of them he could terrify them by threatening to show the forged logan letters as genuine to the government so securing the ruin of logan’s heirs by forfeiture he did not do this himself but he gave forged letters for money to men who were in debt to the dead logan’s estate and who might use the letters to extort remission of what they owed  on july 15 sprot was examined before dunfermline dunbar hart the king’s advocate sir thomas hamilton and other gentlemen  he said that about july 6 1600 logan received a letter from gowrie which two days later bower showed to him at fastcastle  this is the harmless gowrie letter which sprot now quoted from memory as it is printed in hart’s official account  now begins a new puzzle caused by sprot’s dates  of these we can only give a conjectural version for the sake of argument  logan received a letter from gowrie about july 6 1600  he returned a reply by bower but when did bower start with the reply  let us say on july 9  bower returned says sprot ‘within five days’ with ‘a new letter’ from gowrie  that would bring us to july 14 but in letters i and ii dated july 18 logan is informing his unknown correspondent and bower of the receipt of ‘a new letter’ from gowrie  why inform bower of this if bower was the bearer of the new letter  but the ‘new letter’ mentioned in letters i and ii was brought by a retainer of gowrie  in any case supposing by way of conjecture that bower returned from gowrie about july 15 he spent the night says sprot with logan at gunnisgreen and next day july 16 rode to edinburgh with bower boig of lochend and matthew logan  in edinburgh he remained ‘a certain short space’ say four days which would bring us to july 20  needless to say that this does not fit letter ii logan to bower july 18 and letter i logan to the unknown fastcastle july 18  after logan’s return from edinburgh which according to sprot seems to be of about july 20 sprot heard logan and bower discuss some scheme by which logan should get gowrie’s estate of dirleton without payment bower said nothing could be done till logan rode west himself  he discouraged the whole affair but logan said in the hearing of several persons that he would hazard his life with gowrie  lady restalrig blamed bower for making logan try to sell the lands of fastcastle they were not sold till 1602 of which bower protested his innocence  this was after logan’s return from edinburgh say july 20 that is say five days after logan’s return say july 25  bower and logan had a long conference in the open air  sprot was lounging and spying about beside the river a seafisher had taken a basket of blenneys or ‘greenbanes’ logan called to sprot to bring him the fish and they all supped  before supper however sprot walked about with bower and tried to ‘pump’ him as to what was going forward  bower said that ‘the laird should get dirleton without either gold or silver but he feared it should be as dear to him  they had another pie in hand than the selling of land’ bower then asked sprot not to meddle for he feared that ‘in a few days the laird would be either landless or lifeless’  certainly this is a vivid description bower and logan were sitting on a bench ‘at the byre end’ sprot come on the chance of a supper was peeping and watching peter mason the angler at the river side ‘near the stepping stones’ had his basket of blenneys on his honest back his rod or net in his hand the laird was calling for the fish was taking a drink and we hope offering a drink to mason  then followed the lounge and the talk with bower before supper all in the late afternoon of a july day the yellow light sleeping on the northern sea below  vivid this is and plausible but is it true  we have reached the approximate date of july 25 though of course after an interval of eight years sprot’s memory of dates must be vague  next day july 26 logan with bower and others rode to nine wells where david hume the philosopher was born thence the same night back to gunnisgreen next night july 27 to fastcastle and thence to edinburgh this brings us allowing freely for error of memory to about july 27 ‘the hinder end of july’ says sprot  if we make allowance for a vagueness of four or five days this does not fit in badly  logan’s letter to gowrie no iv which sprot finally said that he used as a model for his forgeries is dated ‘gunnisgreen july 29’  ‘at the beginning of august’ says sprot clearly there are four or five days lost in the reckoning logan and bower with matthew logan and willie crockett rode to edinburgh ‘and there stayed three days and the laird with matthew logan came home and bower came to his own house of the brockholes where he stayed four days’ and then was sent for by logan ‘and the laird was very sad and sorry’ obviously because of the failure of the plot on august 5  how do these dates fit into the narrative  logan was at gunnisgreen his letter iv proves it on july 29  later we show another error of sprot’s on this point  he writes that he is sending bower as bearer of his letter to gowrie  if bower left edinburgh on july 30 he could deliver the letter to gowrie at perth on august 2 and be back in edinburgh whither logan now went on august 5 and logan could leave edinburgh on august 6 after hearing of the deaths of his fellowconspirators  we must not press sprot too hard as to dates so remote in time  we may grant that bower bearing logan’s letter of july 29 rode with logan and the others to edinburgh that at edinburgh logan awaited his return with a reply that he thence learned that august 5 was the day for the enterprise and that early on august 6 he heard of its failure and rode sadly home all this being granted for the sake of argument  had the news of august 6 been that the king had mysteriously disappeared we may conceive that logan would have hurried to dirleton met the ruthvens there with their prisoner and sailed with them to fastcastle or he might have made direct to fastcastle and welcomed them there  his reason for being at restalrig or in the canongate was to get the earliest news from perth brought across fife and from bruntisland to leith  whether correct or not this scheme allowing for lapse of memory as to dates is feasible  who can remote from any documents remember the dates of occurrences all through a month now distant by eight years there were no daily newspapers no ready means of ascertaining a date queen mary’s accusers in their chronological account of her movements about the time of darnley’s death are often out in their dates  in legal documents of the period the date of the day of the month of an event is often left blank  this occurs in the confirmation of logan’s own will  ‘he died  july 1606’  when lawyers with plenty of leisure for inquiry were thus at a loss for dates of days of the month having since the reformation no saints’ days to go by sprot in prison might easily go wrong in his chronology                            picture fastcastle  in any case taking letter iv provisionally as genuine in substance we note that on july 29 logan did not yet know the date fixed for gowrie’s enterprise  he suggested ‘the beginning of harvest’ and by august 5 harvest had begun  one of the perth witnesses was reaping in the ‘morton haugh’ when he heard the town bell call the citizens to arms  but gowrie must have acted in great haste logan not knowing till say august 2 or 3 the date of a plot that exploded on august 5  gowrie may have thought as lord maxwell said when arranging his escape from edinburgh castle ‘sic interprysis are nocht effectuat with deliberationis and advisments bot with suddane resolutionis’  it is very important we must freely admit as an argument against the theory of carrying james to logan’s impregnable keep of fastcastle that only one question in our papers is asked as to the provisioning of fastcastle and that merely as to the supply of drink  possibly this had been ascertained in sprot’s earlier and unrecorded examinations april 19july 5  one poor hogshead of wine a trifle to logan had been sent in that summer so matthew logan deponed  as logan had often used fastcastle before for treasonable purposes he was not it may be supposed likely to leave it without provisions  moreover these could be brought by sea from dirleton where carey august 11 says that gowrie had stored ‘all his provision’  moreover government did not wish to prove intent to kidnap the king  that was commonly regarded as a harmless constitutional practice not justifying the slaughter of the ruthvens  from the first government insisted that murder was intended  in the latin indictment of the dead logan this is again dwelt on fastcastle is only to be the safe haven of the murderers  this is a misreading of letter iv where fastcastle is merely spoken of as to be used for a meeting and ‘the concluding of our plot’  thus it cannot be concealed that on july 29 granting letter iv to have a basis the plot as far as logan knew was ‘in the air’  if fastcastle was to be used by the conspirators it must have been taken in the rough on the chance that it was provided or that gowrie could bring his own supplies from dirleton by sea  this extreme vagueness undeniably throws great doubt on logan’s part in the plot letter iv if genuine being the source of our perplexity  but if it is not genuine that is in substance there is only rumour later to be discussed to hint that logan was in any way connected with gowrie  we left bower and logan conversing dolefully some days after the failure of the plot  at this point the perhaps insuperable difficulty arises why did they not as soon as they returned from edinburgh destroy every inch of paper connected with the conspiracy  one letter at least logan’s to gowrie july 29 was not burned according to sprot but was later stolen by himself from bower though he reserved this confession to the last day of his life but two  we might have expected logan to take the letter from bower as soon as they met and to burn or for that matter swallow it if no fire was convenient  yet according to sprot in his final confession logan let bower keep the damning paper for months  if this be true we can only say quos deus vult perdere prius dementat  people do keep damning letters constant experience proves the fact  after bower had met logan in his melancholy mood he rode away and remained absent for four days on what errand sprot did not know and during the next fortnight while scotland was ringing with the gowrie tragedy sprot saw nothing of logan  next logan went to church at coldinghame on a sunday and met bower next day they dined together at gunnisgreen  bower was gloomy  logan said ‘be it as it will i must take my fortune and i will tell you laird bower the scaffold is the best death that a man can die’  logan if he said this must have been drunk he very often was  it was at this point in answer to a question that sprot confessed that logan’s letter to bower no ii was a forgery by himself  the actual letter sprot said was dictated by logan to him and he made a counterfeit copy in imitation of logan’s handwriting  we have stated the difficulties involved in this obvious falsehood  sprot was trying every ruse to conceal his alleged source and model letter iv  sprot was next asked about a certain memorandum by logan directed to bower and to one john bell in 1605  this document was actually found in sprot’s ‘pocquet’ when he was arrested and it contained certain very compromising items  sprot replied that he forged the memorandum in the autumn of 1606 when he forged the other letters  he copied most of it from an actual but innocent note of logan’s on business matters and added the compromising items out of his own invention  he made three copies of this forgery one was produced he gave another to a man named heddilstane or heddilshaw a dweller in berwick in september 1607 the third ‘in course hand’ he gave to another client ‘the goodman of rentoun’ hume  one was to be used to terrorise logan’s executors to whom heddilstane but not rentoun was in debt  sprot’s words are important  ‘he omitted nothing that was in the original’ logan’s memorandum on business matters ‘but eikit’ added ‘two articles to his copy the one concerning ninian chirnside’ as to a dangerous plotletter lost by bower ‘the other where the laird ordered bower to tear his missive letters  he grants that he wrote another copy with his course hand copied from his copy and gave it to the goodman of rentoun’ while the copy given to heddilstane ‘was of his counterfeited writing’ an imitation of logan’s hand               picture handwriting of logan january 1585–6  perhaps sprot had two methods and scales of blackmail  for one he invented damning facts and wrote them out in imitation of logan’s writing  the other species was cheaper a copy in his ‘course hand’ of his more elaborate forgeries in logan’s hand  now the two copies of letters i and iv which at the end of his life as we shall see sprot attested by signed endorsements were in his ‘course hand’  he had them ready for customers when he was arrested in april 1608 and they were doubtless found in his ‘kist’ on the day before his death with the alleged original of letter iv  up to august 11 at a certain hour government had neither the alleged original nor sprot’s ‘course hand copy’ of letter iv otherwise he would not have needed to quote iv from memory as he did on that occasion  among these minor forgeries to be used in blackmailing operations was a letter nominally from logan to one ninian or ringan chirnside  this man was a member of the family of chirnside of easter chirnside his own estate was whitsumlaws  all these chirnsides and humes of berwickshire were a turbulent and lawless gang true borderers  ninian is addressed by logan as ‘brother’ they were most intimate friends  it was ninian who as the endorsement shows produced our letter v on april 19 he had purchased it for the usual ends from sprot being a great debtor as logan’s will proves to his estate  to track these men through the background of history is to have a notion of the day of judgment  old forgotten iniquities and adventures leap to light  chirnside like logan and the douglases of whittingham and john colville and the laird of spot had followed the fortunes of wild frank stewart earl of bothwell and nephew of the bothwell of queen mary frank bothwell was driven into his perilous courses by a charge of practising witchcraft against the king’s life  absurd as this sounds bothwell had probably tried it for what it was worth  when he was ruined pursued driven child of the kirk as he seemed into the catholic faction his old accomplice colville took a solemn farewell of him  ‘by me your lordship was cleared of the odious imputation of witchcraft    but god only knows how far i hazarded my conscience in making black white and darkness light for your sake’ september 12 1594 198  after bothwell when he trapped the king by aid of lady gowrie july 1593 recovered power for a while he defended himself on this charge of witchcraft  he had consulted and employed the wizard richard graham who now accused him of attempting the king’s life by sorcery  but he had only employed graham to heal the earl of angus himself dying of witchcraft  bothwell was charged with employing a retainer ninian chirnside to arrange more than twentyone meetings with the wizard graham the result being the procurement of a poison ‘adder skins toad skins and the hippomanes in the brain of a young foal’ to ooze the juices on the king ‘a poison of such vehemency as should have presently cut him off’  isobel gowdie accused of witchcraft in 1622 confessed to having employed a similar charm 199a  all this bothwell instructed by colville denied but admitted that he had sent ninian chirnside twice to the wizard all in the interests of the dying earl of angus 199b  this chirnside then was a borderer prone to desperate enterprises and darkling rides and midnight meetings with the wizard graham in lonely shepherds’ cottages as was alleged  he could also sink to blackmailing the orphan child of his ‘brother’ logan of restalrig  to go on with sprot’s confessions he had forged he said receipts from logan to the man named edward or ned heddilstane for some of the money which heddilstane owed him  for these forgeries his client paid him well if not willingly  sprot frequently blackmailed ned ‘whenever he want siller’  it must be granted that sprot was a liar so complex and a forger so skilled for the time that is that nothing which he said or produced can be reckoned as such as evidence  on the other hand his power of describing or inventing scenes real or fictitious was of high artistic merit so that he appears occasionally either to deviate into truth or to have been a realistic novelist born centuries too early  why then it may be asked do we doubt that sprot may have forged without a genuine model letter iv  the answer will appear in due time  letter iv as sprot confessed is certainly the model of all the letters which he forged whether those produced or those suppressed  he was afraid to wander from his model which he repeated in letters i  iii v and in the unproduced letters including one which we have found in twelve torn fragments with the signature missing     xv  the final confessions of the notary   on july 16 sprot was again examined  spottiswoode archbishop of glasgow the historian was present on this occasion only with dunfermline dunbar sir thomas hamilton hart and other nobles and officials  none of them signs the record which in this case only is merely attested by the signature of primrose the clerk of council one of lord rosebery’s family  in this session sprot said nothing about forging the letters  the archbishop was not to know  asked if he had any more reminiscences sprot said that in november 1602 fastcastle having been sold logan asked bower ‘for god’s sake’ to bring him any of the letters about the gowrie affair which he might have in keeping  bower said that he had no dangerous papers except one letter from alexander ruthven and another from ‘mr andro clerk’  this clerk was a jesuit who chiefly dealt between spain and the scotch catholics he was involved in the affair called ‘the spanish blanks’ 1593 and visited the rebel catholic peers of the north angus errol and huntly 202 logan like bothwell was ready to intrigue either with the kirk or the jesuits and he seems to have had some personal acquaintance with father andrew  bower left logan to look for these letters at his own house at brockholes and logan passed a night of sleepless anxiety  one of the mysteries of the case is that logan entrusted bower who could not read with all his papers  if one of them was needed bower had to employ a person who could read to find it probably he used as a rule the help of his better educated son valentine  after logan’s restless night bower returned with the two letters ruthven’s and clerk’s which logan ‘burned in the fire’  let it be remembered that sprot has not yet introduced letter iv into his depositions though that was by far the most important                 picture hand of logan as forged by sprot  after burning clerk’s and ruthven’s letters logan dictated to sprot a letter to john baillie of littlegill informing him of the fact  bower rode off with the letter and logan bade sprot be silent about all these things for he had learned from bower that sprot knew a good deal here the amateur of the art of fiction asks why did sprot drag in mr john baillie of littlegill  if logan as sprot swore informed baillie about the burned letters then baillie had a guilty knowledge of the conspiracy  poor baillie was instantly ‘put in ward’ under the charge of the earl of dunfermline  but on the day after sprot was hanged namely on august 13 baillie was set free on bail of 10000 marks to appear before the privy council if called upon  three of sprot’s other victims maul crockett and william galloway were set free on their personal recognisances but mossman and matthew logan were kept in prison and chirnside was not out of danger of the law for several years as we learn from the privy council register  nothing was ever proved against any of these men  after the posthumous trial of logan june 1609 the king bade the council discharge john baillie from his bail ‘as we rest now fully persuaded that there was no just cause of imputation against the said john’  so the register of the privy council informs us 203  thus if sprot told the truth about all these men no corroborative facts were discovered while the only proofs of his charges against logan were the papers which with one exception he confessed to be forgeries executed by himself for purposes of extortion  to go on with his confessions the christmas of 1602 arrived and ‘the laird keepit ane great yule at gunnisgreen’  on the third day of the feast logan openly said to bower at table ‘i shall sleep better this night than that night when i sent you for the letters’ in november ‘for now i am sure that none of these matters will ever come to further light if you be true’  bower answered ‘i protest before god i shall be counted the most damnable traitor in the world if any man on earth know for i have buried them’  after supper bower and logan called sprot out on to the open hillside logan said that bower confessed to having shown sprot a letter of gowrie’s  what he asked did sprot think of the matter  sprot with protestations of loyalty said that he thought that logan had been in the gowrie conspiracy  logan then asked for an oath of secrecy promising ‘to be the best sight you ever saw’ and taking out 12l scots bade sprot buy corn for his children  asked who were present at the scene of the supper sprot named eight yeomen  ‘the lady’ lady restalrig ‘was also present at table that night and at her rising she said “the devil delight in such a feast that will make all the children weep hereafter” and this she spoke as she went past the end of the table  and after entering the other chamber she wept a while ‘and we saw her going up and down the chamber weeping’  a fortnight later lady restalrig blamed bower for the selling of fastcastle  bower appealed to logan it was logan’s fault not his ‘one of two things’ said bower ‘must make you sell your lands either you think your children are bastards or you have planned some treason’ the children were not those of lady restalrig but by former marriages logan replied ‘if i had all the land between the orient and the occident i would sell the same and if i could not get money for it i would give it to good fellows’  on another occasion logan said to bower ‘i am for no land i told you before and will tell you again  you have not learned the art of memory’  in fact logan did sell not only fastcastle but flemington and restalrig  we know how the scot then clung to his acres  why did logan sell all  it does not appear as we have shown that he was in debt  if he had been his creditors would have had him ‘put to the horn’ proclaimed a recalcitrant debtor and the record thereof would be found in the privy council register  but there is no such matter  sprot supposed that logan wished to turn his estates into money to be ready for flight if the truth ever came out  the haste to sell all his lands is certainly a suspicious point against logan  he kept on giving sprot money hush money and for forgeries to defraud others sometimes and taking sprot’s oath of secrecy  a remarkable anecdote follows remarkable on this account  in the letter ii which logan is said by sprot to have written to bower july 18 1600 occurs the phrase ‘keep all things very secret that my lord my brother get no knowledge of our purposes for i rather be eirdit quik’—would rather be buried alive p 184  this ‘my lord my brother’ is obviously meant for alexander sixth lord home whose father the fifth lord had married agnes sister of patrick sixth lord gray and widow of sir robert logan of restalrig  by sir robert lady restalrig had a son the logan of this affair and when after sir robert’s death she married the fifth lord home she had to him a son alexander sixth lord home  our logan and the sixth lord home were therefore brothers uterine 206a  now if we accept as genuine in substance the one letter which sprot declared to be really written by logan no iv gowrie was anxious that home a person of great importance warden on the border should be initiated into the conspiracy  as gowrie had been absent from scotland between august 1594 when he as a lad was in league with the wild kingcatcher francis stewart of bothwell and may 1600 we ask what did gowrie know of home and why did he think him an useful recruit  the answer is that as we showed in another connection p 130 gowrie was in paris in februaryapril 1600 that home was also in paris at the same time arriving in scotland at his house of douglas april 18 1600 and that home did not go to court on his return owing to the king’s displeasure because of his ‘trysting with bothwell’ in brussels 206b  here then we have in march 1600 gowrie and home in paris and bothwell the kingcatcher meeting home in brussels  therefore when letter iv represents gowrie as anxious to bring home who had been consulting bothwell into his plot nothing can be more natural  gowrie himself conceivably met his old rebellious ally bothwell he was certain to meet home in paris and home owning douglas castle and home castle near the border would have been a most serviceable assistant  it must also be remembered that home was at heart a catholic a recent and reluctant protestant convert ‘compelled to come in’ by the kirk bothwell was a catholic gowrie he declared was another logan was a trafficker with jesuits and an ‘idolater’ in the matter of ‘keeping great yules’  logan however if letter iv is genuine in substance wrote that he ‘utterly dissented’ from gowrie’s opinion  he would not try his brother’s home’s mind in the matter or ‘consent that he ever should be counsellor thereto for in good faith he will never help his friend nor harm his foe’  such being the relations if we accept letter iv as in substance genuine between gowrie home and logan we can appreciate sprot’s anecdote now to be given concerning lady home  logan according to sprot said to him in edinburgh early in 1602 ‘thou rememberest what my lady home said to me when she would not suffer my lord to subscribe my contract for fentoun because i would not allow two thousand marks to be kept out of the security and take her word for them  she said to me which was a great knell to my heart that since her coming to the town she knew that i had been in some dealing with the earl of gowrie about dirleton’ now dirleton according to sprot was to have been logan’s payment from gowrie for his aid in the plot  logan then asked sprot if he had blabbed to lady home but sprot replied that ‘he had never spoken to her ladyship but that same day although he had read the contract’ as to fentoun ‘before him and her in the abbey’ of coldingham probably  logan then requested sprot to keep out of lady home’s sight lest she should ask questions ‘for i had rather be eirdit quick than either my lord or she knew anything of it’  now in letter ii july 18 1600 from logan to bower logan as we saw is made to write ‘see that my lord my brother gets no knowledge of our purposes for i sic rather be eirdit quik’  the phrase recurs in another of the forged letters not produced in court  it is thus a probable inference that logan did use this expression to sprot in describing the conversation about lady home and that sprot inserted it into his forged letter ii logan to bower  but clever as sprot was he is scarcely likely to have invented the conversation of logan with lady home arising out of logan’s attempt to do some business with lord home about fentoun  a difficulty raised by lady home led up to the lady’s allusion to dirleton ‘which was a great knell to my heart’ said logan  this is one of the passages which indicate a basis of truth in the confessions of sprot  again as home and gowrie were in paris together while bothwell was in brussels in february 1600 and as home certainly and gowrie conceivably met bothwell it may well have been that gowrie heard of logan from bothwell the old ally of both and marked him as a useful hand  moreover he could not but have heard of logan’s qualities and his keep fastcastle in the troubles and conspiracies of 1592–1594  after making these depositions sprot attested them with phrases of awful solemnity ‘were i presently within one hour to die’  he especially insisted that he had written to logan’s dictation the letter informing john baillie of littlegill that all gowrie’s papers were burned  as we saw in november 1609 the king deliberately cleared baillie of all suspicion  there could be no evidence  bower the messenger was dead  baillie was now called  he denied on oath that he had ever received the letter from logan  he had never seen gowrie ‘except on the day he came first home and rode up the street of edinburgh’  confronted with baillie ‘sprot abides by his deposition’  willie crockett was then called  he had been at logan’s ‘great yule’ in gunnisgreen where logan according to sprot made the imprudent speeches  crockett had also been at dundee with logan he said but it was in the summer of 1603  he did not hear logan’s imprudent speech to bower at the yule supper  as to the weeping of lady restalrig he had often seen her weep and heard her declare that logan would ruin his family  he only remembered as to the yule supper a quarrel between logan and willie home  this was the only examination at which archbishop spottiswoode attended neither he nor any of the lords as we have said already signed the record which is attested only by james primrose clerk of council signing at the foot of each page  had the lords ‘quitted the diet’  the next examination was held on july 22 dunfermline dunbar sir thomas hamilton the president of the court of session and other officials all laymen being present  sprot incidentally remarked that logan visited london in 1603 after king james ascended the english throne  logan appears to have gone merely for pleasure he had seen london before in the winter of 1586  on his return he said that he would ‘never bestow a groat on such vanities’ as the celebration of the king’s holiday august 5 the anniversary of the gowrie tragedy adding ‘when the king has cut off all the noblemen of the country he will live at ease’  but many citizens disliked the 5th of august holiday as much as logan did                       picture handwriting of sprot  in the autumn of 1605 logan again visited london  in sprot’s account of his revels there and his bad reception we have either proof of logan’s guilt if the tale be true or high testimony to sprot’s powers as an artist in fiction  he says that matthew logan accompanied the laird to town in september 1605 and in november was sent back with letters to bower  eight days later matthew took sprot to coldingham to meet bower and get his answer to the letters  it was a sunday these devotees heard sermon and then dined together at john corsar’s  after dinner bower took sprot apart and showed him two letters  would sprot read to him the first few words that he might know which letter he had to answer  the first letter shown so sprot writes on the margin of his recorded deposition referred to the money owed to logan by the earl of dunbar for gunnisgreen and the lands of remington  logan had expected to get the purchase money from dunbar in london he never got more than 18000 out of 33000 marks  sprot wrote for bower the answer to this business letter and gave it to matthew logan to be sent to logan in london  matthew being interrogated denied that he sent any letter back to logan though he owned that sprot wrote one and he denied that sprot and bower had any conference at all on the occasion  but sprot had asserted that the conference with bower occurred after matthew logan left them at corsar’s house where they dined as matthew admitted after sermon  matthew denied too much  a curious conference it was  bower asked sprot to read to him the other of logan’s two letters directed to himself  it ran ‘laird bower—i wot not what i should say or think of this world  it is very hard to trust in any man for apparently there is no constancy or faithfulness  for since i cam here they whom i thought to have been my most entire friends have uttered to me most injurie and have given me the defiance and say i am not worthy to live “and if the king heard what has moved you to put away all your lands and debosch yourself you would not make such merryness and play the companion in london as you do so near his majestie”’  logan went on to express his fear that bower’s rash speeches had roused these suspicions of ‘the auld misterie ye ken of’  ‘god forgive you but i have had no rest since these speeches were upcast to me’  bower was to take great care of this letter ‘for it is within three letters enclosed’ and is confided to matthew logan who travelled by sea as a trusty man  bower was much moved by this melancholy letter and denied that he had been gossiping  he had twice before logan rode south advised him to be very careful never even to mention the name of gowrie  sprot said that he too was uneasy for if anything came out he himself was in evil case  logan visited france as well as london at this time he returned home in the spring of 1606 but bower expressed the belief that he would go on to spain ‘to meet bothwell and father andrew clerk and if he come home it will be rather to die in his own country than for any pleasure he has to live’  bothwell and father andrew of course were both catholic intriguers among whom bothwell reckoned logan and gowrie  now the letter to bower here attributed to logan telling of the new ‘knell at his heart’ when he is rebuked and insulted as he plays the merry companion in london and near the court his touching complaint of the falseness of the world he himself being certainly the blackest of traitors with the distress of bower do make up a very natural description  the ghost of his guilt haunts logan he cannot drown it in a red sea of burgundy life has lost its flavour if he returns it will be with the true scottish desire to die in his own country though of his ancient family’s lands he has not kept an acre  pleasant rich restalrig strong fastcastle jolly gunnisgreen of the ‘great yules’ all are gone nothing is left  surely if sprot invented all this he was a novelist born out of due time  either he told truth or in fiction he rivalled de foe  matthew logan being called contradicted sprot as we have already said he himself had seen bower when he brought him logan’s letter from london take his son valentine apart and knew that valentine read a letter to him  ‘it was a meikle letter’ matthew said and if sprot tell truth it contained three enclosures  bower may have stopped his son from reading the melancholy and compromising epistle and kept it to be read by sprot  logan’s folly in writing at all was the madness that has ruined so many men and women  matthew could not remember having ridden to edinburgh with logan in july 1600 just before the gowrie affair as sprot had declared that he did we could scarcely expect him to remember that  he could remember nothing at all that was compromising nothing of logan’s rash speeches  as to the yule feast at gunnisgreen he averred that lady restalrig only said ‘the devil delight in such a feast that makes discord and makes the house ado’—that is gives trouble  asked if wine and beer were stored in fastcastle in 1600 he said as has already been stated that a hogshead of wine was therein  he himself he said had been ‘in the west’ at the time of the gowrie tragedy and first heard of it at falkirk  on august 6 sprot was interrogated again  only lay lords were present there were no clergymen nor lawyers  he denied that he had received any promise of life or reward  he asked to be confronted with matthew logan and reported a conversation between them held when lord dunbar took possession of gunnisgreen  matthew then hoped to ride with the laird to london 1605 but said ‘alas geordie sprot what shall we all do now now nothing is left  i was aye feared for it for i know the laird has done some evil turn and he will not bide in the country and woe’s me therefor’  sprot asked what the ‘evil turn’ was  matthew answered ‘i know well enough but as the proverb goes “what lies not in my way breaks not my shins”’  sprot added that after bower’s death january 1606 logan wrote to him from london not having heard the news of his decease  lady restalrig opened the letter and wrote a postscript ‘give this to laird bower for i trow that he be ridden to hell as he ofttimes said to the laird that he would do’  in letter iv logan tells gowrie that he believes bower ‘would ride to hell’s gate to pleasure him’  sprot was now asked about two letters  one of these logan to chirnside is endorsed ‘production by niniane chirnesyde  xiii april 1608’ another is letter v endorsed ‘produced by ninian chirnside’ a fact first noted by mr anderson  yet another is the letter in twelve torn pieces  logan in the first of these three letters requests chirnside to find a letter which bower lost in dunglas  the letter imperils logan’s life and lands  the date is september 23 and purports falsely to be written before logan goes to london 1605  sprot explained that he forged the letters that chirnside might blackmail logan’s executors and make them forgive him the debts which as logan’s will proves he owed to the estate  here we cite the letter of the twelve fragments  it is of course a forgery by sprot to enable chirnside to terrorise his creditors logan’s executors  but as it directly implicates chirnside himself in the gowrie conspiracy probably he disliked it and tore it up  yet the artist could not part with his work it still lies now reconstructed in the old folio sheet of paper  the reader will remark that like letters i  iii and v this torn letter is a mere pastiche framed as sprot confessed on ideas and expressions in letter iv  letter found among the haddington mss torn into thirteen pieces one lost—these have been placed in order but at least one line of the piece is wanting  brother

on the same day august 6 sprot withdrew a deposition made before july 5 that the unknown for whom letters i iii v were meant was the laird of kinfauns sir harry lindsay who in 1603 tried to shoot patrick eviot one of the gowrie fugitives  the constable of dundee sir james scrymgeour sprot had also accused falsely  the letters i  iii v he says were ‘imagined by me’  on august 8 three ministers patrick galloway john hall and peter hewatt were present  the two former were now preachers of the courtly party the third received a pension of 500 marks from the king after the posthumous trial of logan 1609 at which the five letters were produced but this reward may have been a mere coincidence  the ministers hall and hewatt in august 1600 had at first as we saw declined to accept james’s version of the affair at gowrie house pp 99–103  sprot now confesses that he knows he is to die deposes that no man has promised him life and that he has stated nothing in hope of life  with tears he deplores that he has taken god’s name in vain in swearing to the truth of his depositions before that of july 5  his last five depositions under examination are ‘true in all points and circumstances and he will go to the death with the same’  ‘further the said george sprot remembers that in the summertide of 1601 the laird of restalrig had indented with the lord willoughby then governor of berwick concerning my lord’s ship then built and lying at berwick whereof the laird should have been equal partner with my lord and to take voyage with the said ship either by the laird himself or some other person whom it pleased him to appoint    to pass to the indies the canarys and through the straits for such conditions as were set down in the indenture betwixt my lord and him which was framed by sir john guevara’ willoughby’s cousin the kidnapper of ashfield in 1599  now this ship of lord willoughby’s at all events was a real ship and here is a grain of fact in the narrative of sprot  the ship was built by lord willoughby to protect english commerce from the piracies of the dunkirkers  on march 28 1601 he writes from berwick to cecil ‘the respect of my country and the pity of those hurt by such’ the dunkirkers ‘persuaded me to build a ship and moves me now to offer to serve her majesty at as reasonable a rate as any ship of 140 tons with sixteen pieces of artillery and 100 men can be maintained with    if this offer seem good to you and the council my ship shall presently be fitted if not i purpose to dispose otherwise of her’ to logan ‘being not able to maintain her’  ‘border calendar’ ii 738  on april 19 willoughby wrote that he had pursued with his ship a pirate which had carried an english prize into the forth  but he cannot unaided maintain the ship even for one summer  on june 14 willoughby ‘took a great cold’ in his ship lying at the haven mouth awaiting a wind and died suddenly  on july 20 carey says that his body has been placed with all honourable rites on board his ship  it appears then that willoughby unable to maintain his ship and not subsidised by government in the summer of 1601 admitted logan to a half of the venture carrying great expenses  logan settled the business at robert jackson’s house in bridge street berwick being accompanied by sprot bower and matthew logan  matthew said privately to sprot ‘wae’s me that ever i should see this day that the laird should grow a seaman i wot not what it means for it is for no good and i fear this shall be one of the sorrowful blocks that ever the laird made  it is true that i have oft thought that the laird would pass away for he is minded to sell all that he has and would to god that he had never been born what should he do with such conditions to go or to send to the sea  he might have lived well enough at home  i find he has ever been carried’ excited ‘and his mind has ever been set on passing out of the country this year past’ that is since the gowrie affair  now all this tale has much vraisemblance  the facts about logan’s adventure with willoughby stopped by willoughby’s death were easily verifiable  logan at his death owned a ship rated at 500 marks so we read in his inventory but this can hardly have been the ship of willoughby  he was restless excited selling land to supply a maritime enterprise  at this time lady restalrig was deeply distressed she wished logan at the indies if only he would first settle flemington on herself  ‘if it be god’s will i desire never to have a child to him’ she said  ‘i have a guess what this mystery means woe’s me for his motherless children’ that is children of former marriages  later lady restalrig had a daughter anna by logan  matthew logan as usual denied every word attributed to him by sprot except regrets for his own condition  matthew could do no less to save his own life  on august 9 before other witnesses and the rev messrs galloway hall and hewatt sprot solemnly confessed to having forged the letters in logan’s hand then in possession of his examiners  on august 10 the same clergymen and many lords and hart being present sprot came to the point at last  where he was asked after a prayer offered at his request by mr galloway was the letter of logan to gowrie whereon as model the rest were forged  now he had not previously mentioned as far as the reports go a letter of logan to gowrie as the model of his forgeries  he had mentioned as his model the brief harmless letter of gowrie to logan  on august 9 he had been very solemnly told that he was to die and that he would see the faces of the lords of the council no more  probably after they left him he told to a minister or a servant in the gaol the fact that he had used as his model a letter from logan to gowrie  the result was that he did again see on august 10 the lords of the council who asked him ‘where the letter now was’ this is letter iv the letter of logan to gowrie of july 29 1600 sprot in place of answering directly cited from memory and erroneously the opening of the letter  he had read it while it was still unfinished in july 1600 at fastcastle  logan who had been writing it was called by bower went out and thrust it between a bench and the wall there sprot found read and restored the unfinished epistle to its place  but the letter is dated ‘from gunnisgreen’ at the conclusion  logan according to sprot left gunnisgreen one day at the end of july 1600 or beginning of august thence rode to fastcastle and thence next day to edinburgh p 190  now logan in the letter iv says that he took two days to write it one day would be at fastcastle when he was interrupted the other the day of dating at gunnisgreen  this however does not tally with sprot’s account p 190 of logan’s movements nine wells gunnisgreen fastcastle edinburgh if these are the days of writing letter iv  yet if sprot forged letter iv he knew where he dated it from 221 if the government had it forged they knew from sprot’s confession that it should have been dated from fastcastle  perhaps we should not bear too heavily on this point  a man may mention the wrong name by inadvertence or the clerk by inadvertence may write the wrong name  mr mark napier in his essay on this matter twice or thrice prints ‘logan’ for ‘sprot’ or ‘sprot’ for ‘logan’ 222  ‘fastcastle’ in sprot’s confession may be a slip of tongue or pen for ‘gunnisgreen’ or he may have been confused among the movements to and from gunnisgreen and fastcastle  the present writer finds similar errors in the manuscript of this work  sprot next alleged that three months after the gowrie affair logan bade bower hunt among his papers for this very letter  he had been at berwick with lord willoughby and bower told sprot that he was ‘taking order’ with all who knew of his part in the gowrie plot  here is the old difficulty  why was the letter kept for one moment after bower brought it back  why leave it with bower for three months  at all events as bower could not read sprot helped him to look for the letter found it and kept it ‘till he framed three new letters upon it’ after which he does not say what he did with it  here sprot cited from memory but not accurately more of letter iv the existence of such errors is not remarkable  sprot again swore to the truth of all his depositions since july 5  but if this story is true how can it be true that logan was at ease in his mind after burning the letter from alexander ruthven and another from father andrew clerk jesuit as sprot previously swore  there was still letter iv lost unburned a haunting fear  it may be suggested that sprot only kept this letter ‘till’ he had made his forgeries on its model and then in a later search pretended to find and returned it having first copied it out in logan’s hand that copy being our letter iv  sprot first would make a copy in his ordinary hand of the letter then restore the original and after logan’s death copy his copy in imitation of logan’s hand and frame i iii v and the torn letter on his copy of iv finally sprot said that ‘he believes this letter is in his chest among his writings because he left it there when he was taken by watty doig and deposes that it is closed and folded within a piece of paper’  sprot said this on august 10  on august 12 he was hanged  now was this letter on which he forged three others found ‘in his kist’ before his death  that it was so found we have direct evidence though not from the best of sources  in the year 1713 an aged nobleman lord cromarty published a defence of the king’s conduct in the gowrie affair  lord cromarty in 1713 was aged eightythree  born about 1630 he remembered the beginnings of the civil war and says that the covenanters about 1640–1645 made great political capital out of king james’s alleged guilt in the slaughter of the ruthvens  later lord cromarty occupied in the restoration the highest judicial offices and as clerk registrar had access to public documents  he was an old courtier he may have been forgetful he may have been unscrupulous but as to the letter in sprot’s kist he writes ‘the letter was found there by the sheriff depute who was ordered by sir william hart lord justice of scotland to seize the said chest and make search for this letter which he found and delivered to the king’s advocate sir thomas hamilton’ 224  now this sir thomas hamilton was the ancestor of the earl of haddington who inherits many of his papers  among these we find a copy in sprot’s ‘course hand’ or rapid current hand of letter iv and another of letter i but no such copies of ii iii and v  each of these is endorsed by james primrose clerk of council is endorsed by sprot in faded ink and is also endorsed in sprot’s ordinary everyday hand very firm and clear thus  ‘this is copyitt off the principal’ the original ‘lykeas the note writtin upon the bak is writtin by me george sprott’  there is in fact another ‘note on the back’ in ink more faded on a dirty rubbed part of the paper  now certainly the last endorsation was written by sprot either on august 11 or august 12 1600  he had not the original or this copy by him on august 10 or on august 11 when examined for on august 10 he could only give a version of letter iv from memory and erroneously the version cited in his indictment  on august 11 he still had not the original or his copy for he quoted from memory what he believed to be a postscript to the original letter iv a passage which is really in the text of letter iv  he could not have made this error if at that hour of august 11 he had either the original of letter iv or his exact copy before him nor would there have been any reason why he should quote from memory if government had the documents  yet he reendorsed his copies of letters i and iv before his death  this endorsement is firm and clear the text of the two copies is fainter and much of the paper more rubbed as if from being kept in the pocket  the copies are older than the final endorsement on the copies  it follows that the sheriff depute found these two copies i iv and the originals in sprot’s kist and brought them to sprot’s examiners after that hour of august 11 when he could only quote from memory  he then endorsed them formally one of the last acts of his life  the originals were also found for it will not be argued that government employed another forger to forge them from sprot’s copies in ‘course hand’  we know that sprot had a secondary species of blackmailing documents these in current hand one of them he gave to the goodman of rentoun  for this or some other purpose he had made the ‘course hand’ copies of letters i and iv which he endorsed just before his death or perhaps he made them from the original which he then destroyed or surreptitiously returned  when he was examined on august 11 the three preachers galloway hall and hewatt and the minister of duddingston mr lumisden were present  he was entreated not to perjure himself to the injury of innocent people dead or alive ‘by making and forging of lies’  he renewed his protestations of truth asked mr galloway to pray for him wept and repeated his averments  on august 12 sprot was tried and hanged at edinburgh  he renewed his protestations from every corner of the scaffold in the most vigorous language  abbot who was present declares that he thrice gave a loud clap with his hands while he swung as a proof that he adhered in death to his last words  a similar story is told of kirkcaldy of grange and i think in other cases  nothing of the sort is in the first draft of the official account of his dying behaviour a draft manifestly drawn up near the spot nor in the official account itself  much value was set on dying confessions  when the preacher robert bruce refused to believe the king’s account of the gowrie tragedy he said that one proof would satisfy him  let andrew henderson the man in the turret be hanged  if he persisted in his confession on the scaffold mr bruce would believe  the king declined to make this abominable experiment  in sprot’s case his dying confession did not move the kirk party  calderwood hints that mr galloway ‘had the most speech to sprot on the scaffold’ and so kept him true to a dying lie 227a he adds that spottiswoode said to galloway ‘i am afraid this man make us all ashamed’ that is by retracting his confessions  mr patrick answered ‘let alone my lord i shall warrant him’ 227b  had andrew henderson swung constant to his confession the presbyterian sceptics would have found similar reasons for disbelief  what are we to believe  did sprot go wherever he went with a blasphemous lie in his mouth  a motive for such vehemence of religious hypocrisy is difficult to find  conceivably he had promise of benefits to his family  conceivably he was an atheist and ‘took god in his own hand’  conceivably his artistic temperament induced him to act his lie well as he had a lie to act  yet all this is not satisfactory  let us take the unromantic view of common sense  it is this logan was a restless disappointed intriguer and debauchee  he sold his lands some to acquire a partnership with lord willoughby in a vessel trading to america this vessel or another is among his assets recorded in his inventory  all his lands he sold—not that he was in debt he was a large lender—for purposes of profligacy  these proceedings gave rise to gossip  the laird must be selling his lands to evade forfeiture  he must have been engaged in the gowrie mystery  then logan dies july 1606  bower is also dead january 1606  it occurs to sprot that there is money in all this and having lost logan’s business the hungry sprot needs money  he therefore makes a pact with some of logan’s debtors he for pay will clear them of their debts to logan’s executors whom he will enable them to blackmail  logan’s descendants by two marriages were finally his heirs with anna a minor daughter of his last wife who had hoped to have no children by him the freespoken lady restalrig née ker marion  they of course were robbed by logan’s forfeiture of 33000 marks owed to logan by dunbar and balmerino  meanwhile just after logan’s death in autumn 1606 sprot forges letters i ii iii iv v and the torn letter with two compromising letters to bower two to ninian chirnside and an ‘eik’ or addition of compromising items to a memorandum on business which in september 1605 logan gave to bower and john bell before he started for london and paris  all these documents the plotletters i ii iii iv v and the rest which lie before me are mere instruments of blackmail intended to terrorise the guardians of the logans  so far all is clear  but in april 1608 sprot has blabbed and is arrested  the forgeries are found among his papers or given up by chirnside  sprot confesses to the plot to logan’s share of it and to the authenticity of the letters and papers  he is then tortured recants his confession and avows the forgery of the papers  the government is disappointed  in july dunbar comes down from town treats sprot leniently and gives him medical attendance  sprot now confesses to his genuine knowledge of the plot but unflinchingly maintains that all the papers so far produced are forgeries based on facts  why does he do this  he has a better chance of pardon if he returns to the statement that they are genuine  if they are the government which he must propitiate has a far stronger hand for the forgeries then defied detection  however for no conceivable reason unless it be either conscience or the vanity of the artist sprot now insists on claiming the letters as his own handiwork  on this point he was inaccessible to temptation if temptation was offered  if he lies as to letter ii having been dictated by logan he lies by way of relapse into the habit of a lifetime and so on other points  he keeps back all mention of letter iv till the last ember of hope of life is extinct  it has not been hitherto known either that sprot kept back letter iv till almost his dying day or that he then at last revealed it  lord cromarty’s averment that it was found in sprot’s kist was disbelieved it is true however and now we ask why did sprot keep back letter iv to the last and why having so long concealed it did he say where it was after all hope of life was over  the answer can only be conjectural  some might guess thus till letter iv was confessed to and found government had not received from sprot one scrap of documentary evidence that could be used against logan’s heirs scoundrel as he was sprot could not guess that the privy council would use papers which were confessed forgeries to save dunbar and balmerino from paying some 33000 marks to logan’s executors  the wretched sprot had robbed the orphans on a small scale but he would not by producing the genuine logan letter enable the lords to ruin them utterly  bad as he was the laird had been kind to sprot  therefore he kept back and by many a lie concealed his real pieces of evidence letter iv and i if i is genuine  so far he acted on a remnant of natural conscience  but sprot alas had a religious conscience  he had a soul to be saved the preachers had prayed with him  when death was but fortyeight hours distant he feared to die with a lie in his mouth  so now at last he spoke of letter iv as his real model  perhaps he hoped that it would not be found and probably it was in some secret drawer or false bottom of his kist  it was found and was used along with the confessed forgeries which even sprot could not have anticipated to destroy the inheritance of the children at logan’s posthumous trial in 1609  but the obvious reply to this hypothesis is that letter iv by the evidence of modern experts evidence unanimous and irresistible is just as much forged as all the rest is just as certainly in sprot’s imitation of logan’s handwriting  this being so why did sprot keep it back so long and why having kept it back did he almost in his last hour produce it and say if he did that it was genuine and his model as it certainly was  this is the last enigma of sprot  his motives defy my poor efforts to decipher them  even if the substance of iv is genuine what were sprot’s motives  i do not feel assured that sprot really maintained the genuineness of the handwriting of letter iv  his remark that he kept logan’s letter only till he forged others on it as a model certainly implies that he did not keep it after he had done his forgeries and therefore that our letter iv is confessedly not logan’s original  certainly it is not     xvi  what is letter iv   the crucial question now arises what is letter iv  if it be genuine in substance then whatever the details of the gowrie conspiracy may have been a conspiracy there was  this can only be denied by ignorance if the enterprise fails says the author of letter iv the plotters will lose their lives their lands and houses will be ‘wrecked’ their very names will be extirpated and in fact james did threaten to extirpate the name of ruthven  the letter deliberately means high treason  the objection of calderwood and of all the ruthven apologists that sprot confessed to having forged all the letters we have shown to rest on lack of information  he said at last that he had forged many papers some did not appear in court in 1609 and that he forged three letters on the model of letter iv  these three letters may either be i iii and v or iii v and the torn letter  the case of letter i is peculiar  though it contains much that is in letter iv and might have been taken from it the repetitions need not imply copying from letter iv  byron and others would say the same things on the same day to two or three correspondents  letter iv is subsequent as dated to letter i and logan might say to the unknown on july 18 what after the announced interval of ten days he said to gowrie  letter i contains this remark on the nature of the plot ‘it is not far by’ not unlike ‘that form with the like stratagem whereof we had conference in cap h’ which may be capheaton on the english side of the border  probably logan often discussed ingenious ways of catching the king new plots were hatched about once a month as cecil’s and the other correspondence of the age abundantly proves  the plot the letter says is like that in a paduan story of a nobleman  the rest of the letter is identical with the matter of iii iv and v  we cannot be sure whether letter i is one of the three forged on iv or not  one thing is certain letters iii and v to the unknown are modelled on iv as is the torn letter  sprot said this was the case and every reader of iii v and the torn letter given above must see that he tells the truth  these letters contain no invention at all they merely repeat letter iv  any man who could invent iv had genius enough to alter his tunes in iii v and the torn letter  but sprot never deserts his model  this is an argument for the authenticity in substance of letter iv  the other three contain nothing that is not in letter iv and everything that is in it except what is personal to gowrie and would be inappropriate if addressed to the unknown i iii v or to chirnside torn letter  there is 1 the mention of a paduan adventure the basis of the plot a thing that sprot is very unlikely to have invented  with all my admiration for sprot i do think that the paduan touch is beyond him this occurs in letter iv ‘the good sport that ma your lordship’s brother told me of a nobleman in padua  it is a parasteur’  à propos ‘to this purpose we have in hand’  this appears in letter i ‘reckless toys of padua’ and in letter v ‘bid m a remember on the sport he told me of padua’  2  the constant applause of bower  this is in letter iv and in i iii v and the torn letter  3  meeting with alexander ruthven  this is in iv and in i and v  4  the meeting at fastcastle which is to be quiet and wellprovisioned this is in iv and in i iii v  5  lord home and mr rhynd are to know nothing  this is in iv and in i and v and the torn letter utterly needless repetition  6  the king’s hunting the opportunity for the plot  this is in iv and in i but that is natural  7  directions as to returning the letters  these are in iv in i iii v and the torn letter  8  injunctions of secrecy  these are in iv and i iii v and in the torn letter  9  logan will be true ‘although the scaffold were already set up’ this is a phrase of letter iv and recurs in letter iii and in the torn letter  10  logan’s elevation of heart on receipt of gowrie’s letter  this occurs in iv and in v  who can doubt that letter iv is the source followed servilely by the forger of the torn letter and i  iii v  if sprot could invent the substance of iv why was he so chary of invention in all the other letters  it is clear moreover that the unknown himself is derived from a line in letter iv ‘i have already sent another letter to the gentleman your lordship knows as the bearer will inform you of his answer’  the bearer is always bower so the ‘gentleman’ is to be conceived as in gowrie’s neighbourhood or on the route thither as one bearer serves both for gowrie and the gentleman  therefore before july 5 sprot who had no idea as to who the gentleman was identified the ‘gentleman’ the unknown of i iii v with the laird of kinfauns near perth or with the constable of dundee but he withdrew these imputations craving the pardon of the accused  thus it stands to reason that i  iii v and the torn letter are forged on the model of iv  sprot introduces no novelties in i iii v or the torn epistle  he harps eternally on the strings of iv  the only variation is v the mention of ‘one other man with you’ in the proposed sail to fastcastle  it is not easy for criticism to evade the conclusion that i  iii v and the torn letter are indeed forgeries modelled on iv  and what is iv  is letter iv in substance genuine  if not why did sprot keep it back till the rope was noosed for his neck  a guess at his possible reasons for so keeping it back as the only real documentary evidence extant against the orphans of logan we have given but this fails if letter iv was a forgery as in handwriting it was  then there are the contents of letter iv  to myself and to mr anderson it does not seem probable it seems hardly credible that sprot could have invented the contents of letter iv  if he did his power of rendering character might have been envied by the author of the waverley novels  in iv logan is painted the ‘main loose man but a good fellow’ with a master hand  the thing is freely largely and spontaneously executed  what especially moves me to think iv no invention is the reference to the paduan incident or romance ‘the good sport that mr alexander told me of the nobleman of padua it is à propos to the purpose we have in hand’  this is casually inserted in the last words of the postscript not blazoned in the text as in the forgeries confessedly modelled on this letter  the whole tone of the letter is in keeping with the alleged author’s temperament  it is respectful but far from servile  gowrie is a great earl but logan is of an old and good name there is the genial sensualism of the man with his promise of wine and ‘a fine hattit kit’ a kind of syllabub  there is the joyous forward glance at an anniversary dinner with bothwell to which the king’s hunting of this year shall furnish the dainty cheer ‘hoc jocose’ at this dinner bothwell and gowrie old allies are to meet at logan’s board which may suggest that bothwell and gowrie are still working together  the contempt for lord home as a conspirator—‘in good faith he will never help his friend or harm his foe’—and the praises of bower are characteristic and here are in place elsewhere they are idle repetitions mere copies  the apology for bad writing—logan could not employ a secretary in this case—is natural the two days writing agrees with sprot’s evidence p 221  could sprot have invented all this and in his confessed forgeries failed to invent anything  would not the fertility of his genius have hurried him into fresh developments and characteristic details appropriate to the imaginary correspondent whom he addresses  these considerations may seem a mere leaning on ‘internal evidence’ and ‘literary instinct’ broken reeds  but the case is buttressed by the long and on any theory purposeless retention of letter iv the secrecy concerning it and the confession so obviously true that letter iv is the source and model of the forgeries  these facts have hitherto been unknown to writers who believed the whole correspondence to be a forgery done for the government  both mr anderson who has greatly aided me by his acuteness and learned experience of old mss and myself disbelieve that logan’s hand wrote letter iv  the matter the contents of letter iv may be logan’s but the existing document may be ‘a sprot after logan’  sprot may have reinserted the genuine logan iv among bower’s collection of papers pretended to find it and returned it to logan after copying it in logan’s hand  or he may have copied it in his ‘course hand’ the copy in the haddington mss and later in autumn 1606 after logan’s death have rewritten his copy in an imitation of logan’s hand  the contents mr anderson believes as i do are none the less genuine logan  if readers accept these conclusions there was a gowrie conspiracy and logan was in it  ‘i trow your lordship has a proof of my constancy already ere now’ he says in letter iv and gowrie may have had a proof in his early conspiracies of 1593–1594 or in a testimonial to logan from bothwell gowrie’s old ally  but if readers do not accept our conclusions they may still rest perhaps on the arguments adduced in the earlier chapters of this essay to demonstrate that neither accident nor the machinations of the king but an enterprise of their own caused the slaughter of the ruthvens the infamous conduct of the privy council in 1608–1609 does not prove that in 1600 the king carried out a conspiracy in itself impossible  i have found nothing tending to show that king james was ever made aware of sprot’s confessions of forgery  it is true that sir william hart the lord justice went to court after sprot’s death and in september the scottish privy council asked james to send him home again 239  but hart need not have told all the truth to james  there is a kind of rejoicing naïveté in all of james’s references to the gowrie affair which seems to me hardly consistent with his disbelief in his own prowess on that occasion  if one may conjecture one would guess that the privy council and the four preachers managed to persuade themselves sprot being the liar whom we know that he lied when he called his logan papers forgeries  the real facts may have been concealed from the king  mr gunton the librarian at hatfield informs me that had he not seen letter iv which he is sure was written by sprot he does not think he should have suspected the genuineness of letters ii and iii after comparing them with the undoubted letters of logan in the cecil manuscripts  the government and the four preachers with such documents in their hands documents still apt to delude may easily have brought themselves to disbelieve sprot’s assertion that they were all forgeries  let us hope that they did     xvii  inferences as to the casket letters   the affair of sprot has an obvious bearing on that other mystery the authenticity of the casket letters attributed to queen mary  as we know she though accused was never allowed to see the letters alleged to be hers  we know that in december 1568 these documents were laid before an assembly of english nobles at hampton court  they were compared for orthography and handwriting with genuine letters written by the queen to elizabeth and cecil tells us that ‘no difference was found’  it was a rapid examination by many persons on a brief winter day partly occupied by other business  if experts existed we are not informed that they were present  the casket letters have disappeared since the death of the elder gowrie in 1584  from him elizabeth had vainly sought to purchase them  they were indispensable said bowes her ambassador to ‘the secrecy of the cause’  gowrie would not be tempted and it is not improbable that he carried so valuable a treasure with him when in april 1584 he retired to dundee to escape by sea if the angus conspiracy failed  at dundee he was captured after defending the house in which he was residing  that house was pulled down recently nothing was discovered but fable runs that at the destruction of another ancient house in dundee ‘lady wark’s stairs’ a packet of old letters in french was found in a hiding hole contrived within a chimney  the letters were not examined by any competent person and nobody knows what became of them romance relates that they were the casket letters entrusted by gowrie to a friend  it is equally probable that he yielded them to the king when he procured his remission for the raid of ruthven  in any case they are lost  consequently we cannot compare the casket letters with genuine letters by mary  on the other hand as i chanced to notice that genuine letters of logan’s exist at hatfield i was enabled by the kindness of the marquis of salisbury and of sir stair agnew to have both the hatfield logan letters and the alleged logan letters produced in 1609 photographed and compared at hatfield and at the general register house in edinburgh  by good fortune the earl of haddington also possesses what we could not expect to find in the case of the casket letters documents in the ordinary handwriting of george sprot the confessed forger of the plotletters attributed to logan  the result of comparison has been to convince mr gunton at hatfield mr anderson in edinburgh professor hume brown and other gentlemen of experience that sprot forged all the plotletters  their reasons for holding this opinion entirely satisfy me and have been drawn up by mr anderson in a convincing report  to put the matter briefly the forged letters present the marked peculiarities of logan’s orthography noted by the witnesses in 1609 but they also contain many peculiarities of spelling which are not logan’s but are sprot’s  the very dotting of the ‘i’s’ is sprot’s not logan’s  the long ‘s’ of logan is heavily and clumsily imitated  there is a distinct set of peculiarities never found in logan’s undisputed letters in sprot’s own letters always found  the hand is more rapid and flowing than that of logan  not being myself familiar with the scottish handwriting of the period my own opinion is of no weight but i conceive that the general effect of logan’s hand in 1586 is not precisely like that of the plotletters  my point however is that in 1609 sprot’s forgeries were clever enough to baffle witnesses of unblemished honour very familiar with the genuine handwriting of logan  the rev alexander watson minister of the kirk of coldinghame where logan was wont to attend alleged that ‘the character of every letter resembles perfectly robert’s handwrit every way’  the spelling which was peculiar was also logan’s as a rule mr watson produced three genuine letters by logan before the lords of the articles who were very sceptical and satisfied them that the plotletters were the laird’s  mr alexander smith minister of chirnside was tutor to logan’s younger children he gave identical evidence  sir john arnott provost of edinburgh a man of distinction and eminence produced four genuine letters by the laird ‘agreeing perfectly in spelling and character with the plotletters  the sheriff clerk of berwick william home in aytoun mill a guest i think at logan’s ‘great yules’ and john home notary in eyemouth coincided the minister of aytoun mr william hogg produced a letter of logan to the laird of aytoun but was not absolutely so certain as the other witnesses  ‘he thinks them’ the plotletters ‘like to be his writing and that the same appear to be very like his write by the conformity of letters and spelling’ 243a  thus at the examination of logan’s real and forged letters as at the examination of queen mary’s real and casket letters in spelling and handwriting ‘no difference was found’  yet the plotletters were all forged and mr anderson shows that though ‘no difference was found’ many differences existed  logan had a better chance of acquittal than mary  the lords of the articles writes sir thomas hamilton to the king june 21 1609 ‘had preconceived hard opinions of restalrig’s process’ 243b  yet they were convinced by the evidence of the witnesses and by their own eyes  from the error of the lords of the articles in 1609 it obviously follows that the english lords at hampton court in 1568 may have been unable to detect proofs of forgery in the casket letters which if the casket letters could now be compared with those of mary would be at once discovered by modern experts  in short the evidence as to mary’s handwriting even if as unanimously accepted by the english lords as cecil declares is not worth a ‘hardhead’ a debased copper scottish coin  it is worth no more than the opinion of the lords of the articles in the case of the letters attributed to restalrig     appendices   appendix a  the frontispiece   gowrie’s arms and ambitions  the frontispiece of this volume is copied from the design of the earl of gowrie’s arms in what is called ‘workman’s ms’ at the lyon’s office in edinburgh  the shield displays within the royal treasure the arms of ruthven in the first and fourth those of cameron and halyburton in the second and third quarters  the supporters are dexter a goat sinister a ram the crest is a ram’s head  the motto is not given it was deid schaw  the shield is blotted by transverse strokes of the pen the whole rude design having been made for the purpose of being thus scored out after gowrie’s death posthumous trial and forfeiture in 1600  on the left of the sinister supporter is an armed man in the gowrie livery  his left hand grasps his swordhilt his right is raised to an imperial crown hanging above him in the air from his lips issue the words tibi soli ‘for thee alone’  sir james balfour paul lyon informs me that he knows no other case of such additional supporter or whatever the figure ought to be called  this figure does not occur on any known ruthven seal  it is not on that of the first earl of gowrie affixed to a deed of february 1583–1584  it is not on a seal used in 1597 by john third earl given in henry laing’s ‘catalogue of scottish seals’ vol i under ‘ruthven’  but in crawford’s ‘peerage of scotland’ 1716 p 166 the writer gives the arms of the third earl john the victim of august 5 1600  in place of the traditional scottish motto deid schaw is the latin translation facta probant  the writer says note c ‘this from an authentic copy of his arms richly illuminated in the year 1597 with his name and titles viz “joannes ruthven comes de gowry dominus de ruthven” c in my hands’  in 1597 as the archives of the faculty of law in the university of padua show gowrie was a student of padua  it is also probable that in 1597 he attained his majority  he certainly had his arms richly illuminated and he added to his ancestral bearings what crawfurd describes thus ‘on the dexter a chivaleer garnish’d with the earl’s coat of arms pointing with a sword upward to an imperial crown with this device tibi soli’  in workman’s ms the figure points to the crown with the open right hand and the left hand is on the swordhilt  the illuminated copy of 1597 once in the possession of crawfurd must be the more authentic the figure here points the sword at a crown which is tibi soli ‘for thee’ gowrie ‘alone’  now on no known ruthven seal as we saw does this figure appear not even on a seal of gowrie himself used in 1597  thus it is perhaps not too daring to suppose that gowrie when in italy in 1597 added this emblematic figure to his ancestral bearings  what does the figure symbolise  on this point we have a very curious piece of evidence  on june 22 1609 ottavio baldi wrote from venice to james now king of england his letter was forwarded by sir henry wotton  baldi says that he has received from sir robert douglas and is sending to the king by his nephew—a cambridge student—‘a strange relique out of this country’  he obtained it thus sir robert douglas while at home in scotland had ‘heard speech’ of ‘a certain emblem or impresa’ left by gowrie in padua meeting a scot in padua douglas asked where this emblem now was and he was directed to the school of a teacher of dancing  there the emblem hung ‘among other devices and remembrances of his scholars’  douglas had a copy of the emblem made and immediately ‘acquainted me with the quality of the thing’ says baldi  ‘we agreed together that it should be fit if possible to obtain the very original itself and to leave in the room thereof the copy that he had already taken which he did effect by well handling the matter  ‘thus hath your majesty now a view in umbra of those detestable thoughts which afterwards appeared in facto according to the said earl’s own mot  for what other sense or allusion can the reaching at a crown with a sword in a stretched posture and the impersonating of his device in a blackamore yield to any intelligent and honest beholder’ 247  from baldi’s letter we learn that in the device left by gowrie at padua the figure pointing a sword at the crown was a negro thus varying from the figure in workman’s ms and that in the illuminated copy emblazoned in 1597 and possessed in 1716 by crawfurd  next we learn that sir robert douglas had heard talk of this emblem in scotland before he left for italy  lastly a mot on the subject by the earl himself was reported to the effect that the device set forth ‘in a shadow’ what was intended to be executed ‘in very deed’  now how could sir robert douglas in scotland hear talk of what had been done and said years ago by gowrie in padua  sir robert douglas was descended from archibald douglas of glenbervie ob 1570 who was ancestor of the catholic earl of angus flor 1596  this archibald of glenbervie had a son archibald named in his father’s testament but otherwise unknown 248  rather senior to gowrie at the university of padua and in the same faculty of law was an archibald douglas  he may have been a kinsman of sir robert douglas himself of the glenbervie family and from him sir robert while still in scotland may have heard of gowrie’s device left by him at padua and of his mot about in umbra and in facto  but even if these two douglases were not akin or did not meet still keith lindsay and ker of newbattle all contemporaries of gowrie at padua might bring home the report of gowrie’s enigmatic device and of his mot thereanent  had the emblem been part of the regular arms of ruthven sir robert douglas and every scot of quality would have known all about it and seen no mystery in it  it will scarcely be denied that the assumption by gowrie of the figure in his livery pointing a sword at the crown and exclaiming ‘for thee only’ does suggest that wildly ambitious notions were in the young man’s mind  what other sense can the emblem bear  how can such ideas be explained  in an anonymous and dateless ms cited in ‘the life of john earl of gowrie’ by the rev john scott of perth 1818 it is alleged that elizabeth in april 1600 granted to gowrie then in london the guard and honours appropriate to a prince of wales  the same mr scott suggests a royal pedigree for gowrie  his mother wife of william first earl was dorothea stewart described in a list of scottish nobles 1592 as ‘sister of umquhile lord methven’  now henry stewart lord methven ‘lord muffin’ as henry viii used to call him was the third husband of the sister of henry viii margaret tudor wife first of james iv then of the earl of angus by whom she had margaret countess of lennox and grandmother of james vi then of lord methven  now if margaret tudor had issue by henry stewart lord methven and if that issue was dorothea mother of john third earl of gowrie or was dorothea’s father or mother that earl was elizabeth’s cousin  now burnet touching on the gowrie mystery says that his own father had ‘taken great pains to inquire into that matter and did always believe it was a real conspiracy     upon the king’s death gowrie stood next to the succession of the crown of england’ namely as descended from margaret tudor by henry burnet says ‘francis’ lord methven  margaret and methven says burnet had a son ‘made lord methven by james v  in the patent he is called frater noster uterinus’—‘our brother uterine’  ‘he had only a daughter who was mother or grandmother to the earl of gowrie so that by this he might be glad to put the king out of the way that so he might stand next to the succession of the crown of england’ 249  if this were true the meaning of gowrie’s device would be flagrantly conspicuous  but where is that patent of james v  burnet conceivably speaks of it on the information of his father who ‘took great pains to inquire into the particulars of that matter’ so that he could tell his son ‘one thing which none of the historians have taken any notice of’ namely our gowrie’s tudor descent and his claims failing james and his issue to the crown of england  now burnet’s father was almost a contemporary of the gowrie affair  of the preachers of that period the king’s enemies burnet’s father knew mr davidson ob 1603 and mr robert bruce and had listened to their prophecies  ‘he told me’ says burnet ‘of many of their predictions that he himself heard them throw out which had no effect’  davidson was an old man in 1600 bruce for his disbelief in james’s account of the conspiracy was suspended in that year though he lived till 1631 and doubtless prophesied in select circles  mr bruce long lay concealed in the house of burnet’s greatgrandmother daughter of sir john arnot a witness in the trial of logan of restalrig  thus burnet’s father had every means of knowing the belief of the contemporaries of gowrie and he may conceivably be burnet’s source for the tale of gowrie’s tudor descent and royal claims  they were almost or rather quite baseless but they were current  in fact dorothea stewart mother of gowrie was certainly a daughter of henry stewart lord methven and of janet stewart of the house of atholl  we find no trace of issue born to margaret tudor by her third husband lord methven  yet gowrie’s emblem adopted by him at padua in 1597 and his device left in the paduan dancing school do distinctly point to some wild idea of his that some crown or other was ‘for him alone’  at the trial of gowrie’s father in 1584 we find mention of his ‘challenginge that honor to be of his hignes blud’ but that must refer to the relationship of the ruthvens and the king through the angus branch of the douglases 250a  this question as to the meaning of gowrie’s emblem came rather early into the controversy  william sanderson in 1656 published lives of mary and of james vi he says ‘i have a manuscript which relates that in padua the earl of gowrie among other impressa sic in a fencing school caused to be painted for his devise a hand and sword aiming at a crown’ 250b  mr scott in 1818 replied that the device with the ruthven arms ‘is engraven on a stone taken from gowrie house in perth and preserved in the house of freeland’ a ruthven house  ‘there is also i have been told a seal with the same engraving upon it which probably had been used by the earls of gowrie and by their predecessors the lords of ruthven’ 251a  but we know of no such seal among gowrie or ruthven seals nor do we know the date of the engraving on stone cited by mr scott  in his opinion the armed man and crown might be an addition granted by james iii to william first lord ruthven in 1487–88 ruthven took the part of the unhappy king who was mysteriously slain near bannockburn  mr scott then guesses that this addition of 1488 implied that the armed man pointed his sword at the crown and exclaimed tibi soli meaning ‘for thee o james iii alone not for thy rebellious son’ james iv  it may be so but we have no evidence for the use of the emblem before 1597  moreover in gowrie’s arms in workman’s ms the sword is sheathed  again the emblem at padua showed a ‘blackamore’ or negro and sir robert douglas could not but have recognised that the device was only part of the ancestral ruthven arms if that was the case  the ‘blackamore’ was horrifying to ottavio baldi as implying a dark intention  here we leave the additional and certainly curious mystery of gowrie’s claims as ‘shadowed’ in his chosen emblem  i know not if it be germane to the matter to add that after bothwell in 1593 had seized james by the aid of our gowrie’s mother and sister he uttered a singular hint to toby matthew dean of durham  he intruded himself on the horrified dean hot from his successful raid described with much humour the kidnapping of the untrussed monarch and let it be understood that he was under the protection of elizabeth that there was a secret candidate for james’s crown and that he expected to be himself lieutenant of the realm of scotland  bothwell was closely lié with lady gowrie dorothea stewart and our gowrie presently joined him in a ‘band’ to serve elizabeth and subdue james 251b    appendix b the contemporary ruthven vindication   state papers scotland elizabeth vol lxvi  no 52  the verie maner

slain  mr bisset’s theory was that henderson had never been in the turret during the crisis but had entered the dark staircase from a door of the dininghall on the first floor  such a door existed according to lord hailes but when he wrote 1757 no traces of this arrangement were extant  if such a door there was henderson may have slunk into the hall out of the dark staircase and slipped forth

in 1599–1600 to call gowrie home  in a brief account of his own life dictated by himself at about the age of seventy 1624 he says ‘i was in france for the calling of the master’ he clearly means earl ‘of gowrie’ wodrow’s ‘life of the rev robert bruce’ p 10 1843  calderwood possessed and wodrow circ 1715 acquired two ‘meditations’ by mr bruce of august 3 4 1600  wodrow promises to print them but does not and when his book was edited in 1843 they could not be found  he says that ‘mr bruce appears to have been prepared in providence’ for his gowrie troubles judging apparently by these ‘meditations’  but mr henry paton has searched for and found the lost ‘meditations’ in ms which are mere spiritual outpourings  wodrow’s meaning is therefore obscure  mr bruce had great celebrity as a prophet but where wodrow found prophecy in the ‘meditations’ of august 3 4 1600 is not apparent wodrow’s ‘bruce’ pp 83 84  wodrow mss advocates’ library vol xliv no 35  111  calderwood vi 49 66–76

by calderwood that ‘while the earl was in strathbraan fifteen days before the fact’ say july 20 ‘the king wrote sundry letters to the earl desiring him to come and hunt with him in the wood of falkland which letters were found in my lord’s pocket as is reported but were destroyed’  mr barbé then proves that letters were sent to gowrie and atholl in the last days of july  it is certain that a letter was sent to gowrie about july 20 possibly a sporting invitation not that there was any harm in an invitation to join a hunting party  james is next accused of ‘trying to stifle the rumour’ about this ‘letter’ by a direct denial  this means that craigengelt gowrie’s caterer was asked whether he knew of any man or boy who came to gowrie from court and said that he did not a negative reply supposed to have been elicited by the torture to which craigengelt was certainly subjected  we only know that at the end of july letters were sent to gowrie to inchaffray to atholl and to ruthven  whether his reached gowrie or not and what it contained we cannot know  137  privy council register vi 194  140a  cf p 110 note  140b  border calendar i 491  142  tragedy of gowrie house pp 29 31  147

edinburgh  164  the evidence for all that occurred to sprot between april and july 1608 is that of a manuscript history of the kirk of scotland now in the advocates’ library  it is written in an early seventeenthcentury hand  calderwood follows it almost textually up to a certain point where the author of the ms history says that sprot on the scaffold declared that he had no promise of benefit to his family  but calderwood declares or says that others declare that sprot was really condemned as a forger which is untrue but confessed to the gowrie conspiracy in return for boons to his wife and children  we have of course no evidence that anything was done by government or by any one for mrs sprot and the children  the author of the ms which calderwood used as he pleased avers that sprot denied on the scaffold the fact that he had any promise  neither draft nor official account confirms the ms history on the point of no promise  the official draft of his last moments from its interlineations each signed by the clerk of council appears to have been drawn up on the spot or hurriedly as soon as sprot was dead  this is the aspect of the draft of the account the official printed account says that there was ‘no place of writing on the scaffold in respect of the press and multitude of people’ pitcairn ii 261  169  vol ii pp 282–7  170  letter i is a peculiar case and
