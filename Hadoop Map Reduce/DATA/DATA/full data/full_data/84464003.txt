desert gold     d e s e r t  g o l d    prologue   i  a face haunted camerona womans face  it was there in the white heart of the dying campfire it hung in the shadows that hovered over the flickering light it drifted in the darkness beyond  this hour when the day had closed and the lonely desert night set in with its dead silence was one in which camerons mind was thronged with memories of a time long pastof a home back in peoria of a woman he had wronged and lost and loved too late  he was a prospector for gold a hunter of solitude a lover of the drear rockribbed infinitude because he wanted to be alone to remember  a sound disturbed camerons reflections  he bent his head listening a soft wind fanned the paling embers blew sparks and white ashes and thin smoke away into the enshrouding circle of blackness  his burro did not appear to be moving about  the quiet split to the cry of a coyote  it rose strange wild mournfulnot the howl of a prowling upland beast baying the campfire or barking at a lonely prospector but the wail of a wolf fullvoiced crying out the meaning of the desert and the night  hunger throbbed in ithunger for a mate for offspring for life  when it ceased the terrible desert silence smote cameron and the cry echoed in his soul he and that wandering wolf were brothers  then a sharp clink of metal on stone and soft pads of hoofs in sand prompted cameron to reach for his gun and to move out of the light of the waning campfire  he was somewhere along the wild border line between sonora and arizona and the prospector who dared the heat and barrenness of that region risked other dangers sometimes as menacing  figures darker than the gloom approached and took shape and in the light turned out to be those of a white man and a heavily packed burro  hello there the man called as he came to a halt and gazed about him  i saw your fire  may i make camp here  cameron came forth out of the shadow and greeted his visitor whom he took for a prospector like himself  cameron resented the breaking of his lonely campfire vigil but he respected the law of the desert  the stranger thanked him and then slipped the pack from his burro then he rolled out his pack and began preparations for a meal his movements were slow and methodical  cameron watched him still with resentment yet with a curious and growing interest  the campfire burst into a bright blaze and by its light cameron saw a man whose gray hair somehow did not seem to make him old and whose stooped shoulders did not detract from an impression of rugged strength  find any mineral asked cameron presently  his visitor looked up quickly as if startled by the sound of a human voice  he replied and then the two men talked a little but the stranger evidently preferred silence  cameron understood that  he laughed grimly and bent a keener gaze upon the furrowed shadowy face another of those strange desert prospectors in whom there was some relentless driving power besides the lust for gold cameron felt that between this man and himself there was a subtle affinity vague and undefined perhaps born of the divination that here was a desert wanderer like himself perhaps born of a deeper an unintelligible relation having its roots back in the past  a longforgotten sensation stirred in camerons breast one so long forgotten that he could not recognize it  but it was akin to pain    ii  when he awakened he found to his surprise that his companion had departed  a trail in the sand led off to the north  there was no water in that direction  cameron shrugged his shoulders it was not his affair he had his own problems  and straightway he forgot his strange visitor  cameron began his day grateful for the solitude that was now unbroken for the canyonfurrowed and cactusspired scene that now showed no sign of life  he traveled southwest never straying far from the dry stream bed and in a desultory way without eagerness he hunted for signs of gold  the work was toilsome yet the periods of rest in which he indulged were not taken because of fatigue  he rested to look to listen to feel  what the vast silent world meant to him had always been a mystical thing which he felt in all its incalculable power but never understood  that day while it was yet light and he was digging in a moist whitebordered wash for water he was brought sharply up by hearing the crack of hard hoofs on stone  there down the canyon came a man and a burro  cameron recognized them  hello friend called the man halting  our trails crossed again thats good  hello replied cameron slowly  any mineral sign today  no  they made camp together ate their frugal meal smoked a pipe and rolled in their blankets without exchanging many words  in the morning the same reticence the same aloofness characterized the manner of both  but camerons companion when he had packed his burro and was ready to start faced about and said  we might stay together if its all right with you  i never take a partner replied cameron  youre alone im alone said the other mildly  its a big place if we find gold therell be enough for two  i dont go down into the desert for gold alone rejoined cameron with a chill note in his swift reply  his companions deepset luminous eyes emitted a singular flash it moved cameron to say that in the years of his wandering he had met no man who could endure equally with him the blasting heat the blinding dust storms the wilderness of sand and rock and lava and cactus the terrible silence and desolation of the desert cameron waved a hand toward the wide shimmering shadowy descent of plain and range  i may strike through the sonora desert  i may head for pinacate or north for the colorado basin  you are an old man  i dont know the country but to me one place is the same as another replied his companion  for moments he seemed to forget himself and swept his farreaching gaze out over the colored gulf of stone and sand  then with gentle slaps he drove his burro in behind cameron yes im old  im lonely too  its come to me just lately  but friend i can still travel and for a few days my company wont hurt you  have it your way said cameron  they began a slow march down into the desert  at sunset they camped under the lee of a low mesa  cameron was glad his comrade had the indian habit of silence  another days travel found the prospectors deep in the wilderness  then there came a breaking of reserve noticeable in the elder man almost imperceptibly gradual in cameron beside the meager mesquite campfire this grayfaced thoughtful old prospector would remove his black pipe from his mouth to talk a little and cameron would listen and sometimes unlock his lips to speak a word  and so as cameron began to respond to the influence of a desert less lonely than habitual he began to take keener note of his comrade and found him different from any other he had ever encountered in the wilderness this man never grumbled at the heat the glare the driving sand the sour water the scant fare  during the daylight hours he was seldom idle  at night he sat dreaming before the fire or paced to and fro in the gloom  he slept but little and that long after cameron had had his own rest  he was tireless patient brooding  camerons awakened interest brought home to him the realization that for years he had shunned companionship  in those years only three men had wandered into the desert with him and these had left their bones to bleach in the shifting sands  cameron had not cared to know their secrets  but the more he studied this latest comrade the more he began to suspect that he might have missed something in the others  in his own driving passion to take his secret into the limitless abode of silence and desolation where he could be alone with it he had forgotten that life dealt shocks to other men  somehow this silent comrade reminded him  one afternoon late after they had toiled up a white winding wash of sand and gravel they came upon a dry waterhole  cameron dug deep into the sand but without avail  he was turning to retrace weary steps back to the last water when his comrade asked him to wait  cameron watched him search in his pack and bring forth what appeared to be a small forked branch of a peach tree  he grasped the prongs of the fork and held them before him with the end standing straight out and then he began to walk along the stream bed  cameron at first amused then amazed then pitying and at last curious kept pace with the prospector  he saw a strong tension of his comrades wrists as if he was holding hard against a considerable force  the end of the peach branch began to quiver and turn  cameron reached out a hand to touch it and was astounded at feeling a powerful vibrant force pulling the branch downward  he felt it as a magnetic shock  the branch kept turning and at length pointed to the ground  dig here said the prospector  what ejaculated cameron  had the man lost his mind  then cameron stood by while his comrade dug in the sand  three feet he dugfourfive and the sand grew dark then moist  at six feet water began to seep through  get the little basket in my pack he said  cameron complied and saw his comrade drop the basket into the deep hole where it kept the sides from caving in and allowed the water to seep through  while cameron watched the basket filled  of all the strange incidents of his desert career this was the strangest curiously he picked up the peach branch and held it as he had seen it held  the thing however was dead in his hands  i see you havent got it remarked his comrade  few men have  got what demanded cameron  a power to find water that way  back in illinois an old german used to do that to locate wells  he showed me i had the same power i cant explain  but you neednt look so dumfounded  theres nothing supernatural about it  you mean its a simple factthat some men have a magnetism a force or power to find water as you did  yes  its not unusual on the farms back in illinois ohio pennsylvania  the old german i spoke of made money traveling round with his peach fork  what a gift for a man in the desert  camerons comrade smiledthe second time in all those days  they entered a region where mineral abounded and their march became slower  generally they took the course of a wash one on each side and let the burros travel leisurely along nipping at the bleached blades of scant grass or at sage or cactus while they searched in the canyons and under the ledges for signs of gold  when they found any rock that hinted of gold they picked off a piece and gave it a chemical test  the search was fascinating  they interspersed the work with long restful moments when they looked afar down the vast reaches and smoky shingles to the line of dim mountains some impelling desire not all the lure of gold took them to the top of mesas and escarpments and here when they had dug and picked they rested and gazed out at the wide prospect  then as the sun lost its heat and sank lowering to dent its red disk behind fardistant spurs they halted in a shady canyon or likely spot in a dry wash and tried for water  when they found it they unpacked gave drink to the tired burros and turned them loose  dead mesquite served for the campfire  while the strange twilight deepened into weird night they sat propped against stones with eyes on the dying embers of the fire and soon they lay on the sand with the light of white stars on their dark faces  each succeeding day and night cameron felt himself more and more drawn to this strange man  he found that after hours of burning toil he had insensibly grown nearer to his comrade  he reflected that after a few weeks in the desert he had always become a different man in civilization in the rough mining camps he had been a prey to unrest and gloom  but once down on the great billowing sweep of this lonely world he could look into his unquiet soul without bitterness did not the desert magnify men  cameron believed that wild men in wild places fighting cold heat starvation thirst barrenness facing the elements in all their ferocity usually retrograded descended to the savage lost all heart and soul and became mere brutes  likewise he believed that men wandering or lost in the wilderness often reversed that brutal order of life and became noble wonderful superhuman  so now he did not marvel at a slow stir stealing warmer along his veins and at the premonition that perhaps he and this man alone on the desert driven there by lifes mysterious and remorseless motive were to see each other through gods eyes  his companion was one who thought of himself last  it humiliated cameron that in spite of growing keenness he could not hinder him from doing more than an equal share of the days work  the man was mild gentle quiet mostly silent yet under all his softness he seemed to be made of the fiber of steel  cameron could not thwart him moreover he appeared to want to find gold for cameron not for himself  camerons hands always trembled at the turning of rock that promised gold he had enough of the prospectors passion for fortune to thrill at the chance of a strike  but the other never showed the least trace of excitement  one night they were encamped at the head of a canyon  the day had been exceedingly hot and long after sundown the radiation of heat from the rocks persisted  a desert bird whistled a wild melancholy note from a dark cliff and a distant coyote wailed mournfully the stars shone white until the huge moon rose to burn out all their whiteness  and on this night cameron watched his comrade and yielded to interest he had not heretofore voiced  pardner what drives you into the desert  do i seem to be a driven man  no but i feel it  do you come to forget  yes  ah softly exclaimed cameron  always he seemed to have known that he said no more  he watched the old man rise and begin his nightly pace to and fro up and down  with slow soft tread forward and back tirelessly and ceaselessly he paced that beat he did not look up at the stars or follow the radiant track of the moon along the canyon ramparts  he hung his head  he was lost in another world  it was a world which the lonely desert made real he looked a dark sad plodding figure and somehow impressed cameron with the helplessness of men  cameron grew acutely conscious of the pang in his own breast of the fire in his heart the strife and torment of his passiondriven soul he had come into the desert to remember a woman  she appeared to him then as she had looked when first she entered his lifea goldenhaired girl blueeyed whiteskinned redlipped tall and slender and beautiful he had never forgotten and an old sickening remorse knocked at his heart  he rose and climbed out of the canyon and to the top of a mesa where he paced to and fro and looked down into the weird and mystic shadows like the darkness of his passion and farther on down the moon track and the glittering stretches that vanished in the cold blue horizon  the moon soared radiant and calm the white stars shone serene  the vault of heaven seemed illimitable and divine  the desert surrounded him silverstreaked and blackmantled a chaos of rock and sand silent austere ancient always waiting  it spoke to cameron  it was a naked corpse but it had a soul  in that wild solitude the white stars looked down upon him pitilessly and pityingly they had shone upon a desert that might once have been alive and was now dead and might again throb with life only to die  it was a terrible ordeal for him to stand alone and realize that he was only a man facing eternity  but that was what gave him strength to endure somehow he was a part of it all some atom in that vastness somehow necessary to an inscrutable purpose something indestructible in that desolate world of ruin and death and decay something perishable and changeable and growing under all the fixity of heaven  in that endless silent hall of desert there was a spirit and cameron felt hovering near him what he imagined to be phantoms of peace  he returned to camp and sought his comrade  i reckon were two of a kind he said  it was a woman who drove me into the desert  but i come to remember  the deserts the only place i can do that  was she your wife asked the elder man  no  a long silence ensued  a cool wind blew up the canyon sifting the sand through the dry sage driving away the last of the lingering heat the campfire wore down to a ruddy ashen heap  i had a daughter said camerons comrade  she lost her mother at birth  and ii didnt know how to bring up a girl  she was pretty and gay  it was thethe old story  his words were peculiarly significant to cameron  they distressed him he had been wrapped up in his remorse  if ever in the past he had thought of any one connected with the girl he had wronged he had long forgotten  but the consequences of such wrong were farreaching  they struck at the roots of a home  here in the desert he was confronted by the spectacle of a splendid man a father wasting his life because he could not forgetbecause there was nothing left to live for  cameron understood better now why his comrade was drawn by the desert  well tell me more asked cameron earnestly  it was the old old story  my girl was pretty and free  the young bucks ran after her  i guess she did not run away from them and i was away a good dealworking in another town  she was in love with a wild fellow  i knew nothing of it till too late  he was engaged to marry her but he didnt come back  and when the disgrace became plain to all my girl left home  she went west  after a while i heard from her  she was wellworkingliving for her baby  a long time passed i had no ties  i drifted west  her lover had also gone west  in those days everybody went west  i trailed him intending to kill him but i lost his trail  neither could i find any trace of her  she had moved on driven no doubt by the hound of her past  since then i have taken to the wilds hunting gold on the desert  yes its the old old story only sadder i think said cameron and his voice was strained and unnatural  pardner what illinois town was it you hailed from  peoria  and youryour name went on cameron huskily  warrenjonas warren  that name might as well have been a bullet  cameron stood erect motionless as men sometimes stand momentarily when shot straight through the heart  in an instant when thoughts resurged like blinding flashes of lightning through his mind he was a swaying quivering terrorstricken man  he mumbled something hoarsely and backed into the shadow  but he need not have feared discovery however surely his agitation might have betrayed him  warren sat brooding over the campfire oblivious of his comrade absorbed in the past  cameron swiftly walked away in the gloom with the blood thrumming thick in his ears whispering over and over  merciful god  nell was his daughter    iii  as thought and feeling multiplied cameron was overwhelmed  beyond belief indeed was it that out of the millions of men in the world two who had never seen each other could have been driven into the desert by memory of the same woman  it brought the past so close  it showed cameron how inevitably all his spiritual life was governed by what had happened long ago  that which made life significant to him was a wandering in silent places where no eye could see him with his secret some fateful chance had thrown him with the father of the girl he had wrecked it was incomprehensible it was terrible  it was the one thing of all possible happenings in the world of chance that both father and lover would have found unendurable  camerons pain reached to despair when he felt this relation between warren and himself  something within him cried out to him to reveal his identity  warren would kill him but it was not fear of death that put cameron on the rack  he had faced death too often to be afraid it was the thought of adding torture to this longsuffering man  all at once cameron swore that he would not augment warrens trouble or let him stain his hands with blood  he would tell the truth of nells sad story and his own and make what amends he could  then camerons thought shifted from father to daughter  she was somewhere beyond the dim horizon line  in those past lonely hours by the campfire his fancy had tortured him with pictures of nell but his remorseful and cruel fancy had lied to him  nell had struggled upward out of menacing depths  she had reconstructed a broken life  and now she was fighting for the name and happiness of her child  little nell cameron experienced a shuddering ripple in all his beingthe physical rack of an emotion born of a new and strange consciousness  as cameron gazed out over the bloodred darkening desert suddenly the strife in his soul ceased  the moment was one of incalculable change in which his eyes seemed to pierce the vastness of cloud and range and mystery of gloom and shadowto see with strong vision the illimitable space before him  he felt the grandeur of the desert its simplicity its truth  he had learned at last the lesson it taught  no longer strange was his meeting and wandering with warren each had marched in the steps of destiny and as the lines of their fates had been inextricably tangled in the years that were gone so now their steps had crossed and turned them toward one common goal  for years they had been two men marching alone answering to an inward driving search and the desert had brought them together for years they had wandered alone in silence and solitude where the sun burned white all day and the stars burned white all night blindly following the whisper of a spirit  but now cameron knew that he was no longer blind and in this flash of revelation he felt that it had been given him to help warren with his burden  he returned to camp trying to evolve a plan  as always at that long hour when the afterglow of sunset lingered in the west warren plodded to and fro in the gloom  all night cameron lay awake thinking  in the morning when warren brought the burros to camp and began preparations for the usual packing cameron broke silence  pardner your story last night made me think  i want to tell you something about myself  its hard enough to be driven by sorrow for one youve loved as youve been driven but to suffer sleepless and eternal remorse for the ruin of one youve loved as i have sufferedthat is hell  listen  in my younger daysit seems long now yet its not so many yearsi was wild  i wronged the sweetest and loveliest girl i ever knew  i went away not dreaming that any disgrace might come to her  along about that time i fell into terrible moodsi changedi learned i really loved her  then came a letter i should have gotten months before  it told of her troubleimportuned me to hurry to save her  half frantic with shame and fear i got a marriage certificate and rushed back to her town she was gonehad been gone for weeks and her disgrace was known friends warned me to keep out of reach of her father  i trailed herfound her  i married her  but too late she would not live with me she left mei followed her west but never found her  warren leaned forward a little and looked into camerons eyes as if searching there for the repentance that might make him less deserving of a mans scorn  cameron met the gaze unflinchingly and again began to speak  you know of course how men out here somehow lose old names old identities  it wont surprise you much to learn my name really isnt cameron as i once told you  warren stiffened upright  it seemed that there might have been a blank a suspension between his grave interest and some strange mood to come  cameron felt his heart bulge and contract in his breast all his body grew cold and it took tremendous effort for him to make his lips form words  warren im the man youre hunting  im burton  i was nells lover  the old man rose and towered over cameron and then plunged down upon him and clutched at his throat with terrible stifling hands the harsh contact the pain awakened cameron to his peril before it was too late desperate fighting saved him from being hurled to the ground and stamped and crushed  warren seemed a maddened giant  there was a reeling swaying wrestling struggle before the elder man began to weaken  the cameron buffeted bloody halfstunned panted for speech  warrenhold on  give mea minute  i married nell  didnt you know that i saved the child  cameron felt the shock that vibrated through warren  he repeated the words again and again  as if compelled by some resistless power warren released cameron and staggering back stood with uplifted shaking hands  in his face was a horrible darkness  warren  waitlisten panted cameron  ive got that marriage certificateive had it by me all these years  i kept itto prove to myself i did right  the old man uttered a broken cry  cameron stole off among the rocks  how long he absented himself or what he did he had no idea  when he returned warren was sitting before the campfire and once more he appeared composed  he spoke and his voice had a deeper note but otherwise he seemed as usual  they packed the burros and faced the north together  cameron experienced a singular exaltation  he had lightened his comrades burden  wonderfully it came to him that he had also lightened his own  from that hour it was not torment to think of nell walking with his comrade through the silent places lying beside him under the serene luminous light of the stars cameron began to feel the haunting presence of invisible things that were real to himphantoms whispering peace  in the moan of the cool wind in the silken seep of sifting sand in the distant rumble of a slipping ledge in the faint rush of a shooting star he heard these phantoms of peace coming with whispers of the long pain of men at the last made endurable  even in the white noonday under the burning sun these phantoms came to be real to him in the dead silence of the midnight hours he heard them breathing nearer on the desert windnatures voices of motherhood whispers of god peace in the solitude    iv  there came a morning when the sun shone angry and red through a dull smoky haze  were in for sandstorms said cameron  they had scarcely covered a mile when a desertwide moaning yellow wall of flying sand swooped down upon them  seeking shelter in the lee of a rock they waited hoping the storm was only a squall such as frequently whipped across the open places  the moan increased to a roar and the dull red slowly dimmed to disappear in the yellow pall and the air grew thick and dark  warren slipped the packs from the burros  cameron feared the sandstorms had arrived some weeks ahead of their usual season  the men covered their heads and patiently waited  the long hours dragged and the storm increased in fury  cameron and warren wet scarfs with water from their canteens and bound them round their faces and then covered their heads  the steady hollow bellow of flying sand went on  it flew so thickly that enough sifted down under the shelving rock to weight the blankets and almost bury the men  they were frequently compelled to shake off the sand to keep from being borne to the ground  and it was necessary to keep digging out the packs  the floor of their shelter gradually rose higher and higher they tried to eat and seemed to be grinding only sand between their teeth  they lost the count of time they dared not sleep for that would have meant being buried alive the could only crouch close to the leaning rock shake off the sand blindly dig out their packs and every moment gasp and cough and choke to fight suffocation  the storm finally blew itself out  it left the prospectors heavy and stupid for want of sleep  their burros had wandered away or had been buried in the sand  far as eye could reach the desert had marvelously changed it was now a rippling sea of sand dunes away to the north rose the peak that was their only guiding mark they headed toward it carrying a shovel and part of their packs  at noon the peak vanished in the shimmering glare of the desert the prospectors pushed on guided by the sun  in every wash they tried for water  with the forked peach branch in his hands warren always succeeded in locating water  they dug but it lay too deep  at length spent and sore they fell and slept through that night and part of the next day  then they succeeded in getting water and quenched their thirst and filled the canteens and cooked a meal  the burning day found them in an interminably wide plain where there was no shelter from the fierce sun the men were exceedingly careful with their water though there was absolute necessity of drinking a little every hour  late in the afternoon they came to a canyon that they believed was the lower end of the one in which they had last found water  for hours they traveled toward its head and long after night had set found what they sought yielding to exhaustion they slept and next day were loath to leave the waterhole  cool night spurred them on with canteens full and renewed strength  morning told cameron that they had turned back miles into the desert and it was desert new to him  the red sun the increasing heat and especially the variety and large size of the cactus plants warned cameron that he had descended to a lower level  mountain peaks loomed on all sides some near others distant and one a blue spur splitting the glaring sky far to the north cameron thought he recognized as a landmark  the ascent toward it was heartbreaking not in steepness but in its leagueandleaguelong monotonous rise cameron knew there was only one hopeto make the water hold out and never stop to rest  warren began to weaken often he had to halt  the burning white day passed and likewise the night with its white stars shining so pitilessly cold and bright  cameron measured the water in his canteen by its weight  evaporation by heat consumed as much as he drank  during one of the rests when he had wetted his parched mouth and throat he found opportunity to pour a little water from his canteen into warrens  at first cameron had curbed his restless activity to accommodate the pace of his elder comrade  but now he felt that he was losing something of his instinctive and passionate zeal to get out of the desert  the thought of water came to occupy his mind  he began to imagine that his last little store of water did not appreciably diminish  he knew he was not quite right in his mind regarding water nevertheless he felt this to be more of fact than fancy and he began to ponder  when next they rested he pretended to be in a kind of stupor but he covertly watched warren  the man appeared far gone yet he had cunning  he cautiously took up camerons canteen and poured water into it from his own  this troubled cameron  the old irritation at not being able to thwart warren returned to him  cameron reflected and concluded that he had been unwise not to expect this very thing  then as his comrade dropped into weary rest he lifted both canteens  if there were any water in warrens it was only very little  both men had been enduring the terrible desert thirst concealing it each giving his water to the other and the sacrifice had been useless  instead of ministering to the parched throats of one or both the water had evaporated  when cameron made sure of this he took one more drink the last and poured the little water left into warrens canteen  he threw his own away  soon afterward warren discovered the loss  wheres your canteen he asked  the heat was getting my water so i drank what was left  my son said warren  the day opened for them in a red and green hell of rock and cactus like a flame the sun scorched and peeled their faces  warren went blind from the glare and cameron had to lead him  at last warren plunged down exhausted in the shade of a ledge  cameron rested and waited hopeless with hot weary eyes gazing down from the height where he sat  the ledge was the top step of a ragged gigantic stairway  below stretched a sad austere and lonely valley a dim wide streak lighter than the bordering gray wound down the valley floor  once a river had flowed there leaving only a forlorn trace down the winding floor of this forlorn valley  movement on the part of warren attracted camerons attention evidently the old prospector had recovered his sight and some of his strength for he had arisen and now began to walk along the arroyo bed with his forked peach branch held before him  he had clung to the precious bit of wood  cameron considered the prospect for water hopeless because he saw that the arroyo had once been a canyon and had been filled with sands by desert winds  warren however stopped in a deep pit and cutting his canteen in half began to use one side of it as a scoop he scooped out a wide hollow so wide that cameron was certain he had gone crazy  cameron gently urged him to stop and then forcibly tried to make him but these efforts were futile  warren worked with slow ceaseless methodical movement  he toiled for what seemed hours cameron seeing the darkening dampening sand realized a wonderful possibility of water and he plunged into the pit with the other half of the canteen  then both men toiled round and round the wide hole down deeper and deeper  the sand grew moist then wet  at the bottom of the deep pit the sand coarsened gave place to gravel finally water welled in a stronger volume than cameron ever remembered finding on the desert  it would soon fill the hole and run over  he marveled at the circumstance  the time was near the end of the dry season perhaps an underground stream flowed from the range behind down to the valley floor and at this point came near to the surface  cameron had heard of such desert miracles  the finding of water revived camerons flagging hopes  but they were shortlived  warren had spend himself utterly  im done  dont linger he whispered  my son gogo  then he fell  cameron dragged him out of the sand pit to a sheltered place under the ledge  while sitting beside the failing man cameron discovered painted images on the wall  often in the desert he had found these evidences of a prehistoric people  then from long habit he picked up a piece of rock and examined it its weight made him closely scrutinize it  the color was a peculiar black  he scraped through the black rust to find a piece of gold  around him lay scattered heaps of black pebbles and bits of black weathered rock and pieces of broken ledge and they showed gold  warren  look  see it  feel it  gold  but warren had never cared and now he was too blind to see  gogo he whispered  cameron gazed down the gray reaches of the forlorn valley and something within him that was neither intelligence nor emotionsomething inscrutably strangeimpelled him to promise  then cameron built up stone monuments to mark his gold strike  that done he tarried beside the unconscious warren  moments passedgrew into hours  cameron still had strength left to make an effort to get out of the desert  but that same inscrutable something which had ordered his strange involuntary promise to warren held him beside his fallen comrade  he watched the white sun turn to gold and then to red and sink behind mountains in the west  twilight stole into the arroyo it lingered slowly turning to gloom the vault of blue black lightened to the blinking of stars then fell the serene silent luminous desert night  cameron kept his vigil  as the long hours wore on he felt creep over him the comforting sense that he need not forever fight sleep a wan glow flared behind the dark uneven horizon and a melancholy misshapen moon rose to make the white night one of shadows  absolute silence claimed the desert  it was mute  then that inscrutable something breathed to him telling him when he was alone  he need not have looked at the dark still face beside him  another face haunted cameronsa womans face  it was there in the white moonlit shadows it drifted in the darkness beyond it softened changed to that of a young girl sweet with the same dark haunting eyes of her mother  cameron prayed to that nameless thing within him the spirit of something deep and mystical as life  he prayed to that nameless thing outside of which the rocks and the sand the spiked cactus and the ragged lava the endless waste with its vast starfired mantle were but atoms  he prayed for mercy to a womanfor happiness to her child  both mother and daughter were close to him then  time and distance were annihilated he had faithhe saw into the future the fateful threads of the past so inextricably woven with his error wound out their tragic length here in this forlorn desert  cameron then took a little tin box from his pocket and opening it removed a folded certificate  he had kept a pen and now he wrote something upon the paper and in lieu of ink he wrote with blood  the moon afforded him enough light to see and having replaced the paper he laid the little box upon a shelf of rock it would remain there unaffected by dust moisture heat time how long had those painted images been there clear and sharp on the dry stone walls  there were no trails in that desert and always there were incalculable changes cameron saw this mutable mood of naturethe sands would fly and seep and carve and bury the floods would dig and cut the ledges would weather in the heat and rain the avalanches would slide the cactus seeds would roll in the wind to catch in a niche and split the soil with thirsty roots  years would pass  cameron seemed to see them too and likewise destiny leading a child down into this forlorn waste where she would find love and fortune and the grave of her father  cameron covered the dark still face of his comrade from the light of the waning moon  that action was the severing of his hold on realities  they fell away from him in final separation  vaguely dreamily he seemed to behold his soul  night merged into gray day and night came again weird and dark  then up out of the vast void of the desert from the silence and illimitableness trooped his phantoms of peace majestically they formed around him marshalling and mustering in ceremonious state and moved to lay upon him their passionless serenity    i  old friends  richard gale reflected that his sojourn in the west had been what his disgusted father had predictedidling here and there with no objective point or purpose  it was reflection such as this only more serious and perhaps somewhat desperate that had brought gale down to the border for some time the newspapers had been printing news of mexican revolution guerrilla warfare united states cavalry patrolling the international line american cowboys fighting with the rebels and wild stories of bold raiders and bandits  but as opportunity and adventure too had apparently given him a wide berth in montana wyoming colorado he had struck southwest for the arizona border where he hoped to see some stirring life  he did not care very much what happened  months of futile wandering in the hope of finding a place where he fitted had inclined richard to his fathers opinion  it was after dark one evening in early october when richard arrived in casita  he was surprised to find that it was evidently a town of importance  there was a jostling jabbering sombreroed crowd of mexicans around the railroad station  he felt as if he were in a foreign country  after a while he saw several men of his nationality one of whom he engaged to carry his luggage to a hotel  they walked up a wide welllighted street lined with buildings in which were bright windows  of the many people encountered by gale most were mexicans his guide explained that the smaller half of casita lay in arizona the other half in mexico and of several thousand inhabitants the majority belonged on the southern side of the street which was the boundary line  he also said that rebels had entered the town that day causing a good deal of excitement  gale was almost at the end of his financial resources which fact occasioned him to turn away from a pretentious hotel and to ask his guide for a cheaper lodginghouse  when this was found a sight of the loungers in the office and also a desire for comfort persuaded gale to change his travelingclothes for rough outing garb and boots  well im almost broke he soliloquized thoughtfully  the governor said i wouldnt make any money  hes rightso far and he said id be coming home beaten  there hes wrong  ive got a hunch that something ll happen to me in this greaser town  he went out into a wide whitewashed highceiled corridor and from that into an immense room which but for pool tables bar benches would have been like a courtyard  the floor was cobblestoned the walls were of adobe and the large windows opened like doors  a blue cloud of smoke filled the place  gale heard the click of pool balls and the clink of glasses along the crowded bar  barelegged sandalfooted mexicans in white rubbed shoulders with mexicans mantled in black and red  there were others in tightfitting blue uniforms with gold fringe or tassels at the shoulders  these men wore belts with heavy bonehandled guns and evidently were the rurales or native policemen  there were blackbearded coarsevisaged americans some gambling round the little tables others drinking  the pool tables were the center of a noisy crowd of younger men several of whom were unsteady on their feet  there were khakiclad cavalrymen strutting in and out  at one end of the room somewhat apart from the general meelee was a group of six men round a little table four of whom were seated the other two standing  these last two drew a second glance from gale the sharpfeatured bronzed faces and piercing eyes the tall slender loosely jointed bodies the quiet easy reckless air that seemed to be a part of the menthese things would plainly have stamped them as cowboys without the buckled sombreros the colored scarfs the hightopped highheeled boots with great silverroweled spurs  gale did not fail to note also that these cowboys wore guns and this fact was rather a shock to his idea of the modern west  it caused him to give some credence to the rumors of fighting along the border and he felt a thrill  he satisfied his hunger in a restaurant adjoining and as he stepped back into the saloon a man wearing a military cape jostled him apologies from both were instant  gale was moving on when the other stopped short as if startled and leaning forward exclaimed  dick gale  youve got me replied gale in surprise  but i dont know you  he could not see the strangers face because it was wholly shaded by a widebrimmed hat pulled well down  by jove  its dick  if this isnt great  dont you know me  ive heard your voice somewhere replied gale  maybe ill recognize you if you come out from under that bonnet  for answer the man suddenly manifesting thought of himself hurriedly drew gale into the restaurant where he thrust back his hat to disclose a handsome sunburned face  george thorne  so help me  ssssh  you neednt yell interrupted the other as he met gales outstretched hand  there was a close hard straining grip i must not be recognized here  there are reasons  ill explain in a minute say but its fine to see you  five years dick five years since i saw you run down university field and spreadeagle the whole wisconsin football team  dont recollect that replied dick laughing  george ill bet you im gladder to see you than you are to see me  it seems so long  you went into the army didnt you  i did  im here now with the ninth cavalry  butnever mind me whatre you doing way down here  say i just noticed your togs dick you cant be going in for mining or ranching not in this godforsaken desert  on the square george i dont know any more why im here thanthan you know  well that beats me ejaculated thorne sitting back in his chair amaze and concern in his expression  what the devils wrong your old mans got too much money for you ever to be up against it dick you couldnt have gone to the bad  a tide of emotion surged over gale  how good it was to meet a friendsome one to whom to talk  he had never appreciated his loneliness until that moment  george how i ever drifted down here i dont know  i didnt exactly quarrel with the governor  butdamn it dad hurt meshamed me and i dug out for the west  it was this way after leaving college i tried to please him by tackling one thing after another that he set me to do on the square i had no head for business  i made a mess of everything  the governor got sore he kept ramming the harpoon into me till i just couldnt stand it what little ability i possessed deserted me when i got my back up and there you are  dad and i had a rather uncomfortable half hour when i quitwhen i told him straight out that i was going west to fare for myself why it wouldnt have been so tough if he hadnt laughed at me  he called me a rich mans sonan idle easygoing spineless swell  he said i didnt even have character enough to be out and out bad  he said i didnt have sense enough to marry one of the nice girls in my sisters crowd  he said i couldnt get back home unless i sent to him for money  he said he didnt believe i could fightcould really make a fight for anything under the sun  ohhehe shot it into me all right  dick dropped his head upon his hands somewhat ashamed of the smarting dimness in his eyes  he had not meant to say so much yet what a relief to let out that longcongested burden  fight cried thorne hotly  whats ailing him  didnt they call you biff gale in college  dick you were one of the best men stagg ever developed  i heard him say sothat you were the fastest onehundredandseventyfivepound man hed ever trained the hardest to stop  the governor didnt count football said dick  he didnt mean that kind of fight  when i left home i dont think i had an idea what was wrong with me  but george i think i know now  i was a rich mans sonspoiled dependent absolutely ignorant of the value of money  i havent yet discovered any earning capacity in me  i seem to be unable to do anything with my hands  thats the trouble  but im at the end of my tether now  and im going to punch cattle or be a miner or do some real stuntlike joining the rebels  aha  i thought youd spring that last one on me declared thorne wagging his head  well you just forget it  say old boy theres something doing in mexico  the united states in general doesnt realize it  but across that line there are crazy revolutionists illpaid soldiers guerrilla leaders raiders robbers outlaws bandits galore starving peons by the thousand girls and women in terror  mexico is like some of her volcanoesready to erupt fire and hell  dont make the awful mistake of joining rebel forces  americans are hated by mexicans of the lower classthe fighting class both rebel and federal  half the time these crazy greasers are on one side then on the other if you didnt starve or get shot in ambush or die of thirst some greaser would knife you in the back for you belt buckle or boots  there are a good many americans with the rebels eastward toward agua prieta and juarez  orozco is operating in chihuahua and i guess he has some idea of warfare  but this is sonora a mountainous desert the home of the slave and the yaqui  theres unorganized revolt everywhere  the american miners and ranchers those who could get away have fled across into the states leaving property  those who couldnt or wouldnt come must fight for their lives are fighting now  thats bad said gale  its news to me  why doesnt the government take action do something  afraid of international complications  dont want to offend the maderists or be criticized by jealous foreign nations  its a delicate situation dick  the washington officials know the gravity of it you can bet  but the united states in general is in the dark and the armywell you ought to hear the inside talk back at san antonio were patrolling the boundary line  were making a grand bluff  i could tell you of a dozen instances where cavalry should have pursued raiders on the other side of the line  but we wont do it  the officers are a grouchy lot these days  you see of course what significance would attach to united states cavalry going into mexican territory  there would simply be hell  my own colonel is the sorest man on the job  were all sore  its like sitting on a powder magazine  we cant keep the rebels and raiders from crossing the line yet we dont fight  my commission expires soon  ill be discharged in three months  you can bet im glad for more reasons than ive mentioned  thorne was evidently laboring under strong suppressed excitement his face showed pale under the tan and his eyes gleamed with a dark fire occasionally his delight at meeting talking with gale dominated the other emotions but not for long  he had seated himself at a table near one of the doorlike windows leading into the street and every little while he would glance sharply out  also he kept consulting his watch  these details gradually grew upon gale as thorne talked  george it strikes me that youre upset said dick presently  i seem to remember you as a coolheaded fellow whom nothing could disturb has the army changed you  thorne laughed  it was a laugh with a strange high note  it was recklessit hinted of exaltation  he rose abruptly he gave the waiter money to go for drinks he looked into the saloon and then into the street  on this side of the house there was a porch opening on a plaza with trees and shrubbery and branches  thorne peered out one window then another  his actions were rapid  returning to the table he put his hands upon it and leaned over to look closely into gales face  im away from camp without leave he said  isnt that a serious offense asked dick  serious  for me if im discovered it means ruin  there are rebels in town  any moment we might have trouble  i ought to be ready for dutywithin call  if im discovered it means arrest that means delaythe failure of my plansruin  gale was silenced by his friends intensity  thorne bent over closer with his dark eyes searching bright  we were old palsonce  surely replied dick  what would you say dick gale if i told you that youre the one man id rather have had come along than any other at this crisis of my life  the earnest gaze the passionate voice with its deep tremor drew dick upright thrilling and eager conscious of strange unfamiliar impetuosity  thorne i should say i was glad to be the fellow replied dick  their hands locked for a moment and they sat down again with heads close over the table  listen began thorne in low swift whisper a few days a week agoit seems like a yeari was of some assistance to refugees fleeing from mexico into the states  they were all women and one of them was dressed as a nun  quite by accident i saw her face it was that of a beautiful girl  i observed she kept aloof from the others i suspected a disguise and when opportunity afforded spoke to her offered my services  she replied to my poor efforts at spanish in fluent english  she had fled in terror from her home some place down in sinaloa  rebels are active there  her father was captured and held for ransom  when the ransom was paid the rebels killed him the leader of these rebels was a bandit named rojas  long before the revolution began he had been feared by people of classloved by the peons bandits are worshiped by the peons all of the famous bandits have robbed the rich and given to the poor rojas saw the daughter made off with her  but she contrived to bribe her guards and escaped almost immediately before any harm befell her  she hid among friends  rojas nearly tore down the town in his efforts to find her  then she disguised herself and traveled by horseback stage and train to casita  her story fascinated me and that one fleeting glimpse i had of her face i couldnt forget  she had no friends here no money she knew rojas was trailing her  this talk i had with her was at the railroad station where all was bustle and confusion  no one noticed us so i thought  i advised her to remove the disguise of a nun before she left the waitingroom  and i got a boy to guide her  but he fetched her to his house  i had promised to come in the evening to talk over the situation with her  i found her dick and when i saw heri went stark staring raving mad over her  she is the most beautiful wonderful girl i ever saw her name is mercedes castaneda and she belongs to one of the old wealthy spanish families  she has lived abroad and in havana  she speaks french as well as english  she isbut i must be brief  dick think think  with mercedes also it was love at first sight my plan is to marry her and get her farther to the interior away from the border  it may not be easy  shes watched  so am i it was impossible to see her without the women of this house knowing at first perhaps they had only curiosityan itch to gossip  but the last two days there has been a change  since last night theres some powerful influence at work  oh these mexicans are subtle mysterious after all they are spaniards  they work in secret in the dark  they are dominated first by religion then by gold then by passion for a woman  rojas must have got word to his friends here yesterday his gang of cutthroat rebels arrived and today he came  when i learned that i took my chance and left camp  i hunted up a priest  he promised to come here  its time hes due  but im afraid hell be stopped  thorne why dont you take the girl and get married without waiting without running these risks said dick  i fear its too late now  i should have done that last night you see were over the line  are we in mexican territory now queried gale sharply  i guess yes old boy  thats what complicates it  rojas and his rebels have casita in their hands  but rojas without his rebels would be able to stop me get the girl and make for his mountain haunts  if mercedes is really watchedif her identity is known which i am sure is the casewe couldnt get far from this house before id be knifed and she seized  good heavens  thorne can that sort of thing happen less than a stones throw from the united states line asked gale incredulously  it can happen and dont you forget it  you dont seem to realize the power these guerrilla leaders these rebel captains and particularly these bandits exercise over the mass of mexicans a bandit is a man of honor in mexico  he is feared envied loved in the hearts of the people he stands next to the national idolthe bullfighter the matador  the race has a wild barbarian bloody strain  take quinteros for instance  he was a peon a slave he became a famous bandit  at the outbreak of the revolution he proclaimed himself a leader and with a band of followers he devastated whole counties  the opposition to federal forces was only a blind to rob and riot and carry off women  the motto of this man and his followers was  let us enjoy ourselves while we may  there are other bandits besides quinteros not so famous or such great leaders but just as bloodthirsty  ive seen rojas  hes a handsome bold sneering devil vainer than any peacock  he decks himself in gold lace and sliver trappings in all the finery he can steal  he was one of the rebels who helped sack sinaloa and carry off half a million in money and valuables  rojas spends gold like he spills blood  but he is chiefly famous for abducting women the peon girls consider it an honor to be ridden off with  rojas has shown a penchant for girls of the better class  thorne wiped the perspiration from his pale face and bent a dark gaze out of the window before he resumed his talk  consider what the position of mercedes really is  i cant get any help from our side of the line  if so i dont know where the population on that side is mostly mexican absolutely in sympathy with whatever actuates those on this side  the whole caboodle of greasers on both sides belong to the class in sympathy with the rebels the class that secretly respects men like rojas and hates an aristocrat like mercedes  they would conspire to throw her into his power  rojas can turn all the hidden underground influences to his ends  unless i thwart him hell get mercedes as easily as he can light a cigarette but ill kill him or some of his gang or her before i let him get her this is the situation old friend  ive little time to spare i face arrest for desertion  rojas is in town i think i was followed to this hotel  the priest has betrayed me or has been stopped mercedes is here alone waiting absolutely dependent upon me to save her fromfrom  shes the sweetest loveliest girl in a few momentssooner or later therell be hell here  dick are you with me  dick gale drew a long deep breath  a coldness a lethargy an indifference that had weighed upon him for months had passed out of his being  on the instant he could not speak but his hand closed powerfully upon his friends  thornes face changed wonderfully the distress the fear the appeal all vanishing in a smile of passionate gratefulness  then dicks gaze attracted by some slight sound shot over his friends shoulder to see a face at the windowa handsome bold sneering face with glittering dark eyes that flashed in sinister intentness  dick stiffened in his seat  thorne with sudden clenching of hands wheeled toward the window  rojas he whispered    ii  mercedes castaneda  the dark face vanished  dick gale heard footsteps and the tinkle of spurs  he strode to the window and was in time to see a mexican swagger into the front door of the saloon  dick had only a glimpse but in that he saw a huge black sombrero with a gaudy band the back of a short tightfitting jacket a heavy pearlhandled gun swinging with a fringe of sash and closefitting trousers spreading wide at the bottom  there were men passing in the street also several mexicans lounging against the hitchingrail at the curb  did you see him  where did he go whispered thorne as he joined gale  those greasers out there with the cartridge belts crossed over their breaststhey are rebels  i think he went into the saloon replied dick  he had a gun but for all i can see the greasers out there are unarmed  never believe it  there  look dick  that fellows a guard though he seems so unconcerned  see he has a short carbine almost concealed theres another greaser farther down the path  im afraid rojas has the house spotted  if we could only be sure  im sure dick  lets cross the hall i want to see how it looks from the other side of the house  gale followed thorne out of the restaurant into the highceiled corridor which evidently divided the hotel opening into the street and running back to a patio  a few dim yellow lamps flickered a mexican with a blanket round his shoulders stood in the front entrance back toward the patio there were sounds of boots on the stone floor shadows flitted across that end of the corridor  thorne entered a huge chamber which was even more poorly lighted than the hall  it contained a table littered with papers a few highbacked chairs a couple of couches and was evidently a parlor  mercedes has been meeting me here said thorne  at this hour she comes every moment or so to the head of the stairs there and if i am here she comes down  mostly there are people in this room a little later  we go out into the plaza  it faces the dark side of the house and thats the place i must slip out with her if theres any chance at all to get away  they peered out of the open window  the plaza was gloomy and at first glance apparently deserted  in a moment however gale made out a slowpacing dark form on the path  farther down there was another  no particular keenness was required to see in these forms a sentinellike stealthiness  gripping gales arm thorne pulled back from the window  you saw them he whispered  its just as i feared  rojas has the place surrounded  i should have taken mercedes away  but i had no timeno chance  im bound theres mercedes now  my god dick thinkthink if theres a way to get her out of this trap  gale turned as his friend went down the room  in the dim light at the head of the stairs stood the slim muffled figure of a woman when she saw thorne she flew noiselessly down the stairway to him he caught her in his arms  then she spoke softly brokenly in a low swift voice it was a mingling of incoherent spanish and english but to gale it was mellow deep unutterably tender a voice full of joy fear passion hope and love  upon gale it had an unaccountable effect  he found himself thrilling wondering  thorne led the girl to the center of the room under the light where gale stood  she had raised a white hand holding a blacklaced mantilla half aside  dick saw a small dark head proudly held an oval face half hidden white as a flower and magnificent black eyes  then thorne spoke  mercedesdick gale an old friendthe best friend i ever had  she swept the mantilla back over her head disclosing a lovely face strange and striking to gale in its pride and fire its intensity  senor galeah  i cannot speak my happiness  his friend  yes mercedes my friend and yours said thorne speaking rapidly well have need of him  dear theres bad news and no time to break it gently  the priest did not come  he must have been detained  and listenbe brave dear mercedesrojas is here  she uttered an inarticulate cry the poignant terror of which shook gales nerve and swayed as if she would faint  thorne caught her and in husky voice importuned her to bear up  my darling  for gods sake dont faintdont go to pieces wed be lost  weve got a chance  well think of something  be strong fight  it was plain to gale that thorne was distracted  he scarcely knew what he was saying  pale and shaking he clasped mercedes to him her terror had struck him helpless  it was so intenseit was so full of horrible certainty of what fate awaited her  she cried out in spanish beseeching him and as he shook his head she changed to english  senor my lover i will be strongi will fighti will obey but swear by my virgin if need be to save me from rojasyou will kill me  mercedes  yes ill swear he replied hoarsely  i knowid rather have you dead than but dont give up  rojas cant be sure of you or he wouldnt wait  hes in there  hes got his men thereall around us  but he hesitates  a beast like rojas doesnt stand idle for nothing  i tell you weve a chance  dick here will think of something  well slip away  then hell take you somewhere onlyspeak to himshow him you wont weaken mercedes this is more than love and happiness for us  its life or death  she became quiet and slowly recovered control of herself  suddenly she wheeled to face gale with proud dark eyes tragic sweetness of appeal and exquisite grace  senor you are an american  you cannot know the spanish bloodthe peon bandits hate and cruelty  i wish to die before rojass hand touches me  if he takes me alive then the hour the little day that my life lasts afterward will be torturedtorture of hell if i live two days his brutal men will have me  if i live three the dogs of his camp senor have you a sister whom you love help senor thorne to save me  he is a soldier  he is bound he must not betray his honor his duty for me ah you two splendid americansso big so strong so fierce  what is that little black halfbreed slave rojas to such men  rojas is a coward now let me waste no more precious time  i am ready  i will be brave  she came close to gale holding out her white hands a woman all fire and soul and passion  to gale she was wonderful  his heart leaped as he bent over her hands and kissed them he seemed to feel himself renewed remade  senorita he said i am happy to be your servant  i can conceive of no greater pleasure than giving the service you require  and what is that inquired thorne hurriedly  that of incapacitating senor rojas for tonight and perhaps several nights to come replied gale  dick what will you do asked thorne now in alarm  ill make a row in that saloon returned dick bluntly  ill start something  ill rush rojas and his crowd  ill  lord no you mustnt dickyoull be knifed cried thorne he was in distress yet his eyes were shining  ill take a chance  maybe i can surprise that slow greaser bunch and get away before they know whats happened you be ready watching at the window  when the row starts those fellows out there in the plaza will run into the saloon  then you slip out go straight through the plaza down the street  its a dark street i remember  ill catch up with you before you get far  thorne gasped but did not say a word  mercedes leaned against him her white hands now at her breast her great eyes watching gale as he went out  in the corridor gale stopped long enough to pull on a pair of heavy gloves to muss his hair and disarrange his collar  then he stepped into the restaurant went through and halted in the door leading into the saloon  his five feet eleven inches and one hundred and eighty pounds were more noticeable there and it was part of his plan to attract attention to himself  no one however appeared to notice him the poolplayers were noisily intent on their game the same crowd of motleyrobed mexicans hung over the reeking bar gales roving glance soon fixed upon the man he took to be rojas he recognized the huge highpeaked black sombrero with its ornamented band  the mexicans face was turned aside  he was in earnest excited colloquy with a dozen or more comrades most of whom were sitting round a table  they were listening talking drinking  the fact that they wore cartridge belts crossed over their breasts satisfied that these were the rebels he had noted the belts of the mexicans outside who were apparently guards  a waiter brought more drinks to this group at the table and this caused the leader to turn so gale could see his face  it was indeed the sinister sneering face of the bandit rojas  gale gazed at the man with curiosity  he was under medium height and striking in appearance only because of his dandified dress and evil visage he wore a lace scarf a tight brightbuttoned jacket a buckskin vest embroidered in red a sash and belt joined by an enormous silver clasp gale saw again the pearlhandled gun swinging at the bandits hip jewels flashed in his scarf  there were gold rings in his ears and diamonds on his fingers  gale became conscious of an inward fire that threatened to overrun his coolness  other emotions harried his selfcontrol  it seemed as if sight of the man liberated or created a devil in gale  and at the bottom of his feelings there seemed to be a wonder at himself a strange satisfaction for the something that had come to him  he stepped out of the doorway down the couple of steps to the floor of the saloon and he staggered a little simulating drunkenness he fell over the pool tables jostled mexicans at the bar laughed like a maudlin fool and with his hat slouched down crowded here and there presently his eye caught sight of the group of cowboys whom he had before noticed with such interest  they were still in a corner somewhat isolated  with fertile mind working gale lurched over to them  he remembered his many unsuccessful attempts to get acquainted with cowboys  if he were to get any help from these silent aloof rangers it must be by striking fire from them in one swift stroke  planting himself squarely before the two tall cowboys who were standing he looked straight into their lean bronzed faces  he spared a full moment for that keen cool gaze before he spoke  im not drunk  im throwing a bluff and i mean to start a rough house  im going to rush that damned bandit rojas  its to save a girlto give her lover who is my friend a chance to escape with her when i start a row my friend will try to slip out with her  every door and window is watched  ive got to raise hell to draw the guards in well youre my countrymen  were in mexico  a beautiful girls honor and life are at stake  now gentlemen watch me  one cowboys eyes narrowed blinking a little and his lean jaw dropped the others hard face rippled with a fleeting smile  gale backed away and his pulse leaped when he saw the two cowboys as if with one purpose slowly stride after him  then gale swerved staggering along brushed against the tables kicked over the empty chairs  he passed rojas and his gang and out of the tail of his eye saw that the bandit was watching him waving his hands and talking fiercely  the hum of the many voices grew louder and when dick lurched against a table overturning it and spilling glasses into the laps of several mexicans there arose a shrill cry he had succeeded in attracting attention almost every face turned his way  one of the insulted men a little tawny fellow leaped up to confront gale and in a frenzy screamed a volley of spanish of which gale distinguished gringo  the mexican stamped and made a threatening move with his right hand  dick swung his leg and with a swift side kick knocked the fellows feet from under him whirling him down with a thud  the action was performed so suddenly so adroitly it made the mexican such a weakling so like a tumbled tenpin that the shrill jabbering hushed  gale knew this to be the significant moment  wheeling he rushed at rojas  it was his old linebreaking plunge neither rojas nor his men had time to move  the blackskinned bandits face turned a dirty white his jaw dropped he would have shrieked if gale had not hit him  the blow swept him backward against his men then gales heavy body swiftly following with the momentum of that rush struck the little group of rebels  they went down with table and chairs in a sliding crash  gale carried by his plunge went with them  like a cat he landed on top  as he rose his powerful hands fastened on rojas  he jerked the little bandit off the tangled pile of struggling yelling men and swinging him with terrific force let go his hold  rojas slid along the floor knocking over tables and chairs gale bounded back dragged rojas up handling him as if he were a limp sack  a shot rang out above the yells  gale heard the jingle of breaking glass  the room darkened perceptibly  he flashed a glance backward the two cowboys were between him and the crowd of frantic rebels one cowboy held two guns low down level in front of him  the other had his gun raised and aimed  on the instant it spouted red and white with the crack came the crashing of glass another darkening shade over the room  with a cry gale slung the bleeding rojas from him  the bandit struck a table toppled over it fell and lay prone  another shot made the room full of moving shadows with light only back of the bar  a whiteclad figure rushed at gale  he tripped the man but had to kick hard to disengage himself from grasping hands  another figure closed in on gale  this one was dark swift a blade glinteddescribed a circle aloft  simultaneously with a close red flash the knife wavered the man wielding it stumbled backward  in the din gale did not hear a report but the mexicans fall was significant then pandemonium broke loose  the din became a roar  gale heard shots that sounded like dull spats in the distance  the big lamp behind the bar seemingly split then sputtered and went out leaving the room in darkness  gale leaped toward the restaurant door which was outlined faintly by the yellow light within  right and left he pushed the groping men who jostled with him  he vaulted a pool table sent tables and chairs flying and gained the door to be the first of a wedging mob to squeeze through  one sweep of his arm knocked the restaurant lamp from its stand and he ran out leaving darkness behind him a few bounds took him into the parlor  it was deserted  thorne had gotten away with mercedes  it was then gale slowed up  for the space of perhaps sixty seconds he had been moving with startling velocity  he peered cautiously out into the plaza  the paths the benches the shady places under the trees contained no skulking men  he ran out keeping to the shade and did not go into the path till he was halfway through the plaza  under a street lamp at the far end of the path he thought he saw two dark figures  he ran faster and soon reached the street the uproar back in the hotel began to diminish or else he was getting out of hearing the few people he saw close at hand were all coming his way and only the foremost showed any excitement gale walked swiftly peering ahead for two figures  presently he saw themone tall wearing a cape the other slight mantled  gale drew a sharp breath of relief  thorne and mercedes were not far ahead  from time to time thorne looked back  he strode swiftly almost carrying mercedes who clung closely to him  she too looked back once gale saw her white face flash in the light of a street lamp he began to overhaul them and soon when the last lamp had been passed and the street was dark he ventured a whistle  thorne heard it for he turned whistled a low reply and went on  not for some distance beyond where the street ended in open country did they halt to wait the desert began here  gale felt the soft sand under his feet and saw the grotesque forms of cactus  then he came up with the fugitives  dick  are youall right panted thorne grasping gale  imout of breathbutok replied gale  good good choked thorne  i was scaredhelpless dick it worked splendidly  we had no trouble  what on earth did you do  i made the row all right said dick  good heavens  it was like a row i once heard made by a mob  but the shots dickwere they at you  they paralyzed me  then the yells what happened  those guards of rojas ran round in front at the first shot  tell me what happened  while i was rushing rojas a couple of cowboys shot out the lamplights a mexican who pulled a knife on me got hurt i guess  then i think there was some shooting from the rebels after the room was dark  rushing rojas queried thorne leaning close to dick  his voice was thrilling exultant deep with a joy that yet needed confirmation what did you do to him  i handed him one off side tackled then tried a forward pass replied dick lightly speaking the football vernacular so familiar to thorne  thorne leaned closer his fine face showing fierce and corded in the starlight  tell me straight he demanded in thick voice  gale then divined something of the suffering thorne had undergonesomething of the hot wild vengeful passion of a lover who must have brutal truth  it stilled dicks lighter mood and he was about to reply when mercedes pressed close to him touched his hands looked up into his face with wonderful eyes  he thought he would not soon forget their beautythe shadow of pain that had been the hope dawning so fugitively  dear lady said gale with voice not wholly steady rojas himself will hound you no more tonight nor for many nights  she seemed to shake to thrill to rise with the intelligence she pressed his hand close over her heaving breast  gale felt the quick throb of her heart  senor  senor dick she cried  then her voice failed  but her hands flew up quick as a flash she raised her facekissed him  then she turned and with a sob fell into thornes arms  there ensued a silence broken only by mercedes sobbing  gale walked some paces away  if he were not stunned he certainly was agitated the strange sweet fire of that girls lips remained with him  on the spur of the moment he imagined he had a jealousy of thorne  but presently this passed  it was only that he had been deeply movedstirred to the depths during the last hourhad become conscious of the awakening of a spirit  what remained with him now was the splendid glow of gladness that he had been of service to thorne  and by the intensity of mercedes abandon of relief and gratitude he measured her agony of terror and the fate he had spared her  dick dick come here called thorne softly  lets pull ourselves together now  weve got a problem yet  what to do  where to go how to get any place  we dont dare risk the stationthe corrals where mexicans hire out horses  were on good old us ground this minute but were not out of danger  as he paused evidently hoping for a suggestion from gale the silence was broken by the clear ringing peal of a bugle  thorne gave a violent start  then he bent over listening  the beautiful notes of the bugle floated out of the darkness clearer sharper faster  its a call dick  its a call he cried  gale had no answer to make  mercedes stood as if stricken  the bugle call ended  from a distance another faintly pealed  there were other sounds too remote to recognize  then scattering shots rattled out  dick the rebels are fighting somebody burst out thorne excitedly the little federal garrison still holds its stand perhaps it is attacked again  anyway theres something doing over the line  maybe the crazy greasers are firing on our camp  weve feared itin the dark and here i am away without leavepractically a deserter  go back  go back before youre too late cried mercedes  better make tracks thorne added gale  it cant help our predicament for you to be arrested  ill take care of mercedes  no no no replied thorne  i can get awayavoid arrest  thatd be all right for the immediate present  but its not best for the future  george a deserter is a deserter better hurry leave the girl to me till tomorrow  mercedes embraced her lover begged him to go  thorne wavered  dick im up against it he said  youre right  if only i can get back in time  but oh i hate to leave her  old fellow youve saved her  i already owe you everlasting gratitude  keep out of casita dick  the us side might be safe but im afraid to trust it at night  go out in the desert up in the mountains in some safe place then come to me in camp  well plan  ill have to confide in colonel weede  maybe hell help us  hide her from the rebelsthats all  he wrung dicks hand clasped mercedes tightly in his arms kissed her and murmured low over her then released her to rush off into the darkness  he disappeared in the gloom  the sound of his dull footfalls gradually died away  for a moment the desert silence oppressed gale  he was unaccustomed to such strange stillness  there was a low stir of sand a rustle of stiff leaves in the wind  how white the stars burned  then a coyote barked to be bayed by a dog  gale realized that he was between the edge of an unknown desert and the edge of a hostile town he had to choose the desert because though he had no doubt that in casita there were many americans who might befriend him he could not chance the risks of seeking them at night  he felt a slight touch on his arm felt it move down felt mercedes slip a trembling cold little hand into his  dick looked at her she seemed a whitefaced girl now with staring frightened black eyes that flashed up at him  if the loneliness the silence the desert the unknown dangers of the night affected him what must they be to this hunted driven girl  gales heart swelled  he was alone with her  he had no weapon no money no food no drink no covering nothing except his two hands  he had absolutely no knowledge of the desert of the direction or whereabouts of the boundary line between the republics he did not know where to find the railroad or any road or trail or whether or not there were towns near or far  it was a critical desperate situation  he thought first of the girl and groaned in spirit prayed that it would be given him to save her  when he remembered himself it was with the stunning consciousness that he could conceive of no situation which he would have exchanged for this onewhere fortune had set him a perilous task of loyalty to a friend to a helpless girl  senor senor suddenly whispered mercedes clinging to him listen i hear horses coming    iii  a flight into the desert  uneasy and startled gale listened and hearing nothing wondered if mercedess fears had not worked upon her imagination  he felt a trembling seize her and he held her hands tightly  you were mistaken i guess he whispered  no no senor  dick turned his ear to the soft wind  presently he heard or imagined he heard low beats  like the first faint faroff beats of a drumming grouse they recalled to him the illinois forests of his boyhood  in a moment he was certain the sounds were the padlike steps of hoofs in yielding sand  the regular tramp was not that of grazing horses  on the instant made cautious and stealthy by alarm gale drew mercedes deeper into the gloom of the shrubbery  sharp pricks from thorns warned him that he was pressing into a cactus growth and he protected mercedes as best he could  she was shaking as one with a severe chill she breathed with little hurried pants and leaned upon him almost in collapse  gale ground his teeth in helpless rage at the girls fate if she had not been beautiful she might still have been free and happy in her home  what a strange world to live inhow unfair was fate  the sounds of hoofbeats grew louder  gale made out a dark moving mass against a background of dull gray  there was a line of horses he could not discern whether or not all the horses carried riders the murmur of a voice struck his earthen a low laugh  it made him tingle for it sounded american  eagerly he listened  there was an interval when only the hoofbeats could be heard  it shore was laddy it shore was came a voice out of the darkness rough house  laddy since wire fences drove us out of texas we aint seen the like of that  an we never had such a call  call  it was a burnin roast replied another voice  i felt low down  he vamoosed some sudden an i hope he an his friends shook the dust of casita  thats a rotten town jim  gale jumped up in joy  what luck  the speakers were none other than the two cowboys whom he had accosted in the mexican hotel  hold on fellows he called out and strode into the road  the horses snorted and stamped  then followed swift rustling soundsa clinking of spurs then silence  the figures loomed clearer in the gloom gale saw five or six horses two with riders and one other at least carrying a pack  when gale got within fifteen feet of the group the foremost horseman said  i reckon thats close enough stranger  something in the cowboys hand glinted darkly bright in the starlight  youd recognize me if it wasnt so dark replied gale halting i spoke to you a little while agoin the saloon back there  come over an lets see you said the cowboy curtly  gale advanced till he was close to the horse  the cowboy leaned over the saddle and peered into gales face  then without a word he sheathed the gun and held out his hand  gale met a grip of steel that warmed his blood  the other cowboy got off his nervous spirited horse and threw the bridle  he too peered closely into gales face  my names ladd he said  reckon im some glad to meet you again  gale felt another grip as hard and strong as the other had been  he realized he had found friends who belonged to a class of men whom he had despaired of ever knowing  galedick gale is my name he began swiftly  i dropped into casita tonight hardly knowing where i was  a boy took me to that hotel  there i met an old friend whom i had not seen for years he belongs to the cavalry stationed here  he had befriended a spanish girlfallen in love with her  rojas had killed this girls fathertried to abduct her you know what took place at the hotel gentlemen if its ever possible ill show you how i appreciate what you did for me there  i got away found my friend with the girl  we hurried out here beyond the edge of town  then thorne had to make a break for camp  we heard bugle calls shots and he was away without leave  that left the girl with me  i dont know what to do  thorne swears casita is no place for mercedes at night  the girl aint no peon no common greaser interrupted ladd  no  her name is castaneda  she belongs to an old spanish family once rich and influential  reckoned as much replied the cowboy  theres more than rojass wantin to kidnap a pretty girl  shore he does that every day or so must be somethin political or feelin against class  well casita aint no place for your friends girl at night or day or any time shore theres americans whod take her in an fight for her if necessary  but it aint wise to risk that  lash what do you say  its been gettin hotter round this greaser corral for some weeks replied the other cowboy  if that twobit of a garrison surrenders theres no tellin whatll happen  orozco is headin west from agua prieta with his guerrillas  campo is burnin bridges an tearin up the railroad south of nogales  then theres all these bandits callin themselves revolutionists just for an excuse to steal burn kill an ride off with women  its plain facts laddy an bein across the us line a few inches or so dont make no hell of a difference  my advice is dont let miss castaneda ever set foot in casita again  looks like youve shore spoke sense said ladd  i reckon gale you an the girl ought to come with us  casita shore would be a little warm for us tomorrow  we didnt kill anybody but i shot a greasers arm off an lash strained friendly relations by destroyin property we know people wholl take care of the senorita till your friend can come for her  dick warmly spoke his gratefulness and inexpressibly relieved and happy for mercedes he went toward the clump of cactus where he had left her  she stood erect waiting and dark as it was he could tell she had lost the terror that had so shaken her  senor gale you are my good angel she said tremulously  ive been lucky to fall in with these men and im glad with all my heart he replied  come  he led her into the road up to the cowboys who now stood bareheaded in the starlight  they seemed shy and lash was silent while ladd made embarrassed unintelligible reply to mercedess thanks  there were five horsestwo saddled two packed and the remaining one carried only a blanket  ladd shortened the stirrups on his mount and helped mercedes up into the saddle  from the way she settled herself and took the few restive prances of the mettlesome horse gale judged that she could ride  lash urged gale to take his horse  but this gale refused to do  ill walk he said  im used to walking  i know cowboys are not  they tried again to persuade him without avail  then ladd started off riding bareback  mercedes fell in behind with gale walking beside her the two pack animals came next and lash brought up the rear  once started with protection assured for the girl and a real objective point in view gale relaxed from the tense strain he had been laboring under  how glad he would have been to acquaint thorne with their good fortune  later of course there would be some way to get word to the cavalryman  but till then what torments his friend would suffer  it seemed to dick that a very long time had elapsed since he stepped off the train and one by one he went over every detail of incident which had occurred between that arrival and the present moment strange as the facts were he had no doubts  he realized that before that night he had never known the deeps of wrath undisturbed in him he had never conceived even a passing idea that it was possible for him to try to kill a man  his right hand was swollen stiff so sore that he could scarcely close it  his knuckles were bruised and bleeding and ached with a sharp pain  considering the thickness of his heavy glove gale was of the opinion that so to bruise his hand he must have struck rojas a powerful blow  he remembered that for him to give or take a blow had been nothing  this blow to rojas however had been a different matter  the hot wrath which had been his motive was not puzzling but the effect on him after he had cooled off a subtle difference something puzzled and eluded him the more it baffled him the more he pondered  all those wandering months of his had been filled with dissatisfaction yet he had been too apathetic to understand himself  so he had not been much of a person to try perhaps it had not been the blow to rojas any more than other things that had wrought some change in him  his meeting with thorne the wonderful black eyes of a spanish girl her appeal to him the hate inspired by rojas and the rush the blow the action sight of thorne and  mercedes hurrying safely away the girls hand pressing his to her heaving breast the sweet fire of her kiss the fact of her being alone with him dependent upon himall these things gale turned over and over in his mind only to fail of any definite conclusion as to which had affected him so remarkably or to tell what had really happened to him  had he fallen in love with thornes sweetheart  the idea came in a flash  was he all in an instant and by one of those incomprehensible reversals of  character jealous of his friend  dick was almost afraid to look up at mercedes  still he forced himself to do so and as it chanced mercedes was looking down at him  somehow the light was better and he clearly saw her white face her black and starry eyes her perfect mouth  with a quick graceful impulsiveness she put her hand upon his shoulder  like her appearance the action was new strange striking to gale but it brought home suddenly to him the nature of gratitude and affection in a girl of her blood  it was sweet and sisterly  he knew then that he had not fallen in love with her the feeling that was akin to jealousy seemed to be of the beautiful something for which mercedes stood in thornes life gale then grasped the bewildering possibilities the infinite wonder of what a girl could mean to a man  the other haunting intimations of change seemed to be elusively blended with sensationsthe heat and thrill of action the sense of something done and more to do the utter vanishing of an old weary hunt for he knew not what  maybe it had been a hunt for work for energy for spirit for love for his real self whatever it might be there appeared to be now some hope of finding it  the desert began to lighten  gray openings in the border of shrubby growths changed to paler hue  the road could be seen some rods ahead and it had become a stony descent down steadily down dark ridged backs of mountains bounded the horizon and all seemed near at hand hemming in the plain  in the east a white glow grew brighter and brighter reaching up to a line of cloud defined sharply below by a rugged notched range  presently a silver circle rose behind the black mountain and the gloom of the desert underwent a transformation from a gray mantle it changed to a transparent haze  the moon was rising  senor i am cold said mercedes  dick had been carrying his coat upon his arm  he had felt warm even hot and had imagined that the steady walk had occasioned it  but his skin was cool  the heat came from an inward burning he stopped the horse and raised the coat up and helped mercedes put it on  i should have thought of you he said  but i seemed to feel warm the coats a little large we might wrap it round you twice  mercedes smiled and lightly thanked him in spanish  the flash of mood was in direct contrast to the appealing passionate and tragic states in which he had successively viewed her and it gave him a vivid impression of what vivacity and charm she might possess under happy conditions  he was about to start when he observed that ladd had halted and was peering ahead in evident caution  mercedes horse began to stamp impatiently raised his ears and head and acted as if he was about to neigh  a warning hist from ladd bade dick to put a quieting hand on the horse  lash came noiselessly forward to join his companion the two then listened and watched  an uneasy yet thrilling stir ran through gales veins  this scene was not fancy  these men of the ranges had heard or seen or scented danger  it was all real as tangible and sure as the touch of mercedess hand upon his arm  probably for her the night had terrors beyond gales power to comprehend  he looked down into the desert and would have felt no surprise at anything hidden away among the bristling cactus the dark winding arroyos the shadowed rocks with their moonlit tips the ragged plain leading to the black bold mountains the wind appeared to blow softly with an almost imperceptible moan over the desert  that was a new sound to gale but he heard nothing more  presently lash went to the rear and ladd started ahead  the progress now however was considerably slower not owing to a roadfor that became betterbut probably owing to caution exercised by the cowboy guide  at the end of a half hour this marked deliberation changed and the horses followed ladds at a gait that put gale to his best walkingpaces  meanwhile the moon soared high above the black corrugated peaks the gray the gloom the shadow whitened  the clearing of the dark foreground appeared to lift a distant veil and show endless aisles of desert reaching down between dim horizonbounding ranges  gale gazed abroad knowing that as this night was the first time for him to awake to consciousness of a vague wonderful other self so it was one wherein he began to be aware of an encroaching presence of physical thingsthe immensity of the starstudded sky the soaring moon the bleak mysterious mountains and limitless slope and plain and ridge and valley  these things in all their magnificence had not been unnoticed by him before only now they spoke a different meaning a voice that he had never heard called him to see to feel the vast hard externals of heaven and earth all that represented the open the free silence and solitude and space  once more his thoughts like his steps were halted by ladds actions the cowboy reined in his horse listened a moment then swung down out of the saddle  he raised a cautioning hand to the others then slipped into the gloom and disappeared  gale marked that the halt had been made in a ridged and cutup pass between low mesas he could see the columns of cactus standing out black against the moonwhite sky  the horses were evidently tiring for they showed no impatience  gale heard their panting breaths and also the bark of some animala dog or a coyote  it sounded like a dog and this led gale to wonder if there was any house near at hand  to the right up under the ledges some distance away stood two square black objects too uniform he thought to be rocks  while he was peering at them uncertain what to think the shrill whistle of a horse pealed out to be followed by the rattling of hoofs on hard stone  then a dog barked  at the same moment that ladd hurriedly appeared in the road a light shone out and danced before one of the square black objects  keep close an dont make no noise he whispered and led his horse at right angles off the road  gale followed leading mercedess horse  as he turned he observed that lash also had dismounted  to keep closely at ladds heels without brushing the cactus or stumbling over rocks and depressions was a task gale found impossible after he had been stabbed several times by the bayonetlike spikes which seemed invisible the matter of caution became equally one of selfpreservation  both the cowboys dick had observed wore leather chaps  it was no easy matter to lead a spirited horse through the dark winding lanes walled by thorns  mercedes horse often balked and had to be coaxed and carefully guided  dick concluded that ladd was making a wide detour  the position of certain stars grown familiar during the march veered round from one side to another  dick saw that the travel was fast but by no means noiseless  the pack animals at times crashed and ripped through the narrow places  it seemed to gale that any one within a mile could have heard these sounds  from the tops of knolls or ridges he looked back trying to locate the mesas where the light had danced and the dog had barked alarm  he could not distinguish these two rocky eminences from among many rising in the background  presently ladd let out into a wider lane that appeared to run straight the cowboy mounted his horse and this fact convinced gale that they had circled back to the road  the march proceeded then once more at a good steady silent walk  when dick consulted his watch he was amazed to see that the hour was still early  how much had happened in little time  he now began to be aware that the night was growing colder and strange to him he felt something damp that in a country he knew he would have recognized as dew he had not been aware there was dew on the desert  the wind blew stronger the stars shone whiter the sky grew darker and the moon climbed toward the zenith  the road stretched level for miles then crossed arroyos and ridges wound between mounds of broken ruined rock found a level again and then began a long ascent dick asked mercedes if she was cold and she answered that she was speaking especially of her feet which were growing numb then she asked to be helped down to walk awhile  at first she was cold and lame and accepted the helping hand dick proffered  after a little however she recovered and went on without assistance dick could scarcely believe his eyes as from time to time he stole a sidelong glance at this silent girl who walked with lithe and rapid stride  she was wrapped in his long coat yet it did not hide her slender grace  he could not see her face which was concealed by the black mantle  a lowspoken word from ladd recalled gale to the question of surroundings and of possible dangers  ladd had halted a few yards ahead  they had reached the summit of what was evidently a high ridge which sloped with much greater steepness on the far side it was only after a few more forward steps however that dick could see down the slope  then full in view flashed a bright campfire around which clustered a group of dark figures  they were encamped in a wide arroyo where horses could be seen grazing in black patches of grass between clusters of trees  a second look at the campers told gale they were mexicans  at this moment lash came forward to join ladd and the two spent a long uninterrupted moment studying the arroyo  a hoarse laugh faint yet distinct floated up on the cool wind  well laddy whatre you makin of that outfit inquired lash speaking softly  same as any of them raider outfits replied ladd  theyre across the line for beef  but theyll run off any good stock  as hoss thieves these rebels have got em all beat  that outfit is waitin till its late  theres a ranch up the arroyo  gale heard the first speaker curse under his breath  sure i feel the same said ladd  but weve got a girl an the young man to look after not to mention our pack outfit an were huntin for a job not a fight old hoss  keep on your chaps  nothin to it but head south for the rio forlorn  youre talkin sense now jim  i wish wed headed that way long ago but it aint strange id want to travel away from the border thinkin of the girl  jim we cant go round this greaser outfit an strike the road again  too rough  so well have to give up gettin to san felipe  perhaps its just as well laddy  rio forlorn is on the border line but its country where these rebels aint been yet  wait till they learn of the oasis an beldins hosses exclaimed laddy  im not anticipatin peace anywhere along the border jim but we cant go ahead we cant go back  whatll we do laddy  its a hike to beldins ranch  an if we get there in daylight some greaser will see the girl before beldin can hide her  itll get talked about  the newsll travel to casita like sage balls before the wind  shore we wont ride into rio forlorn in the daytime  lets slip the packs jim  we can hid them off in the cactus an come back after them  with the young man ridin we  the whispering was interrupted by a loud ringing neigh that whistled up from the arroyo  one of the horses had scented the travelers on the ridge top  the indifference of the mexicans changed to attention  ladd and lash turned back and led the horses into the first opening on the south side of the road  there was nothing more said at the moment and manifestly the cowboys were in a hurry  gale had to run in the open places to keep up  when they did stop it was welcome to gale for he had begun to fall behind  the packs were slipped securely tied and hidden in a mesquite clump ladd strapped a blanket around one of the horses  his next move was to take off his chaps  gale youre wearin boots an by liftin your feet you can beat the cactus he whispered  but thethemiss castaneda shell be torn all to pieces unless she puts these on  please tell heran hurry  dick took the caps and going up to mercedes he explained the situation  she laughed evidently at his embarrassed earnestness and slipped out of the saddle  senor chapparejos and i are not strangers she said  deftly and promptly she equipped herself and then gale helped her into the saddle called to her horse and started off  lash directed gale to mount the other saddled horse and go next  dick had not ridden a hundred yards behind the trotting leaders before he had sundry painful encounters with reaching cactus arms the horse missed these by a narrow margin  dicks knees appeared to be in line and it became necessary for him to lift them high and let his boots take the onslaught of the spikes  he was at home in the saddle and the accomplishment was about the only one he possessed that had been of any advantage during his sojourn in the west  ladd pursued a zigzag course southward across the desert trotting down the aisles cantering in wide bare patches walking through the clumps of cacti  the desert seemed all of a sameness to dicka wilderness of rocks and jagged growths hemmed in by lowering ranges always looking close yet never growing any nearer the moon slanted back toward the west losing its white radiance and the gloom of the earlier evening began to creep into the washes and to darken under the mesas  by and by ladd entered an arroyo and here the travelers turned and twisted with the meanderings of a dry stream bed  at the head of a canyon they had to take once more to the rougher ground  always it led down always it grew rougher more rolling with wider bare spaces always the black ranges loomed close  gale became chilled to the bone and his clothes were damp and cold his knees smarted from the wounds of the poisoned thorns and his right hand was either swollen stiff or too numb to move  moreover he was tiring  the excitement the long walk the miles on miles of jolting trotthese had wearied him  mercedes must be made of steel he thought to stand all that she had been subjected to and yet when the stars were paling and dawn perhaps not far away stay in the saddle  so dick gale rode on drowsier for each mile and more and more giving the horse a choice of ground  sometimes a prod from a murderous spine roused dick  a grayness had blotted out the waning moon in the west and the clear dark starry sky overhead  once when gale thinking to fight his weariness raised his head he saw that one of the horses in the lead was riderless  ladd was carrying mercedes  dick marveled that her collapse had not come sooner another time rousing himself again he imagined they were now on a good hard road  it seemed that hours passed though he knew only little time had elapsed when once more he threw off the spell of weariness  he heard a dog bark  tall trees lined the open lane down which he was riding presently in the gray gloom he saw low square houses with flat roofs ladd turned off to the left down another lane gloomy between trees every few rods there was one of the squat houses  this lane opened into wider lighter space  the cold air bore a sweet perfumewhether of flowers or fruit dick could not tell  ladd rode on for perhaps a quarter of a mile though it seemed interminably long to dick  a grove of trees loomed dark in the gray morning  ladd entered it and was lost in the shade  dick rode on among trees  presently he heard voices and soon another house low and flat like the others but so long he could not see the farther end stood up blacker than the trees  as he dismounted cramped and sore he could scarcely stand  lash came alongside he spoke and some one with a big hearty voice replied to him then it seemed to dick that he was led into blackness like pitch where presently he felt blankets thrown on him and then his drowsy faculties faded    iv  forlorn river  when dick opened his eyes a flood of golden sunshine streamed in at the open window under which he lay  his first thought was one of blank wonder as to where in the world he happened to be  the room was large square adobewalled  it was littered with saddles harness blankets upon the floor was a bed spread out upon a tarpaulin  probably this was where some one had slept  the sight of huge dusty spurs a gun belt with sheath and gun and a pair of leather chaps bristling with broken cactus thorns recalled to dick the cowboys the ride mercedes and the whole strange adventure that had brought him there  he did not recollect having removed his boots indeed upon second thought he knew he had not done so  but there they stood upon the floor  ladd and lash must have taken them off when he was so exhausted and sleepy that he could not tell what was happening he felt a dead weight of complete lassitude and he did not want to move  a sudden pain in his hand caused him to hold it up  it was black and blue swollen to almost twice its normal size and stiff as a board  the knuckles were skinned and crusted with dry blood dick soliloquized that it was the worstlooking hand he had seen since football days and that it would inconvenience him for some time  a warm dry fragrant breeze came through the window  dick caught again the sweet smell of flowers or fruit  he heard the fluttering of leaves the murmur of running water the twittering of birds then the sound of approaching footsteps and voices  the door at the far end of the room was open  through it he saw poles of peeled wood upholding a porch roof a bench rose bushes in bloom grass and beyond these brightgreen foliage of trees  he shore was sleepin when i looked in an hour ago said a voice that dick recognized as ladds  let him sleep came the reply in deep goodnatured tones  mrs b says the girls never moved  must have been a tough ride for them both  forty miles through cactus  young gale hoofed darn near half the way replied ladd  we tried to make him ride one of our hosses  if we had wed never got here  a walk like thatd killed me an jim  well laddy im right down glad to see you boys and ill do all i can for the young couple said the other  but im doing some worry here dont mistake me  about your stock  ive got only a few head of cattle at the oasis now im worrying some mostly about my horses  the u s is doing some worrying too dont mistake me  the rebels have worked west and north as far as casita  there are no cavalrymen along the line beyond casita and there cant be  its practically waterless desert  but these rebels are desert men  they could cross the line beyond the rio forlorn and smuggle arms into mexico  of course my job is to keep tab on chinese and japs trying to get into the us from magdalena bay  but im supposed to patrol the border line  im going to hire some rangers now im not so afraid of being shot up though out in this lonely place theres danger of it what im afraid of most is losing that bunch of horses  if any rebels come this far or if they ever hear of my horses theyre going to raid me  you know what those guerrilla mexicans will do for horses theyre crazy on horse flesh  they know fine horses  they breed the finest in the world  so i dont sleep nights any more  reckon me an jim might as well tie up with your for a spell beldin weve been ridin up an down arizona tryin to keep out of sight of wire fences  laddy its open enough around forlorn river to satisfy even an oldtime cowpuncher like you laughed belding  id take your staying on as some favor dont mistake me  perhaps i can persuade the young man gale to take a job with me  thats shore likely  he said he had no money no friends  an if a scrappers all youre lookin for hell do replied ladd with a dry chuckle  mrs b will throw some broncho capers round this ranch when she hears im going to hire a stranger  why  well theres nell and you said this gale was a young american my wife will be scared to death for fear nell will fall in love with him  laddy choked off a laugh then evidently slapped his knee or beldings for there was a resounding smack  hes a finespoken goodlooking chap you said went on belding  shore he is said laddy warmly  what do you say jim  by this time dick gales ears began to burn and he was trying to make himself deaf when he wanted to hear every little word  husky young fellow nice voice steady clear eyes kinda proud i thought an some handsome he was replied jim lash  maybe i ought to think twice before taking a stranger into my family said belding seriously  well i guess hes all right laddy being the cavalrymans friend  no bum or lunger  he must be all right  bum  lunger  say didnt i tell you i shook hands with this boy an was plumb glad to meet him demanded laddy with considerable heat manifestly he had been affronted tom beldin hes a gentleman an he could lick you inin half a second  how about that jim  less time replied lash  tom heres my stand  young gale can have my hoss my gun anythin of mine  aw i didnt mean to insult you boys dont mistake me said belding course hes all right  the object of this conversation lay quiet upon his bed thrilling and amazed at being so championed by the cowboys delighted with beldings idea of employing him and much amused with the quaint seriousness of the three  hows the young man called a womans voice  it was kind and mellow and earnest  gale heard footsteps on flagstones  hes asleep yet wife replied belding  guess he was pretty much knocked out ill close the door there so we wont wake him  there were slow soft steps then the door softly closed  but the fact scarcely made a perceptible difference in the sound of the voices outside  laddy and jim are going to stay went on belding  itll be like the old panhandle days a little  im powerful glad to have the boys nellie  you know i meant to sent to casita to ask them well see some trouble before the

he like  well im not long acquainted never saw him by day but i was some tolerable took with him  an jim here jim says the young man can have his gun an his hoss  wonderful  laddy what on earth did this stranger do to win you cowboys in just one night  ill shore have to tell you  me an jim were watchin a game of cards in the del sol saloon in casita  thats across the line we had acquaintancesfour fellows from the cross bar outfit where we worked a while back  this del sol is a billiard hall saloon restaurant an the like  an it was full of greasers some of camps rebels were there drinkin an playin games then pretty soon in come rojas with some of his outfit they were packin guns an kept to themselves off to one side i didnt give them a second look till jim said he reckoned there was somethin in the wind  then carelesslike i began to peek at rojas  they call rojas the dandy rebel an he shore looked the part  it made me sick to see him in all that lace an glitter knowin him to be the cutthroat robber he is its no oncommon sight to see excited greasers  theyre all crazy but this bandit was shore some agitated  he kept his men in a tight bunch round a table  he talked an waved his hands  he was actually shakin  his eyes had a wild glare  now i figgered that trouble was brewin most likely for the little casita garrison people seemed to think campo an rojas would join forces to oust the federals  jim thought rojass excitement was at the hatchin of some plot  anyway we didnt join no card games an without pretendin to we was some watchful  a little while afterward i seen a fellow standin in the restaurant door  he was a young american dressed in corduroys and boots like a prospector  you know its no onusual fact to see prospectors in these parts  what made me think twice about this one was how big he seemed how he filled up that door  he looked round the saloon an when he spotted rojas he sorta jerked up  then he pulled his slouch hat lopsided an began to stagger down down the steps  first off i made shore he was drunk  but i remembered he didnt seem drunk before  it was some queer  so i watched that young man  he reeled around the room like a fellow who was drunkern a lord nobody but me seemed to notice him  then he began to stumble over poolplayers an get his feet tangled up in chairs an bump against tables he got some pretty hard looks  he came round our way an all of a sudden he seen us cowboys  he gave another start like the one when he first seen rojas then he made for us  i tipped jim off that somethin was doin  when he got close he straightened up put back his slouch hat an looked at us  then i saw his face  it sorta electrified yours truly it was white with veins standin out an eyes flamina face of fury i was plumb amazed didnt know what to think then this queer young man shot some cool polite words at me an jim  he was only bluffin at bein drunkhe meant to rush rojas to start a rough house  the bandit was after a girl  this girl was in the hotel an she was the sweetheart of a soldier the young fellows friend  the hotel was watched by rojass guards an the plan was to make a fuss an get the girl away in the excitement well jim an me got a hint of our bein americansthat cowboys generally had a name for loyalty to women  then this amazin chapyou cant imagine how scornfulsaid for me an jim to watch him  before i could catch my breath an figger out what he meant by rush an rough house he had knocked over a table an crowded some greaser half off the map  one little funny man leaped up like a wild monkey an began to screech  an in another second he was in the air upside down  when he lit he laid there  then quickern i can tell you the young man dove at rojas  like a mad steer on the rampage he charged rojas an his men  the whole outfit went downsmash  i figgered then what rush meant  the young fellow came up out of the pile with rojas an just like id sling an empty sack along the floor he sent the bandit  but swift as that went he was on top of rojas before the chairs an tables had stopped rollin  i woke up then an made for the center of the room jim with me i began to shoot out the lamps  jim throwed his guns on the crazy rebels an i was afraid thered be blood spilled before i could get the room dark  beins shore busy i lost sight of the young fellow for a second or so an when i got an eye free for him i seen a greaser about to knife him  think i was some considerate of the greaser by only shootin his arm off  then i cracked the last lamp an in the hullabaloo me an jim vamoosed  we made tracks for our hosses an packs an was hittin the san felipe road when we run right plumb into the young man  well he said his name was galedick gale  the girl was with him safe an well but her sweetheart the soldier bein away without leave had to go back sudden  there shore was some trouble for jim an me heard shootin gale said he had no money no friends was a stranger in a desert country an he was distracted to know how to help the girl  so me an jim started off with them for san felipe got switched and then we headed for the rio forlorn  oh i think he was perfectly splendid exclaimed the girl  shore he was  only nell you cant lay no claim to bein the original discoverer of that fact  but laddy you havent told me what he looks like  at this juncture dick gale felt it absolutely impossible for him to play the eavesdropper any longer  quietly he rolled out of bed the voices still sounded close outside and it was only by effort that he kept from further listening  beldings kindly interest laddys blunt and sincere cowboy eulogy the girls sweet eagerness and praisethese warmed gales heart  he had fallen among simple people into whose lives the advent of an unknown man was welcome he found himself in a singularly agitated mood  the excitement the thrill the difference felt in himself experienced the preceding night had extended on into his present  and the possibilities suggested by the conversation he had unwittingly overheard added sufficiently to the other feelings to put him into a peculiarly receptive state of mind  he was wild to be one of the belding rangers  the idea of riding a horse in the open desert with a dangerous duty to perform seemed to strike him with an appealing force  something within him went out to the cowboys to this blunt and kind belding he was afraid to meet the girl  if every man who came along fell in love with this sweetvoiced nell then what hope had he to escapenow when his whole inner awakening betokened a change of spirit hope a finding of real worth real good real power in himself  he did not understand wholly yet he felt ready to ride to fight to love the desert to love these outdoor men to love a woman  that beautiful spanish girl had spoken to something dead in him and it had quickened to life  the sweet voice of an audacious unseen girl warned him that presently a still more wonderful thing would happen to him  gale imagined he made noise enough as he clumsily pulled on his boots yet the voices split by a merry laugh kept on murmuring outside the door  it was awkward for him having only one hand available to lace up his boots  he looked out of the window evidently this was at the end of the house  there was a flagstone walk beside which ran a ditch full of swift muddy water  it made a pleasant sound  there were trees strange of form and color to to him  he heard bees birds chickens saw the red of roses and green of grass  then he saw close to the wall a tub full of water and a bench upon which lay basin soap towel comb and brush  the window was also a door for under it there was a step  gale hesitated a moment then went out  he stepped naturally hoping and expecting that the cowboys would hear him  but nobody came awkwardly with left hand he washed his face  upon a nail in the wall hung a little mirror by the aid of which dick combed and brushed his hair  he imagined he looked a most haggard wretch  with that he faced forward meaning to go round the corner of the house to greet the cowboys and these newfound friends  dick had taken but one step when he was halted by laugher and the patter of light feet  from close around the corner pealed out that sweet voice  dad youll have your wish and mama will be wild  dick saw a little foot sweep into view a white dress then the swiftly moving form of a girl  she was looking backward  dad i shall fall in love with your new ranger  i willi have  then she plumped squarely into dicks arms  she started back violently  dick saw a fair face and darkblue audaciously flashing eyes swift as lightning their expression changed to surprise fear wonder  for an instant they were level with dicks grave questioning suddenly sweetly she blushed  ohh she faltered  then the blush turned to a scarlet fire  she whirled past him and like a white gleam was gone  dick became conscious of the quickened beating of his heart  he experienced a singular exhilaration  that moment had been the one for which he had been ripe the event upon which strange circumstances had been rushing him  with a couple of strides he turned the corner  laddy and lash were there talking to a man of burly form  seen by day both cowboys were grayhaired redskinned and weatherbeaten with lean sharp features and gray eyes so much alike that they might have been brothers  hello theres the young fellow spoke up the burly man  mr gale im glad to meet you  my names belding  his greeting was as warm as his handclasp was long and hard gale saw a heavy man of medium height  his head was large and covered with grizzled locks  he wore a shortcropped mustache and chin beard  his skin was brown and his dark eyes beamed with a genial light  the cowboys were as cordial as if dick had been their friend for years  young man did you run into anything as you came out asked belding with twinkling eyes  why yes i met something white and swift flying by replied dick  did she see you asked laddy  i think so but she didnt wait for me to introduce myself  that was nell burton my girlstepdaughter i should say said belding  shes sure some whirlwind as laddy calls her  come lets go in and meet the wife  the house was long like a barracks with porch extending all the way and doors every dozen paces  when dick was ushered into a sittingroom he was amazed at the light and comfort  this room had two big windows and a door opening into a patio where there were luxuriant grass roses in bloom and flowering trees  he heard a slow splashing of water  in mrs belding gale found a woman of noble proportions and striking appearance  her hair was white  she had a strong serious welllined face that bore haunting evidences of past beauty  the gaze she bent upon him was almost piercing in its intensity  her greeting which seemed to dick rather slow in coming was kind though not cordial gales first thought after he had thanked these good people for their hospitality was to inquire about mercedes  he was informed that the spanish girl had awakened with a considerable fever and nervousness when however her anxiety had been allayed and her thirst relieved she had fallen asleep again  mrs belding said the girl had suffered no great hardship other than mental and would very soon be rested and well  now gale said belding when his wife had excused herself to get supper the boys jim and laddy told me about you and the mixup at casita  ill be glad to take care of the girl till its safe for your soldier friend to get her out of the country  that wont be very soon dont mistake me i dont want to seem overcurious about youladdy has interested me in youand straight out id like to know what you propose to do now  i havent any plans replied dick and taking the moment as propitious he decided to speak frankly concerning himself  i just drifted down here  my home is in chicago  when i left school some years agoim twentyfive nowi went to work for my father heshe has business interests there  i tried all kinds of inside jobs  i couldnt please my father  i guess i put no real heart in my work the fact was i didnt know how to work  the governor and i didnt exactly quarrel but he hurt my feelings and i quit six months or more ago i came west and have knocked about from wyoming southwest to the border  i tried to find congenial work but nothing came my way to tell you frankly mr belding i suppose i didnt much care  i believe though that all the time i didnt know what i wanted  ive learnedwell just lately  what do you want to do interposed belding  i want a mans job  i want to do things with my hands  i want action  i want to be outdoors  belding nodded his head as if he understood that and he began to speak again cut something short then went on hesitatingly  galeyou could go home againto the old manitd be all right  mr belding theres nothing shady in my past  the governor would be glad to have me home  thats the only consolation ive got but im not going  im broke  i wont be a tramp  and its up to me to do something  howd you like to be a border ranger asked belding laying a hand on dicks knee  part of my job here is united states inspector of immigration  ive got that boundary line to patrolto keep out chinks and japs  this revolution has added complications and im looking for smugglers and raiders here any day  youll not be hired by the u s youll simply be my ranger same as laddy and jim who have promised to work for me  ill pay you well give you a room here furnish everything down to guns and the finest horse you ever saw in your life  your job wont be safe and healthy sometimes but itll be a mans jobdont mistake me you can gamble on having things to do outdoors  now what do you say  i accept and i thank youi cant say how much replied gale earnestly  good  thats settled  lets go out and tell laddy and jim  both boys expressed satisfaction at the turn of affairs and then with belding they set out to take gale around the ranch  the house and several outbuildings were constructed of adobe which according to belding retained the summer heat on into winter and the winter cold on into summer  these grayred mud habitations were hideous to look at and this fact perhaps made their really comfortable interiors more vividly a contrast  the wide grounds were covered with luxuriant grass and flowers and different kinds of trees  gales interest led him to ask about fig trees and pomegranates and especially about a beautiful specimen that belding called palo verde  belding explained that the luxuriance of this desert place was owing to a few springs and the dammedup waters of the rio forlorn before he had come to the oasis it had been inhabited by a papago indian tribe and a few peon families  the oasis lay in an arroyo a mile wide and sloped southwest for some ten miles or more the river went dry most of the year but enough water was stored in flood season to irrigate the gardens and alfalfa fields  ive got one neverfailing spring on my place said belding  fine sweet water  you know what that means in the desert  i like this oasis  the longer i live here the better i like it  theres not a spot in southern arizona thatll compare with this valley for water or grass or wood  its beautiful and healthy  forlorn and lonely yes especially for women like my wife and nell but i like it and between you and me boys ive got something up my sleeve  theres gold dust in the arroyos and theres mineral up in the mountains if we only had water  this hamlet has steadily grown since i took up a station here  why casita is no place beside forlorn river pretty soon the southern pacific will shoot a railroad branch out here  there are possibilities and i want you boys to stay with me and get in on the ground floor  i wish this rebel war was over well here are the corrals and the fields  gale take a look at that bunch of horses  beldings last remark was made as he led his companions out of shady gardens into the open  gale saw an adobe shed and a huge pen fenced by strangely twisted and contorted branches or trunks of mesquite and beyond these wide flat fields greena dark rich greenand dotted with beautiful horses  there were whites and blacks and bays and grays  in his admiration gale searched his memory to see if he could remember the like of these magnificent animals and had to admit that the only ones he could compare with them were the arabian steeds  every ranch loves his horses said belding  when i was in the panhandle i had some fine stock  but these are mexican  they came from durango where they were bred  mexican horses are the finest in the world bar none  shore i reckon i savvy why you dont sleep nights drawled laddy i see a greaser out thereno its an indian  thats my papago herdsman  i keep watch over the horses now day and night  lord how id hate to have rojas or salazarany of those bandit rebelsfind my horses gale can you ride  dick modestly replied that he could according to the eastern idea of horsemanship  you dont need to be half horse to ride one of that bunch  but over there in the other field ive ironjawed broncos i wouldnt want you to tackleexcept to see the fun  ive an outlaw ill gamble even laddy cant ride  so  how muchll you gamble asked laddy instantly  the ringing of a bell which belding said was a call to supper turned the men back toward the house  facing that way gale saw dark beetling ridges rising from the oasis and leading up to bare black mountains  he had heard belding call them no name mountains and somehow the appellation suited those lofty mysterious frowning peaks  it was not until they reached the house and were about to go in that belding chanced to discover gales crippled hand  what an awful hand he exclaimed  where the devil did you get that  i stove in my knuckles on rojas replied dick  you did that in one punch  say im glad it wasnt me you hit why didnt you tell me  thats a bad hand  those cuts are full of dirt and sand  inflammations setting in  its got to be dressed  nell he called  there was no answer  he called again louder  mother wheres the girl  shes there in the diningroom replied mrs belding  did she hear me he inquired impatiently  of course  nell roared belding  this brought results  dick saw a glimpse of golden hair and a white dress in the door  but they were not visible longer than a second  dad whats the matter asked a voice that was still as sweet as formerly but now rather small and constrained  bring the antiseptics cotton bandagesand things out here hurry now  belding fetched a pail of water and a basin from the kitchen  his wife followed him out and upon seeing dicks hand was all solicitude then dick heard light quick footsteps but he did not look up  nell this is mr galedick gale who came with the boys last last night said belding  hes got an awful hand  got it punching that greaser rojas  i want you to dress it gale this is my stepdaughter nell burton of whom i spoke  shes some good when theres somebody sick or hurt  shove out your fist my boy and let her get at it  suppers nearly ready  dick felt that same strange quickening heart throb yet he had never been cooler in his life  more than anything else in the world he wanted to look at nell burton however divining that the situation might be embarrassing to her he refrained from looking up  she began to bathe his injured knuckles  he noted the softness the deftness of her touch and then it seemed her fingers were not quite as steady as they might have been  still in a moment they appeared to become surer in their work  she had beautiful hands not too large though certainly not small and they were strong brown supple  he observed next with stealthy upwardstealing glance that she had rolled up her sleeves exposing fine round arms graceful in line  her skin was brownno it was more gold than brown  it had a wonderful clear tint dick stoically lowered his eyes then putting off as long as possible the alluring moment when he was to look into her face  that would be a fateful moment  he played with a certain strange joy of anticipation when however she sat down beside him and rested his injured hand in her lap as she cut bandages she was so thrillingly near that he yielded to an irrepressible desire to look up  she had a sweet fair face warmly tinted with that same healthy goldenbrown sunburn  her hair was light gold and abundant a waving mass  her eyes were shaded by long downcast lashes yet through them he caught a gleam of blue  despite the stir within him gale seeing she was now absorbed in her task critically studied her with a second closer gaze she was a sweet wholesome joyous pretty girl  shore it musta hurt replied laddy who sat an interested spectator  yes i confess it did replied dick slowly with his eyes on nells face  but i didnt mind  the girls lashes swept up swiftly in surprise  she had taken his words literally  but the darkblue eyes met his for only a fleeting second  then the warm tint in her cheeks turned as red as her lips hurriedly she finished tying the bandage and rose to her feet  i thank you said gale also rising  with that belding appeared in the doorway and finding the operation concluded called them in to supper  dick had the use of only one arm and he certainly was keenly aware of the shy silent girl across the table but in spite of these considerable handicaps he eclipsed both hungry cowboys in the assault upon mrs beldings bounteous supper belding talked the cowboys talked more or less  mrs belding put in a word now and then and dick managed to find brief intervals when it was possible for him to say yes or no  he observed gratefully that no one round the table seemed to be aware of his enormous appetite  after supper having a favorable opportunity when for a moment no one was at hand dick went out through the yard past the gardens and fields and climbed the first knoll  from that vantage point he looked out over the little hamlet somewhat to his right and was surprised at its extent its considerable number of adobe houses  the overhanging mountains ragged and darkening a great heave of splintered rock rather chilled and affronted him  westward the setting sun gilded a spiked frostcolored limitless expanse of desert  it awed gale  everywhere rose blunt broken ranges or isolated groups of mountains  yet the desert stretched away down between and beyond them  when the sun set and gale could not see so far he felt a relief  that grand and austere attraction of distance gone he saw the desert nearer at handthe valley at his feet  what a strange gray somber place  there was a lighter strip of gray winding down between darker hues  this he realized presently was the river bed and he saw how the pools of water narrowed and diminished in size till they lost themselves in gray sand  this was the rainy season near its end and here a little river struggled hopelessly forlornly to live in the desert  he received a potent impression of the nature of that blasted ageworn waste which he had divined was to give him strength and work and love    v  a desert rose  belding assigned dick to a little room which had no windows but two doors one opening into the patio the other into the yard on the west side of the house  it contained only the barest necessities for comfort  dick mentioned the baggage he had left in the hotel at casita and it was beldings opinion that to try to recover his property would be rather risky on the moment richard gale was probably not popular with the mexicans at casita  so dick bade goodby to fine suits of clothes and linen with a feeling that as he had said farewell to an idle and useless past it was just as well not to have any old luxuries as reminders  as he possessed however not a thing save the clothes on his back and not even a handkerchief he expressed regret that he had come to forlorn river a beggar  beggar hell exploded belding with his eyes snapping in the lamplight  moneys the last thing we think of out here  all the same gale if you stick youll be rich  it wouldnt surprise me replied dick thoughtfully  but he was not thinking of material wealth  then as he viewed his stained and torn shirt he laughed and said belding while im getting rich id like to have some respectable clothes  weve a little mex store in town and what you cant get there the women folks will make for you  when dick lay down he was dully conscious of pain and headache that he did not feel well  despite this and a mind thronging with memories and anticipations he succumbed to weariness and soon fell asleep  it was light when he awoke but a strange brightness seen through what seemed blurred eyes  a moment passed before his mind worked clearly and then he had to make an effort to think  he was dizzy when he essayed to lift his right arm an excruciating pain made him desist then he discovered that his arm was badly swollen and the hand had burst its bandages  the injured member was red angry inflamed and twice its normal size  he felt hot all over and a raging headache consumed him  belding came stamping into the room  hello dick  do you know its late  hows the busted fist this morning  dick tried to sit up but his effort was a failure  he got about half up then felt himself weakly sliding back  i guessim pretty sick he said  he saw belding lean over him feel his face and speak and then everything seemed to drift not into darkness but into some region where he had dim perceptions of gray moving things and of voices that were remote  then there came an interval when all was blank he knew not whether it was one of minutes or hours but after it he had a clearer mind  he slept awakened during nighttime and slept again when he again unclosed his eyes the room was sunny and cool with a fragrant breeze that blew through the open door dick felt better but he had no particular desire to move or talk or eat  he had however a burning thirst  mrs belding visited him often her husband came in several times and once nell slipped in noiselessly  even this last event aroused no interest in dick  on the next day he was very much improved  weve been afraid of blood poisoning said belding  but my wife thinks the dangers past  youll have to rest that arm for a while  ladd and jim came peeping in at the door  come in boys  he can have companythe more the betterif itll keep him content  he mustnt move thats all  the cowboys entered slow easy cool kindvoiced  shore its tough said ladd after he had greeted dick  you look used up  jim lash wagged his halfbald sunburned head musta been moren tough for rojas  gale laddy tells me one of our neighbors fellow named carter is going to casita put in belding  heres a chance to get word to your friend the soldier  oh that will be fine exclaimed dick  i declare id forgotten thorne how is miss castaneda  i hope  shes all right gale  been up and around the patio for two days like all the spanishthe real thingshes made of damascus steel weve been getting acquainted  she and nell made friends at once ill call them in  he closed the door leading out into the yard explaining that he did not want to take chances of mercedess presence becoming known to neighbors  then he went to the patio and called  both girls came in mercedes leading  like nell she wore white and she had a red rose in her hand  dick would scarcely have recognized anything about her except her eyes and the way she carried her little head and her beauty burst upon him strange and anew  she was swift impulsive in her movements to reach his side  senor i am so sorry you were illso happy you are better  dick greeted her offering his left hand gravely apologizing for the fact that owing to a late infirmity he could not offer the right her smile exquisitely combined sympathy gratitude admiration  then dick spoke to nell likewise offering his hand which she took shyly her reply was a murmured unintelligible one but her eyes were glad and the tint in her cheeks threatened to rival the hue of the rose she carried  everybody chatted then except nell who had apparently lost her voice presently dick remembered to speak of the matter of getting news to thorne  senor may i write to him  will some one take a letter i shall hear from him she said and her white hands emphasized her words  assuredly  i guess poor thorne is almost crazy  ill write to him no i cant with this crippled hand  thatll be all right gale said belding  nell will write for you she writes all my letters  so belding arranged it and mercedes flew away to her room to write while nell fetched pen and paper and seated herself beside gales bed to take his dictation  what with watching nell and trying to catch her glance and listening to beldings talk with the cowboys dick was hard put to it to dictate any kind of a creditable letter  nell met his gaze once then no more the color came and went in her cheeks and sometimes when he told her to write so and so there was a demure smile on her lips  she was laughing at him  and belding was talking over the risks involved in a trip to casita  shore ill ride in with the letters ladd said  no you wont replied belding  that bandit outfit will be laying for you  well i reckon if they was i wouldnt be oncommon grieved  ill tell you boys ill ride in myself with carter  theres business i can see to and im curious to know what the rebels are doing  laddy keep one eye open while im gone  see the horses are locked up gale im going to casita myself  ought to get back tomorrow some time  ill be ready to start in an hour  have your letter ready  and sayif you want to write home its a chance sometimes we dont go to the p o in a month  he tramped out followed by the tall cowboys and then dick was enabled to bring his letter to a close  mercedes came back and her eyes were shining  dick imagined a letter received from her would be something of an event for a fellow  then remembering beldings suggestion he decided to profit by it  may i trouble you to write another for me asked dick as he received the letter from nell  its no trouble im sureid be pleased she replied  that was altogether a wonderful speech of hers dick thought because the words were the first coherent ones she had spoken to him  may i stay asked mercedes smiling  by all means he answered and then he settled back and began  presently gale paused partly because of genuine emotion and stole a look from under his hand at nell  she wrote swiftly and her downcast face seemed to be softer in its expression of sweetness  if she had in the very least been drawn to him  but that was absurdimpossible  when dick finished dictating his eyes were upon mercedes who sat smiling curious and sympathetic  how responsive she was he heard the hasty scratch of nells pen  he looked at nell presently she rose holding out his letter  he was just in time to see a wave of red recede from her face  she gave him one swift gaze unconscious searching then averted it and turned away  she left the room with mercedes before he could express his thanks  but that strange speaking flash of eyes remained to haunt and torment gale  it was indescribably sweet and provocative of thoughts that he believed were wild without warrant  something within him danced for very joy and the next instant he was conscious of wistful doubt a gravity that he could not understand it dawned upon him that for the brief instant when nell had met his gaze she had lost her shyness  it was a womans questioning eyes that had pierced through him  during the rest of the day gale was content to lie still on his bed thinking and dreaming dozing at intervals and watching the lights change upon the mountain peaks feeling the warm fragrant desert wind that blew in upon him  he seemed to have lost the faculty of estimating time  a long while strong in its effect upon him appeared to have passed since he had met thorne  he accepted things as he felt them and repudiated his intelligence his old inquisitive habit of mind returned  did he love nell was he only attracted for the moment what was the use of worrying about her or himself  he refused to answer and deliberately gave himself up to dreams of her sweet face and of that last darkblue glance  next day he believed he was well enough to leave his room but mrs belding would not permit him to do so  she was kind softhanded motherly and she was always coming in to minister to his comfort this attention was sincere not in the least forced yet gale felt that the friendliness so manifest in the others of the household did not extend to her  he was conscious of something that a little thought persuaded him was antagonism  it surprised and hurt him  he had never been much of a success with girls and young married women but their mothers and old people had generally been fond of him  still though mrs beldings hair was snowwhite she did not impress him as being old he reflected that there might come a time when it would be desirable far beyond any ground of everyday friendly kindliness to have mrs belding be well disposed toward him  so he thought about her and pondered how to make her like him  it did not take very long for dick to discover that he liked her  her face except when she smiled was thoughtful and sad  it was a face to make one serious  like a haunting shadow like a phantom of happier years the sweetness of nells face was there and infinitely more of beauty than had been transmitted to the daughter  dick believed mrs beldings friendship and motherly love were worth striving to win entirely aside from any more selfish motive  he decided both would be hard to get  often he felt her deep penetrating gaze upon him and though this in no wise embarrassed himfor he had no shameful secrets of past or presentit showed him how useless it would be to try to conceal anything from her naturally on first impulse he wanted to hide his interest in the daughter but he resolved to be absolutely frank and true and through that win or lose  moreover if mrs belding asked him any questions about his home his family his connections he would not avoid direct and truthful answers  toward evening gale heard the tramp of horses and beldings hearty voice  presently the rancher strode in upon gale shaking the gray dust from his broad shoulders and waving a letter  hello dick  good news and bad he said putting the letter in dicks hand  had no trouble finding your friend thorne  looked like hed been drunk for a week  say he nearly threw a fit  i never saw a fellow so wild with joy  he made sure you and mercedes were lost in the desert  he wrote two letters which i brought dont mistake me boy it was some fun with mercedes just now i teased her wouldnt give her the letter  you ought to have seen her eyes  if ever you see a blackandwhite desert hawk swoop down upon a quail then youll know how mercedes pounced upon her letter well casita is one hell of a place these days  i tried to get your baggage and i think i made a mistake  were going to see travel toward forlorn river  the federal garrison got reinforcements from somewhere and is holding out theres been fighting for three days  the rebels have a string of flat railroad cars all iron and they ran this up within range of the barricades  theyve got some machine guns and theyre going to lick the federals sure  there are dead soldiers in the ditches mexican noncombatants lying dead in the streetsand buzzards everywhere its reported that campo the rebel leader is on the way up from sinaloa and huerta a federal general is coming to relieve the garrison i dont take much stock in reports  but theres hell in casita all right  do you think well have trouble out here asked dick excitedly  sure  some kind of trouble sooner or later replied belding gloomily  why you can stand on my ranch and step over into mexico laddy says well lose horses and other stock in night raids jim lash doesnt look for any worse  but jim isnt as well acquainted with greasers as i am  anyway my boy as soon as you can hold a bridle and a gun youll be on the job dont mistake me  with laddy and jim asked dick trying to be cool  sure  with them and me and by yourself  dick drew a deep breath and even after belding had departed he forgot for a moment about the letter in his hand  then he unfolded the paper and read   dear dickyouve more than saved my life  to the end of my days youll be the one man to whom i owe everything  words fail to express my feelings  this must be a brief note  belding is waiting and i used up most of the time writing to mercedes  i like belding  he was not unknown to me though i never met or saw him before  youll be interested to learn that hes the unadulterated article the real western goods ive heard of some of his stunts and they made my hair curl  dick your luck is staggering  the way belding spoke of you was great  but you deserve it old man  im leaving mercedes in your charge subject of course to advice from belding  take care of her dick for my life is wrapped up in her  by all means keep her from being seen by mexicans  we are sitting tight herenothing doing  if some action doesnt come soon itll be darned strange  things are centering this way theres scrapping right along and people have begun to move were still patrolling the line eastward of casita  itll be impossible to keep any tab on the line west of casita for its too rough  that cactus desert is awful cowboys or rangers with desertbred horses might keep raiders and smugglers from crossing but if cavalrymen could stand that waterless wilderness which i doubt much their horses would drop under them  if things do quiet down before my commission expires ill get leave of absence run out to forlorn river marry my beautiful spanish princess and take her to a civilized country where i opine every son of a gun who sees her will lose his head and drive me mad  its my great luck old pal that you are a fellow who never seemed to care about pretty girls  so you wont give me the double cross and run off with mercedescarry her off like the villain in the play i mean  that reminds me of rojas  oh dick it was glorious  you didnt do anything to the dandy rebel  not at all  you merely caressed himgently moved him to one side  dick harken to these glad words rojas is in the hospital  i was interested to inquire he had a smashed finger a dislocated collar bone three broken ribs and a fearful gash on his face  hell be in the hospital for a month  dick when i meet that pigheaded dad of yours im going to give him the surprise of his life  send me a line whenever any one comes in from f r and inclose mercedess letter in yours  take care of her dick and may the future hold in store for you some of the sweetness i know now  faithfully yours thorne   dick reread the letter then folded it and placed it under his pillow  never cared for pretty girls huh he soliloquized  george i never saw any till i struck southern arizona guess id better make up for lost time  while he was eating his supper with appetite rapidly returning to normal ladd and jim came in bowing their tall heads to enter the door  their friendly advances were singularly welcome to gale but he was still backward  he allowed himself to show that he was glad to see them and he listened  jim lash had heard from belding the result of the mauling given to rojas by dick  and jim talked about what a grand thing that was  ladd had a good deal to say about beldings horses it took no keen judge of human nature to see that horses constituted ladds ruling passion  ive had wimmen go back on me but never no hoss declared ladd and manifestly that was a controlling truth with him  shore its a cinch beldin is agoin to lose some of them hosses he said  you can search me if i dont think therell be more doin on the border here than along the rio grande  were just the same as on greaser soil  mebbe we dont stand no such chance of bein shot up as we would across the line  but whos goin to give up his hosses without a fight  half the time when beldins stock is out of the alfalfa its grazin over the line  he thinks hes careful about them hosses but he aint  look ahere laddy you caint believe all you hear replied jim seriously  i reckon we mightnt have any trouble  back up jim  shore youre standin on your bridle  i aint goin much on reports  remember that american we met in casita the prospector whod just gotten out of sonora  he had some story he had swore hed killed seventeen greasers breakin through the rebel line round the mine where he an other americans were corralled  the next day when i met him again he was drunk an then he told me hed shot thirty greasers  the chances are he did kill some  but reports are exaggerated  there are miners fightin for life down in sonora you can gamble on that  an the truth is bad enough  take rojass harryin of the senorita for instance  can you beat that  shore jim theres more doin than the raidin of a few hosses  an forlorn river is goin to get hers  another dawn found gale so much recovered that he arose and looked after himself not however without considerable difficulty and rather disheartening twinges of pain  some time during the morning he heard the girls in the patio and called to ask if he might join them  he received one response a mellow si senor  it was not as much as he wanted but considering that it was enough he went out  he had not as yet visited the patio and surprise and delight were in store for him  he found himself lost in a labyrinth of green and rosebordered walks  he strolled around discovering that the patio was a courtyard open at an end but he failed to discover the young ladies  so he called again  the answer came from the center of the square  after stooping to get under shrubs and wading through bushes he entered an open sandy circle full of magnificent and murderous cactus plants strange to him  on the other side in the shade of a beautiful tree he found the girls mercedes sitting in a hammock nell upon a blanket  what a beautiful tree he exclaimed  i never saw one like that what is it  palo verde replied nell  senor palo verde means green tree added mercedes  this desert tree which had struck dick as so new and strange and beautiful was not striking on account of size for it was small scarcely reaching higher than the roof but rather because of its exquisite color of green trunk and branch alike and owing to the odd fact that it seemed not to possess leaves  all the tree from ground to tiny flat twigs was a soft polished green  it bore no thorns  right then and there began dicks education in desert growths and he felt that even if he had not had such charming teachers he would still have been absorbed  for the patio was full of desert wonders  a twistingtrunked tree with full foliage of small gray leaves nell called a mesquite  then dick remembered the name and now he saw where the desert got its palegray color a huge lofty fluted column of green was a saguaro or giant cactus  another oddshaped cactus resembling the legs of an inverted devilfish bore the name ocatillo each branch rose high and symmetrical furnished with sharp blades that seemed to be at once leaves and thorns  yet another cactus interested gale and it looked like a huge low barrel covered with greenribbed cloth and long thorns  this was the bisnaga or barrel cactus according to nell and mercedes this plant was a happy exception to its desert neighbors for it secreted water which had many times saved the lives of men  last of the cacti to attract gale and the one to make him shiver was a low plant consisting of stem and many rounded protuberances of a frosty steely white and covered with long murderous spikes from this plant the desert got its frosty glitter it was as stiff as unyielding as steel and bore the name choya  dicks enthusiasm was contagious and his earnest desire to learn was flattering to his teachers  when it came to assimilating spanish however he did not appear to be so apt a pupil  he managed after many trials to acquire buenos dias and buenos tardes and senorita and gracias and a few other short terms dick was indeed eager to get a little smattering of spanish and perhaps he was not really quite so stupid as he pretended to be it was delightful to be taught by a beautiful spaniard who was so gracious and intense and magnetic of personality and by a sweet american girl who moment by moment forgot her shyness  gale wished to prolong the lessons  so that was the beginning of many afternoons in which he learned desert lore and spanish verbs and something else that he dared not name  nell burton had never shown to gale that daring side of her character which had been so suggestively defined in beldings terse description and ladds encomiums and in her own audacious speech and merry laugh and flashing eye of that nevertobeforgotten first meeting  she might have been an entirely different girl but gale remembered and when the ice had been somewhat broken between them he was always trying to surprise her into her real self there were moments that fairly made him tingle with expectation yet he saw little more than a ghost of her vivacity and never a gleam of that individuality which belding had called a devil on the few occasions that dick had been left alone with her in the patio nell had grown suddenly unresponsive and restrained or she had left him on some transparent pretext on the last occasion mercedes returned to find dick staring disconsolately at the rosebordered path where nell had evidently vanished  the spanish girl was wonderful in her divination  senor dick she cried  dick looked at her soberly nodded his head and then he laughed mercedes had seen through him in one swift glance  her white hand touched his in wordless sympathy and thrilled him  this spanish girl was all fire and passion and love  she understood him she was his friend she pledged him what he felt would be the most subtle and powerful influence  little by little he learned details of nells varied life  she had lived in many places  as a child she remembered moving from town to town of going to school among schoolmates whom she never had time to know  lawrence kansas where she studied for several years was the later exception to this changeful nature of her schooling  then she moved to stillwater oklahoma from there to austin texas and on to waco where her mother met and married belding  they lived in new mexico awhile in tucson arizona in douglas and finally had come to lonely forlorn river  mother could never live in one place any length of time said nell and since weve been in the southwest she has never ceased trying to find some trace of her father  he was last heard of in nogales fourteen years ago  she thinks grandfather was lost in the sonora desert and every place we go is worse  oh i love the desert  but id like to go back to lawrenceor to see chicago or new yorksome of the places mr gale speaks of i remember the college at lawrence though i was only twelve i saw racesand once real football  since then ive read magazines and papers about big football games and i was always fascinated  mr gale of course youve seen games  yes a few replied dick and he laughed a little  it was on his lips then to tell her about some of the famous games in which he had participated  but he refrained from exploiting himself there was little however of the color and sound and cheer of the violent action and rush and battle incidental to a big college football game that he did not succeed in making mercedes and nell feel just as if they had been there  they hung breathless and wideeyed upon his words  some one else was present at the latter part of dicks narrative the moment he became aware of mrs beldings presence he remembered fancying he had heard her call and now he was certain she had done so mercedes and nell however had been and still were oblivious to everything except dicks recital  he saw mrs belding cast a strange intent glance upon nell then turn and go silently through the patio dick concluded his talk but the brilliant beginning was not sustained  dick was haunted by the strange expression he had caught on mrs beldings face especially the look in her eyes  it had been one of repressed pain liberated in a flash of certainty  the mother had seen just as quickly as mercedes how far he had gone on the road of love perhaps she had seen moreeven more than he dared hope  the incident roused gale  he could not understand mrs belding nor why that look of hers that seeming baffled hopeless look of a woman who saw the inevitable forces of life and could not thwart them should cause him perplexity and distress  he wanted to go to her and tell her how he felt about nell but fear of absolute destruction of his hopes held him back  he would wait nevertheless an instinct that was perhaps akin to selfpreservation prompted him to want to let nell know the state of his mind words crowded his brain seeking utterance  who and what he was how he loved her the work he expected to take up soon his longings hopes and plansthere was all this and more  but something checked him  and the repression made him so thoughtful and quiet even melancholy that he went outdoors to try to throw off the mood the sun was yet high and a dazzling white light enveloped valleys and peaks he felt that the wonderful sunshine was the dominant feature of that arid region  it was like white gold  it had burned its color in a face he knew  it was going to warm his blood and brown his skin  a hot languid breeze so dry that he felt his lips shrink with its contact came from the desert and it seemed to smell of wideopen untainted places where sand blew and strange pungent plants gave a bittersweet tang to the air  when he returned to the house some hours later his room had been put in order  in the middle of the white coverlet on his table lay a fresh red rose  nell had dropped it there  dick picked it up feeling a throb in his breast  it was a bud just beginning to open to show between its petals a darkred unfolding heart how fragrant it was how exquisitely delicate how beautiful its inner hue of red deep and dark the crimson of life blood  had nell left it there by accident or by intent  was it merely kindness or a girls subtlety  was it a message couched elusively a symbol a hope in a halfblown desert rose    vi  the yaqui  toward evening of a lowering december day some fifty miles west of forlorn river a horseman rode along an old dimly defined trail from time to time he halted to study the lay of the land ahead it was bare somber ridgy desert covered with duncolored greasewood and stunted prickly pear  distant mountains hemmed in the valley raising black spurs above the round lomas and the squarewalled mesas  this lonely horseman bestrode a steed of magnificent build perfectly white except for a dark bar of color running down the noble head from ears to nose  sweatcaked dust stained the long flanks  the horse had been running  his mane and tail were laced and knotted to keep their length out of reach of grasping cactus and brush  clumsy homemade leather shields covered the front of his forelegs and ran up well to his wide breast  what otherwise would have been muscular symmetry of limb was marred by many a scar and many a lump  he was lean gaunt worn a huge machine of muscle and bone beautiful only in head and mane a weightcarrier a horse strong and fierce like the desert that had bred him  the rider fitted the horse as he fitted the saddle  he was a young man of exceedingly powerful physique wideshouldered longarmed biglegged  his lean face where it was not red blistered and peeling was the hue of bronze  he had a dark eye a falcon gaze roving and keen  his jaw was prominent and set mastifflike his lips were stern  it was youth with its softness not yet quite burned and hardened away that kept the whole cast of his face from being ruthless  this young man was dick gale but not the listless traveler nor the lounging wanderer who two months before had by chance dropped into casita  friendship chivalry lovethe deepseated unplumbed emotions that had been stirred into being with all their incalculable power for spiritual change had rendered different the meaning of life in the moment almost of their realization the desert had claimed gale and had drawn him into its crucible  the desert had multiplied weeks into years  heat thirst hunger loneliness toil fear ferocity painhe knew them all  he had felt them allthe white sun with its glazed coalescing lurid fire the caked split lips and rasping drypuffed tongue the sickening ache in the pit of his stomach the insupportable silence the empty space the utter desolation the contempt of life the weary ride the long climb the plod in sand the search search search for water the sleepless night alone the watch and wait the dread of ambush the swift flight the fierce pursuit of men wild as bedouins and as fleet the willingness to deal sudden death the pain of poison thorn the stinging tear of lead through flesh and that strange paradox of the burning desert the cold at night the piercing icy wind the dew that penetrated to the marrow the numbing desert cold of the dawn  beyond any dream of adventure he had ever had beyond any wild story he had ever read had been his experience with those hardriding rangers ladd and lash  then he had traveled alone the hundred miles of desert between forlorn river and the sonoyta oasis  ladds prophecy of trouble on the border had been mild compared to what had become the actuality  with rebel occupancy of the garrison at casita outlaws bandits raiders in rioting bands had spread westward  like troops of arabs magnificently mounted they were here there everywhere along the line and if murder and worse were confined to the mexican side pillage and raiding were perpetrated across the border  many a darkskinned raider bestrode one of beldings fast horses and indeed all except his selected white thoroughbreds had been stolen  so the job of the rangers had become more than a patrolling of the boundary line to keep japanese and chinese from being smuggled into the united states  belding kept close at home to protect his family and to hold his property but the three rangers in fulfilling their duty had incurred risks on their own side of the line had been outraged robbed pursued and injured on the other  some of the few waterholes that had to be reached lay far across the border in mexican territory horses had to drink men had to drink and ladd and lash were not of the stripe that forsook a task because of danger  slow to wrath at first as became men who had long lived peaceful lives they had at length revolted and desert vultures could have told a gruesome story made a comrade and ally of these bordermen dick gale had leaped at the desert action and strife with an intensity of heart and a rare physical ability which accounted for the remarkable fact that he had not yet fallen by the way  on this december afternoon the three rangers as often were separated lash was far to the westward of sonoyta somewhere along camino del diablo that terrible devils road where many desert wayfarers had perished  ladd had long been overdue in a prearranged meeting with gale  the fact that ladd had not shown up miles west of the papago well was significant  the sun had hidden behind clouds all the latter part of that day an unusual occurrence for that region even in winter  and now as the light waned suddenly telling of the hidden sunset a cold dry penetrating wind sprang up and blew in gales face  not at first but by imperceptible degrees it chilled him  he untied his coat from the back of the saddle and put it on  a few cold drops of rain touched his cheek  he halted upon the edge of a low escarpment  below him the narrowing valley showed bare black ribs of rock long winding gray lines leading down to a central floor where mesquite and cactus dotted the barren landscape  moving objects diminutive in size gray and white in color arrested gales roving sight they bobbed away for a while then stopped  they were antelope and they had seen his horse  when he rode on they started once more keeping to the lowest level  these wary animals were often desert watchdogs for the ranger they would betray the proximity of horse or man  with them trotting forward he made better time for some miles across the valley  when he lost them caution once more slowed his advance  the valley sloped up and narrowed to head into an arroyo where grass began to show gray between the clumps of mesquite  shadows formed ahead in the hollows along the walls of the arroyo under the trees and they seemed to creep to rise to float into a veil cast by the background of bold mountains at last to claim the skyline  night was not close at hand but it was there in the east lifting upward drooping downward encroaching upon the west  gale dismounted to lead his horse to go forward more slowly  he had ridden sixty miles since morning and he was tired and a not entirely healed wound in his hip made one leg drag a little  a mile up the arroyo near its head lay the papago well  the need of water for his horse entailed a risk that otherwise he could have avoided  the well was on mexican soil  gale distinguished a faint light flickering through the thin sharp foliage  campers were at the well and whoever they were no doubt they had prevented ladd from meeting gale ladd had gone back to the next waterhole or maybe he was hiding in an arroyo to the eastward awaiting developments  gale turned his horse not without urge of iron arm and persuasive speech for the desert steed scented water and plodded back to the edge of the arroyo where in a secluded circle of mesquite he halted the horse snorted his relief at the removal of the heavy burdened saddle and accoutrements and sagging bent his knees lowered himself with slow heave and plunged down to roll in the sand  gale poured the contents of his larger canteen into his hat and held it to the horses nose  drink sol he said  it was but a drop for a thirsty horse  however blanco sol rubbed a wet muzzle against gales hand in appreciation  gale loved the horse and was loved in return  they had saved each others lives and had spent long days and nights of desert solitude together sol had known other masters though none so kind as this new one but it was certain that gale had never before known a horse  the spot of secluded ground was covered with bunches of galleta grass upon which sol began to graze  gale made a long halter of his lariat to keep the horse from wandering in search of water next gale kicked off the cumbersome chapparejos with their flapping tripping folds of leather over his feet and drawing a long rifle from its leather sheath he slipped away into the shadows  the coyotes were howling not here and there but in concerted volume at the head of the arroyo  to dick this was no more reassuring than had been the flickering light of the campfire  the wild desert dogs with their characteristic insolent curiosity were baying men round a campfire  gale proceeded slowly halting every few steps careful not to brush against the stiff greasewood  in the soft sand his steps made no sound  the twinkling light vanished occasionally like a jackolantern and when it did show it seemed still a long way off gale was not seeking trouble or inviting danger  water was the thing that drove him  he must see who these campers were and then decide how to give blanco sol a drink  a rabbit rustled out of brush at gales feet and thumped away over the sand  the wind pattered among dry broken stalks of dead ocatilla every little sound brought gale to a listening pause  the gloom was thickening fast into darkness  it would be a night without starlight he moved forward up the pale zigzag aisles between the mesquite  he lost the light for a while but the coyotes chorus told him he was approaching the campfire  presently the light danced through the black branches and soon grew into a flame  stooping low with bushy mesquites between him and the fire gale advanced  the coyotes were in full cry  gale heard the tramping stamping thumps of many hoofs  the sound worried him  foot by foot he advanced and finally began to crawl  the wind favored his position so that neither coyotes nor horses could scent him  the nearer he approached the head of the arroyo where the well was located the thicker grew the desert vegetation  at length a dead palo verde with huge black clumps of its parasite mistletoe thick in the branches marked a distance from the well that gale considered close enough  noiselessly he crawled here and there until he secured a favorable position and then rose to peep from behind his covert  he saw a bright fire not a cookingfire for that would have been low and red but a crackling blaze of mesquite  three men were in sight all close to the burning sticks  they were mexicans and of the coarse type of raiders rebels bandits that gale expected to see  one stood up his back to the fire another sat with shoulders enveloped in a blanket and the third lounged in the sand his feet almost in the blaze  they had cast off belts and weapons  a glint of steel caught gales eye  three short shiny carbines leaned against a rock  a little to the left within the circle of light stood a square house made of adobe bricks several untrimmed poles upheld a roof of brush which was partly fallen in  this house was a papago indian habitation and a month before had been occupied by a family that had been murdered or driven off by a roving band of outlaws  a rude corral showed dimly in the edge of firelight and from a black mass within came the snort and stamp and whinney of horses  gale took in the scene in one quick glance then sank down at the foot of the mesquite  he had naturally expected to see more men but the situation was by no means new  this was one or part of one of the raider bands harrying the border  they were stealing horses or driving a herd already stolen  these bands were more numerous than the waterholes of northern sonora they never camped long at one place like arabs they roamed over the desert all the way from nogales to casita  if gale had gone peaceably up to this campfire there were a hundred chances that the raiders would kill and rob him to one chance that they might not  if they recognized him as a ranger comrade of ladd and lash if they got a glimpse of blanco sol then gale would have no chance  these mexicans had evidently been at the well some time  their horses being in the corral meant that grazing had been done by day  gale revolved questions in mind  had this trio of outlaws run across ladd it was not likely for in that event they might not have been so comfortable and carefree in camp  were they waiting for more members of their gang  that was very probable with gale however the most important consideration was how to get his horse to water  sol must have a drink if it cost a fight there was stern reason for gale to hurry eastward along the trail he thought it best to go back to where he had left his horse and not make any decisive move until daylight  with the same noiseless care he had exercised in the advance gale retreated until it was safe for him to rise and walk on down the arroyo  he found blanco sol contentedly grazing  a heavy dew was falling and as the grass was abundant the horse did not show the usual restlessness and distress after a dry and exhausting day gale carried his saddle blankets and bags into the lee of a little greasewoodcovered mound from around which the wind had cut the soil and here in a wash he risked building a small fire by this time the wind was piercingly cold  gales hands were numb and he moved them to and fro in the little blaze  then he made coffee in a cup cooked some slices of bacon on the end of a stick and took a couple of hard biscuits from a saddlebag  of these his meal consisted  after that he removed the halter from blanco sol intending to leave him free to graze for a while  then gale returned to his little fire replenished it with short sticks of dead greasewood and mesquite and wrapping his blanket round his shoulders he sat down to warm himself and to wait till it was time to bring in the horse and tie him up  the fire was inadequate and gale was cold and wet with dew hunger and thirst were with him  his bones ached and there was a dull deepseated pain throbbing in his unhealed wound  for days unshaven his beard seemed like a million pricking needles in his blistered skin he was so tired that once having settled himself he did not move hand or foot  the night was dark dismal cloudy windy growing colder  a moan of wind in the mesquite was occasionally pierced by the highkeyed yelp of a coyote  there were lulls in which the silence seemed to be a thing of stifling encroaching substancea thing that enveloped buried the desert  judged by the great average of ideals and conventional standards of life dick gale was a starved lonely suffering miserable wretch but in his case the judgment would have hit only externals would have missed the vital inner truth  for gale was happy with a kind of strange wild glory in the privations the pains the perils and the silence and solitude to be endured on this desert land in the past he had not been of any use to himself or others and he had never know what it meant to be hungry cold tired lonely  he had never worked for anything  the needs of the day had been provided and tomorrow and the future looked the same danger peril toilthese had been words read in books and papers  in the present he used his hands his senses and his wits  he had a duty to a man who relied on his services  he was a comrade a friend a valuable ally to riding fighting rangers  he had spent endless days weeks that seemed years alone with a horse trailing over climbing over hunting over a desert that was harsh and hostile by nature and perilous by the invasion of savage men  that horse had become human to gale  and with him gale had learned to know the simple needs of existence  like dead scales the superficialities the falsities the habits that had once meant all of life dropped off useless things in this stern waste of rock and sand  gales happiness as far as it concerned the toil and strife was perhaps a grim and stoical one  but love abided with him and it had engendered and fostered other undeveloped traitsromance and a feeling for beauty and a keen observation of nature  he felt pain but he was never miserable  he felt the solitude but he was never lonely  as he rode across the desert even though keen eyes searched for the moving black dots the rising puffs of white dust that were warnings he saw nells face in every cloud  the cleancut mesas took on the shape of her straight profile with its strong chin and lips its fine nose and forehead  there was always a glint of gold or touch of red or graceful line or gleam of blue to remind him of her  then at night her face shone warm and glowing flushing and paling in the campfire  tonight as usual with a keen ear to the wind gale listened as one on guard yet he watched the changing phantom of a sweet face in the embers and as he watched he thought  the desert developed and multiplied thought  a thousand sweet faces glowed in the pink and white ashes of his campfire the faces of other sweethearts or wives that had gleamed for other men  gale was happy in his thought of nell for nell for something when he was alone this way in the wilderness told him she was near him she thought of him she loved him  but there were many men alone on that vast southwestern plateau and when they saw dream faces surely for some it was a fleeting flash a gleam soon gone like the hope and the name and the happiness that had been and was now no more  often gale thought of those hundreds of desert travelers prospectors wanderers who had ventured down the camino del diablo never to be heard of again  belding had told him of that most terrible of all desert trailsa trail of shifting sands  lash had traversed it and brought back stories of buried waterholes of bones bleaching white in the sun of gold mines as lost as were the prospectors who had sought them of the merciless yaqui and his hatred for the mexican  gale thought of this trail and the men who had camped along it  for many there had been one night one campfire that had been the last  this idea seemed to creep in out of the darkness the loneliness the silence and to find a place in gales mind so that it had strange fascination for him he knew now as he had never dreamed before how men drifted into the desert leaving behind graves wrecked homes ruined lives lost wives and sweethearts  and for every wanderer every campfire had a phantom face  gale measured the agony of these men at their last campfire by the joy and promise he traced in the ruddy heart of his own  by and by gale remembered what he was waiting for and getting up he took the halter and went out to find blanco sol  it was pitchdark now and gale could not see a rod ahead  he felt his way and presently as he rounded a mesquite he saw sols white shape outlined against the blackness  the horse jumped and wheeled ready to run  it was doubtful if any one unknown to sol could ever have caught him gales low call reassured him and he went on grazing  gale haltered him in the likeliest patch of grass and returned to his camp  there he lifted his saddle into a protected spot under a low wall of the mound and laying one blanket on the sand he covered himself with the other and stretched himself for the night  here he was out of reach of the wind but he heard its melancholy moan in the mesquite  there was no other sound  the coyotes had ceased their hungry cries  gale dropped to sleep and slept soundly during the first half of the night and after that he seemed always to be partially awake aware of increasing cold and damp the dark mantle turned gray and then daylight came quickly  the morning was clear and nipping cold  he threw off the wet blanket and got up cramped and half frozen  a little brisk action was all that was necessary to warm his blood and loosen his muscles and then he was fresh tingling eager the sun rose in a golden blaze and the descending valley took on wondrous changing hues  then he fetched up blanco sol saddled him and tied him to the thickest clump of mesquite  sol well have a drink pretty soon he said patting the splendid neck  gale meant it  he would not eat till he had watered his horse sol had gone nearly fortyeight hours without a sufficient drink and that was long enough even for a desertbred beast  no three raiders could keep gale away from that well  taking his rifle in hand he faced up the arroyo  rabbits were frisking in the short willows and some were so tame he could have kicked them  gale walked swiftly for a goodly part of the distance and then when he saw blue smoke curling up above the trees he proceeded slowly with alert eye and ear  from the lay of the land and position of trees seen by daylight he found an easier and safer course that the one he had taken in the dark  and by careful work he was enabled to get closer to the well and somewhat above it  the mexicans were leisurely cooking their morning meal  they had two fires one for warmth the other to cook over  gale had an idea these raiders were familiar to him  it seemed all these border hawks resembled one anotherbeing mostly small of build wiry angular swarthyfaced and blackhaired and they wore the oddly styled mexican clothes and sombreros  a slow wrath stirred in gale as he watched the trio  they showed not the slightest indication of breaking camp  one fellow evidently the leader packed a gun at his hip the only weapon in sight  gale noted this with speculative eyes  the raiders had slept inside the little adobe house and had not yet brought out the carbines next gale swept his gaze to the corral in which he saw more than a dozen horses some of them fine animals  they were stamping and whistling fighting one another and pawing the dirt  this was entirely natural behavior for desert horses penned in when they wanted to get at water and grass  but suddenly one of the blacks a big shaggy fellow shot up his ears and pointed his nose over the top of the fence  he whistled other horses looked in the same direction and their ears went up and they too whistled  gale knew that other horses or men very likely both were approaching  but the mexicans did not hear the alarm or show any interest if they did  these mescaldrinking raiders were not scouts it was notorious how easily they could be surprised or ambushed mostly they were ignorant thickskulled peons  they were wonderful horsemen and could go long without food or water but they had not other accomplishments or attributes calculated to help them in desert warfare  they had poor sight poor hearing poor judgment and when excited they resembled crazed ants running wild  gale saw two indians on burros come riding up the other side of the knoll upon which the adobe house stood and apparently they were not aware of the presence of the mexicans for they came on up the path one indian was a papago  the other striking in appearance for other reasons than that he seemed to be about to fall from the burro gale took to be a yaqui  these travelers had absolutely nothing for an outfit except a blanket and a halfempty bag  they came over the knoll and down the path toward the well turned a corner of the house and completely surprised the raiders  gale heard a short shrill cry strangely high and wild and this came from one of the indians  it was answered by hoarse shouts then the leader of the trio the mexican who packed a gun pulled it and fired pointblank  he missed onceand again  at the third shot the papago shrieked and tumbled off his burro to fall in a heap  the other indian swayed as if the taking away of the support lent by his comrade had brought collapse and with the fourth shot he too slipped to the ground  the reports had frightened the horses in the corral and the vicious black crowding the rickety bars broke them down  he came plunging out  two of the mexicans ran for him catching him by nose and mane and the third ran to block the gateway  then with a splendid vaulting mount the mexican with the gun leaped to the back of the horse  he yelled and waved his gun and urged the black forward  the manner of all three was savagely jocose  they were having sport  the two on the ground began to dance and jabber  the mounted leader shot again and then stuck like a leech upon the bare back of the rearing black  it was a vain show of horsemanship  then this mexican by some strange grip brought the horse down plunging almost upon the body of the indian that had fallen last  gale stood aghast with his rifle clutched tight  he could not divine the intention of the raider but suspected something brutal the horse answered to that cruel guiding hand yet he swerved and bucked he reared aloft pawing the air wildly snorting then he plunged down upon the prostrate indian  even in the act the intelligent animal tried to keep from striking the body with his hoofs  but that was not possible a yell hideous in its passion signaled this feat of horsemanship  the mexican made no move to trample the body of the papago he turned the black to ride again over the other indian  that brought into gales mind what he had heard of a mexicans hate for a yaqui  it recalled the barbarism of these savage peons and the war of extermination being waged upon the yaquis  suddenly gale was horrified to see the yaqui writhe and raise a feeble hand  the action brought renewed and more savage cries from the mexicans  the horse snorted in terror  gale could bear no more  he took a quick shot at the rider  he missed the moving figure but hit the horse  there was a bound a horrid scream a mighty plunge then the horse went down giving the mexican a stunning fall  both beast and man lay still  gale rushed from his cover to intercept the other raiders before they could reach the house and their weapons  one fellow yelled and ran wildly in the opposite direction the other stood stricken in his tracks  gale ran in close and picked up the gun that had dropped from the raider leaders hand  this fellow had begun to stir to come out of his stunned condition  then the frightened horses burst the corral bars and in a thundering dustmantled stream fled up the arroyo  the fallen raider sat up mumbling to his saints in one breath cursing in his next  the other mexican kept his stand intimidated by the threatening rifle  go greasers  run yelled gale  then he yelled it in spanish at the point of his rifle he drove the two raiders out of the camp his next move was to run into the house and fetch out the carbines with a heavy stone he dismantled each weapon  that done he set out on a run for his horse  he took the shortest cut down the arroyo with no concern as to whether or not he would encounter the raiders probably such a meeting would be all the worse for them and they knew it blanco sol heard him coming and whistled a welcome and when gale ran up the horse was snorting war  mounting gale rode rapidly back to the scene of the action and his first thought when he arrived at the well was to give sol a drink and to fill his canteens  then gale led his horse up out of the waterhole and decided before remounting to have a look at the indians  the papago had been shot through the heart but the yaqui was still alive moreover he was conscious and staring up at gale with great strange somber eyes black as volcanic slag  gringo goodno kill he said in husky whisper  his speech was not affirmative so much as questioning  yaqui youre done for said gale and his words were positive he was simply speaking aloud his mind  yaquino hurtmuch replied the indian and then he spoke a strange wordrepeated it again and again  an instinct of gales or perhaps some suggestion in the husky thick whisper or dark face told gale to reach for his canteen he lifted the indian and gave him a drink and if ever in all his life he saw gratitude in human eyes he saw it then  then he examined the injured yaqui not forgetting for an instant to send wary fugitive glances on all sides  gale was not surprised  the indian had three woundsa bullet hole in his shoulder a crushed arm and a badly lacerated leg what had been the matter with him before being set upon by the raider gale could not be certain  the ranger thought rapidly  this yaqui would live unless left there to die or be murdered by the mexicans when they found courage to sneak back to the well  it never occurred to gale to abandon the poor fellow  that was where his old training the higher order of human feeling made impossible the following of any elemental instinct of selfpreservation  all the same gale knew he multiplied his perils a hundredfold by burdening himself with a crippled indian swiftly he set to work and with rifle ever under his hand and shifting glance spared from his task he bound up the yaquis wounds  at the same time he kept keen watch  the indians burros and the horses of the raiders were all out of sight  time was too valuable for gale to use any in what might be a vain search  therefore he lifted the yaqui upon sols broad shoulders and climbed into the saddle  at a word sol dropped his head and started eastward up the trail walking swiftly without resentment for his double burden  far ahead between two huge mesas where the trail mounted over a pass a long line of dust clouds marked the position of the horses that had escaped from the corral  those that had been stolen would travel straight and true for home and perhaps would lead the others with them  the raiders were left on the desert without guns or mounts  blanco sol walked or jogtrotted six miles to the hour  at that gait fifty miles would not have wet or turned a hair of his dazzling white coat  gale bearing in mind the everpresent possibility of encountering more raiders and of being pursued saved the strength of the horse  once out of sight of papago well gale dismounted and walked beside the horse steadying with one firm hand the helpless dangling yaqui  the sun cleared the eastern ramparts and the coolness of morning fled as if before a magic foe  the whole desert changed  the grays wore bright the mesquites glistened the cactus took the silver hue of frost and the rocks gleamed gold and red  then as the heat increased a wind rushed up out of the valley behind gale and the hotter the sun blazed down the swifter rushed the wind the wonderful transparent haze of distance lost its bluish hue for one with tinge of yellow  flying sand made the peaks dimly outlined  gale kept pace with his horse  he bore the twinge of pain that darted through his injured hip at every stride  his eye roved over the wide smoky prospect seeking the landmarks he knew when the wild and bold spurs of no name mountains loomed through a rent in flying clouds of sand he felt nearer home  another hour brought him abreast of a dark straight shaft rising clear from a beetling escarpment  this was a monument marking the international boundary line  when he had passed it he had his own country under foot  in the heat of midday he halted in the shade of a rock and lifting the yaqui down gave him a drink then after a long sweeping survey of the surrounding desert he removed sols saddle and let him roll and took for himself a welcome rest and a bite to eat  the yaqui was tenacious of life  he was still holding his own for the first time gale really looked at the indian to study him he had a large head nobly cast and a face that resembled a shrunken mask  it seemed chiseled in the darkred volcanic lava of his sooner wilderness  the indians eyes were always black and mystic but this yaquis encompassed all the tragic desolation of the desert  they were fixed on gale moved only when he moved the indian was short and broad and his body showed unusual muscular development although he seemed greatly emaciated from starvation or illness  gale resumed his homeward journey  when he got through the pass he faced a great depression as rough as if millions of gigantic spikes had been driven by the hammer of thor into a seamed and cracked floor this was altar valley  it was a chaos of arroyos canyons rocks and ridges all mantled with cactus and at its eastern end it claimed the dry bed of forlorn river and water when there was any  with a wounded helpless man across the saddle this stretch of thorny and contorted desert was practically impassable  yet gale headed into it unflinchingly  he would carry the yaqui as far as possible or until death make the burden no longer a duty  blanco sol plodded on over the dragging sand up and down the steep loose banks of washes out on the rocks and through the rows of whitetoothed choyas  the sun sloped westward bending fiercer heat in vengeful parting reluctance  the wind slackened  the dust settled  and the bold forbidding front of no name mountains changed to red and gold gale held grimly by the side of the tireless implacable horse holding the yaqui on the saddle taking the brunt of the merciless thorns  in the end it became heartrending toil  his heavy chaps dragged him down but he dared not go on without them for thick and stiff as they were the terrible steelbayoneted spikes of the choyas pierced through to sting his legs  to the last mile gale held to blanco sols gait and kept everwatchful gaze ahead on the trail  then with the low flat houses of forlorn river shining red in the sunset gale flagged and rapidly weakened the yaqui slipped out of the saddle and dropped limp in the sand  gale could not mount his horse  he clutched sols long tail and twisted his hand in it and staggered on  blanco sol whistled a piercing blast  he scented cool water and sweet alfalfa hay  twinkling lights ahead meant rest  the melancholy desert twilight rapidly succeeded the sunset  it accentuated the forlorn loneliness of the gray winding river of sand and its grayer shores night shadows trooped down from the black and looming mountains    vii  white horses  a crippled yaqui  why the hell did you saddle yourself with him roared belding as he laid gale upon the bed  belding had grown hard these late violent weeks  because i chose whispered gale in reply  go after himhe dropped in the trailacross the rivernear the first big saguaro  belding began to swear as he fumbled with matches and the lamp but as the light flared up he stopped short in the middle of a word  you said you werent hurt he demanded in sharp anxiety as he bent over gale  im onlyall in  will you goor send some onefor the yaqui  sure dick sure belding replied in softer tones  then he stalked out his heels rang on the flagstones he opened a door and called mothergirls heres dick back  hes done up nowno no hes not hurt or in bad shape  you women  do what you can to make him comfortable  ive got a little job on hand  there were quick replies that gales dulling ears did not distinguish then it seemed mrs belding was beside his bed her presence so cool and soothing and helpful and mercedes and nell wideeyed and whitefaced were fluttering around him  he drank thirstily but refused food  he wanted rest  and with their faces drifting away in a kind of haze with the feeling of gentle hands about him he lost consciousness  he slept twenty hours  then he arose thirsty hungry lame overworn and presently went in search of belding and the business of the day  your yaqui was near dead but guess well pull him through said belding  dick the other day that indian came here by rail and foot and lord only knows how else all the way from new orleans he spoke english better than most indians and i know a little yaqui  i got some of his story and guessed the rest  the mexican government is trying to root out the yaquis  a year ago his tribe was taken in chains to a mexican port on the gulf  the fathers mothers children were separated and put in ships bound for yucatan  there they were made slaves on the great henequen plantations  they were driven beaten starved  each slave had for a days rations a hunk of sour dough no more  yucatan is low marshy damp hot  the yaquis were bred on the high dry sonoran plateau where the air is like a knife they dropped dead in the henequen fields and their places were taken by more  you see the mexicans wont kill outright in their war of extermination of the yaquis  they get use out of them  its a horrible thing well this yaqui you brought in escaped from his captors got aboard ship and eventually reached new orleans  somehow he traveled way out here  i gave him a bag of food and he went off with a papago indian  he was a sick man then  and he must have fallen foul of some greasers  gale told of his experience at papago well  that raider who tried to grind the yaqui under a horses hoofshe was a hyena  concluded gale shuddering  ive seen some blood spilled and some hard sights but that inhuman devil took my nerve why as i told you belding i missed a shot at himnot twenty paces  dick in cases like that the sooner you clean up the bunch the better said belding grimly  as for hard sightswait till youve seen a yaqui do up a mexican  bar none that is the limit  its blood lust a racial hate deep as life and terrible  the spaniards crushed the aztecs four or five hundred years ago  that hate has had time to grow as deep as a cactus root  the yaquis are mountain aztecs personally i think they are noble and intelligent and if let alone would be peaceable and industrious  i like the few ive known  but they are a doomed race  have you any idea what ailed this yaqui before the raider got in his work  no i havent  i noticed the indian seemed in bad shape but i couldnt tell what was the matter with him  well my idea is another personal one  maybe its off color  i think that yaqui was or is for that matter dying of a broken heart  all he wanted was to get back to his mountains and die there are no yaquis left in that part of sonora he was bound for  he had a strange look in his eyes said gale thoughtfully  yes i noticed that  but all yaquis have a wild look  dick if im not mistaken this fellow was a chief  it was a waste of strength a needless risk for you to save him pack him back here but damn the whole greaser outfit generally im glad you did  gale remembered then to speak of his concern for ladd  laddy didnt go out to meet you replied belding  i knew you were due in any day and as theres been trouble between here and casita i sent him that way  since youve been out our friend carter lost a bunch of horses and a few steers  did you get a good look at the horses those raiders had at papago well  dick had learned since he had become a ranger to see everything with keen sure photographic eye and being put to the test so often required of him he described the horses as a darkcolored drove mostly bays and blacks with one spotted sorrel  some of carterssure as youre born exclaimed belding  his bunch has been split up divided among several bands of raiders he has a grass ranch up here in three mile arroyo  its a good long ride in u s territory from the border  those horses i saw will go home dont you think asked dick  sure  they cant be caught or stopped  well what shall i do now  stay here and rest bluntly replied belding  you need it  let the women fuss over youdoctor you a little  when jim gets back from sonoyta ill know more about what we ought to do  by lord it seems our job now isnt keeping japs and chinks out of the u s its keeping our property from going into mexico  are there any letters for me asked gale  letters  say my boy itd take something pretty important to get me or any man here back casita way  if the town is safe these days the road isnt  its a month now since any one went to casita  gale had received several letters from his sister elsie the last of which he had not answered  there had not been much opportunity for writing on his infrequent returns to forlorn river and besides elsie had written that her father had stormed over what he considered dicks falling into wild and evil ways  time flies said dick  george thorne will be free before long and hell be coming out  i wonder if hell stay here or try to take mercedes away  well hell stay right here in forlorn river if i have any say replied belding  id like to know how hed ever get that spanish girl out of the country now with all the trails overrun by rebels and raiders  itd be hard to disguise her  say dick maybe we can get thorne to stay here  you know since youve discovered the possibility of a big water supply ive had dreams of a future for forlorn river if only this war was over  dick thats what it iswarscattered war along the northern border of mexico from gulf to gulf  what if it isnt our war  were on the fringe  no we cant develop forlorn river until theres peace  the discovery that belding alluded to was one that might very well lead to the making of a wonderful and agricultural district of altar valley while in college dick gale had studied engineering but he had not set the scientific world afire with his brilliance  nor after leaving college had he been able to satisfy his father that he could hold a job  nevertheless his smattering of engineering skill bore fruit in the last place on earth where anything might have been expected of itin the desert  gale had always wondered about the source of forlorn river  no white man or mexican or so far as known no indian had climbed those mighty broken steps of rock called no name mountains from which forlorn river was supposed to come  gale had discovered a long narrow rockbottomed and rockwalled gulch that could be dammed at the lower end by the dynamiting of leaning cliffs above  an inexhaustible supply of water could be stored there furthermore he had worked out an irrigation plan to bring the water down for mining uses and to make a paradise out of that part of altar valley which lay in the united states  belding claimed there was gold in the arroyos gold in the gulches not in quantities to make a prospector rejoice but enough to work for  and the soil on the higher levels of altar valley needed only water to make it grow anything the year round  gale too had come to have dreams of a future for forlorn river  on the afternoon of the following day ladd unexpectedly appeared leading a lame and lathered horse into the yard  belding and gale who were at work at the forge looked up and were surprised out of speech the legs of the horse were raw and red and he seemed about to drop ladds sombrero was missing he wore a bloody scarf round his head sweat and blood and dust had formed a crust on his face little streams of powdery dust slid from him and the lower half of his scarred chaps were full of broken white thorns  howdy boys he drawled  i shore am glad to see you all  wheren hells your hat  demanded belding furiously  it was a ridiculous greeting  but beldings words signified little  the dark shade of worry and solicitude crossing his face told more than his black amaze  the ranger stopped unbuckling the saddle girths and looking at belding broke into his slow cool laugh  tom you recollect that whopper of a saguaro up here where carters trail branches off the main trail to casita  well i climbed it an left my hat on top for a woodpeckers nest  youve been runningfighting queried belding as if ladd had not spoken at all  i reckon itll dawn on you after a while replied ladd slipping the saddle  laddy go in the house to the women said belding  ill tend to your horse  shore tom in a minute  ive been down the road  an i found hoss tracks an steer tracks goin across the line  but i seen no sign of raiders till this mornin  slept at carters last night that raid the other day cleaned him out  hes shootin mad  well this mornin i rode plumb into a bunch of carters hosses runnin wild for home some greasers were tryin to head them round an chase them back across the line  i rode in between an made matters embarrassin  carters hosses got away  then me an the greasers had a little game of hide an seek in the cactus  i was on the wrong side an had to break through their line to head toward home  we run some  but i had a closer call than im stuck on havin  laddy you wouldnt have any such close calls if youd ride one of my horses expostulated belding  this broncho of yours can run and lord knows hes game  but you want a big strong horse mexican bred with cactus in his blood take one of the bunchbull white woman blanco jose  i had a big fast horse a while back but i lost him said ladd this bronch aint so bad  shore bull an that white devil with his greaser namethey could run down my bronch kill him in a mile of cactus  but somehow tom i cant make up my mind to take one of them grand white hosses  shore i reckon im kinda soft  an mebbe id better take one before the raiders clean up forlorn river  belding cursed low and deep in his throat and the sound resembled muttering thunder  the shade of anxiety on his face changed to one of dark gloom and passion  next to his wife and daughter there was nothing so dear to him as those white horses  his father and grandfatherall his progenitors of whom he had tracehad been lovers of horses  it was in beldings blood  laddy before its too late cant i get the whites away from the border  mebbe it aint too late but where can we take them  to san felipe  no  weve more chance to hold them here  to casita and the railroad  afraid to risk gettin there  an the towns full of rebels who need hosses  then straight north  shore man youre crazy  thers no water no grass for a hundred miles  ill tell you tom the safest plan would be to take the white bunch south into sonora into some wild mountain valley keep them there till the raiders have traveled on back east  pretty soon there wont be any rich pickin left for these greasers  an then theyll ride on to new ranges  laddy i dont know the trails into sonora  an i cant trust a mexican or a papago  between you and me im afraid of this indian who herds for me  i reckon wed better stick here tom dick its some good to see you again  but you seem kinda quiet  shore you get quieter all the time  did you see any sign of jim out sonoyta way  then belding led the lame horse toward the wateringtrough while the two rangers went toward the house dick was telling ladd about the affair at papago well when they turned the corner under the porch nell was sitting in the door  she rose with a little scream and came flying toward them  now ill get it whispered ladd  the womenll make a baby of me an shore i cant help myself  oh laddy youve been hurt cried nell as with white cheeks and dilating eyes she ran to him and caught his arm  nell i only run a thorn in my ear  oh laddy dont lie  youve lied before  i know youre hurt come in to mother  shore nell its only a scratch  my bronch throwed me  laddy no horse every threw you  the girls words and accusing eyes only hurried the ranger on to further duplicity  mebbe i got it when i was ridin hard under a mesquite an a sharp snag  youve been shot mama heres laddy and hes been shot oh these dreadful days were having  i cant bear them  forlorn river used to be so safe and quiet  nothing happened  but now  jim comes home with a bloody hole in himthen dickthen laddy oh im afraid some day theyll never come home   the morning was bright still and clear as crystal  the heat waves had not yet begun to rise from the desert  a soft gray white and green tint perfectly blended lay like a mantle over mesquite and sand and cactus  the canyons of distant mountain showed deep and full of lilac haze  nell sat perched high upon the topmost bar of the corral gate  dick leaned beside her now with his eyes on her face now gazing out into the alfalfa field where beldings thoroughbreds grazed and pranced and romped and whistled  nell watched the horses  she loved them never tired of watching them  but her gaze was too consciously averted from the yearning eyes that tried to meet hers to be altogether natural  a great fenced field of dark velvety green alfalfa furnished a rich background for the drove of about twenty white horses  even without the horses the field would have presented a striking contrast to the surrounding hot glaring blaze of rock and sand  belding had bred a hundred or more horses from the original stock he had brought up from durango  his particular interest was in the almost unblemished whites and these he had given especial care  he made a good deal of money selling this strain to friends among the ranchers back in texas  no mercenary consideration however could have made him part with the great rangy white horses he had gotten from the durango breeder  he called them blanco diablo white devil blanco sol white sun blanca reina white queen blanca mujer white woman and el gran toro blanco the big white bull belding had been laughed at by ranchers for preserving the sentimental durango names and he had been unmercifully ridiculed by cowboys  but the names had never been changed  blanco diablo was the only horse in the field that was not free to roam and graze where he listed  a stake and a halter held him to one corner where he was severely let alone by the other horses he did not like this isolation  blanco diablo was not happy unless he was running or fighting a rival  of the two he would rather fight if anything white could resemble a devil this horse surely did  he had nothing beautiful about him yet he drew the gaze and held it  the look of him suggested discontent anger revolt viciousness  when he was not grazing or prancing he held his long lean head level pointing his nose and showing his teeth  beldings favorite was almost all the world to him and he swore diablo could stand more heat and thirst and cactus than any other horse he owned and could run down and kill any horse in the southwest  the fact that ladd did not agree with belding on these salient points was a great disappointment and also a perpetual source for argument  ladd and lash both hated diablo and dick gale after one or two narrow escapes from being brained had inclined to the cowboys side of the question  el gran toro blanco upheld his name  he was a huge massive thickflanked stallion a kingly mate for his fullbodied glossy consort blanca reina  the other mare blanca mujer was dazzling white without a spot perfectly pointed racy graceful elegant yet carrying weight and brawn and range that suggested her relation to her forebears  the cowboys admitted some of beldings claims for diablo but they gave loyal and unshakable allegiance to blanco sol  as for dick he had to fight himself to keep out of arguments for he sometimes imagined he was unreasonable about the horse  though he could not understand himself he knew he loved sol as a man loved a friend a brother  free of heavy saddle and the clumsy leg shields blanco sol was somehow allsatisfying to the eyes of the rangers  as long and big as diablo was sol was longer and bigger  also he was higher more powerful he looked more a thing for actionspeedier at a distance the honorable scars and lumps that marred his muscular legs were not visible  he grazed aloof from the others and did not cavort nor prance but when he lifted his head to whistle how wild he appeared and proud and splendid  the dazzling whiteness of the desert sun shone from his coat he had the fire and spirit of the desert in his noble head  its strength and power in his gigantic frame  belding swears sol never beat diablo dick was saying  he believes it replied nell  dad is queer about that horse  but laddy rode sol oncemade him beat diablo  jim saw the race  nell laughed  i saw it too  for that matter even i have made sol put his nose before dads favorite  id like to have seen that  nell arent you ever going to ride with me  some daywhen its safe  safe  ii mean when the raiders have left the border  oh im glad you mean that said dick laughing  well ive often wondered how belding ever came to give blanco sol to me  he was jealous  i think he wanted to get rid of sol  no  why nell hed give laddy or jim one of the whites any day  would he  not devil or queen or white woman  never in this world but dad has lots of fast horses the boys could pick from dick i tell you dad wants blanco sol to run himself outlose his speed on the desert  dad is just jealous for diablo  maybe  he surely has strange passion for horses  i think i understand better than i used to  i owned a couple of racers once they were just animals to me i guess  but blanco sol  do you love him asked nell and now a warm blue flash of eyes swept his face  do i  well rather  im glad  sol has been finer a better horse since you owned him  he loves you dick  hes always watching for you see him raise his head thats for you  i know as much about horses as dad or laddy any day sol always hated diablo and he never had much use for dad  dick looked up at her  itll bebe pretty hard to leave solwhen i go away  nell sat perfectly still  go away she asked presently with just the faintest tremor in her voice  yes  sometimes when i get blueas i am todayi think ill go but in sober truth nell its not likely that ill spend all my life here  there was no answer to this  dick put his hand softly over hers and despite her halfhearted struggle to free it he held on  nell  her color fled  he saw her lips part  then a heavy step on the gravel a cheerful complaining voice interrupted him and made him release nell and draw back  belding strode into view round the adobe shed  hey dick that darned yaqui indian cant be driven or hired or coaxed to leave forlorn river  hes well enough to travel  i offered him horse gun blanket grub  but no go  thats funny replied gale with a smile  let him stayput him to work  it doesnt strike me funny  but ill tell you what i think  that poor homeless heartbroken indian has taken a liking to you dick these desert yaquis are strange folk  ive heard strange stories about them  id believe most anything  and thats how i figure his case you saved his life  that sort of thing counts big with any indian even with an apache  with a yaqui maybe its of deep significance ive heard a yaqui say that with his tribe no debt to friend or foe ever went unpaid  perhaps thats what ails this fellow  dick dont laugh said nell  ive noticed the yaqui  its pathetic the way his great gloomy eyes follow you  youve made a friend continued belding  a yaqui could be a real friend on this desert  if he gets his strength back hell be of service to you dont mistake me  hes welcome here  but youre responsible for him and youll have trouble keeping him from massacring all the greasers in forlorn river   the probability of a visit from the raiders and a dash bolder than usual on the outskirts of a ranch led belding to build a new corral it was not sightly to the eye but it was high and exceedingly strong the gate was a massive affair swinging on huge hinges and fastening with heavy chains and padlocks  on the outside it had been completely covered with barb wire which would make it a troublesome thing to work on in the dark  at night belding locked his white horses in this corral  the papago herdsman slept in the adobe shed adjoining  belding did not imagine that any wooden fence however substantially built could keep determined raiders from breaking it down  they would have to take time however and make considerable noise and belding relied on these facts  belding did not believe a band of night raiders would hold out against a hot rifle fire  so he began to make up some of the sleep he had lost  it was noteworthy however that ladd did not share beldings sanguine hopes  jim lash rode in reporting that all was well out along the line toward the sonoyta oasis  days passed and belding kept his rangers home nothing was heard of raiders at hand  many of the newcomers both american and mexican who came with wagons and pack trains from casita stated that property and life were cheap back in that rebelinfested town  one january morning dick gale was awakened by a shrill menacing cry he leaped up bewildered and frightened he heard beldings booming voice answering shouts and rapid steps on flagstones  but these had not awakened him  heavy breaths almost sobs seemed at his very door in the cold and gray dawn dick saw something white  gun in hand he bounded across the room  just outside his door stood blanco sol  it was not unusual for sol to come poking his head in at dicks door during daylight  but now in the early dawn when he had been locked in the corral it meant raidersno less  dick called softly to the snorting horse and hurriedly getting into clothes and boots he went out with a gun in each hand  sol was quivering in every muscle  like a dog he followed dick around the house hearing shouts in the direction of the corrals gale bent swift steps that way  he caught up with jim lash who was also leading a white horse  hello jim  guess its all over but the fireworks said dick  i caint say just what has come off replied lash  ive got the bull  found him runnin in the yard  they reached the corral to find belding shaking roaring like a madman the gate was open the corral was empty  ladd stooped over the ground evidently trying to find tracks  i reckon we might jest as well cool off an wait for daylight suggested jim  shore  theyve flown the coop you can gamble on that  tom wheres the papago  said ladd  hes gone laddygone  doublecrossed us eh  i see heres a crowbar lyin by the gatepost that indian fetched it from the forge  it was used to pry out the bolts an steeples  tom i reckon there wasnt much time lost forcin that gate  belding in shirt sleeves and barefooted roared with rage he said he had heard the horses running as he leaped out of bed  what woke you asked laddy  sol  he came whistling for dick  didnt you hear him before i called you  hear him  he came thunderin right under my window  i jumped up in bed an when he let out that blast jim lit square in the middle of the floor an i was scared stiff  dick seein it was your room he blew into what did you think  i couldnt think  im shaking yet laddy  boys ill bet sol spilled a few raiders if any got hands on him said jim  now lets sit down an wait for daylight  its my idea well find some of the hosses runnin loose  tom you go an get some clothes on  its freezin cold  an dont forget to tell the women folks were all right  daylight made clear some details of the raid  the cowboys found tracks of eight raiders coming up from the river bed where their horses had been left  evidently the papago had been false to his trust  his few personal belongings were gone  lash was correct in his idea of finding more horses loose in the fields  the men soon rounded up eleven of the whites all more or less frightened and among the number were queen and blanca mujer  the raiders had been unable to handle more than one horse for each man  it was bitter irony of fate that belding should lose his favorite the one horse more dear to him than all the others somewhere out on the trail a raider was fighting the ironjawed savage blanco diablo  i reckon were some lucky observed jim lash  lucky aint enough word replied ladd  you see it was this way some of the raiders piled over the fence while the others worked on the gate  mebbe the papago went inside to pick out the best hosses  but it didnt work except with diablo an how they ever got him i dont know  id have gambled itd take all of eight men to steal him  but greasers have got us skinned on handlin hosses  belding was unconsolable  he cursed and railed and finally declared he was going to trail the raiders  tom you just aint agoin to do nothin of the kind said ladd coolly  belding groaned and bowed his head  laddy youre right he replied presently  ive got to stand it i cant leave the women and my property  but its sure tough im sore way down deep and nothin but blood would ever satisfy me  leave that to me an jim said ladd  what do you mean to do demanded belding starting up  shore i dont know yet give me a light for my pipe  an dick go fetch out your yaqui    viii  the running of blanco sol  the yaquis strange dark glance roved over the corral the swinging gate with its broken fastenings the tracks in the road and then rested upon belding  malo he said and his spanish was clear  shore yaqui about eight bad men an a traitor indian said ladd  i think he means my herder added belding  if he does that settles any doubt it might be decent to haveyaquimalo papagosi  the yaqui spread wide his hands  then he bent over the tracks in the road  they led everywhither but gradually he worked out of the thick net to take the trail that the cowboys had followed down to the river belding and the rangers kept close at his heels occasionally dick lent a helping hand to the still feeble indian he found a trampled spot where the raiders had left their horses from this point a deeply defined narrow trail led across the dry river bed  belding asked the yaqui where the raiders would head for in the sonora desert  for answer the indian followed the trail across the stream of sand through willows and mesquite up to the level of rock and cactus at this point he halted  a sandfilled almost obliterated trail led off to the left and evidently went round to the east of no name mountains  to the right stretched the road toward papago well and the sonoyta oasis  the trail of the raiders took a southeasterly course over untrodden desert the yaqui spoke in his own tongue then in spanish  think he means slow march said belding  laddy from the looks of that trail the greasers are having trouble with the horses  tom shore a boy could see that replied laddy  ask yaqui to tell us where the raiders are headin an if theres water  it was wonderful to see the yaqui point  his dark hand stretched he sighted over his stretched finger at a low white escarpment in the distance  then with a stick he traced a line in the sand and then at the end of that another line at right angles  he made crosses and marks and holes and as he drew the rude map he talked in yaqui in spanish with a word here and there in english belding translated as best he could  the raiders were heading southeast toward the railroad that ran from nogales down into sonora  it was four days travel bad trail good sure waterhole one day out then water not sure for two days  raiders traveling slow bothered by too many horses not looking for pursuit were never pursued could be headed and ambushed that night at the first waterhole a natural trap in a valley  the men returned to the ranch  the rangers ate and drank while making hurried preparations for travel  blanco sol and the cowboys horses were fed watered and saddled  ladd again refused to ride one of beldings whites  he was quick and cold  get me a longrange rifle an lots of shells  rustle now he said  laddy you dont want to be weighted down protested belding  shore i want a gun thatll outshoot the dinky little carbines an muskets used by the rebels  trot one out an be quick  ive got a 405 a longbarreled heavy rifle thatll shoot a mile i use it for mountain sheep  but laddy itll break that bronchs back  his back wont break so easy dick take plenty of shells for your remington  an dont forget your field glass  in less than an hour after the time of the raid the three rangers heavily armed and superbly mounted on fresh horses rode out on the trail  as gale turned to look back from the far bank of forlorn river he saw nell waving a white scarf  he stood high in his stirrups and waved his sombrero  then the mesquites hid the girls slight figure and gale wheeled grimfaced to follow the  rangers  they rode in single file with ladd in the lead  he did not keep to the trail of the raiders all the time  he made short cuts the raiders were traveling leisurely and they evinced a liking for the most level and least cactuscovered stretches of ground but the cowboy took a beeline course for the white escarpment pointed out by the yaqui and nothing save deep washes and impassable patches of cactus or rocks made him swerve from it he kept the broncho at a steady walk over the rougher places and at a swinging indian canter over the hard and level ground  the sun grew hot and the wind began to blow  dust clouds rolled along the blue horizon  whirling columns of sand like water spouts at sea circled up out of white arid basins and swept away and spread aloft before the wind  the escarpment began to rise to change color to show breaks upon its rocky face  whenever the rangers rode out on the brow of a knoll or ridge or an eminence before starting to descend ladd required of gale a long careful sweeping survey of the desert ahead through the field glass there were streams of white dust to be seen streaks of yellow dust trailing low clouds of sand over the glistening dunes but no steadily rising uniformly shaped puffs that would tell a tale of moving horses on the desert  at noon the rangers got out of the thick cactus  moreover the gravelbottomed washes the low weathering rotting ledges of yellow rock gave place to hard sandy rolls and bare clay knolls the desert resembled a rounded hummocky sea of color  all light shades of blue and pink and yellow and mauve were there dominated by the glaring white sun  mirages glistened wavered faded in the shimmering waves of heat  dust as fine as powder whiffed up from under the tireless hoofs  the rangers rode on and the escarpment began to loom  the desert floor inclined perceptibly upward  when gale got an unobstructed view of the slope of the escarpment he located the raiders and horses  in another hours travel the rangers could see with naked eyes a long faint moving streak of black and white dots  theyre headin for that yellow pass said ladd pointing to a break in the eastern end of the escarpment  when they get out of sight well rustle  im thinkin that waterhole the yaqui spoke of lays in the pass  the rangers traveled swiftly over the remaining miles of level desert leading to the ascent of the escarpment  when they achieved the gateway of the pass the sun was low in the west  dwarfed mesquite and greasewood appeared among the rocks  ladd gave the word to tie up horses and go forward on foot  the narrow neck of the pass opened and descended into a valley half a mile wide perhaps twice that in length  it had apparently unscalable slopes of weathered rock leading up to beetling walls with floor bare and hard and white except for a patch of green mesquite near the far end it was a lurid and desolate spot the barren bottom of a desert bowl  keep down boys said ladd  theres the waterhole an hosses have sharp eyes  shore the yaqui figgered this place  i never seen its like for a trap  both white and black horses showed against the green and a thin curling column of blue smoke rose lazily from amid the mesquites  i reckon wed better wait till dark or mebbe daylight said jim lash  let me figger some  dick what do you make of the outlet to this hole  looks rough to me  with his glass gale studied the narrow construction of walls and roughened rising floor  laddy its harder to get out at that end than here he replied  shore thats hard enough  let me have a look well boys it dont take no figgerin for this job  jim ill want you at the other end blockin the pass when were ready to start  whenll that be inquired jim  soon as its light enough in the mornin  that greaser outfit will hang till tomorrow  theres no sure water ahead for two days you remember  i reckon i can slip through to the other end after dark said lash thoughtfully  it might get me in bad to go round  the rangers stole back from the vantage point and returned to their horses which they untied and left farther round among broken sections of cliff  for the horses it was a dry hungry camp but the rangers built a fire and had their short though strengthening meal  the location was high and through a break in the jumble of rocks the great colored void of desert could be seen rolling away endlessly to the west  the sun set and after it had gone down the golden tips of mountains dulled their lower shadows creeping upward  jim lash rolled in his saddle blanket his feet near the fire and went to sleep  ladd told gale to do likewise while he kept the fire up and waited until it was late enough for jim to undertake circling round the raiders  when gale awakened the night was dark cold windy  the stars shone with white brilliance jim was up saddling his horse and ladd was talking low when gale rose to accompany them both rangers said he need not go but gale wanted to go because that was the thing ladd or jim would have done  with ladd leading they moved away into the gloom  advance was exceedingly slow careful silent  under the walls the blackness seemed impenetrable  the horse was as cautious as his master ladd did not lose his way nevertheless he wound between blocks of stone and clumps of mesquite and often tried a passage to abandon it  finally the trail showed pale in the gloom and eastern stars twinkled between the lofty ramparts of the pass  the advance here was still as stealthily made as before but not so difficult or slow  when the dense gloom of the pass lightened and there was a wide space of sky and stars overhead ladd halted and stood silent a moment  luck again he whispered  the winds in your face jim  the horses wont scent you  go slow  dont crack a stone  keep close under the wall  try to get up as high as this at the other end wait till daylight before riskin a loose slope  ill be ridin the job early thats all  ladds cool easy speech was scarcely significant of the perilous undertaking  lash moved very slowly away leading his horse the soft pads of hoofs ceased to sound about the time the gray shape merged into the black shadows  then ladd touched dicks arm and turned back up the trail  but dick tarried a moment  he wanted a fuller sense of that ebonybottomed abyss with its pale encircling walls reaching up to the dusky blue sky and the brilliant stars  there was absolutely no sound  he retraced his steps down soon coming up with ladd and together they picked a way back through the winding recesses of cliff  the campfire was smoldering  ladd replenished it and lay down to get a few hours sleep while gale kept watch  the after part of the night wore on till the paling of stars the thickening of gloom indicated the dark hour before dawn  the spot was secluded from wind but the air grew cold as ice  gale spent the time stripping wood from a dead mesquite in pacing to and fro in listening  blanco sol stamped occasionally which sound was all that broke the stilliness ladd awoke before the faintest gray appeared  the rangers ate and drank  when the black did lighten to gray they saddled the horses and led them out to the pass and down to the point where they had parted with lash  here they awaited daylight  to gale it seemed long in coming  such a delay always aggravated the slow fire within him  he had nothing of ladds patience  he wanted action  the gray shadow below thinned out and the patch of mesquite made a blot upon the pale valley  the day dawned  still ladd waited  he grew more silent grimmer as the time of action approached  gale wondered what the plan of attack would be  yet he did not ask  he waited ready for orders  the valley grew clear of gray shadow except under leaning walls on the eastern side  then a straight column of smoke rose from among the mesquites  manifestly this was what ladd had been awaiting  he took the long 405 from its sheath and tried the lever  then he lifted a cartridge belt from the pommel of his saddle  every ring held a shell and these shells were four inches long  he buckled the belt round him  come on dick  ladd led the way down the slope until he reached a position that commanded the rising of the trail from a level  it was the only place a man or horse could leave the valley for the pass  dick heres your stand  if any raider rides in range take a crack at him now i want the lend of your hoss  blanco sol  exclaimed gale more in amazement that ladd should ask for the horse than in reluctance to lend him  will you let me have him ladd repeated almost curtly  certainly laddy  a smile momentarily chased the dark cold gloom that had set upon the rangers lean face  shore i appreciate it dick  i know how you care for that hoss i guess mebbe charlie ladd has loved a hoss  an one not so good as sol i was only tryin your nerve dick askin you without tellin my plan sol wont get a scratch you can gamble on that ill ride him down into the valley an pull the greasers out in the open  theyve got shortranged carbines  they cant keep out of range of the 405 an ill be takin the dust of their lead  sabe senor  laddy  youll run sol away from the raiders when they chase you run him after them when they try to get away  shore  ill run all the time  they cant gain on sol an hell run them down when i want  can you beat it  no  its great but suppose a raider comes out on blanco diablo  i reckon thats the one weak place in my plan  im figgerin theyll never think of that till its too late  but if they do well sol can outrun diablo  an i can always kill the white devil  ladds strange hate of the horse showed in the passion of his last words in his hardening jaw and grim set lips  gales hand went swiftly to the rangers shoulder  laddy  dont kill diablo unless its to save your life  all right  but by god if i get a chance ill make blanco sol run him off his legs  he spoke no more and set about changing the length of sols stirrups when he had them adjusted to suit he mounted and rode down the trail and out upon the level  he rode leisurely as if merely going to water his horse  the long black rifle lying across his saddle however was ominous  gale securely tied the other horse to a mesquite at hand and took a position behind a low rock over which he could easily see and shoot when necessary  he imagined jim lash in a similar position at the far end of the valley blocking the outlet  gale had grown accustomed to danger and the hard and fierce feelings peculiar to it  but the coming drama was so peculiarly different in promise from all he had experienced that he waited the moment of action with thrilling intensity  in him stirred long brooding wrath at these border raidersaffection for belding and keen desire to avenge the outrages he had sufferedwarm admiration for the cold implacable ladd and his absolute fearlessness and a curious throbbing interest in the old muchdiscussed and neverdecided argument as to whether blanco sol was fleeter stronger horse than blanco diablo  gale felt that he was to see a race between these great rivalsthe kind of race that made men and horses terrible  ladd rode a quarter of a mile out upon the flat before anything happened  then a whistle rent the still cold air  a horse had seen or scented blanco sol  the whistle was prolonged faint but clear it made the blood thrum in gales ears  sol halted  his head shot up with the old wild spirited sweep  gale leveled his glass at the patch of mesquites  he saw the raiders running to an open place pointing gesticulating  the glass brought them so close that he saw the dark faces  suddenly they broke and fled back among the trees then he got only white and dark gleams of moving bodies  evidently that moment was one of boots guns and saddles for the raiders  lowering the glass gale saw that blanco sol had started forward again his gait was now a canter and he had covered another quarter of a mile before horses and raiders appeared upon the outskirts of the mesquites then blanco sol stopped his shrill ringing whistle came distinctly to gales ears the raiders were mounted on dark horses and they stood abreast in a motionless line  gale chuckled as he appreciated what a puzzle the situation presented for them  a lone horseman in the middle of the valley did not perhaps seem so menacing himself as the possibilities his presence suggested  then gale saw a raider gallop swiftly from the group toward the farther outlet of the valley  this might have been owing to characteristic cowardice but it was more likely a move of the raiders to make sure of retreat  undoubtedly ladd saw this galloping horseman  a few waiting moments ensued  the galloping horseman reached the slope began to climb  with naked eyes gale saw a puff of white smoke spring out of the rocks  then the raider wheeled his plunging horse back to the level and went racing wildly down the valley  the compact bunch of bays and blacks seemed to break apart and spread rapidly from the edge of the mesquites  puffs of white smoke indicated firing and showed the nature of the raiders excitement they were far out of ordinary range but they spurred toward ladd shooting as they rode  ladd held his ground the big white horse stood like a rock in his tracks  gale saw little spouts of dust rise in front of blanco sol and spread swift as sight to his rear the raiders bullets striking low were skipping along the hard bare floor of the valley  then ladd raised the long rifle  there was no smoke but three high spanging reports rang out  a gap opened in the dark line of advancing horsemen then a riderless steed sheered off to the right  blanco sol seemed to turn as on a pivot and charged back toward the lower end of the valley he circled over to gales right and stretched out into his run  there were now five raiders in pursuit and they came sweeping down yelling and shooting evidently sure of their quarry  ladd reserved his fire he kept turning from back to front in his saddle  gale saw how the space widened between pursuers and pursued saw distinctly when ladd eased up sols running  manifestly ladd intended to try to lead the raiders round in front of gales position and presently gale saw he was going to succeed  the raiders riding like vaqueros swept on in a curve cutting off what distance they could one fellow a small wiry rider high on his mounts neck like a jockey led his companions by many yards  he seemed to be getting the range of ladd or else he shot high for his bullets did not strike up the dust behind sol gale was ready to shoot  blanco sol pounded by his rapid rhythmic hoofbeats plainly to be heard  he was running easily  gale tried to still the jump of heart and pulse and turned his eye again on the nearest pursuer  this raider was crossing in his carbine held muzzle up in his right hand and he was coming swiftly  it was a long shot upward of five hundred yards  gale had not time to adjust the sights of the remington but he knew the gun and holding coarsely upon the swiftly moving blot he began to shoot  the first bullet sent up a great splash of dust beneath the horses nose making him leap as if to hurdle a fence the rifle was automatic gale needed only to pull the trigger  he saw now that the raiders behind were in line  swiftly he worked the trigger  suddenly the leading horse leaped convulsively not up nor aside but straight ahead and then he crashed to the ground throwing his rider like a catapult and then slid and rolled  he half got up fell back and kicked but his rider never moved  the other raiders sawed the reins of plunging steeds and whirled to escape the unseen battery  gale slipped a fresh clip into the magazine of his rifle  he restrained himself from useless firing and gave eager eye to the duel below  ladd began to shoot while sol was running  the 405 rang out sharplythen again  the heavy bullets streaked the dust all the way across the valley  ladd aimed deliberately and pulled slowly unmindful of the kicking dustpuffs behind sol and to the side  the raiders spurred madly in pursuit loading and firing  they shot ten times while ladd shot once and all in vain and on ladds sixth shot a raider topped backward threw his carbine and fell with his foot catching in a stirrup  the frightened horse plunged away dragging him in a path of dust  gale had set himself to miss nothing of that fighting race yet the action passed too swiftly for clear sight of all  ladd had emptied a magazine and now blanco sol quickened and lengthened his running stride  he ran away from his pursuers  then it was that the rangers ruse was divined by the raiders  they hauled sharply up and seemed to be conferring  but that was a fatal mistake  blanco sol was seen to break his gait and slow down in several jumps then square away and stand stockstill  ladd fired at the closely grouped raiders  an instant passed  then gale heard the spat of a bullet out in front saw a puff of dust then heard the lead strike the rocks and go whining away  and it was after this that one of the raiders fell prone from his saddle the steeljacketed 405 had gone through him on its uninterrupted way to hum past gales position  the remaining two raiders frantically spurred their horses and fled up the valley  ladd sent sol after them  it seemed to gale even though he realized his excitement that blanco sol made those horses seem like snails  the raiders split one making for the eastern outlet the other circling back of the mesquites  ladd kept on after the latter then puffs of white smoke and rifle shots faintly crackling told jim lashs hand in the game  however he succeeded only in driving the raider back into the valley  but ladd had turned the other horseman and now it appeared the two raiders were between lash above on the stony slope and ladd below on the level there was desperate riding on part of the raiders to keep from being hemmed in closer  only one of them got away and he came riding for life down under the eastern wall blanco sol settled into his graceful beautiful swing  he gained steadily though he was far from extending himself  by gales actual count the raider fired eight times in that race down the valley and all his bullets went low and wide he pitched the carbine away and lost all control in headlong flight  some few hundred rods to the left of gale the raider put his horse to the weathered slope  he began to climb  the horse was superb infinitely more courageous than his rider  zigzag they went up and up and when ladd reached the edge of the slope they were high along the cracked and guttered rampart  oncetwice ladd raised the long rifle but each time he lowered it  gale divined that the rangers restraint was not on account of the mexican but for that valiant and faithful horse  up and up he went and the yellow dust clouds rose and an avalanche rolled rattling and cracking down the slope  it was beyond belief that a horse burdened or unburdened could find footing and hold it upon that wall of narrow ledges and inverted slanting gullies but he climbed on surefooted as a mountain goat and surmounting the last rough steps he stood a moment silhouetted against the white sky then he disappeared  ladd sat astride blanco sol gazing upward  how the cowboy must have honored that raiders brave steed  gale who had been too dumb to shout the admiration he felt suddenly leaped up and his voice came with a shriek  look out laddy  a big horse like a white streak was bearing down to the right of the ranger  blanco diablo  a matchless rider swung with the horses motion  gale was stunned  then he remembered the first raider the one lash had shot at and driven away from the outlet this fellow had made for the mesquite and had put a saddle on beldings favorite  in the heat of the excitement while ladd had been intent upon the climbing horse this last raider had come down with the speed of the wind straight for the western outlet  perhaps very probably he did not know gale was there to block it and certainly he hoped to pass ladd and blanco sol  a touch of the spur made sol lunge forward to head off the raider diablo was in his stride but the distance and angle favored sol the raider had no carbine  he held aloft a gun ready to level it and fire he sat the saddle as if it were a stationary seat  gale saw ladd lean down and drop the 405 in the sand  he would take no chances of wounding beldings bestloved horse  then gale sat transfixed with suspended breath watching the horses thundering toward him  blanco diablo was speeding low fleet as an antelope fierce and terrible in his devilish action a horse for war and blood and death  he seemed unbeatable  yet to see the magnificently running blanco sol was but to court a doubt  gale stood spellbound  he might have shot the raider but he never thought of such a thing  the distance swiftly lessened  plain it was the raider could not make the opening ahead of ladd  he saw it and swerved to the left emptying his sixshooter as he turned his dark face gleamed as he flashed by gale  blanco sol thundered across  then the race became straight away up the valley  diablo was cold and sol was hot therein lay the only handicap and vantage  it was a fleet beautiful magnificent race  gale thrilled and exulted and yelled as his horse settled into a steadily swifter run and began to gain  the dust rolled in a funnelshaped cloud from the flying hoofs  the raider wheeled with gun puffing white and ladd ducked low over the neck of his horse  the gap between diablo and sol narrowed yard by yard  at first it had been a wide one  the raider beat his mount and spurred beat and spurred wheeled round to shoot then bent forward again in his circle at the upper end of the valley he turned far short of the jumble of rocks  all the devil that was in blanco diablo had its running on the downward stretch  the strange cruel urge of bit and spur the crazed rider who stuck like a burr upon him the shots and smoke added terror to his natural violent temper  he ran himself off his feet  but he could not elude that relentless horse behind him the running of blanco sol was that of a sure remorseless driving powersteadierstrongerswifter with every long and wonderful stride  the raider tried to sheer diablo off closer under the wall to make the slope where his companion had escaped  but diablo was uncontrollable he was running wild with breaking gait  closer and closer crept that white smoothly gliding beautiful machine of speed  then like one white flash following another the two horses gleamed down the bank of a wash and disappeared in clouds of dust  gale watched with strained and smarting eyes  the thick throb in his ears was pierced by faint sounds of gunshots  then he waited in almost unendurable suspense  suddenly something whiter than the background of dust appeared above the low roll of valley floor  gale leveled his glass  in the clear circle shone blanco sols noble head with its long black bar from ears to nose  sols head was drooping now  another second showed ladd still in the saddle  the ranger was leading blanco diablespentbrokendraggingriderless    ix  an interrupted siesta  no man ever had a more eloquent and beautiful pleader for his cause than had dick gale in mercedes castaneda  he peeped through the green shining twigs of the palo verde that shaded his door  the hour was high noon and the patio was sultry  the only sounds were the hum of bees in the flowers and the low murmur of the spanish girls melodious voice  nell lay in the hammock her hands behind her head with rosy cheeks and arch eyes  indeed she looked rebellious  certain it was dick reflected that the young lady had fully recovered the wilful personality which had lain dormant for a while  equally certain it seemed that mercedess earnestness was not apparently having the effect it should have had  dick was inclined to be rebellious himself  belding had kept the rangers in off the line and therefore dick had been idle most of the time and though he tried hard he had been unable to stay far from nells vicinity  he believed she cared for him but he could not catch her alone long enough to verify his tormenting hope  when alone she was as illusive as a shadow as quick as a flash as mysterious as a yaqui  when he tried to catch her in the garden or fields or corner her in the patio she eluded him and left behind a memory of darkblue haunting eyes  it was that look in her eyes which lent him hope  at other times when it might have been possible for dick to speak nell clung closely to mercedes  he had long before enlisted the loyal mercedes in his cause but in spite of this nell had been more than a match for them both  gale pondered over an idea he had long revolved in mind and which now suddenly gave place to a decision that made his heart swell and his cheek burn  he peeped again through the green branches to see nell laughing at the fiery mercedes  quien sabe he called mockingly and was delighted with nells quick amazed start  then he went in search of mrs belding and found her busy in the kitchen  the relation between gale and mrs belding had subtly and incomprehensively changed  he understood her less than when at first he divined an antagonism in her  if such a thing were possible she had retained the antagonism while seeming to yield to some influence that must have been fondness for him  gale was in no wise sure of her affection and he had long imagined she was afraid of him or of something that he represented  he had gone on openly and fairly though discreetly with his rather onesided love affair and as time passed he had grown less conscious of what had seemed her unspoken opposition  gale had come to care greatly for nells mother  not only was she the comfort and strength of her home but also of the inhabitants of forlorn river  indian mexican american were all the same to her in trouble or illness and then she was nurse doctor peacemaker helper  she was good and noble and there was not a child or grownup in forlorn river who did not love and bless her  but mrs belding did not seem happy  she was brooding intense deep strong eager for the happiness and welfare of others and she was dominated by a worship of her daughter that was as strange as it was pathetic  mrs belding seldom smiled and never laughed there was always a soft sad hurt look in her eyes  gale often wondered if there had been other tragedy in her life than the supposed loss of her father in the desert perhaps it was the very unsolved nature of that loss which made it haunting  mrs belding heard dicks step as he entered the kitchen and looking up greeted him  mother began dick earnestly  belding called her that and so did ladd and lash but it was the first time for dick  motheri want to speak to you  the only indication mrs belding gave of being started was in her eyes which darkened shadowed with multiplying thought  i love nell went on dick simply and i want you to let me ask her to be my wife  mrs beldings face blanched to a deathly white  gale thinking with surprise and concern that she was going to faint moved quickly toward her took her arm  forgive me  i was blunt but i thought you knew  ive known for a long time replied mrs belding  her voice was steady and there was no evidence of agitation except in her pallor then youyou havent spoken to nell  dick laughed  ive been trying to get a chance to tell her  i havent had it yet  but she knows  there are other ways besides speech  and mercedes has told her  i hope i almost believe nell cares a little for me  ive known that too for a long time said mrs belding low almost as a whisper  you know cried dick with a glow and rush of feeling  dick you must be very blind not to see what has been plain to all of us i guessit couldnt have been helped  youre a splendid fellow  no wonder she loves you  mother  youll give her to me  she drew him to the light and looked with strange piercing intentness into his face  gale had never dreamed a womans eyes could hold such a world of thought and feeling  it seemed all the sweetness of life was there and all the pain  do you love her she asked  with all my heart  you want to marry her  ah i want to  as much as i want to live and work for her  when would you marry her  why just as soon as she will do it  tomorrow dick gave a wild exultant little laugh  dick gale you want my nell  you love her just as she isher sweetnessher goodness  just herself body and soul theres nothing could change younothing  dear mrs belding i love nell for herself  if she loves me ill be the happiest of men  theres absolutely nothing that could make any difference in me  but your people  oh dick you come of a proud family  i can tell ii once knew a young man like you  a few months cant change prideblood  years cant change them  youve become a ranger  you love the adventurethe wild life  that wont last perhaps youll settle down to ranching  i know you love the west but dick theres your family  if you want to know anything about my family ill tell you interrupted dick with strong feeling  ive not secrets about them or myself  my future and happiness are nells to make  no one else shall count with me  then dickyou may have her  godblessyouboth  mrs beldings strained face underwent a swift and mobile relaxation and suddenly she was weeping in strangely mingled happiness and bitterness  why mother  gale could say no more  he did not comprehend a mood seemingly so utterly at variance with mrs beldings habitual temperament  but he put his arm around her  in another moment she had gained command over herself and kissing him she pushed him out of the door  there  go tell her dick and have some spunk about it  gale went thoughtfully back to his room  he vowed that he would answer for nells happiness if he had the wonderful good fortune to win her then remembering the hope mrs belding had given him dick lost his gravity in a flash and something began to dance and ring within him he simply could not keep his steps turned from the patio  every path led there  his blood was throbbing his hopes mounting his spirit soaring  he knew he had never before entered the patio with that inspirited presence  now for some spunk he said under his breath  plainly he meant his merry whistle and his buoyant step to interrupt this first languorous stage of the siesta which the girls always took during the hot hours  nell had acquired the habit long before mercedes came to show how fixed a thing it was in the life of the tropics  but neither girl heard him  mercedes lay under the palo verde her beautiful head dark and still upon a cushion  nell was asleep in the hammock  there was an abandonment in her deep repose and a faint smile upon her face  her sweet red lips with the soft perfect curve had always fascinated dick and now drew him irresistibly  he had always been consumed with a desire to kiss her and now he was overwhelmed with his opportunity it would be a terrible thing to do but if she did not awaken at once  no he would fight the temptation that would be more than spunk  it would  suddenly an ugly green fly sailed low over nell appeared about to alight on her  noiselessly dick stepped close to the hammock bent under the tree and with a sweep of his hand chased the intruding fly away  but he found himself powerless to straighten up  he was close to herbending over her facenear the sweet lips  the insolent dreaming smile just parted them  then he thought he was lost  but she stirredhe feared she would awaken  he had stepped back erect when she opened her eyes  they were sleepy yet surprised until she saw him  then she was wide awake in a second bewildered uncertain  whyyou here she asked slowly  large as life replied dick with unusual gayety  how long have you been here  just got here this fraction of a second he replied lying shamelessly  it was evident that she did not know whether or not to believe him and as she studied him a slow blush dyed her cheek  you are absolutely truthful when you say you just stepped there  why of course answered dick right glad he did not have to lie about that  i thoughti wasdreaming she said and evidently the sound of her voice reassured her  yes you looked as if you were having pleasant dreams replied dick so sorry to wake you  i cant see how i came to do it i was so quiet  mercedes didnt wake  well ill go and let you have your siesta and dreams  but he did not move to go  nell regarded him with curious speculative eyes  isnt it a lovely day queried dick  i think its hot  only ninety in the shade  and youve told me the mercury goes to one hundred and thirty in midsummer  this is just a glorious golden day  yesterday was finer but you didnt notice it  oh yesterday was somewhere back in the pastthe inconsequential past  nells sleepy blue eyes opened a little wider  she did not know what to make of this changed young man  dick felt gleeful and tried hard to keep the fact from becoming manifest  whats the inconsequential past  you seem remarkably happy today  i certainly am happy  adios  pleasant dreams  dick turned away then and left the patio by the opening into the yard nell was really sleepy and when she had fallen asleep again he would return  he walked around for a while  belding and the rangers were shoeing a broncho  yaqui was in the field with the horses  blanco sol grazed contently and now and then lifted his head to watch  his long ears went up at sight of his master and he whistled  presently dick as if magnetdrawn retraced his steps to the patio and entered noiselessly  nell was now deep in her siesta  she was inert relaxed untroubled by dreams  her hair was damp on her brow  again nell stirred and gradually awakened  her eyes unclosed humid shadowy unconscious  they rested upon dick for a moment before they became clear and comprehensive  he stood back fully ten feet from her and to all outside appearances regarded her calmly  ive interrupted your siesta again he said  please forgive me ill take myself off  he wandered away and when it became impossible for him to stay away any longer he returned to the patio  the instant his glance rested upon nells face he divined she was feigning sleep  the faint roseblush had paled  the warm rich golden tint of her skin had fled  dick dropped upon his knees and bent over her  though his blood was churning in his veins his breast laboring his mind whirling with the wonder of that moment and its promise he made himself deliberate  he wanted more than anything he had ever wanted in his life to see if she would keep up that pretense of sleep and let him kiss her  she must have felt his breath for her hair waved off her brow  her cheeks were now white her breast swelled and sank  he bent down closercloser  but he must have been maddeningly slow for as he bent still closer nells eyes opened and he caught a swift purple gaze of eyes as she whirled her head then with  a little cry she rose and fled    x  rojas  no word from george thorne had come to forlorn river in weeks gale grew concerned over the fact and began to wonder if anything serious could have happened to him  mercedes showed a slow wearing strain  thornes commission expired the end of january and if he could not get his discharge immediately he surely could obtain leave of absence therefore gale waited not without growing anxiety and did his best to cheer mercedes  the first of february came bringing news of rebel activities and bandit operations in and around casita but not a word from the cavalryman  mercedes became silent mournful  her eyes were great black windows of tragedy  nell devoted herself entirely to the unfortunate girl dick exerted himself to persuade her that all would yet come well in fact the whole household could not have been kinder to a sister or a daughter  but their united efforts were unavailing  mercedes seemed to accept with fatalistic hopelessness a last and crowning misfortune  a dozen times gale declared he would ride in to casita and find out why they did not hear from thorne however older and wiser heads prevailed over his impetuosity  belding was not sanguine over the safety of the casita trail  refugees from there arrived every day in forlorn river and if tales they told were true real war would have been preferable to what was going on along the border  belding and the rangers and the yaqui held a consultation  not only had the indian become a faithful servant to gale but he was also of value to belding  yaqui had all the craft of his class and superior intelligence  his knowledge of mexicans was second only to his hate of them  and yaqui who had been scouting on all the trails gave information that made belding decide to wait some days before sending any one to casita  he required promises from his rangers particularly gale not to leave without his consent  it was upon gales coming from this conference that he encountered nell  since the interrupted siesta episode she had been more than ordinarily elusive and about all he had received from her was a tantalizing smile from a distance  he got the impression now however that she had awaited him  when he drew close to her he was certain of it and he experienced more than surprise  dick she began hurriedly  dads not going to send any one to see about thorne  no not yet  he thinks it best not to  we all think so  im sorry poor mercedes  i knew it  i tried to coax him to send laddy or even yaqui he wouldnt listen to me  dick mercedes is dying by inches cant you see what ails her  its more than love or fear  its uncertaintysuspense  oh cant we find out for her  nell i feel as badly as you about her  i wanted to ride in to casita  belding shut me up quick the last time  nell came close to gale clasped his arm  there was no color in her face  her eyes held a dark eager excitement  dick will you slip off without dads consent  risk it  go to casita and find out whats happened to thorneat least if he ever started for forlorn river  no nell i wont do that  she drew away from him with passionate suddenness  are you afraid  this certainly was not the nell burton that gale knew  no im not afraid gale replied a little nettled  will you gofor my sake  like lightning her mood changed and she was close to him again hands on his her face white her whole presence sweetly alluring  nell i wont disobey belding protested gale  i wont break my word  dick itll not be so bad as that  butwhat if it is go dick if not for poor mercedess sake then for mineto please me illill you wont lose anything by going  i think i know how mercedes feels  just a word from thorne or about him would save her take blanco sol and go dick  what rebel outfit could ever ride you down on that horse  why dick if i was up on sol i wouldnt be afraid of the whole rebel army  my dear girl its not a question of being afraid  its my wordmy duty to belding  you said you loved me  if you love me you will go you dont love me  gale could only stare at this transformed girl  dick listen if you goif you fetch some word of thorne to comfort mercedes youwell you will have your reward  nell  her dangerous sweetness was as amazing as this newly revealed character  dick will you go  nono cried gale in violence struggling with himself  nell burton ill tell you this  to have the reward i want would mean pretty near heaven for me  but not even for that will i break my word to your father  she seemed the incarnation of girlish scorn and wilful passion  gracias senor she replied mockingly  adios  then she flashed out of his sight  gale went to his room at once disturbed and thrilling and did not soon recover from that encounter  the following morning at the breakfast table nell was not present mrs belding evidently considered the fact somewhat unusual for she called out into the patio and then into the yard  then she went to mercedess room  but nell was not there either  shes in one of her tantrums lately said belding  wouldnt speak to me this morning  let her alone mother  shes spoiled enough without running after her  shes always hungry  shell be on hand presently dont mistake me  notwithstanding beldings conviction which gale shared nell did not appear at all during the hour  when belding and the rangers went outside yaqui was eating his meal on the bench where he always sat  yaquilluvia d oro si asked belding waving his hand toward the corrals  the indians beautiful name for nell meant shower of gold and belding used it in asking yaqui if he had seen her he received a negative reply  perhaps half an hour afterward as gale was leaving his room he saw the yaqui running up the path from the fields  it was markedly out of the ordinary to see the indian run  gale wondered what was the matter yaqui ran straight to belding who was at work at his bench under the wagon shed  in less than a moment belding was bellowing for his rangers  gale got to him first but ladd and lash were not far behind  blanco sol gone yelled belding in a rage  gone  in broad daylight with the indian awatchin queried ladd  it happened while yaqui was at breakfast  thats sure  hed just watered sol  raiders exclaimed jim lash  lord only knows  yaqui says it wasnt raiders  mebbe sols just walked off somewheres  he was haltered in the corral  send yaqui to find the hosss trail an lets figger said ladd shore this s no raider job  in the swift search that ensued gale did not have anything to say but his mind was forming a conclusion  when he found his old saddle and bridle missing from the peg in the barn his conclusion became a positive conviction and it made him for the moment cold and sick and speechless  hey dick dont take it so much to heart said belding  well likely find sol and if we dont theres other good horses  im not thinking of sol replied gale  ladd cast a sharp glance at gale snapped his fingers and said  damn me if i aint guessed it too  whats wrong with you locoed gents bluntly demanded belding  nell has slipped away on sol answered dick  there was a blank pause which presently belding broke  well thats all right if nells on him  i was afraid wed lost the horse  belding youre trackin bad said ladd wagging his head  nell has started for casita burst out gale  she has gone to fetch mercedes some word about thorne  oh belding you neednt shake your head  i know shes gone  she tried to persuade me to go and was furious when i wouldnt  i dont believe it replied belding hoarsely  nell may have her temper  shes a little devil at times but she always had good sense  tom you can gamble shes gone said ladd  aw hell no  jim what do you think implored belding  i reckon sols white head is pointed level an straight down the casita trail  an nell can ride  were losing time  that roused belding to action  i say youre all wrong he yelled starting for the corrals shes only taking a little ride same as shes done often  but rustle now find out  dick you ride cross the valley  jim you hunt up and down the river  ill head up san felipe way  and you laddy take diablo and hit the casita trail  if she really has gone after thorne you can catch her in an hour or so  shore ill go replied ladd  but beldin if youre not plumb crazy youre close to it  that big white devil cant catch sol not in an hour or a day or a week  whats more at the end of any runnin time with an even start sol will be farther in the lead an now sols got an hours start  laddy you mean to say sol is a faster horse than diablo thundered belding his face purple  shore  i mean to tell you just that there replied the ranger  illill bet a  were wastin time curtly interrupted ladd  you can gamble on this if you want to  ill ride your blanco devil as he never was rid before cept once when a damn sight better hossman than i am couldnt make him outrun sol  without more words the men saddled and were off not waiting for the yaqui to come in with possible information as to what trail blanco sol had taken  it certainly did not show in the clear sand of the level valley where gale rode to and fro  when gale returned to the house he found belding and lash awaiting him  they did not mention their own search but stated that yaqui had found blanco sols tracks in the casita trail  after some consultation belding decided to send lash along after ladd  the interminable time that followed contained for gale about as much suspense as he could well bear what astonished him and helped him greatly to fight off actual distress was the endurance of nells mother  early on the morning of the second day gale who had acquired an unbreakable habit of watching saw three white horses and a bay come wearily stepping down the road  he heard blanco sols familiar whistle and he leaped up wild with joy  the horse was riderless gales sudden joy received a violent check then resurged when he saw a limp white form in jim lashs arms  ladd was supporting a horseman who wore a military uniform  gale shouted with joy and ran into the house to tell the good news it was the everthoughtful mrs belding who prevented him from rushing in to tell mercedes  then he hurried out into the yard closely followed by the beldings  lash handed down a ragged travelstained wan girl into beldings arms  dad  mama  it was indeed a repentant nell but there was spirit yet in the tired blue eyes  then she caught sight of gale and gave him a faint smile  hellodick  nell  gale reached for her hand held it tightly and found speech difficult  you neednt worryabout your old horse she said as belding carried her toward the door  oh dick  blanco sol isglorious  gale turned to greet his friend  indeed it was but a haggard ghost of the cavalryman  thorne looked ill or wounded  gales greeting was also a question full of fear  thornes answer was a faint smile  he seemed ready to drop from the saddle  gale helped ladd hold thorne upon the horse until they reached the house  belding came out again  his welcome was checked as he saw the condition of the cavalryman  thorne reeled into dicks arms  but he was able to stand and walk  im nothurt  only weakstarved he said  is mercedes  take me to her  shell be well the minute she sees him averred belding as he and gale led the cavalryman to mercedess room  there they left him and gale at least felt his ears ringing with the girls broken cry of joy  when belding and gale hurried forth again the rangers were tending the tired horses  upon returning to the house jim lash calmly lit his pipe and ladd declared that hungry as he was he had to tell his story  shore beldin began ladd that was funny about diablo catchin blanco sol  funny aint the word  i nearly laughed myself to death well i rode in sols tracks all the way to casita  never seen a rebel or a raider till i got to town  figgered nell made the trip in five hours  i went straight to the camp of the cavalrymen an found them just coolin off an dressin down their hosses after what looked to me like a big ride  i got there too late for the fireworks  some soldier took me to an officers tent  nell was there some white an all in  she just said laddy  thorne was there too an he was bein worked over by the camp doctor  i didnt ask no questions because i seen quiet was needed round that tent  after satisfying myself that nell was all right an thorne in no danger i went out  shore there was so darn many fellers who wanted to an tried to tell me whatd come off i thought id never find out  but i got the story piece by piece  an heres what happened  nell rode blanco sol atearin into camp an had a crowd round her in a jiffy  she told who she was where shed come from an what she wanted  well it seemed a day or so before nell got there the cavalrymen had heard word of thorne  you see thorne had left camp on leave of absence some time before  he was shore mysterious they said an told nobody where he was goin a week or so after he left camp some greaser give it away that rojas had a prisoner in a dobe shack near his camp  nobody paid much attention to what the greaser said he wanted money for mescal  an it was usual for rojas to have prisoners  but in a few more days it turned out pretty sure that for some reason rojas was holdin thorne  now it happened when this news came colonel weede was in nogales with his staff an the officer left in charge didnt know how to proceed rojass camp was across the line in mexico an ridin over there was serious business  it meant a whole lot more than just scatterin one greaser camp  it was what had been botherin moren one colonel along the line  thornes feller soldiers was anxious to get him out of a bad fix but they had to wait for orders  when nell found out thorne was bein starved an beat in a dobe shack no moren two mile across the line she shore stirred up that cavalry camp  shore  she told them soldiers rojas was holdin thornetorturin him to make him tell where mercedes was she told about mercedeshow sweet an beautiful she washow her father had been murdered by rojashow she had been hounded by the bandithow ill an miserable she was waitin for her lover an she begged the cavalrymen to rescue thorne  from the way it was told to me i reckon them cavalrymen went up in the air  fine fiery lot of young bloods i thought achin for a scrap but the officer in charge bein in a ticklish place still held out for higher orders  then nell broke loose  youall know nells tongue is sometimes like a choya thorn  id have give somethin to see her work up that soldier outfit  nells never so pretty as when shes mad an this last stunt of hers was no girly tantrum as beldin calls it  she musta been ragin with all the hell theres in a woman cant you fellers see her on blanco sol with her eyes turnin black  ladd mopped his sweaty face with his dusty scarf  he was beaming he was growing excited hurried in his narrative  right out then nell swore shed go after thorne  if them cavalrymen couldnt ride with a western girl to save a brother americanlet them hang back  one feller under orders tried to stop blanco sol  an that feller invited himself to the hospital then the cavalrymen went flyin for their hosses  mebbe nells move was just foxywomans cunnin  but im thinkin as she felt then shed have sent blanco sol straight into rojass camp which id forgot to say was in plain sight  it didnt take long for every cavalryman in that camp to get wind of what was comin off  shore they musta been wild  they strung out after nell in a thunderin troop  say i wish you fellers could see the lane that bunch of hosses left in the greasewood an cactus  looks like thered been a cattle stampede on the desert blanco sol stayed out in front you can gamble on that  right into rojass camp  sabe you senors  gawd almighty  i never had grief that d hold a candle to this one of bein too late to see nell an sol in their one best race  rojas an his men vamoosed without a shot  that aint surprisin there wasnt a shot fired by anybody  the cavalrymen soon found thorne an hurried with him back on uncle sams land  thorne was half naked black an blue all over thin as a rail  he looked mighty sick when i seen him first  that was a little after midday he was given food an drink  shore he seemed a starved man but he picked up wonderful an by the time jim came along he was wantin to start for forlorn river so was nell  by main strength as much as persuasion we kept the two of them quiet till next evenin at dark  well we made as sneaky a start in the dark as jim an me could manage an never hit the trail till we was miles from town thornes nerve held him up for a while  then all at once he tumbled out of his saddle  we got him back an lash held him on nell didnt give out till daybreak  as ladd paused in his story belding began to stutter and finally he exploded  his mighty utterances were incoherent  but plainly the wrath he had felt toward the wilful girl was forgotten  gale remained gripped by silence  i reckon youll all be some surprised when you see casita went on ladd  its half burned an half tore down  an the rebels are livin fat  there was rumors of another federal force on the road from casa grandes  i seen a good many americans from interior mexico an the stories they told would make your hair stand up they all packed guns was fightin mad at greasers an sore on the good old u s  but shore glad to get over the line  some were waitin for trains which dont run reglar no more an others were ready to hit the trails north  laddy what knocks me is rojas holding thorne prisoner trying to make him tell where mercedes had been hidden said belding  shore  it d knock anybody  the bandits crazy over her  thats the spanish of it replied belding his voice rolling  rojas is a peon  hes been a slave to the proud castilian  he loves mercedes as he hates her  when i was down in durango i saw something of these peons insane passions  rojas wants this girl only to have her then kill her its damn strange boys and even with thorne here our troubles have just begun  tom you spoke correct said jim ladd in his cool drawl  shore im not sayin what i think added ladd  but the look of him was not indicative of a tranquil optimism  thorne was put to bed in gales room  he was very weak yet he would keep mercedess hand and gaze at her with unbelieving eyes mercedess failing hold on hope and strength seemed to have been a fantasy she was again vivid magnetic beautiful shot through and through with intense and throbbing life  she induced him to take food and drink then fighting sleep with what little strength he had left at last he succumbed  for all dick could ascertain his friend never stirred an eyelash nor a finger for twentyseven hours  when he awoke he was pale weak but the old thorne  hello dick i didnt dream it then he said  there you are and my darling with the proud dark eyesshes here  why yes you locoed cavalryman  say whats happened to you  it cant be those clothes and a little bronze on your face dick youre olderyouve changed youre not so thickly built  by gad if you dont look fine  thanks  im sorry i cant return the compliment  youre about the seediest hungriestlooking fellow i ever saw say old man you must have had a tough time  a dark and somber fire burned out the happiness in thornes eyes  dick dont make medont let me think of that fiend rojas im here now  ill be well in a day or two  then  mercedes came in radiant and softvoiced  she fell upon her knees beside thornes bed and neither of them appeared to see nell enter with a tray  then gale and nell made a good deal of unnecessary bustle in moving a small table close to the bed  mercedes had forgotten for the moment that her lover had been a starving man if thorne remembered it he did not care  they held hands and looked at each other without speaking  nell i thought i had it bad whispered dick  but im not  hush  its beautiful replied nell softly and she tried to coax dick from the room  dick however thought he ought to remain at least long enough to tell thorne that a man in his condition could not exist solely upon love  mercedes sprang up blushing with pretty penitent manner and moving white hands eloquent of her condition  oh mercedesdont go cried thorne as she stepped to the door  senor dick will stay  he is not mucha malo for youas i am  then she smiled and went out  good lord exclaimed thorne  how i love her  dick isnt she the most beautiful the loveliest the finest  george i share your enthusiasm said dick dryly but mercedes isnt the only girl on earth  manifestly this was a startling piece of information and struck thorne in more than one way  george went on dick did you happen to observe the girl who saved your lifewho incidentally just fetched in your breakfast  nell burton  why of course  shes brave a wonderful girl and really nicelooking  you long lean hungry beggar  that was the young lady who might answer the raving eulogy you just got out of your system iwell you havent cornered the love market  thorne uttered some kind of a sound that his weakened condition would not allow to be a whoop  dick  do you mean it  i shore do as laddy says  im glad dick with all my heart  i wondered at the changed look you wear  why boy youve got a different front call the lady in and you bet ill look her over right  i can see better now  eat your breakfast  theres plenty of time to dazzle you afterward  thorne fell to upon his breakfast and made it vanish with magic speed meanwhile dick told him something of a rangers life along the border  you neednt waste your breath said thorne  i guess i can see belding and those rangers have made you the real thingthe real western goods what i want to know is all about the girl  well laddy swears shes got your girl roped in the corral for looks  thats not possible  ill have to talk to laddy but she must be a wonder or dick gale would never have fallen for her isnt it great dick  im here  mercedes is wellsafe  youve got a girl oh but say i havent a dollar to my name  i had a lot of money dick and those robbers stole it my watcheverything damn that little black greaser  he got mercedess letters  i wish you could have seen him trying to read them  hes simply nutty over her dick i could have borne the loss of money and valuablesbut those beautiful wonderful letterstheyre gone  cheer up  you have the girl  belding will make you a proposition presently  the future smiles old friend  if this rebel business was only ended  dick youre going to be my savior twice over well now listen to me  his gay excitement changed to earnest gravity  i want to marry mercedes at once  is there a padre here  yes  but are you wise in letting any mexican even a priest know mercedes is hidden in forlorn river  it couldnt be kept much longer  gale was compelled to acknowledge the truth of this statement  ill marry her first then ill face my problem  fetch the padre dick  and ask our kind friends to be witnesses at the ceremony  much to gales surprise neither belding nor ladd objected to the idea of bringing a padre into the household and thereby making known to at least one mexican the whereabouts of mercedes castaneda beldings caution was wearing out in wrath at the persistent unsettled condition of the border and ladd grew only the cooler and more silent as possibilities of trouble multiplied  gale fetched the padre a little weazened timid man who was old and without interest or penetration  apparently he married mercedes and thorne as he told his beads or mumbled a prayer  it was mrs belding who kept the occasion from being a merry one and she insisted on not exciting thorne  gale marked her unusual pallor and the singular depth and sweetness of her voice  mother whats the use of making a funeral out of a marriage protested belding  a chance for some fun doesnt often come to forlorn river  youre a fine doctor  cant you see the girl is what thorne needed  hell be well tomorrow dont mistake me  george when youre all right again well add something to present congratulations said gale  we shore will put in ladd  so with parting jests and smiles they left the couple to themselves  belding enjoyed a laugh at his good wifes expense for thorne could not be kept in bed and all in a day it seemed he grew so well and so hungry that his friends were delighted and mercedes was radiant  in a few days his weakness disappeared and he was going the round of the fields and looking over the ground marked out in gales plan of water development  thorne was highly enthusiastic and at once staked out his claim for one hundred and sixty acres of land adjoining that of belding and the rangers these five tracts took in all the ground necessary for their operations but in case of the success of the irrigation project the idea was to increase their squatter holdings by purchase of more land down the valley  a hundred families had lately moved to forlorn river more were coming all the time and belding vowed he could see a vision of the whole altar valley green with farms  meanwhile everybody in beldings household except the quiet ladd and the watchful yaqui in the absence of disturbance of any kind along the border grew freer and more unrestrained as if anxiety was slowly fading in the peace of the present  jim lash made a trip to the sonoyta oasis and ladd patrolled fifty miles of the line eastward without incident or sight of raiders  evidently all the border hawks were in at the picking of casita  the february nights were cold with a dry icy penetrating coldness that made a warm fire most comfortable  beldings household usually congregated in the sittingroom where burning mesquite logs crackled in the open fireplace  beldings one passion besides horses was the game of checkers and he was always wanting to play  on this night he sat playing with ladd who never won a game and never could give up trying  mrs belding worked with her needle stopping from time to time to gaze with thoughtful eyes into the fire  jim lash smoked his pipe by the hearth and played with the cat on his knee  thorne and mercedes were at the table with pencil and paper and he was trying his best to keep his attention from his wifes beautiful animated face long enough to read and write a little spanish  gale and nell sat in a corner watching the bright fire  there came a low knock on the door  it may have been an ordinary knock for it did not disturb the women but to belding and his rangers it had a subtle meaning  whos that asked belding as he slowly pushed back his chair and looked at ladd  yaqui replied the ranger  come in called belding  the door opened and the short square powerfully built indian entered  he had a magnificent head strangely staring somber black eyes and very darkly bronzed face  he carried a rifle and strode with impressive dignity  yaqui what do you want asked belding and repeated his question in spanish  senor dick replied the indian  gale jumped up stifling an exclamation and he went outdoors with yaqui  he felt his arm gripped and allowed himself to be led away without asking a question  yaquis presence was always one of gloom and now his stern action boded catastrophe  once clear of trees he pointed to the level desert across the river where a row of campfires shone bright out of the darkness  raiders ejaculated gale  then he cautioned yaqui to keep sharp lookout and hurriedly returning to the house he called the men out and told them there were rebels or raiders camping just across the line  ladd did not say a word  belding with an oath slammed down his cigar  i knew it was too good to last dick you and jim stay here while laddy and i look around  dick returned to the sittingroom  the women were nervous and not to be deceived  so dick merely said yaqui had sighted some lights off in the desert and they probably were campfires  belding did not soon return and when he did he was alone and saying he wanted to consult with the men he sent mrs belding and the girls to their rooms  his gloomy anxiety had returned  laddys gone over to scout around and try to find out who the outfit belongs to and how many are in it said belding  i reckon if theyre raiders with bad intentions we wouldnt see no fires remarked jim calmly  it d be useless i suppose to send for the cavalry said gale whatevers coming off would be over before the soldiers could be notified let alone reach here  hell fellows  i dont look for an attack on forlorn river burst out belding  i cant believe that possible  these rebelraiders have a little sense  they wouldnt spoil their game by pulling u s soldiers across the line from yuma to el paso  but as jim says if they wanted to steal a few horses or cattle they wouldnt build fires im afraid its  belding hesitated and looked with grim concern at the cavalryman  what queried thorne  im afraid its rojas  thorne turned pale but did not lose his nerve  i thought of that at once  if true itll be terrible for mercedes and me  but rojas will never get his hands on my wife  if i cant kill him ill kill her belding this is tough on youthis risk we put upon your family i regret  cut that kind of talk replied belding bluntly  well if it is rojas hes acting damn strange for a raider  thats what worries me we cant do anything but wait  with laddy and yaqui out there we wont be surprised  lets take the best possible view of the situation until we know more  thatll not likely be before tomorrow  the women of the house might have gotten some sleep that night but it was certain the men did not get any  morning broke cold and gray the 19th of february  breakfast was prepared earlier than usual and an air of suppressed waiting excitement pervaded the place  otherwise the ordinary details of the mornings work continued as on any other day ladd came in hungry and cold and said the mexicans were not breaking camp  he reported a goodsized force of rebels and was taciturn as to his idea of forthcoming events  about an hour after sunrise yaqui ran in with the information that part of the rebels were crossing the river  that cant mean a fight yet declared belding  but get in the house boys and make ready anyway  ill meet them  drive them off the place same as if you had a company of soldiers backin you said ladd  dont give them an inch  were in bad and the bigger bluff we put up the more likely our chance  belding youre an officer of the united states  mexicans are much impressed by show of authority  ive seen that often in camp said thorne  oh i know the whitelivered greasers better than any of you dont mistake me replied belding  he was pale with rage but kept command over himself  the rangers with yaqui and thorne stationed themselves at the several windows of the sittingroom  rifles and smaller arms and boxes of shells littered the tables and window seats  no small force of besiegers could overcome a resistance such as belding and his men were capable of making  here they come boys called gale from his window  rebelraiders i should say laddy  shore  an a fine outfit of buzzards  reckon theres about a dozen in the bunch observed the calm lash some hosses theyre ridin  where n the hell do they get such hosses anyhow  shore jim they work hard an buy em with real silver pesos replied ladd sarcastically  do any of you see rojas whispered thorne  nix  no dandy bandit in that outfit  its too far to see said gale  the horsemen halted at the corrals  they were orderly and showed no evidence of hostility  they were however fully armed  belding stalked out to meet them  apparently a leader wanted to parley with him but belding would hear nothing  he shook his head waved his arms stamped to and fro and his loud angry voice could be heard clear back at the house  whereupon the detachment of rebels retired to the bank of the river beyond the white post that marked the boundary line and there they once more drew rein  belding remained by the corrals watching them evidently still in threatening mood presently a single rider left the troop and trotted his horse back down the road when he reached the corrals he was seen to halt and pass something to belding  then he galloped away to join his comrades  belding looked at whatever it was he held in his hand shook his burley head and started swiftly for the house  he came striding into the room holding a piece of soiled paper  cant read it and dont know as i want to he said savagely  beldin shore wed better read it replied ladd  what we want is a line on them greasers  whether theyre campos men or salazars or just a wanderin bunch of rebelsor rojass bandits sabe senor  not one of the men was able to translate the garbled scrawl  shore mercedes can read it said ladd  thorne opened a door and called her  she came into the room followed by nell and mrs belding  evidently all three divined a critical situation  my dear we want you to read whats written on this paper said thorne as he led her to the table  it was sent in by rebels andand we fear contains bad news for us  mercedes gave the writing one swift glance then fainted in thornes arms  he carried her to a couch and with nell and mrs belding began to work over her  belding looked at his rangers  it was characteristic of the man that now when catastrophe appeared inevitable all the gloom and care and angry agitation passed from him  laddy its rojas all right  how many men has he out there  mebbe twenty  not more  we can lick twice that many greasers  shore  jim lash removed his pipe long enough to speak  i reckon  but it aint sense to start a fight when mebbe we can avoid it  whats your idea  lets stave the greaser off till dark  then laddy an me an thorne will take mercedes an hit the trail for yuma  camino del diablo  that awful trail with a woman  jim do you forget how many hundreds of men have perished on the devils road  i reckon i aint forgettin nothin replied jim  the waterholes are full now  theres grass an we can do the job in six days  its three hundred miles to yuma  beldin jims idea hits me pretty reasonable interposed ladd lord knows thats about the only chance weve got except fightin  but suppose we do stave rojas off and you get safely away with mercedes  isnt rojas going to find it out quick  then whatll he try to do to us whore left here  i reckon hed find out by daylight replied jim  but tom he aint agoin to start a scrap then  hed want time an hosses an men to chase us out on the trail  you see im figgerin on the crazy greaser wantin the girl  i reckon hell try to clean up here to get her  but hes too smart to fight you for nothin rojas may be nutty about women but hes afraid of the u s take my word for it hed discover the trail in the mornin an light out on it  i reckon with ten hours start we could travel comfortable  belding paced up and down the room  jim and ladd whispered together gale walked to the window and looked out at the distant group of bandits and then turned his gaze to rest upon mercedes she was conscious now and her eyes seemed all the larger and blacker for the whiteness of her face  thorne held her hands and the other women were trying to still her tremblings  no one but gale saw the yaqui in the background looking down upon the spanish girl  all of yaquis looks were strange but this singularly so  gale marked it and felt he would never forget mercedess beauty had never before struck him as being so exquisite so alluring as now when she lay stricken  gale wondered if the indian was affected by her loveliness her helplessness or her terror  yaqui had seen mercedes only a few times and upon each of these he had appeared to be fascinated  could the strange indian because his hate for mexicans was so great be gloating over her misery  something about yaquia noble austerity of countenancemade gale feel his suspicion unjust  presently belding called his rangers to him and then thorne  listen to this he said earnestly  ill go out and have a talk with rojas  ill try to reason with him tell him to think a long time before he sheds blood on uncle sams soil  that hes now after an americans wife  ill not commit myself nor will i refuse outright to consider his demands nor will i show the least fear of him  ill play for time  if my bluff goes through well and good after dark the four of you laddy jim dick and thorne will take mercedes and my best white horses and with yaqui as guide circle round through altar valley to the trail and head for yuma wait now laddy  let me finish  i want you to take the white horses for two reasonsto save them and to save you savvy  if rojas should follow on my horses hed be likely to catch you  also you can pack a great deal more than on the bronchs  also the big horses can travel faster and farther on little grass and water  i want you to take the indian because in a case of this kind hell be a godsend  if you get headed or lost or have to circle off the trail think what it d mean to have yaqui with you  he knows sonora as no greaser knows it  he could hide you find water and grass when you would absolutely believe it impossible  the indian is loyal  he has his debt to pay and hell pay it dont mistake me  when youre gone ill hide nell so rojas wont see her if he searches the place  then i think i could sit down and wait without any particular worry  the rangers approved of beldings plan and thorne choked in his effort to express his gratitude  all right well chance it concluded belding  ill go out now and call rojas and his outfit over say it might be as well for me to know just what he said in that paper  thorne went to the side of his wife  mercedes weve planned to outwit rojas  will you tell us just what he wrote  the girl sat up her eyes dilating and with her hands clasping thornes  she said  rojas sworeby his saints and his virginthat if i wasnt givento himin twentyfour hourshe would set fire to the villagekill the mencarry off the womenhang the children on cactus thorns  a moments silence followed her last halting whisper  by his saints an his virgin echoed ladd  he laugheda cold cutting deadly laughsignificant and terrible  then the yaqui uttered a singular cry  gale had heard this once before and now he remembered it was at the papago well  look at the indian whispered belding hoarsely  damn if i dont believe he understood every word mercedes said  and gentlemen dont mistake me if he ever gets near senor rojas therell be some gory aztec knife work  yaqui had moved close to mercedes and stood beside her as she leaned against her husband  she seemed impelled to meet the indians gaze and evidently it was so powerful or hypnotic that it wrought irresistibly upon her  but she must have seen or divined what was beyond the others for she offered him her trembling hand  yaqui took it and laid it against his body in a strange motion and bowed his head  then he stepped back into the shadow of the room  belding went outdoors while the rangers took up their former position at the west window  each had his own somber thoughts gale imagined and knew his own were dark enough  a slow fire crept along his veins he saw belding halt at the corrals and wave his hand  then the rebels mounted and came briskly up the road this time to rein in abreast  wherever rojas had kept himself upon the former advance was not clear but he certainly was prominently in sight now  he made a gaudy almost a dashing figure  gale did not recognize the white sombrero the crimson scarf the velvet jacket nor any feature of the dandys costume but their general effect the whole ensemble recalled vividly to mind his first sight of the bandit  rojas dismounted and seemed to be listening  he betrayed none of the excitement gale had seen in him that night at the del sol evidently this composure struck ladd and lash as unusual in a mexican supposed to be laboring under stress of feeling  belding made gestures vehemently bobbed his big head appeared to talk with his body as much as with his tongue  then rojas was seen to reply and after that it was clear that the talk became painful and difficult  it ended finally in what appeared to be mutual understanding  rojas mounted and rode away with his men while belding came tramping back to the house  as he entered the door his eyes were shining his big hands were clenched and he was breathing audibly  you can rope me if im not locoed he burst out  i went out to conciliate a redhanded little murderer and damn me if i didnt meet aawell ive not suitable name handy  i started my bluff and got along pretty well but i forgot to mention that mercedes was thornes wife  and what do you think  rojas swore he loved mercedesswore hed marry her right here in forlorn riverswore he would give up robbing and killing people and take her away from mexico  he has goldjewels  he swore if he didnt get her nothing mattered  hed die anyway without her and heres the strange thing  i believe him  he was cold as ice and all hell inside  never saw a greaser like him  well i pretended to be greatly impressed  we got to talking friendly i suppose though i didnt understand half he said and i imagine he gathered less what i said  anyway without my asking he said for me to think it over for a day and then wed talk again  shore were born lucky ejaculated ladd  i reckon rojasll be smart enough to string his outfit across the few trails leadin out of forlorn river remarked jim  that neednt worry us  all we want is dark to come replied belding yaqui will slip through  if we thank any lucky stars let it be for the indian now boys put on your thinking caps youll take eight horses the pick of my bunch  you must pack all thats needed for a possible long trip  mind yaqui may lead you down into some wild sonora valley and give rojas the slip you may get to yuma in six days and maybe in six weeks  yet youve got to pack lighta small pack in saddleslarger ones on the two free horses  you may have a big fight laddy take the 405  dick will pack his remington  all of you go gunned heavy  but the main thing is a pack that ll be light enough for swift travel yet one that ll keep you from starving on the desert  the rest of that day passed swiftly  dick had scarcely a word with nell and all the time as he chose and deliberated and worked over his little pack there was a dull pain in his heart  the sun set twilight fell then night closed down fortunately a night slightly overcast  gale saw the white horses pass his door like silent ghosts  even blanco diablo made no sound and that fact was indeed a tribute to the yaqui  gale went out to put his saddle on blanco sol the horse rubbed a soft nose against his shoulder  then gale returned to the sittingroom there was nothing more to do but wait and say goodby  mercedes came clad in leather chaps and coat a slim stripling of a cowboy her dark eyes flashing  her beauty could not be hidden and now hope and courage had fired her blood  gale drew nell off into the shadow of the room  she was trembling and as she leaned toward him she was very different from the coy girl who had so long held him aloof  he took her into his arms  dearest im goingsoon and maybe ill never  dick dodont say it sobbed nell with her head on his breast  i might never come back he went on steadily  i love youive loved you ever since the first moment i saw you  do you care for mea little  dear dickdedear dick my heart is breaking faltered nell as she clung to him  it might be breaking for mercedesfor laddy and jim  i want to hear something for myself  something to have on long marchesround lonely campfires  something to keep my spirit alive  oh nell you cant imagine that silence out therethat terrible world of sand and stone do you love me  yes yes  oh i love you so  i never knew it till now  i love you so  dick ill be safe and ill waitand hope and pray for your return  if i come backnowhen i come back will you marry me  iioh yes she whispered and returned his kiss  belding was in the room speaking softly  nell darling i must go said dick  im a selfish little coward cried nell  its so splendid of you all  i ought to glory in it but i cant   fight if you must dick  fight for that lovely persecuted girl  ill love youthe more oh  goodby  goodby  with a wrench that shook him gale let her go  he heard beldings soft voice  yaqui says the early hours best  trust him laddy  remember what i sayyaquis a godsend  then they were all outside in the pale gloom under the trees yaqui mounted blanco diablo mercedes was lifted upon white woman thorne climbed astride queen jim lash was already upon his horse which was as white as the others but bore no name ladd mounted the stallion blanco torres and gathered up the long halters of the two pack horses gale came last with blanco sol  as he toed the stirrup hand on mane and pommel gale took one more look in at the door  nell stood in the gleam of light her hair shining face like ashes her eyes dark her lips parted her arms outstretched  that sweet and tragic picture etched its cruel outlines into gales heart  he waved his hand and then fiercely leaped into the saddle  blanco sol stepped out  before gale stretched a line of moving horses white against dark shadows  he could not see the head of that column he scarcely heard a soft hoofbeat  a single star shone out of a rift in thin clouds there was no wind  the air was cold  the dark space of desert seemed to yawn  to the left across the river flickered a few campfires  the chill night silent and mystical seemed to close in upon gale and he faced the wide quivering black level with keen eyes and grim intent and an awakening of that wild rapture which came like a spell to him in the open desert    xi  across cactus and lava  blanco sol showed no inclination to bend his head to the alfalfa which swished softly about his legs  gale felt the horses sensitive almost human alertness  sol knew as well as his master the nature of that flight  at the far corner of the field yaqui halted and slowly the line of white horses merged into a compact mass  there was a trail here leading down to the river  the campfires were so close that the bright blazes could be seen in movement and dark forms crossed in front of them  yaqui slipped out of his saddle  he ran his hand over diablos nose and spoke low and repeated this action for each of the other horses  gale had long ceased to question the strange indians behavior  there was no explaining or understanding many of his manoeuvers  but the results of them were always thoughtprovoking gale had never seen horse stand so silently as in this instance no stampno champ of bitno toss of headno shake of saddle or packno heave or snort  it seemed they had become imbued with the spirit of the indian  yaqui moved away into the shadows as noiselessly as if he were one of them  the darkness swallowed him  he had taken a parallel with the trail  gale wondered if yaqui meant to try to lead his string of horses by the rebel sentinels  ladd had his head bent low his ear toward the trail  jims long neck had the arch of a listening deer gale listened too and as the slow silent moments went by his faculty of hearing grew more acute from strain  he heard blanco sol breathe he heard the pound of his own heart he heard the silken rustle of the alfalfa he heard a faint faroff sound of voice like a lost echo then his ear seemed to register a movement of air a disturbance so soft as to be nameless  then followed long silent moments  yaqui appeared as he had vanished  he might have been part of the shadows  but he was there  he started off down the trail leading diablo  again the white line stretched slowly out  gale fell in behind  a bench of ground covered with sparse greasewood sloped gently down to the deep wide arroyo of forlorn river blanco sol shied a few feet out of the trail  peering low with keen eyes gale made out three objectsa white sombrero a blanket and a mexican lying face down  the yaqui had stolen upon this sentinel like a silent wind of death  just then a desert coyote wailed and the wild cry fitted the darkness and the yaquis deed  once under the dark lee of the river bank yaqui caused another halt and he disappeared as before  it seemed to gale that the indian started to cross the pale level sandbed of the river where stones stood out gray and the darker line of opposite shore was visible  but he vanished and it was impossible to tell whether he went one way or another  moments passed  the horses held heads up looked toward the glimmering campfires and listened gale thrilled with the meaning of it allthe nightthe silencethe flightand the wonderful indian stealing with the slow inevitableness of doom upon another sentinel an hour passed and gale seemed to have become deadened to all sense of hearing there were no more sounds in the world  the desert was as silent as it was black  yet again came that strange change in the tensity of gales earstrain a check a break a vibrationand this time the sound did not go nameless  it might have been moan of wind or wail of fardistant wolf but gale imagined it was the strangling deathcry of another guard or that strange involuntary utterance of the yaqui  blanco sol trembled in all his great frame and then gale was certain the sound was not imagination  that certainty once for all fixed in gales mind the mood of his flight  the yaqui dominated the horses and the rangers thorne and mercedes were as persons under a spell  the indians strange silence the feeling of mystery and power he seemed to create all that was incomprehensible about him were emphasized in the light of his slow sure and ruthless action  if he dominated the others surely he did more for galecolored his thoughtspresage the wild and terrible future of that flight  if rojas embodied all the hatred and passion of the peonscourged slave for a thousand yearsthen yaqui embodied all the darkness the cruelty the white sunheated blood the ferocity the tragedy of the desert  suddenly the indian stalked out of the gloom  he mounted diablo and headed across the river  once more the line of moving white shadows stretched out  the soft sand gave forth no sound at all the glimmering campfires sank behind the western bank  yaqui led the way into the willows and there was faint swishing of leaves then into the mesquite and there was faint rustling of branches  the glimmering lights appeared again and grotesque forms of saguaros loomed darkly gale peered sharply along the trail and presently on the pale sand under a cactus there lay a blanketed form prone outstretched a carbine clutched in one hand a cigarette still burning in the other  the cavalcade of white horses passed within five hundred yards of campfires around which dark forms moved in plain sight  soft pads in sand faint metallic tickings of steel on thorns low regular breathing of horsesthese were all the sounds the fugitives made and they could not have been heard at onefifth the distance the lights disappeared from time to time grew dimmer more flickering and at last they vanished altogether  beldings fleet and tireless steeds were out in front the desert opened ahead wide dark vast  rojas and his rebels were behind eating drinking careless the somber shadow lifted from gales  heart  he held now an unquenchable faith in the yaqui  belding would be listening back there along the river he would know of the escape  he would tell nell and then hide her safely as gale accepted a strange and fatalistic foreshadowing of toil blood and agony in this desert journey so he believed in mercedess ultimate freedom and happiness and his own return to the girl who had grown dearer than life   a cold gray dawn was fleeing before a rosy sun when yaqui halted the march at papago well  the horses were taken to water then led down the arroyo into the grass  here packs were slipped saddles removed mercedes was cold lame tired but happy  it warmed gales blood to look at her  the shadow of fear still lay in her eyes but it was passing  hope and courage shone there and affection for her ranger protectors and the yaqui and unutterable love for the cavalryman  jim lash remarked how cleverly they had fooled the rebels  shore theyll be comin along replied ladd  they built a fire cooked and ate  the yaqui spoke only one word sleep  blankets were spread  mercedes dropped into a deep slumber her head on thornes shoulder  excitement kept thorne awake  the two rangers dozed beside the fire  gale shared the yaquis watch  the sun began to climb and the icy edge of dawn to wear away  rabbits bobbed their cotton tails under the mesquite  gale climbed a rocky wall above the arroyo bank and there with command over the miles of the backtrail he watched  it was a sweeping rolling wrinkled and streaked range of desert that he saw ruddy in the morning sunlight with patches of cactus and mesquite roughetched in shimmering gloom  no name mountains split the eastern sky towering high gloomy grand with purple veils upon their slopes  they were forty miles away and looked five gale thought of the girl who was there under their shadow  yaqui kept the horses bunched and he led them from one little park of galleta grass to another  at the end of three hours he took them to water  upon his return gale clambered down from his outlook the rangers grew active  mercedes was awakened and soon the party faced westward their long shadows moving before them yaqui led with blanco diablo in a long easy lope  the arroyo washed itself out into flat desert and the greens began to shade into gray and then the gray into red  only sparse cactus and weathered ledges dotted the great low roll of a rising escarpment yaqui suited the gait of his horse to the lay of the land and his followers accepted his pace  there were canter and trot and swift walk and slow climb and long swingmiles up and down and forward  the sun soared hot  the heated air lifted and incoming currents from the west swept low and hard over the barren earth  in the distance all around the horizon accumulations of dust seemed like ranging mushrooming yellow clouds  yaqui was the only one of the fugitives who never looked back mercedes did it the most  gale felt what compelled her he could not resist it himself  but it was a vain search  for a thousand puffs of white and yellow dust rose from that backward sweep of desert and any one of them might have been blown from under horses hoofs  gale had a conviction that when yaqui gazed back toward the well and the shining plain beyond there would be reason for it  but when the sun lost its heat and the wind died down yaqui took long and careful surveys westward from the high points on the trail  sunset was not far off and there in a bare spotted valley lay coyote tanks the only waterhole between papago well and the sonoyta oasis  gale used his glass told yaqui there was no smoke no sign of life still the indian fixed his falcon eyes on distant spots looked long  it was as if his vision could not detect what reason or cunning or intuition perhaps an instinct told him was there  presently in a sheltered spot where blown sand had not obliterated the trail yaqui found the tracks of horses  the curve of the iron shoes pointed westward an intersecting trail from the north came in here  gale thought the tracks either one or two days old  ladd said they were one day the indian shook his head  no farther advance was undertaken  the yaqui headed south and traveled slowly climbing to the brow of a bold height of weathered mesa  there he sat his horse and waited  no one questioned him the rangers dismounted to stretch their legs and mercedes was lifted to a rock where she rested  thorne had gradually yielded to the deserts influence for silence  he spoke once or twice to gale and occasionally whispered to mercedes  gale fancied his friend would soon learn that necessary speech in desert travel meant a few greetings a few words to make real the fact of human companionship a few short terse terms for the business of day or night and perhaps a stern order or a soft call to a horse  the sun went down and the golden rosy veils turned to blue and shaded darker till twilight was there in the valley  only the spurs of mountains spiring the near and far horizon retained their clear outline  darkness approached and the clear peaks faded  the horses stamped to be on the move  malo exclaimed the yaqui  he did not point with arm but his falcon head was outstretched and his piercing eyes gazed at the blurring spot which marked the location of coyote tanks  jim can you see anything asked ladd  nope but i reckon he can  darkness increased momentarily till night shaded the deepest part of the valley  then ladd suddenly straightened up turned to his horse and muttered low under his breath  i reckon so said lash and for once his easy goodnatured tone was not in evidence  his voice was harsh  gales eyes keen as they were were last of the rangers to see tiny needlepoints of light just faintly perceptible in the blackness  laddy  campfires he asked quickly  shores youre born my boy  how many  ladd did not reply but yaqui held up his hand his fingers wide five campfires  a strong force of rebels or raiders or some other desert troop was camping at coyote tanks  yaqui sat his horse for a moment motionless as stone his dark face immutable and impassive  then he stretched wide his right arm in the direction of no name mountains now losing their last faint traces of the afterglow and he shook his head  he made the same impressive gesture toward the sonoyta oasis with the same somber negation  thereupon he turned diablos head to the south and started down the slope  his manner had been decisive even stern  lash did not question it nor did ladd  both rangers hesitated however and showed a strange almost sullen reluctance which gale had never seen in them before  raiders were one thing rojas was another camino del diablo still another but that vast and desolate and unwatered waste of cactus and lava the sonora desert might appall the stoutest heart  gale felt his own sinkfelt himself flinch  oh where is he going cried mercedes  her poignant voice seemed to break a spell  shore lady yaquis goin home replied ladd gently  an considerin our troubles i reckon we ought to thank god he knows the way  they mounted and rode down the slope toward the darkening south  not until night travel was obstructed by a wall of cactus did the indian halt to make a dry camp  water and grass for the horses and fire to cook by were not to be had  mercedes bore up surprisingly but she fell asleep almost the instant her thirst had been allayed  thorne laid her upon a blanket and covered her the men ate and drank  diablo was the only horse that showed impatience but he was angry and not in distress  blanco sol licked gales hand and stood patiently  many a time had he taken his rest at night without a drink  yaqui again bade the men sleep ladd said he would take the early watch but from the way the indian shook his head and settled himself against a stone it appeared if ladd remained awake he would have company  gale lay down weary of limb and eye  he heard the soft thump of hoofs the sough of wind in the cactusthen no more  when he awoke there was bustle and stir about him  day had not yet dawned and the air was freezing cold  yaqui had found a scant bundle of greasewood which served to warm them and to cook breakfast mercedes was not aroused till the last moment  day dawned with the fugitives in the saddle  a picketed wall of cactus hedged them in yet the yaqui made a tortuous path that zigzag as it might in the main always headed south  it was wonderful how he slipped diablo through the narrow aisles of thorns saving the horse and saving himself  the others were torn and clutched and held and stung  the way was a flat sandy pass between low mountain ranges there were open spots and aisles and squares of sand and hedging rows of prickly pear and the huge spiderlegged ocatillo and hummocky masses of clustered bisnagi  the day grew dry and hot  a fragrant wind blew through the pass  cactus flowers bloomed red and yellow and magenta the sweet pale ajo lily gleamed in shady corners  ten miles of travel covered the length of the pass  it opened wide upon a wonderful scene an arboreal desert dominated by its pure light green yet lined by many merging colors  and it rose slowly to a low dim and darkred zone of lava spurred peaked domed by volcano cones a wild and ragged region illimitable as the horizon  the yaqui if not at fault was yet uncertain  his falcon eyes searched and roved and became fixed at length at the southwest and toward this he turned his horse  the great fluted saguaros fifty sixty feet high raised columnal forms and their branching limbs and curving lines added a grace to the desert  it was the lowbushed cactus that made the toil and pain of travel  yet these thorny forms were beautiful  in the basins between the ridges to right and left along the floor of low plains the mirage glistened wavered faded vanishedlakes and trees and clouds  inverted mountains hung suspended in the lilac air and faint tracery of whitewalled cities  at noon yaqui halted the cavalcade  he had selected a field of bisnagi cactus for the place of rest  presently his reason became obvious with long heavy knife he cut off the tops of these barrelshaped plants  he scooped out soft pulp and with stone and hand then began to pound the deeper pulp into a juicy mass  when he threw this out there was a little water left sweet cool water which man and horse shared eagerly  thus he made even the deserts fiercest growths minister to their needs  but he did not halt long  miles of graygreen spiked walls lay between him and that line of ragged red lava which manifestly he must reach before dark  the travel became faster straighter and the glistening thorns clutched and clung to leather and cloth and flesh  the horses reared snorted balked leapedbut they were sent on  only blanco sol the patient the plodding the indomitable needed no goad or spur  waves and scarfs and wreaths of heat smoked up from the sand mercedes reeled in her saddle  thorne bade her drink bathed her face supported her and then gave way to ladd who took the girl with him on torres broad back  yaquis unflagging purpose and iron arm were bitter and hateful to the proud and haughty spirit of blanco diablo for once beldings great white devil had met his master  he fought rider bit bridle cactus sandand yet he went on and on zigzagging turning winding crashing through the barbed growths the middle of the afternoon saw thorne reeling in his saddle and then wherever possible gales powerful arm lent him strength to hold his seat  the giant cactus came to be only so in name  these saguaros were thinning out growing stunted and most of them were single columns gradually other cactus forms showed a harder struggle for existence and the spaces of sand between were wider  but now the dreaded glistening choya began to show pale and gray and white upon the rising slope  roundtopped hills sunsetcolored above blueblack below intervened to hide the distant spurs and peaks  mile and mile long tongues of red lava streamed out between the hills and wound down to stop abruptly upon the slope  the fugitives were entering a desolate burnedout world  it rose above them in limitless gradual ascent and spread wide to east and west  then the waste of sand began to yield to cinders  the horses sank to their fetlocks as they toiled on  a fine choking dust blew back from the leaders and men coughed and horses snorted  the huge round hills rose smooth symmetrical colored as if the setting sun was shining on bare blueblack surfaces but the sun was now behind the hills  in between ran the streams of lava  the horsemen skirted the edge between slope of hill and perpendicular ragged wall  this red lava seemed to have flowed and hardened there only yesterday  it was broken sharp dull rust color full of cracks and caves and crevices and everywhere upon its jagged surface grew the whitethorned choya  again twilight encompassed the travelers  but there was still light enough for gale to see the constricted passage open into a wide deep space where the dull color was relieved by the gray of gnarled and dwarfed mesquite  blanco sol keenest of scent whistled his welcome herald of water  the other horses answered quickened their gait gale smelled it too sweet cool damp on the dry air  yaqui turned the corner of a pocket in the lava wall  the file of white horses rounded the corner after him  and gale coming last saw the pale glancing gleam of a pool of water beautiful in the twilight   next day the yaquis relentless driving demand on the horses was no longer in evidence  he lost no time but he did not hasten  his course wound between low cinder dunes which limited their view of the surrounding country  these dunes finally sank down to a black floor as hard as flint with tongues of lava to the left and to the right the slow descent into the cactus plain  yaqui was now traveling due west it was gales idea that the indian was skirting the first sharptoothed slope of a vast volcanic plateau which formed the western half of the sonora desert and extended to the gulf of california  travel was slow but not exhausting for rider or beast  a little sand and meager grass gave a grayish tinge to the strip of black ground between lava and plain  that day as the manner rather than the purpose of the yaqui changed so there seemed to be subtle differences in the others of the party gale himself lost a certain sickening dread which had not been for himself but for mercedes and nell and thorne and the rangers  jim goodnatured again might have been patrolling the boundary line  ladd lost his taciturnity and his gloom changed to a cool careless air  a mood that was almost defiance began to be manifested in thorne  it was in mercedes however that gale marked the most significant change her collapse the preceding day might never have been  she was lame and sore she rode her saddle sidewise and often she had to be rested and helped but she had found a reserve fund of strength and her mental condition was not the same that it had been  her burden of fear had been lifted gale saw in her the difference he always felt in himself after a few days in the desert  already mercedes and he and all of them had begun to respond to the desert spirit moreover yaquis strange influence must have been a call to the primitive  thirty miles of easy stages brought the fugitives to another waterhole a little round pocket under the heavedup edge of lava there was spare short bleached grass for the horses but no wood for a fire this night there was question and reply conjecture doubt opinion and conviction expressed by the men of the party but the indian who alone could have told where they were where they were going what chance they had to escape maintained his stoical silence  gale took the early watch ladd the midnight one and lash that of the morning  the day broke rosy glorious cold as ice  action was necessary to make useful benumbed hands and feet  mercedes was fed while yet wrapped in blankets  then while the packs were being put on and horses saddled she walked up and down slapping her hands warming her ears  the rose color of the dawn was in her cheeks and the wonderful clearness of desert light in her eyes  thornes eyes sought her constantly  the rangers watched her  the yaqui bent his glance upon her only seldom but when he did look it seemed that his strange fixed and inscrutable face was about to break into a smile  yet that never happened  gale himself was surprised to find how often his own glance found the slender dark beautiful spaniard  was this because of her beauty he wondered  he thought not altogether  mercedes was a woman  she represented something in life that men of all races for thousands of years had loved to see and own to revere and debase to fight and die for  it was a significant index to the days travel that yaqui should keep a blanket from the pack and tear it into strips to bind the legs of the horses  it meant the dreaded choya and the knifeedged lava  that yaqui did not mount diablo was still more significant mercedes must ride but the others must walk  the indian led off into one of the gray notches between the tumbled streams of lava  these streams were about thirty feet high a rotting mass of splintered lava rougher than any other kind of roughness in the world  at the apex of the notch where two streams met a narrow gully wound and ascended  gale caught sight of the dim pale shadow of a onetime trail  near at hand it was invisible he had to look far ahead to catch the faint tracery yaqui led diablo into it and then began the most laborious and vexatious and painful of all slow travel  once up on top of that lava bed gale saw stretching away breaking into millions of crests and ruts a vast redblack field sweeping onward and upward with ragged low ridges and mounds and spurs leading higher and higher to a great split escarpment wall above which dim peaks shone hazily blue in the distance  he looked no more in that direction  to keep his foothold to save his horse cost him all energy and attention  the course was marked out for him in the tracks of the other horses  he had only to follow  but nothing could have been more difficult  the disintegrating surface of a lava bed was at once the roughest the hardest the meanest the cruelest the most deceitful kind of ground to travel  it was rotten yet it had corners as hard and sharp as pikes it was rough yet as slippery as ice  if there was a foot of level surface that space would be one to break through under a horses hoofs  it was seamed lined cracked ridged knotted iron  this lava bed resembled a tremendously magnified clinker  it had been a running sea of molten flint boiling bubbling spouting and it had burst its surface into a million sharp facets as it hardened  the color was dull dark angry red like no other red inflaming to the eye  the millions of minute crevices were dominated by deep fissures and holes ragged and rough beyond all comparison  the fugitives made slow progress  they picked a cautious winding way to and fro in little steps here and there along the many twists of the trail up and down the unavoidable depressions round and round the holes  at noon so winding back upon itself had been their course they appeared to have come only a short distance up the lava slope  it was rough work for them it was terrible work for the horses blanco diablo refused to answer to the power of the yaqui  he balked he plunged he bit and kicked  he had to be pulled and beaten over many places  mercedess horse almost threw her and she was put upon blanco sol  the white charger snorted a protest then obedient to gales stern call patiently lowered his noble head and pawed the lava for a footing that would hold  the lava caused gale toil and worry and pain but he hated the choyas as the travel progressed this species of cactus increased in number of plants and in size  everywhere the red lava was spotted with little round patches of glistening frosty white  and under every bunch of choya along and in the trail were the discarded joints like little frosty pine cones covered with spines it was utterly impossible always to be on the lookout for these and when gale stepped on one often as not the steellike thorns pierced leather and flesh  gale came almost to believe what he had heard claimed by desert travelersthat the choya was alive and leaped at man or beast  certain it was when gale passed one if he did not put all attention to avoiding it he was hooked through his chaps and held by barbed thorns  the pain was almost unendurable  it was like no other  it burned stung beatalmost seemed to freeze  it made useless arm or leg it made him bite his tongue to keep from crying out it made the sweat roll off him  it made him sick  moreover bad as the choya was for man it was infinitely worse for beast  a jagged stab from this poisoned cactus was the only thing blanco sol could not stand  many times that day before he carried mercedes he had wildly snorted and then stood trembling while gale picked broken thorns from the muscular legs  but after mercedes had been put upon sol gale made sure no choya touched him  the afternoon passed like the morning in ceaseless winding and twisting and climbing along this abandoned trail  gale saw many waterholes mostly dry some containing water all of them catchbasins full only after rainy season  little ugly bunched bushes that gale scarcely recognized as mesquites grew near these holes also stunted greasewood and prickly pear  there was no grass and the choya alone flourished in that hard soil  darkness overtook the party as they unpacked beside a pool of water deep under an overhanging shelf of lava  it had been a hard day the horses drank their fill and then stood patiently with drooping heads hunger and thirst appeased and a warm fire cheered the weary and footsore fugitives  yaqui said sleep  and so another night passed   upon the following morning ten miles or more up the slowascending lava slope gales attention was called from his somber search for the less rough places in the trail  dick why does yaqui look back asked mercedes  gale was startled  does he  every little while replied mercedes  gale was in the rear of all the other horses so as to take for mercedess sake the advantage of the broken trail  yaqui was leading diablo winding around a break  his head was bent as he stepped slowly and unevenly upon the lava  gale turned to look back the first time in several days  the mighty hollow of the desert below seemed wide strip of redwide strip of greenwide strip of graystreaking to purple peaks  it was all too vast too mighty to grasp any little details  he thought of course of rojas in certain pursuit but it seemed absurded to look for him  yaqui led on and gale often glanced up from his task to watch the indian  presently he saw him stop turn and look back  ladd did likewise and then jim and thorne  gale found the desire irresistible thereafter he often rested blanco sol and looked back the while  he had his fieldglass but did not choose to use it  rojas will follow said mercedes  gale regarded her in amaze  the tone of her voice had been indefinable  if there were fear then he failed to detect it  she was gazing back down the colored slope and something about her perhaps the steady falcon gaze of her magnificent eyes reminded him of yaqui  many times during the ensuing hour the indian faced about and always his followers did likewise  it was high noon with the sun beating hot and the lava radiating heat when yaqui halted for a rest  the place selected was a ridge of lava almost a promontory considering its outlook  the horses bunched here and drooped their heads  the rangers were about to slip the packs and remove saddles when yaqui restrained them  he fixed a changeless gleaming gaze on the slow descent but did not seem to look afar  suddenly he uttered his strange crythe one gale considered involuntary or else significant of some tribal trait or feeling it was incomprehensible but no one could have doubted its potency  yaqui pointed down the lava slope pointed with finger and arm and neck and headhis whole body was instinct with direction  his whole being seemed to have been animated and then frozen  his posture could not have been misunderstood yet his expression had not altered  gale had never seen the indians face change its hard redbronze calm  it was the color and the flintiness and the character of the lava at his feet  shore he sees somethin said ladd  but my eyes are not good  i reckon i aint sure of mine replied jim  im bothered by a dim movin streak down there  thorne gazed eagerly down as he stood beside mercedes who sat motionless facing the slope  gale looked and looked till he hurt his eyes  then he took his glass out of its case on sols saddle  there appeared to be nothing upon the lava but the innumerable dots of choya shining in the sun  gale swept his glass slowly forward and back  then into a nearer field of vision crept a long whiteandblack line of horses and men  without a word he handed the glass to ladd the ranger used it muttering to himself  theyre on the lava fifteen miles down in an air line he said presently  jim shore theyre twice that an more accordin to the trail  jim had his look and replied  i reckon were a day an a night in the lead  is it rojas burst out thorne with set jaw  yes thorne  its rojas and a dozen men or more replied gale and he looked up at mercedes  she was transformed  she might have been a medieval princess embodying all the spanish power and passion of that time breathing revenge hate unquenchable spirit of fire  if her beauty had been wonderful in her helpless and appealing moments now when she looked back whitefaced and flameeyed it was transcendant  gale drew a long deep breath  the mood which had presaged pursuit strife blood on this somber desert returned to him tenfold  he saw thornes face corded by black veins and his teeth exposed like those of a snarling wolf  these rangers who had coolly risked death many times and had dealt it often were white as no fear or pain could have made them  then on the moment yaqui raised his hand not clenched or doubled tight but curled rigid like an eagles claw and he shook it in a strange slow gesture which was menacing and terrible  it was the woman that called to the depths of these men  and their passion to kill and to save was surpassed only by the wild hate which was yet love the unfathomable emotion of a peon slave  gale marveled at it while he felt his whole being cold and tense as he turned once more to follow in the tracks of his leaders  the fight predicted by belding was at hand  what a fight that must be  rojas was traveling light and fast  he was gaining he had bought his men with gold with extravagant promises perhaps with offers of the body and blood of an aristocrat hateful to their kind  lastly there was the wild desolate environment a tortured wilderness of jagged lava and poisoned choya a lonely fierce and repellant world a red stage most somberly and fittingly colored for a supreme struggle between men  yaqui looked back no more  mercedes looked back no more  but the others looked and the time came when gale saw the creeping line of pursuers with naked eyes  a level line above marked the rim of the plateau  sand began to show in the little lava pits  on and upward toiled the cavalcade still very slowly advancing  at last yaqui reached the rim  he stood with his hand on blanco diablo and both were silhouetted against the sky that was the outlook for a yaqui  and his great horse dazzlingly white in the sunlight with head wildly and proudly erect mane and tail flying in the wind made a magnificent picture  the others toiled on and upward and at last gale led blanco sol over the rim  then all looked down the red slope  but shadows were gathering there and no moving line could be seen  yaqui mounted and wheeled diablo away  the others followed gale saw that the plateau was no more than a vast field of low ragged circles levels mounds cones and whirls of lava  the lava was of a darker red than that down upon the slope and it was harder than flint  in places fine sand and cinders covered the uneven floor  strange varieties of cactus vied with the omnipresent choya yaqui however found ground that his horse covered at a swift walk  but there was only an hour perhaps of this comparatively easy going then the yaqui led them into a zone of craters  the top of the earth seemed to have been blown out in holes from a few rods in width to large craters some shallow others deep and all red as fire  yaqui circled close to abysses which yawned sheer from a level surface and he appeared always to be turning upon his course to avoid them  the plateau had now a considerable dip to the west  gale marked the slow heave and ripple of the ocean of lava to the south where high rounded peaks marked the center of this volcanic region  the uneven nature of the slope westward prevented any extended view until suddenly the fugitives emerged from a rugged break to come upon a sublime and aweinspiring spectacle  they were upon a high point of the western slope of the plateau it was a slope but so many leagues long in its descent that only from a height could any slant have been perceptible  yaqui and his white horse stood upon the brink of a crater miles in circumference a thousand feet deep with its red walls patched in frostcolored spots by the silvery choya  the giant tracery of lava streams waved down the slope to disappear in undulating sand dunes and these bordered a seemingly endless arm of blue sea  this was the gulf of california beyond the gulf rose dim bold mountains and above them hung the setting sun dusky red flooding all that barren empire with a sinister light  it was strange to gale then and perhaps to the others to see their guide lead diablo into a smooth and wellworn trail along the rim of the awful crater  gale looked down into that red chasm it resembled an inferno  the dark cliffs upon the opposite side were veiled in blue haze that seemed like smoke  here yaqui was at home  he moved and looked about him as a man coming at last into his own  gale saw him stop and gaze out over that redribbed void to the gulf  gale devined that somewhere along this crater of hell the yaqui would make his final stand and one look into his strange inscrutable eyes made imagination picture a fitting doom for the pursuing rojas    xii  the crater of hell  the trail led along a gigantic fissure in the side of the crater and then down and down into a redwalled blue hazed labyrinth  presently gale upon turning a sharp corner was utterly amazed to see that the split in the lava sloped out and widened into an arroyo  it was so green and soft and beautiful in all the angry contorted red surrounding that gale could scarcely credit his sight blanco sol whistled his welcome to the scent of water  then gale saw a great hole a pit in the shiny lava a dark cool shady well there was evidence of the fact that at flood seasons the water had an outlet into the arroyo  the soil appeared to be a fine sand in which a reddish tinge predominated and it was abundantly covered with a long grass still partly green  mesquites and palo verdes dotted the arroyo and gradually closed in thickets that obstructed the view  shore it all beats me exclaimed ladd  what a place to holeup in we could have hid here for a long time  boys i saw mountain sheep the real old genuine rocky mountain bighorn  what do you think of that  i reckon its a yaqui huntingground replied lash  that trail we hit must be hundreds of years old  its worn deep and smooth in iron lava  well all i got to say isbeldin was shore right about the indian an i can see rojass finish somewhere up along that awful hellhole  camp was made on a level spot  yaqui took the horses to water and then turned them loose in the arroyo  it was a tired and somber group that sat down to eat  the strain of suspense equaled the wearing effects of the long ride  mercedes was calm but her great dark eyes burned in her white face  yaqui watched her  the others looked at her with unspoken pride  presently thorne wrapped her in his blankets and she seemed to fall asleep at once  twilight deepened  the campfire blazed brighter  a cool wind played with mercedess black hair waving strands across her brow  little of yaquis purpose or plan could be elicited from him  but the look of him was enough to satisfy even thorne  he leaned against a pile of wood which he had collected and his gloomy gaze pierced the campfire and at long intervals strayed over the motionless form of the spanish girl  the rangers and thorne however talked in low tones  it was absolutely impossible for rojas and his men to reach the waterhole before noon of the next day  and long before that time the fugitives would have decided on a plan of defense  what that defense would be and where it would be made were matters over which the men considered gravely  ladd averred the yaqui would put them into an impregnable position that at the same time would prove a deathtrap for their pursuers  they exhausted every possibility and then tired as they were still kept on talking  what stuns me is that rojas stuck to our trail said thorne his lined and haggard face expressive of dark passion  he has followed us into this fearful desert  hell lose men horses perhaps his life hes only a bandit and he stands to win no gold  if he ever gets out of here it ll be by herculean labor and by terrible hardship  all for a poor little helpless womanjust a woman my god i cant understand it  shorejust a woman replied ladd solemnly nodding his head  then there was a long silence during which the men gazed into the fire each perhaps had some vague conception of the enormity of rojass love or hatesome faint and amazing glimpse of the gulf of human passion  those were cold hard grim faces upon which the light flickered  sleep said the yaqui  thorne rolled in his blanket close beside mercedes  then one by one the rangers stretched out feet to the fire  gale found that he could not sleep  his eyes were weary but they would not stay shut his body ached for rest yet he could not lie still  the night was so somber so gloomy and the lavaencompassed arroyo full of shadows  the dark velvet sky fretted with white fire seemed to be close  there was an absolute silence as of death  nothing movednothing outside of gales body appeared to live  the yaqui sat like an image carved out of lava  the others lay prone and quiet  would another night see any of them lie that way quiet forever  gale felt a ripple pass over him that was at once a shudder and a contraction of muscles  used as he was to the desert and its oppression why should he feel tonight as if the weight of its lava and the burden of its mystery were bearing him down  he sat up after a while and again watched the fire  nells sweet face floated like a wraith in the pale smokeglowed and flushed and smiled in the embers  other faces shone therehis sistersthat of his mother  gale shook off the tender memories  this desolate wilderness with its forbidding silence and its dark promise of hell on the morrowthis was not the place to unnerve oneself with thoughts of love and home  but the torturing paradox of the thing was that this was just the place and just the night for a man to be haunted  by and by gale rose and walked down a shadowy aisle between the mesquites  on his way back the yaqui joined him gale was not surprised  he had become used to the indians strange guardianship but now perhaps because of gales poignancy of thought the contending tides of love and regret the deep burning premonition of deadly strife he was moved to keener scrutiny of the yaqui  that of course was futile  the indian was impenetrable silent strange  but suddenly inexplicably gale felt yaquis human quality  it was aloof as was everything about this indian but it was there  this savage walked silently beside him without glance or touch or word  his thought was as inscrutable as if mind had never awakened in his race yet gale was conscious of greatness and somehow he was reminded of the indians story  his home had been desolated his people carried off to slavery his wife and children separated from him to die  what had life meant to the yaqui  what had been in his heart  what was now in his mind  gale could not answer these questions  but the difference between himself and yaqui which he had vaguely felt as that between savage and civilized men faded out of his mind forever  yaqui might have considered he owed gale a debt and with a yaquis austere and noble fidelity to honor he meant to pay it  nevertheless this was not the thing gale found in the indians silent presence accepting the desert with its subtle and inconceivable influence gale felt that the savage and the white man had been bound in a tie which was no less brotherly because it could not be comprehended  toward dawn gale managed to get some sleep  then the morning broke with the sun hidden back of the uplift of the plateau  the horses trooped up the arroyo and snorted for water  after a hurried breakfast the packs were hidden in holes in the lava  the saddles were left where they were and the horses allowed to graze and wander at will canteens were filled a small bag of food was packed and blankets made into a bundle  then yaqui faced the steep ascent of the lava slope  the trail he followed led up on the right side of the fissure opposite to the one he had come down  it was a steep climb and encumbered as the men were they made but slow progress  mercedes had to be lifted up smooth steps and across crevices  they passed places where the rims of the fissure were but a few yards apart at length the rims widened out and the red smoky crater yawned beneath  yaqui left the trail and began clambering down over the rough and twisted convolutions of lava which formed the rim sometimes he hung sheer over the precipice  it was with extreme difficulty that the party followed him  mercedes had to be held on narrow footwide ledges  the choya was there to hinder passage finally the indian halted upon a narrow bench of flat smooth lava and his followers worked with exceeding care and effort down to his position  at the back of this bench between bunches of choya was a niche a shallow cave with floor lined apparently with mold  ladd said the place was a refuge which had been inhabited by mountain sheep for many years  yaqui spread blankets inside left the canteen and the sack of food and with a gesture at once humble yet that of a chief he invited mercedes to enter  a few more gestures and fewer words disclosed his plan  in this inaccessible nook mercedes was to be hidden  the men were to go around upon the opposite rim and block the trail leading down to the waterhole  gale marked the nature of this eyrie  it was the wildest and most rugged place he had ever stepped upon  only a sheep could have climbed up the wall above or along the slanting shelf of lava beyond  below glistened a whole bank of choya frosty in the sunlight and it overhung an apparently bottomless abyss  ladd chose the smallest gun in the party and gave it to mercedes  shore its best to go the limit on bein ready he said simply the chances are youll never need it  but if you do  he left off there and his break was significant  mercedes answered him with a fearless and indomitable flash of eyes  thorne was the only one who showed any shaken nerve  his leavetaking of his wife was affecting and hurried  then he and the rangers carefully stepped in the tracks of the yaqui  they climbed up to the level of the rim and went along the edge when they reached the fissure and came upon its narrowest point yaqui showed in his actions that he meant to leap it  ladd restrained the indian  they then continued along the rim till they reached several bridges of lava which crossed it  the fissures was deep in some parts choked in others  evidently the crater had no direct outlet into the arroyo below  its bottom however must have been far beneath the level of the waterhole  after the fissure was crossed the trail was soon found  here it ran back from the rim  yaqui waved his hand to the right where along the corrugated slope of the crater there were holes and crevices and coverts for a hundred men  yaqui strode on up the trail toward a higher point where presently his dark figure stood motionless against the sky  the rangers and thorne selected a deep depression out of which led several ruts deep enough for cover  according to ladd it was as good a place as any perhaps not so hidden as others but freer from the dreaded choya  here the men laid down rifles and guns and removing their heavy cartridge belts settled down to wait  their location was close to the rim wall and probably five hundred yards from the opposite rim which was now seen to be considerably below them  the glaring red cliff presented a deceitful and baffling appearance  it had a thousand ledges and holes in its surfaces and one moment it looked perpendicular and the next there seemed to be a long slant  thorne pointed out where he thought mercedes was hidden ladd selected another place and lash still another  gale searched for the bank of choya he had seen under the bench where mercedess retreat lay and when he found it the others disputed his opinion then gale brought his field glass into requisition proving that he  was right once located and fixed in sight the white patch of choya the bench and the sheep eyrie stood out from the other features of that rugged wall  but all the men were agreed that yaqui had hidden mercedes where only the eyes of a vulture could have found her  jim lash crawled into a little strip of shade and bided the time tranquilly  ladd was restless and impatient and watchful every little while rising to look up the farreaching slope and then to the right where yaquis dark figure stood out from a high point of the rim thorne grew silent and seemed consumed by a slow sullen rage  gale was neither calm nor free of a gnawing suspense nor of a waiting wrath but as best he could he put the pending action out of mind  it came over him all of a sudden that he had not grasped the stupendous nature of this desert setting  there was the measureless red slope its lower ridges finally sinking into white sand dunes toward the blue sea  the cold sparkling light the white sun the deep azure of sky the feeling of boundless expanse all around himthese meant high altitude  southward the barren red simply merged into distance  the field of craters rose in high dark wheels toward the dominating peaks when gale withdrew his gaze from the magnitude of these spaces and heights the crater beneath him seemed dwarfed  yet while he gazed it spread and deepened and multiplied its ragged lines  no he could not grasp the meaning of size or distance here  there was too much to stun the sight but the mood in which nature had created this convulsed world of lava seized hold upon him  meanwhile the hours passed  as the sun climbed the clear steely lights vanished the blue hazes deepened and slowly the glistening surfaces of lava turned redder  ladd was concerned to discover that yaqui was missing from his outlook upon the high point  jim lash came out of the shady crevice and stood up to buckle on his cartridge belt his narrow gray glance slowly roved from the height of lava down along the slope paused in doubt and then swept on to resurvey the whole vast eastern dip of the plateau  i reckon my eyes are pore he said  mebbe its this damn red glare anyway whats them creepin spots up there  shore i seen them  mountain sheep replied ladd  guess again laddy  dick i reckon youd better flash the glass up the slope  gale adjusted the field glass and began to search the lava beginning close at hand and working away from him  presently the glass became stationary  i see half a dozen small animals brown in color  they look like sheep  but i couldnt distinguish mountain sheep from antelope  shore theyre bighorn said laddy  i reckon if youll pull around to the east an search under that long wall of lavathereyoull see what i see added jim  the glass climbed and circled wavered an instant then fixed steady as a rock  there was a breathless silence  fourteen horsestwo packedsome mountedothers without riders and lame said gale slowly  yaqui appeared far up the trail coming swiftly  presently he saw the rangers and halted to wave his arms and point  then he vanished as if the lava had opened beneath him  lemme that glass suddenly said jim lash  im seein red i tell you well pore as my eyes are they had it right  rojas an his outfit have left the trail  jim you aint meanin theyve taken to that awful slope queried ladd  i sure do  there they arestill comin but goin down too  mebbe rojas is crazy but it begins to look like he  laddy ill be danged if the greaser bunch hasnt vamoosed  gone out of sight  right there not a half mile away the whole caboodlegone  shore theyre behind a crust or have gone down into a rut suggested ladd  theyll show again in a minute  look sharp boys for im figgerin rojas ll spread his men  minutes passed but nothing moved upon the slope  each man crawled up to a vantage point along the crest of rotting lava  the watchers were careful to peer through little notches or from behind a spur and the constricted nature of their hidingplace kept them close together ladds muttering grew into a growl then lapsed into the silence that marked his companions  from time to time the rangers looked inquiringly at gale  the field glass however like the naked sight could not catch the slightest moving object out there upon the lava  a long hour of slow mounting suspense wore on  shore its all goin to be as queer as the yaqui said ladd  indeed the strange mien the silent action the somber character of the indian had not been without effect upon the minds of the men  then the weird desolate tragic scene added to the vague sense of mystery and now the disappearance of rojass band the long wait in the silence the boding certainty of invisible foes crawling circling closer and closer lent to the situation a final touch that made it unreal  im reckonin theres a mind behind them greasers replied jim or mebbe we aint done rojas credit if somethin would only come off  that lash the coolest most provokingly nonchalant of men in times of peril should begin to show a nervous strain was all the more indicative of a subtle pervading unreality  boys look sharp suddenly called lash  low down to the leftmebbe three hundred yards  see along by them seams of lavabehind the choyas  first off i thought it was a sheep  but its the yaqui crawlin swift as a lizard  cant you see him  it was a full moment before jims companions could locate the indian flat as a snake yaqui wound himself along with incredible rapidity his advance was all the more remarkable for the fact that he appeared to pass directly under the dreaded choyas  sometimes he paused to lift his head and look  he was directly in line with a huge whorl of lava that rose higher than any point on the slope this spur was a quarter of a mile from the position of the rangers  shore hes headin for that high place  said ladd  hes goin slow now  there hes stopped behind some choyas  hes gettin upno hes kneelin now what the hell  laddy take a peek at the side of that lava ridge sharply called jim  i guess mebbe somethin aint comin off  see  theres rojas an his outfit climbin  dont make out no hosses dick use your glass an tell us whats doin  ill watch yaqui an tell you what his move means  clearly and distinctly almost as if he could have touched them gale had rojas and his followers in sight  they were toiling up the rough lava on foot  they were heavily armed  spurs chaps jackets scarfs were not in evidence  gale saw the lean swarthy faces the black straggly hair the ragged soiled garments which had once been white  theyre almost up now gale was saying  there  they halt on top i see rojas  he looks wild  by  fellows an indian its a papago  beldings old herder the indian pointsthis waythen down  hes showing rojas the lay of the trail  boys yaquis in range of that bunch said jim swiftly  hes raisin his rifle slowlord how slow he is hes covered some one which one i cant say  but i think hell pick rojas  the yaqui can shoot  hell pick rojas added gale grimly  rojasyesyes cried thorne in passion of suspense  not on your life  ladds voice cut in with scorn  gentlemen you can gamble yaqui ll kill the papago  that traitor indian knows these sheep haunts  hes tellin rojas  a sharp rifle shot rang out  laddys right called gale  the papagos hithis arm fallsthere he tumbles  more shots rang out  yaqui was seen standing erect firing rapidly at the darting mexicans  for all gale could make out no second bullet took effect  rojas and his men vanished behind the bulge of lava then yaqui deliberately backed away from his position he made no effort to run or hide  evidently he watched cautiously for signs of pursuers in the ruts and behind the choyas  presently he turned and came straight toward the position of the rangers sheered off perhaps a hundred paces below it and disappeared in a crevice  plainly his intention was to draw pursuers within rifle shot  shore jim you had your wish  somethin come off said ladd an im sayin thank god for the yaqui  that papago d have ruined us even so mebbe hes told rojas moren enough to make us sweat blood  he had a chance to kill rojas cried out the drawnfaced passionate thorne  he didnt take it he didnt take it  only ladd appeared to be able to answer the cavalrymans poignant cry  listen son he said and his voice rang  weall know how you feel an if id had that one shot never in the world could i have picked the papago guide  id have had to kill rojas  thats the white man of it but yaqui was right  only an indian could have done it  you can gamble the papago alive meant slim chance for us  because hed led straight to where mercedes is hidden an then wed have left cover to fight it out when you come to think of the yaquis hate for greasers when you just seen him pass up a shot at onewell i dont know how to say what i mean but damn me my sombrerro is off to the indian  i reckon so an i reckon the balls opened rejoined lash and now that former nervous impatience so unnatural to him was as if it had never been  he was smilingly cool and his voice had almost a caressing note  he tapped the breech of his winchester with a sinewy brown hand and he did not appear to be addressing any one in particular  yaquis opened the ball  look up your pardners there gents an get ready to dance  another wait set in then and judging by the more direct rays of the sun and a receding of the little shadows cast by the choyas gale was of the opinion that it was a long wait  but it seemed short the four men were lying under the bank of a half circular hole in the lava  it was notched and cracked and its rim was fringed by choyas  it sloped down and opened to an unobstructed view of the crater  gale had the upper position fartherest to the right and therefore was best shielded from possible fire from the higher ridges of the rim some three hundred yards distant  jim came next well hidden in a crack the positions of thorne and ladd were most exposed  they kept sharp lookout over the uneven rampart of their hidingplace  the sun passed the zenith began to slope westward and to grow hotter as it sloped  the men waited and waited  gale saw no impatience even in thorne  the sultry air seemed to be laden with some burden or quality that was at once composed of heat menace color and silence even the light glancing up from the lava seemed red and the silence had substance  sometimes gale felt that it was unbearable  yet he made no effort to break it  suddenly this dead stillness was rent by a shot clear and stinging close at hand  it was from a rifle not a carbine  with startling quickness a cry followeda cry that pierced galeit was so thin so highkeyed so different from all other cries  it was the involuntary human shriek at death  yaquis called out another pardner said jim lash laconically  carbines began to crack  the reports were quick light like sharp spats without any ring  gale peered from behind the edge of his covert  above the ragged wave of lava floated faint whitish clouds all that was visible of smokeless powder  then gale made out round spots dark against the background of red and in front of them leaped out small tongues of fire  ladds 405 began to spang with its beautiful sound of power  thorne was firing somewhat wildly gale thought  then jim lash pushed his winchester over the rim under a choya and between shots gale could hear him singing turn the lady turnturn the lady turn alaman left swing your pardners forward an back turn the lady turn  gale got into the fight himself not so sure that he hit any of the round bobbing objects he aimed at but growing sure of himself as action liberated something forced and congested within his breast  then over the position of the rangers came a hail of steel bullets those that struck the lava hissed away into the crater those that came biting through the choyas made a sound which resembled a sharp ripping of silk  bits of cactus stung gales face and he dreaded the flying thorns more than he did the flying bullets  hold on boys called ladd as he crouched down to reload his rifle save your shells  the greasers are spreadin on us some goin down below yaqui others movin up for that high ridge  when they get up there im damned if it wont be hot for us  there aint room for all of us to hide here  ladd raised himself to peep over the rim  shots were now scattering and all appeared to come from below  emboldened by this he rose higher  a shot from in front a rip of bullet through the choya a spat of something hitting ladds face a steel missle hissing onwardthese inseparably blended sounds were all registered by gales sensitive ear  with a curse ladd tumbled down into the hole  his face showed a great gray blotch and starting blood  gale felt a sickening assurance of desperate injury to the ranger  he ran to him calling laddy  laddy  shore i aint plugged  its a damn choya burr  the bullet knocked it in my face  pull it out  the oval longspiked cone was firmly imbedded in ladds cheek blood streamed down his face and neck  carefully yet with no thought of pain to himself gale tried to pull the cactus joint away  it was as firm as if it had been nailed there  that was the damnable feature of the barbed thorns  once set they held on as that strange plant held to its desert life  ladd began to writhe and sweat mingled with the blood on his face  he cursed and raved and his movements made it almost impossible for gale to do anything  put your knifeblade under an tear it out shouted ladd hoarsely  thus ordered gale slipped a long blade in between the imbedded thorns and with a powerful jerk literally tore the choya out of ladds quivering flesh  then where the rangers face was not red and raw it certainly was white  a volley of shots from a different angle was followed by the quick ring of steel bullets striking the lava all around gale his first idea as he heard the projectiles sing and hum and whine away into the air was that they were coming from above him  he looked up to see a number of low white and dark knobs upon the high point of lava  they had not been there before  then he saw little pale leaping tongues of fire as he dodged down he distinctly heard a bullet strike ladd  at the same instant he seemed to hear thorne cry out and fall and lashs boots scrape rapidly away  ladd fell backward still holding the 405  gale dragged him into the shelter of his own position and dreading to look at him took up the heavy weapon  it was with a kind of savage strength that he gripped the rifle and it was with a cold and deadly intent that he aimed and fired  the first greaser huddled low let his carbine go clattering down and then crawled behind the rim  the second  and third jerked back  the fourth seemed to flop up over the crest of lava  a dark arm reached for him clutched his leg tried to drag him up  it was in vain  wildly grasping at the air the bandit fell slid down a steep shelf rolled over the rim to go hurtling down out of sight  fingering the hot rifle with closepressed hands gale watched the sky line along the high point of lava  it remained unbroken as his passion left him he feared to look back at his companions and the cold chill returned to his breast  shoreim damn gladthem greasers aint usin softnose bullets drawled a calm voice  swift as lightning gale whirled  laddy  i thought you were done for cried gale with a break in his voice  i aint amindin the bullet much  but that choya joint took my nerve an you can gamble on it  dick this holes pretty high up aint it  the rangers blouse was open at the neck and on his right shoulder under the collar bone was a small hole just beginning to bleed  sure its high laddy replied gale gladly  went clear through clean as a whistle  he tore a handkerchief into two parts made wads and pressing them close over the wounds he bound them there with ladds scarf  shore its funny how a bullet can floor a man an then not do any damage said ladd  i felt a zip of wind an somethin like a pat on my chest an down i went  well so much for the small caliber with their steel bullets  supposin id connected with a 405  laddy iim afraid thornes done for whispered gale  hes lying over there in that crack  i can see part of him  he doesnt move  i was wonderin if id have to tell you that  dick he went down hard hit fallin you know limp an soggy  it was a moral cinch one of us would get it in this fight but god  im sorry thorne had to be the man  laddy maybe hes not dead replied gale  he called aloud to his friend  there was no answer  ladd got up and after peering keenly at the height of lava he strode swiftly across the space  it was only a dozen steps to the crack in the lava where thorne had fallen head first  ladd bent over went to his knees so that gale saw only his head  then he appeared rising with arms round the cavalryman  he dragged him across the hole to the sheltered corner that alone afforded protection  he had scarcely reached it when a carbine cracked and a bullet struck the flinty lava striking sparks then singing away into the air  thorne was either dead or unconscious and gale with a contracting throat and numb heart decided for the former  not so ladd who probed the bloody gash on thornes temple and then felt his breast  hes alive an not bad hurt  that bullet hit him glancin  shore them steel bullets are some lucky for us  dick you neednt look so glum i tell you he aint bad hurt  i felt his skull with my finger theres no hole in it  wash him off an tie  wow did you get the wind of that one  an mebbe it didnt sing off the lava dick look after thorne now while i  the completion of his speech was the stirring ring of the 405 and then he uttered a laugh that was unpleasant  shore greaser theres a mans size bullet for you  no slim sharppointed steeljacket nail  im takin it on me to believe youre appreciatin of the 405 seein as you dont make no fuss  it was indeed a joy to gale to find that thorne had not received a wound necessarily fatal though it was serious enough  gale bathed and bound it and laid the cavalryman against the slant of the bank his head high to lessen the probability of bleeding  as gale straightened up ladd muttered low and deep and swung the heavy rifle around to the left  far along the slope a figure moved  ladd began to work the lever of the winchester and to shoot  at every shot the heavy firearm sprang up and the recoil made ladds shoulder give back  gale saw the bullets strike the lava behind beside before the fleeing mexican sending up dull puffs of dust  on the sixth shot he plunged down out of sight either hit or frightened into seeking cover  dick mebbe theres one or two left above but we neednt figure much on it said ladd as loading the rifle he jerked his fingers quickly from the hot breech  listen  jim an yaqui are hittin it up lively down below  ill sneak down there  you stay here an keep about half an eye peeled up yonder an keep the rest my way  ladd crossed the hole climbed down into the deep crack where thorne had fallen and then went stooping along with only his head above the level  presently he disappeared  gale having little to fear from the high ridge directed most of his attention toward the point beyond which ladd had gone  the firing had become desultory and the light carbine shots outnumbered the sharp rifle shots five to one  gale made a note of the fact that for some little time he had not heard the unmistakable report of jim lashs automatic then ensued a long interval in which the desert silence seemed to recover its grip  the 405 ripped it asunderspangspangspang gale fancied he heard yells  there were a few pattering shots still farther down the trail gale had an uneasy conviction that rojas and some of his band might go straight to the waterhole it would be hard to dislodge even a few men from that retreat  there seemed a lull in the battle  gale ventured to stand high and screened behind choyas he swept the threequarter circle of lava with his glass  in the distance he saw horses but no riders below him down the slope along the crater rim and the trail the lava was bare of all except tufts of choya  gale gathered assurance  it looked as if the day was favoring his side  then thorne coming partly to consciousness engaged gales care  the cavalryman stirred and moaned called for water and then for mercedes  gale held him back with a strong hand and presently he was once more quiet  for the first time in hours as it seemed gale took note of the physical aspect of his surroundings  he began to look upon them without keen gaze strained for crouching form or bobbing head or spouting carbine  either gales sense of color and proportion had become deranged during the fight or the encompassing air and the desert had changed  even the sun had changed  it seemed lowering oval in shape magenta in hue and it had a surface that gleamed like oil on water  its red rays shone through red haze distances that had formerly been clearly outlined were now dim obscured  the yawning chasm was not the same  it circled wider redder deeper  it was a weird ghastly mouth of hell  gale stood fascinated unable to tell how much he saw was real how much exaggeration of overwrought emotions  there was no beauty here but an unparalleled grandeur a sublime scene of devastation and desolation which might have had its counterpart upon the burnedout moon  the mood that gripped gale now added to its somber portent an unshakable foreboding of calamity  he wrestled with the spell as if it were a physical foe  reason and intelligence had their voices in his mind but the moment was not one wherein these things could wholly control  he felt life strong within his breast yet there a step away was death yawning glaring smoky red  it was a momentan hour for a savage born bred developed in this scarred and blasted place of jagged depths and red distances and silences never meant to be broken  since gale was not a savage he fought that call of the red gods which sent him back down the long ages toward his primitive day  his mind combated his sense of sight and the hearing that seemed useless and his mind did not win all the victory something fatal was here hanging in the balance as the red haze hung along the vast walls of that crater of hell  suddenly harsh prolonged yells brought him to his feet and the unrealities vanished  far down the trails where the crater rims closed in the deep fissure he saw moving forms  they were three in number two of them ran nimbly across the lava bridge  the third staggered far behind  it was ladd  he appeared hard hit  he dragged at the heavy rifle which he seemed unable to raise  the yells came from him  he was calling the yaqui  gales heart stood still momentarily  here then was the catastrophe he hardly dared sweep that fissure with his glass the two fleeing figures haltedturned to fire at ladd  gale recognized the foremost onesmall compact gaudy  rojas the bandits arm was outstretched puffs of white smoke rose and shots rapped out  when ladd went down rojas threw his gun aside and with a wild yell bounded over the lava his companion followed  a tide of passion first hot as fire then cold as ice rushed over gale when he saw rojas take the trail toward mercedess hidingplace the little bandit appeared to have the surefootedness of a mountain sheep  the mexican following was not so sure or fast  he turned back gale heard the trenchant bark of the 405  ladd was kneeling  he shot againagain  the retreating bandit seemed to run full into an invisible obstacle then fell lax inert lifeless  rojas sped on unmindful of the spurts of dust about him  yaqui high above ladd was also firing at the bandit  then both rifles were emptied  rojas turned at a high break in the trail  he shook a defiant hand and his exulting yell pealed faintly to gales ears  about him there was something desperate magnificent  then he clambered down the trail  ladd dropped the 405 and rising gun in hand he staggered toward the bridge of lava  before he had crossed it yaqui came bounding down the slope and in one splendid leap he cleared the fissure he ran beyond the trail and disappeared on the lava above  rojas had not seen this sudden darting move of the indian  gale felt himself bitterly powerless to aid in that pursuit  he could only watch  he wondered fearfully what had become of lash presently when rojas came out of the cracks and ruts of lava there might be a chance of disabling him by a long shot his progress was now slow  but he was making straight for mercedess hidingplace  what was it leading him therean eagle eye or hate or instinct  why did he go on when there could be no turning back for him on that trail ladd was slow heavy staggering on the trail but he was relentless only death could stop the ranger now  surely rojas must have known that when he chose the trail  from time to time gale caught glimpses of yaquis dark figure stealing along the higher rim of the crater he was making for a point above the bandit  momentsendless moments dragged by  the lowering sun colored only the upper half of the crater walls  far down the depths were murky blue again gale felt the insupportable silence  the red haze became a transparent veil before his eyes  sinister evil brooding waiting seemed that yawning abyss  ladd staggered along the trail at times he crawled  the yaqui gained he might have had wings he leaped from jagged crust to jagged crust his surefootedness was a wonderful thing  but for gale the marvel of that endless period of watching was the purpose of the bandit rojas  he had now no weapon  gales glass made this fact plain  there was death behind him death below him death before him and though he could not have known it death above him  he never falterednever made a misstep upon the narrow flinty trail when he reached the lower end of the level ledge gales poignant doubt became a certainty  rojas had seen mercedes  it was incredible yet gale believed it  then his heart clamped as in an icy vise gale threw forward the remington and sinking on one knee began to shoot he emptied the magazine  puffs of dust near rojas did not even make him turn  as gale began to reload he was horrorstricken by a low cry from thorne  the cavalryman had recovered consciousness  he was half raised pointing with shaking hand at the opposite ledge  his distended eyes were riveted upon rojas  he was trying to utter speech that would not come  gale wheeled rigid now steeling himself to one last forlorn hopethat mercedes could defend herself  she had a gun  he doubted not at all that she would use it  but remembering her terror of this savage he feared for her  rojas reached the level of the ledge  he halted  he crouched it was the act of a panther  manifestly he saw mercedes within the cave then faint shots patted the air broke in quick echo rojas went down as if struck a heavy blow  he was hit but even as gale yelled in sheer madness the bandit leaped erect he seemed too quick too supple to be badly wounded  a slight dark figure flashed out of the cave mercedes  she backed against the wall  gale saw a puff of whiteheard a report  but the bandit lunged at her  mercedes ran not to try to pass him but straight for the precipice  her intention was plain  but rojas outstripped her even as she reached the verge then a piercing scream pealed across the cratera scream of despair  gale closed his eyes  he could not bear to see more  thorne echoed mercedess scream  gale looked round just in time to leap and catch the cavalryman as he staggered apparently for the steep slope  and then as gale dragged him back both fell gale saved his friend but he plunged into a choya  he drew his hands away full of the great glistening cones of thorns  for gods sake gale shoot  shoot  kill her  kill her cantyouseerojas  thorne fainted  gale stunned for the instant stood with uplifted hands and gazed from thorne across the crater  rojas had not killed mercedes  he was overpowering her  his actions seemed slow wearing purposeful hers were violent  like a trapped shewolf mercedes was fighting she tore struggled flung herself  rojass intention was terribly plain  in agony now both mental and physical cold and sick and weak gale gripped his rifle and aimed at the struggling forms on the ledge  he pulled the trigger  the bullet struck up a cloud of red dust close to the struggling couple  again gale fired hoping to hit rojas praying to kill mercedes  the bullet struck high a thirdfourthfifth time the remington spokein vain the rifle fell from gales racked hands  how horribly plain that fiends intention  gale tried to close his eyes but could not  he prayed wildly for a sudden blindnessto faint as thorne had fainted  but he was transfixed to the spot with eyes that pierced the red light  mercedes was growing weaker seemed about to collapse  oh jim lash are you dead cried gale  oh laddy oh yaqui  suddenly a dark form literally fell down the wall behind the ledge where rojas fought the girl  it sank in a heap then bounded erect  yaqui screamed gale and he waved his bleeding hands till the blood bespattered his face  then he choked  utterance became impossible  the indian bent over rojas and flung him against the wall mercedes sinking back lay still  when rojas got up the indian stood between him and escape from the ledge  rojas backed the other way along the narrowing shelf of lava  his manner was abject stupefied  slowly he stepped backward  it was then that gale caught the white gleam of a knife in yaquis hand  rojas turned and ran  he rounded a corner of wall where the footing was precarious  yaqui followed slowly  his figure was dark and menacing  but he was not in a hurry  when he passed off the ledge rojas was edging farther and farther along the wall  he was clinging now to the lava creeping inch by inch  perhaps he had thought to work around the buttress or climb over it  evidently he went as far as possible and there he clung an unscalable wall above the abyss beneath  the approach of the yaqui was like a slow dark shadow of gloom if it seemed so to the stricken gale what must it have been to rojas  he appeared to sink against the wall  the yaqui stole closer and closer he was the savage now and for him the moment must have been glorified gale saw him gaze up at the great circling walls of the crater then down into the depths perhaps the red haze hanging above him or the purple haze below or the deep caverns in the lava held for yaqui spirits of the desert his gods to whom he called  perhaps he invoked shadows of his loved ones and his race calling them in this moment of vengeance  gale heardor imagined he heardthat wild strange yaqui cry  then the indian stepped close to rojas and bent low keeping out of reach  how slow were his motions  would yaqui nevernever end it a wail drifted across the crater to gales ears  rojas fell backward and plunged sheer  the bank of white choyas caught him held him upon their steel spikes  how long did the dazed gale sit there watching rojas wrestling and writhing in convulsive frenzy  the bandit now seemed mad to win the delayed death  when he broke free he was a white patched object no longer human a ball of choya burrs and he slipped off the bank to shoot down and down into the purple depths of the crater    xiii  changes at forlorn river  the first of march saw the federal occupation of the garrison at casita  after a short decisive engagement the rebels were dispersed into small bands and driven eastward along the boundary line toward nogales  it was the destiny of forlorn river however never to return to the slow sleepy tenor of its former existence  beldings predictions came true  that straggling line of homeseekers was but a forerunner of the real invasion of altar valley  refugees from mexico and from casita spread the word that water and wood and grass and land were to be had at forlorn river and as if by magic the white tents and red adobe houses sprang up to glisten in the sun  belding was happier than he had been for a long time  he believed that evil days for forlorn river along with the apathy and lack of enterprise were in the past  he hired a couple of trustworthy mexicans to ride the boundary line and he settled down to think of ranching and irrigation and mining projects  every morning he expected to receive some word form sonoyta or yuma telling him that yaqui had guided his party safely across the desert  belding was simpleminded a man more inclined to action than reflection  when the complexities of life hemmed him in he groped his way out never quite understanding  his wife had always been a mystery to him  nell was sunshine most of the time but like the sundominated desert she was subject to strange changes wilful stormy sudden  it was enough for belding now to find his wife in a lighter happier mood and to see nell dreamily turning a ring round and round the third finger of her left hand and watching the west every day both mother and daughter appeared farther removed from the past darkly threatening days  belding was hearty in his affections but undemonstrative if there was any sentiment in his makeup it had an outlet in his memory of blanco diablo and a longing to see him often belding stopped his work to gaze out over the desert toward the west  when he thought of his rangers and thorne and mercedes he certainly never forgot his horse  he wondered if diablo was running walking resting if yaqui was finding water and grass  in march with the short desert winter over the days began to grow warm  the noon hours were hot and seemed to give promise of the white summer blaze and blasting furnace wind soon to come no word was received from the rangers  but this caused belding no concern and it seemed to him that his women folk considered no news good news  among the many changes coming to pass in forlorn river were the installing of postoffice service and the building of a mescal drinkinghouse  belding had worked hard for the post office but he did not like the idea of a saloon for forlorn river  still that was an inevitable evil  the mexicans would have mescal  belding had kept the little border hamlet free of an establishment for distillation of the fiery cactus drink  a good many americans drifted into forlorn riverminers cowboys prospectors outlaws and others of nondescript character and these men of course made the saloon which was also an inn their headquarters belding with carter and other old residents saw the need of a sheriff for forlorn river  one morning early in this spring month while belding was on his way from the house to the corrals he saw nell running blanco jose down the road at a gait that amazed him she did not take the turn of the road to come in by the gate she put jose at a fourfoot wire fence and came clattering into the yard  nell must have another tantrum said belding  shes long past due  blanco jose like the other white horses was big of frame and heavy and thunder rolled from under his great hoofs  nell pulled him up and as he pounded and slid to a halt in a cloud of dust she swung lightly down  it did not take more than half an eye for belding to see that she was furious  nell whats come off now asked belding  im not going to tell you she replied and started away leading jose toward the corral  belding leisurely followed  she went into the corral removed joses bridle and led him to the wateringtrough  belding came up and without saying anything began to unbuckle joses saddle girths  but he ventured a look at nell  the red had gone from her face and he was surprised to see her eyes brimming with tears most assuredly this was not one of nells tantrums  while taking off joses saddle and hanging it in the shed belding pondered in his slow way  when he came back to the corral nell had her face against the bars and she was crying  he slipped a big arm around her and waited  although it was not often expressed there was a strong attachment between them  dad i dont want you to think me aa baby any more she said ive been insulted  with a specific fact to make clear thought in beldings mind he was never slow  i knew something unusual had come off  i guess youd better tell me  dad i will if you promise  what  not to mention it to mother not to pack a gun down there and never never tell dick  belding was silent  seldom did he make promises readily  nell sure something must have come off for you to ask all that  if you dont promise ill never tell thats all she declared firmly  belding deliberated a little longer  he knew the girl  well i promise not to tell mother he said presently and seeing youre here safe and well i guess i wont go packing a gun down there wherever that is  but i wont promise to keep anything from dick that perhaps he ought to know  dad what would dick do ifif he were here and i were to tell him idid been horribly insulted  i guess that d depend  mostly you know dick does what you want but you couldnt stop himnobody couldif there was reason a mans reason to get started  remember what he did to rojas nell tell me whats happened  nell regaining her composure wiped her eyes and smoothed back her hair  the other day wednesday she began i was coming home and in front of that mescal drinkingplace there was a crowd  it was a noisy crowd i didnt want to walk out into the street or seem afraid  but i had to do both  there were several young men and if they werent drunk they certainly were rude  i never saw them before but i think they must belong to the mining company that was run out of sonora by rebels mrs carter was telling me  anyway these young fellows were americans  they stretched themselves across the walk and smiled at me i had to go out in the road  one of them the rudest followed me  he was a big fellow redfaced with prominent eyes and a bold look  he came up beside me and spoke to me  i ran home  and as i ran i heard his companions jeering  well today just now when i was riding up the valley road i came upon the same fellows  they had instruments and were surveying remembering dick and how he always wished for an instrument to help work out his plan for irrigation i was certainly surprised to see these strangers surveyingand surveying upon laddys plot of land  it was a sandy road there and jose happened to be walking so i reined in and asked these engineers what they were doing the leader who was that same bold fellow who had followed me seemed much pleased at being addressed  he was swaggeringtoo friendly not my idea of a gentleman at all  he said he was glad to tell me he was going to run water all over altar valley  dad you can bet that made me wild  that was dicks plan his discovery and here were surveyors on laddys claim  then i told him that he was working on private land and hed better get off  he seemed to forget his flirty proclivities in amazement then he looked cunning  i read his mind  it was news to him that all the land along the valley had been taken up  he said something about not seeing any squatters on the land and then he shut up tight on that score  but he began to be flirty again  he got hold of joses bridle and before i could catch my breath he said i was a peach and that he wanted to make a date with me that his name was chase that he owned a gold mine in mexico  he said a lot more i didnt gather but when he called me dearie iwell i lost my temper  i jerked on the bridle and told him to let go  he held on and rolled his eyes at me  i dare say he imagined he was a gentlemen to be infatuated with  he seemed sure of conquest  one thing certain he didnt know the least bit about horses  it scared me the way he got in front of jose  i thanked my stars i wasnt up on blanco diablo  well dad im a little ashamed now but i was mad  i slashed him across the face with my quirt  jose jumped and knocked mr chase into the sand i didnt get the horse under control till i was out of sight of those surveyors and then i let him run home  nell i guess you punished the fellow enough  maybe hes only a conceited softy  but i dont like that sort of thing  it isnt western  i guess he wont be so smart next time  any fellow would remember being hit by blanco jose  if youd been up on diablo wed have to bury mr chase  thank goodness i wasnt  im sorry now dad  perhaps the fellow was hurt  but what could i do  lets forget all about it and ill be careful where i ride in the future dad what does it mean this surveying around forlorn river  i dont know nell replied belding thoughtfully  it worries me it looks good for forlorn river but bad for dicks plan to irrigate the valley  lord id hate to have some one forestall dick on that  no no we wont let anybody have dicks rights declared nell  where have i been keeping myself not to know about these surveyors muttered belding  they must have just come  go see mrs cater  she told me there were strangers in town americans who had mining interests in sonora and were run out by orozco  find out what theyre doing dad  belding discovered that he was indeed the last man of consequence in forlorn river to learn of the arrival of ben chase and son mineowners and operators in sonora  they with a force of miners had been besieged by rebels and finally driven off their property this property was not destroyed but held for ransom  and the chases pending developments had packed outfits and struck for the border  casita had been their objective point but for some reason which belding did not learn they had arrived instead at forlorn river  it had taken ben chase just one day to see the possibilities of altar valley and in three days he had men at work  belding returned home without going to see the chases and their operations  he wanted to think over the situation  next morning he went out to the valley to see for himself  mexicans were hastily erecting adobe houses upon ladds one hundred and sixty acres upon dick gales upon jim lashs and thornes  there were men staking the valley floor and the river bed  that was sufficient for belding  he turned back toward town and headed for the camp of these intruders  in fact the surroundings of forlorn river except on the river side reminded belding of the mushroom growth of a newly discovered mining camp  tents were everywhere adobe shacks were in all stages of construction rough clapboard houses were going up the latest of this work was new and surprising to belding all because he was a busy man with no chance to hear village gossip when he was directed to the headquarters of the chase mining company he went thither in slowgrowing wrath  he came to a big tent with a huge canvas fly stretched in front under which sat several men in their shirt sleeves  they were talking and smoking  my names belding  i want to see this mr chase said belding gruffly  slowwitted as belding was and absorbed in his own feelings he yet saw plainly that his advent was disturbing to these men  they looked alarmed exchanged glances and then quickly turned to him  one of them a tall rugged man with sharp face and shrewd eyes and white hair got up and offered his hand  im chase senior he said  my son radford chase is here somewhere youre belding the line inspector i take it  i meant to call on you  he seemed a roughandready loudspoken man withal cordial enough  yes im the inspector replied belding ignoring the proffered hand and id like to know what in the hell you mean by taking up land claimsstaked ground that belongs to my rangers  land claims slowly echoed chase studying his man  were taking up only unclaimed land  thats a lie  you couldnt miss the stakes  well mr belding as to that i think my men did run across some staked ground  but we recognize only squatters  if your rangers think theyve got property just because they drove a few stakes in the ground theyre much mistaken  a squatter has to build a house and live on his land so long according to law before he owns it  this argument was unanswerable and belding knew it  according to law exclaimed belding  then you own up youve jumped our claims  mr belding im a plain business man  i come along  i see a good opening  nobody seems to have tenable grants  i stake out claims locate squatters start to build  it seems to me your rangers have overlooked certain precautions  thats unfortunate for them  im prepared to hold my claim and to back all the squatters who work for me  if you dont like it you can carry the matter to tucson the law will uphold me  the law  say on this southwest border we havent any law except a mans word and a gun  then youll find united states law has come along with ben chase replied the other snapping his fingers  he was still smooth outspoken but his mask had fallen  youre not a westerner queried belding  no im from illinois  i thought the west hadnt bred you  i know your kind  youd last a long time on the texas border now wouldnt you  youre one of the land and water hogs that has come to root in the west youre like the timber sharkstake it all and leave none for those who follow  mr chase the west would fare better and last longer if men like you were driven out  you cant drive me out  im not so sure of that  wait till my rangers come back  i wouldnt be in your boots  dont mistake me  i dont suppose you could be accused of stealing another mans ideas or plan but sure youve stolen these four claims  maybe the law might uphold you  but the spirit not the letter counts with us bordermen  see here belding i think youre taking the wrong view of the matter im going to develop this valley  youd do better to get in with me ive a proposition to make you about that strip of land of yours facing the river  you cant make any deals with me  i wont have anything to do with you  belding abruptly left the camp and went home  nell met him probably intended to question him but one look into his face confirmed her fears  she silently turned away  belding realized he was powerless to stop chase and he was sick with disappointment for the ruin of dicks hopes and his own    xiv  a lost son  time passed  the population of forlorn river grew apace  belding who had once been the head of the community found himself a person of little consequence  even had he desired it he would not have had any voice in the selection of postmaster sheriff and a few other officials  the chases divided their labors between forlorn river and their mexican gold mine which had been restored to them  the desert trips between these two places were taken in automobiles  a months time made the motor cars almost as familiar a sight in forlorn river as they had been in casita before the revolution  belding was not so busy as he had been formerly  as he lost ambition he began to find less work to do  his wrath at the usurping chases increased as he slowly realized his powerlessness to cope with such men  they were promoters men of big interests and wide influence in the southwest  the more they did for forlorn river the less reason there seemed to be for his own grievance he had to admit that it was personal that he and gale and the rangers would never have been able to develop the resources of the valley as these men were doing it  all day long he heard the heavy booming blasts and the rumble of avalanches up in the gorge  chases men were dynamiting the cliffs in the narrow box canyon  they were making the dam just as gale had planned to make it  when this work of blasting was over belding experienced a relief  he would not now be continually reminded of his and gales loss  resignation finally came to him  but he could not reconcile himself to misfortune for gale  moreover belding had other worry and strain  april arrived with no news of the rangers  from casita came vague reports of raiders in the sonoyta countryreports impossible to verify until his mexican rangers returned  when these men rode in one of them gonzales an intelligent and reliable halfbreed said he had met prospectors at the oasis  they had just come in on the camino del diablo reported a terrible trip of heat and drought and not a trace of the yaquis party  that settles it declared belding  yaqui never went to sonoyta hes circled round to the devils road and the rangers mercedes thorne the horsestheyim afraid they have been lost in the desert its an old story on camino del diablo  he had to tell nell that and it was an ordeal which left him weak  mrs belding listened to him and was silent for a long time while she held the stricken nell to her breast then she opposed his convictions with that quiet strength so characteristic of her arguments  well then decided belding rojas headed the rangers at papago well or the tanks  tom when you are down in the mouth you use poor judgment she went on  you know only by a miracle could rojas or anybody have headed those white horses  wheres your old stubborn confidence  yaqui was up on diablo  dick was up on sol  and there were the other horses they could not have been headed or caught  miracles dont happen  all right mother its sure good to hear you said belding  she always cheered him and now he grasped at straws  im not myself these days dont mistake that  tell us what you think you always say you feel things when you really dont know them  i can say little more than what you said yourself the night mercedes was taken away  you told laddy to trust yaqui that he was a godsend he might go south into some wild sonora valley  he might lead rojas into a trap  he would find water and grass where no mexican or american could  but mother theyre gone seven weeks  seven weeks  at the most i gave them six weeks  seven weeks in the desert  how do the yaquis live she asked  belding could not reply to that but hope revived in him  he had faith in his wife though he could not in the least understand what he imagined was something mystic in her  years ago when i was searching for my father i learned many things about this country said mrs belding  you can never tell how long a man may live in the desert  the fiercest most terrible and inaccessible places often have their hidden oasis  in his later years my father became a prospector  that was strange to me for he never cared for gold or money  i learned that he was often gone in the desert for weeks once for months  then the time came when he never came back  that was years before i reached the southwest border and heard of him  even then i did not for long give up hope of his coming back  i know nowsomething tells meindeed it seems his spirit tells mehe was lost  but i dont have that feeling for yaqui and his party  yaqui has given rojas the slip or has ambushed him in some trap  probably that took time and a long journey into sonora  the indian is too wise to start back now over dry trails  hell curb the rangers hell wait i seem to know this dear nell so be brave patient  dick gale will come back to you  oh mother cried nell  i cant give up hope while i have you  that talk with the strong mother worked a change in nell and belding nell who had done little but brood and watch the west and take violent rides seemed to settle into a waiting patience that was sad yet serene  she helped her mother more than ever she was a comfort to belding she began to take active interest in the affairs of the growing village  belding who had been breaking under the strain of worry recovered himself so that to outward appearance he was his old self  he alone knew however that his humor was forced and that the slow burning wrath he felt for the chases was flaming into hate  belding argued with himself that if ben chase and his son radford had turned out to be big men in other ways than in the power to carry on great enterprises he might have become reconciled to them but the father was greedy grasping hard cold the son added to those traits an overbearing disposition to rule and he showed a fondness for drink and cards  these men were developing the valley to be sure and a horde of poor mexicans and many americans were benefiting from that development nevertheless these chases were operating in a way which proved they cared only for themselves  belding shook off a lethargic spell and decided he had better set about several by no means small tasks if he wanted to get them finished before the hot months  he made a trip to the sonoyta oasis  he satisfied himself that matters along the line were favorable and that there was absolutely no trace of his rangers upon completing this trip he went to casita with a number of his white thoroughbreds and shipped them to ranchers and horsebreeders in texas  then being near the railroad and having time he went up to tucson  there he learned some interesting particulars about the chases  they had an office in the city influential friends in the capitol  they were powerful men in the rapidly growing finance of the west  they had interested the southern pacific railroad and in the near future a branch line was to be constructed from san felipe to forlorn river  these details of the chase development were insignificant when compared to a matter striking close home to belding his responsibility had been subtly attacked  a doubt had been cast upon his capability of executing the duties of immigration inspector to the best advantage of the state  belding divined that this was only an entering wedge  the chases were bent upon driving him out of forlorn river but perhaps to serve better their own ends they were proceeding at leisure  belding returned home consumed by rage  but he controlled it  for the first time in his life he was afraid of himself  he had his wife and nell to think of and the old law of the west had gone forever  dad theres another rojas round these diggings was nells remark after the greetings were over and the usual questions and answers passed  beldings exclamation was cut short by nells laugh  she was serious with a kind of amused contempt  mr radford chase  now nell what the roared belding  hush dad  dont swear interrupted nell  i only meant to tease you  humph  say my girl that name chase makes me see red  if you must tease me hit on some other way  sabe senorita  si si dad  nell you may as well tell him and have it over said mrs belding quietly  you promised me once dad that youd not go packing a gun off down there didnt you  yes i remember replied belding but he did not answer her smile  will you promise again she asked lightly  here was nell with arch eyes yet not the old arch eyes so full of fun and mischief her lips were tremulous her cheeks seemed less round  yes rejoined belding and he knew why his voice was a little thick  well if you werent such a good old blind dad youd have seen long ago the way mr radford chase ran round after me  at first it was only annoying and i did not want to add to your worries but these two weeks youve been gone ive been more than annoyed after that time i struck mr chase with my quirt he made all possible efforts to meet me he did meet me wherever i went  he sent me letters till i got tired of sending them back  when you left home on your trips i dont know that he grew bolder but he had more opportunity  i couldnt stay in the house all the time there were mamas errands and sick people and my sunday school and what not  mr chase waylaid me every time i went out if he works any more i dont know when unless its when im asleep he followed me until it was less embarassing for me to let him walk with me and talk his head off  he made love to me  he begged me to marry him  i told him i was already in love and engaged to be married  he said that didnt make any difference  then i called him a fool  next time he saw me he said he must explain  he meant i was being true to a man who everybody on the border knew had been lost in the desert  thatthat hurt  maybemaybe its true  sometimes it seems terribly true  since then of course i have stayed in the house to avoid being hurt again  but dad a little thing like a girl sticking close to her mother and room doesnt stop mr chase  i think hes crazy  anyway hes a most persistent fool  i want to be charitable because the man swears he loves me and maybe he does but he is making me nervous  i dont sleep  im afraid to be in my room at night ive gone to mothers room  hes always hanging round  bold why that isnt the thing to call mr chase  hes absolutely without a sense of decency  he bribes our servants  he comes into our patio  think of that  he makes the most ridiculous excuses  he bothers mother to death  i feel like a poor little rabbit holed by a hound  and i darent peep out  somehow the thing struck belding as funny and he laughed  he had not had a laugh for so long that it made him feel good  he stopped only at sight of nells surprise and pain  then he put his arms round her  never mind dear  im an old bear  but it tickled me i guess i sure hope mr radford chase has got it bad nell its only the old story  the fellows fall in love with you  its your good looks nell what a price women like you and mercedes have to pay for beauty  id a d a good deal rather be ugly as a mud fence  so would i dad ifif dick would still love me  he wouldnt you can gamble on that as laddy says  well the first time i catch this locoed romeo sneaking round here illill  dad you promised  confound it nell i promised not to pack a gun  thats all ill only shoo this fellow off the place gently mind you gently ill leave the rest for dick gale  oh dad cried nell and she clung to him wistful frightened yet something more  dont mistake me nell  you have your own way generally  you pull the wool over mothers eyes and you wind me round your little finger but you cant do either with dick gale  youre tenderhearted you overlook the doings of this hound chase but when dick comes back you just make up your mind to a little hell in the chase camp  oh hell find it out  and i sure want to be round when dick hands mr radford the same as he handed rojas  belding kept a sharp lookout for young chase and then a few days later learned that both son and father had gone off upon one of their frequent trips to casa grandes near where their mines were situated  april grew apace and soon gave way to may  one morning belding was called from some garden work by the whirring of an automobile and a holloa  he went forward to the front yard and there saw a car he thought resembled one he had seen in casita it contained a familiarlooking driver but the three figures in gray coats and veils were strange to him  by the time he had gotten to the road he decided two were women and the other a man  at the moment their faces were emerging from dusty veils  belding saw an elderly sallowfaced rather frailappearing man who was an entire stranger to him a handsome darkeyed woman whose hair showed white through her veil and a superbly built girl whose face made belding at once think of dick gale  is this mr tom belding inspector of immigration inquired the gentleman courteously  im belding and i know who you are replied belding in hearty amaze as he stretched forth his big hand  youre dick gales dadthe governor dick used to say  im sure glad to meet you  thank you  yes im dicks governor and here mr beldingdicks mother and his sister elsie  beaming his pleasure belding shook hands with the ladies who showed their agitation clearly  mr belding ive come west to look up my lost son said mr gale his sisters letters were unanswered  we havent heard from him in months  is he still here with you  well now sure im awful sorry began belding his slow mind at work  dicks away just nowbeen away for a considerable spell  im expecting him back any day wont you come in  youre all dusty and hot and tired  come in and let mother and nell make you comfortable of course youll stay  weve a big house  you must stay till dick comes back  maybe that ll be aw i guess it wont be long let me handle the baggage mr gale come in i sure am glad to meet you all  eager excited delighted belding went on talking as he ushered the gales into the sittingroom presenting them in his hearty way to the astounded mrs belding and nell  for the space of a few moments his wife and daughter were bewildered  belding did not recollect any other occasion when a few callers had thrown them off their balance  but of course this was different  he was a little flustered himselfa circumstance that dawned upon him with surprise  when the gales had been shown to rooms mrs belding gained the poise momentarily lost but nell came rushing back wilder than a deer in a state of excitement strange even for her  oh  dicks mother his sister whispered nell  belding observed the omission of the father in nells exclamation of mingled delight and alarm  his mother went on nell  oh i knew it  i always guessed it dicks people are proud rich theyre somebody  i thought id faint when she looked at me  she was just curiouscurious but so cold and proud  she was wondering about me  im wearing his ring  it was his mothers he said  i wonti cant take it off  and im scared but the sisteroh shes lovely and sweetproud too  i felt warm all over when she looked at me  ii wanted to kiss her  she looks like dick when he first came to us  but hes changed  theyll hardly recognize him to think theyve come  and i had to be looking a fright when of all times on earth id want to look my best  nell out of breath ran away evidently to make herself presentable according to her idea of the exigency of the case  belding caught a glimpse of his wifes face as she went out and it wore a sad strange anxious expression  then belding sat alone pondering the contracting emotions of his wife and daughter  it was beyond his understanding women were creatures of feeling  belding saw reason to be delighted to entertain dicks family and for the time being no disturbing thought entered his mind  presently the gales came back into the sittingroom looking very different without the long gray cloaks and veils  belding saw distinction and elegance  mr gale seemed a grave troubled kindly person ill in body and mind  belding received the same impression of power that ben chase had given him only here it was minus any harshness or hard quality  he gathered that mr gale was a man of authority  mrs gale rather frightened belding but he could not have told why  the girl was just like dick as he used to be  their manner of speaking also reminded belding of dick  they talked of the ride from ash fork down to the border of the ugly and tornup casita of the heat and dust and cactus along the trail  presently nell came in now cool and sweet in white with a red rose at her breast  belding had never been so proud of her  he saw that she meant to appear well in the eyes of dicks people and began to have a faint perception of what the ordeal was for her  belding imagined the sooner the gales were told that dick was to marry nell the better for all concerned and especially for nell  in the general conversation that ensued he sought for an opening in which to tell this important news but he was kept so busy answering questions about his position on the border the kind of place forlorn river was the reason for so many tents etc that he was unable to find opportunity  its very interesting very interesting said mr gale  at another time i want to learn all youll tell me about the west its new to me im surprised amazed sir i may say but mr belding what i want to know most is about my son  im broken in health  ive worried myself ill over him  i dont mind telling you sir that we quarreled i laughed at his threats  he went away  and ive come to see that i didnt know richard  i was wrong to upbraid him  for a year weve known nothing of his doings and now for almost six months weve not heard from him at all  frankly mr belding i weakened first and ive come to hunt him up  my fear is that i didnt start soon enough the boy will have a great position some daygod knows perhaps soon i should not have allowed him to run over this wild country for so long  but i hoped though i hardly believed that he might find himself  now im afraid hes  mr gale paused and the white hand he raised expressively shook a little  belding was not so thickwitted where men were concerned  he saw how the matter lay between dick gale and his father  well mr gale sure most young bucks from the east go to the bad out here he said bluntly  ive been told that replied mr gale and a shade overspread his worn face  they blow their money then go punching cows take to whiskey  yes rejoined mr gale feebly nodding  then they get to gambling lose their jobs went on belding  mr gale lifted haggard eyes  then its bumming around regular tramps and to the bad generally belding spread wide his big arms and when one of them dropped round nell who sat beside him she squeezed his hand tight  sure its the regular thing he concluded cheerfully  he rather felt a little glee at mr gales distress and mrs gales crushed itoldyouso woe in no wise bothered him but the look in the big dark eyes of dicks sister was too much for belding  he choked off his characteristic oath when excited and blurted out say but dick gale never went to the bad listen  belding had scarcely started dick gales story when he perceived that never in his life had he such an absorbed and breathless audience presently they were awed and at the conclusion of that story they sat whitefaced still amazed beyond speech  dick gales advent in casita his rescue of mercedes his life as a border ranger certainly lost no picturesque or daring or even noble detail in beldings telling  he kept back nothing but the present doubt of dicks safety  dicks sister was the first of the three to recover herself  oh father she cried and there was a glorious light in her eyes deep down in my heart i knew dick was a man  mr gale rose unsteadily from his chair  his frailty was now painfully manifest  mr belding do you mean my sonrichard galehas done all that you told us he asked incredulously  i sure do replied belding with hearty good will  martha do you hear  mr gale turned to question his wife  she could not answer  her face had not yet regained its natural color  he faced that bandit and his gang alonehe fought them demanded mr gale his voice stronger  dick mopped up the floor with the whole outfit  he rescued a spanish girl went into the desert without food weapons anything but his hands  richard gale whose hands were always useless  belding nodded with a grin  hes a ranger nowriding fighting sleeping on the sand preparing his own food  well i should smile rejoined belding  he cares for his horse with his own hands  this query seemed to be the climax of mr gales strange hunger for truth  he had raised his head a little higher and his eye was brighter  mention of a horse fired beldings blood  does dick gale care for his horse  say there are not many men as well loved as that white horse of dicks  blanco sol he is mr gale thats mex for white sun  wait till you see blanco sol  bar one the whitest biggest strongest fastest grandest horse in the southwest  so he loves a horse  i shall not know my own son mr belding you say richard works for you  may i ask at what salary  he gets forty dollars board and outfit replied belding proudly  forty dollars echoed the father  by the day or week  the month of course said belding somewhat taken aback  forty dollars a month for a young man who spent five hundred in the same time when he was at college and who ran it into thousands when he got out  mr gale laughed for the first time and it was the laugh of a man who wanted to believe what he heard yet scarcely dared to do it  what does he do with so much moneymoney earned by peril toil sweat and blood  forty dollars a month  he saves it replied belding  evidently this was too much for dick gales father and he gazed at his wife in sheer speechless astonishment  dicks sister clapped her hands like a little child  belding saw that the moment was propitious  sure he saves it  dicks engaged to marry nell here  my stepdaughter nell burton  ohh dad faltered nell and she rose white as her dress  how strange it was to see dicks mother and sister rise also and turn to nell with dark proud searching eyes  belding vaguely realized some blunder he had made  nells white appealing face gave him a pang  what had he done  surely this family of dicks ought to know his relation to nell  there was a silence that positively made belding nervous  then elsie gale stepped close to nell  miss burton are you really richards betrothed  nells tremulous lips framed an affirmative but never uttered it she held out her hand showing the ring dick had given her  miss gales recognition was instant and her response was warm sweet gracious  i think i am going to be very very glad she said and kissed nell  miss burton we are learning wonderful things about richard added mr gale in an earnest though shaken voice  if you have had to do with making a man of himand now i begin to see to believe somay god bless you my dear girl i have not really looked at you richards fiancee mother we have not found him yet but i think weve found his secret  we believed him a lost son  but here is his sweetheart  it was only then that the pride and hauteur of mrs gales face broke into an expression of mingled pain and joy  she opened her arms nell uttering a strange little stifled cry flew into them  belding suddenly discovered an unaccountable blur in his sight he could not see perfectly and that was why when mrs belding entered the sittingroom he was not certain that her face was as sad and white as it seemed    xv  bound in the desert  far away from forlorn river dick gale sat stunned gazing down into the purple depths where rojas had plunged to his death  the yaqui stood motionless upon the steep red wall of lava from which he had cut the bandits hold  mercedes lay quietly where she had fallen from across the depths there came to gales ear the indians strange wild cry  then silence hollow breathless stony silence enveloped the great abyss and its upheaved lava walls  the sun was setting  every instant the haze reddened and thickened  action on the part of the yaqui loosened the spell which held gale as motionless as his surroundings  the indian was edging back toward the ledge  he did not move with his former lithe and sure freedom  he crawled slipped dragged himself rested often and went on again  he had been wounded  when at last he reached the ledge where mercedes lay gale jumped to his feet strong and thrilling spurred to meet the responsibility that now rested upon him  swiftly he turned to where thorne lay  the cavalryman was just returning to consciousness  gale ran for a canteen bathed his face made him drink  the look in thornes eyes was hard to bear  thorne  thorne  its all right its all right cried gale in piercing tones  mercedes is safe  yaqui saved her  rojas is done for  yaqui jumped down the wall and drove the bandit off the ledge cut him loose from the wall foot by foot hand by hand  weve won the fight thorne  for thorne these were marvelous strengthgiving words  the dark horror left his eyes and they began to dilate to shine  he stood up dizzily but unaided and he gazed across the crater yaqui had reached the side of mercedes was bending over her she stirred  yaqui lifted her to her feet  she appeared weak unable to stand alone  but she faced across the crater and waved her hand  she was unharmed  thorne lifted both arms above head and from his lips issued a cry  it was neither call nor holloa nor welcome nor answer  like the yaquis it could scarcely be named but it was deep husky prolonged terribly human in its intensity it made gale shudder and made his heart beat like a trip hammer mercedes again waved a white hand  the yaqui waved too and gale saw in the action an urgent signal  hastily taking up canteen and rifles gale put a supporting arm around thorne  come old man  can you walk  sure you can walk  lean on me and well soon get out of this  dont look across  look where you step weve not much time before dark  oh thorne im afraid jim has cashed in  and the last i saw of laddy he was badly hurt  gale was keyed up to a high pitch of excitement and alertness he seemed to be able to do many things  but once off the ragged notched lava into the trail he had not such difficulty with thorne and could keep his keen gaze shifting everywhere for sight of enemies  listen thorne  whats that asked gale halting as they came to a place where the trail led down through rough breaks in the lava  the silence was broken by a strange sound almost unbelieveable considering the time and place  a voice was droning turn the lady turn  turn the lady turn  alamon left  all swing turn the lady turn  hello jim called gale dragging thorne round the corner of lava where are you  oh you son of a gun i thought you were dead  oh im glad to see you  jim are you hurt  jim lash stood in the trail leaning over the butt of his rifle which evidently he was utilizing as a crutch  he was pale but smiling  his hands were bloody  a scarf had been bound tightly round his left leg just above the knee  the leg hung limp and the foot dragged  i reckon i aint injured much replied him  but my leg hurts like hell if you want to know  laddy  oh wheres laddy  hes just across the crack there  i was trying to get to him  we had it hot an heavy down here  laddy was pretty bad shot up before he tried to head rojas off the trail dick did you see the yaqui go after rojas  did i exclaimed gale grimly  the finish was all that saved me from runnin loco plumb over the rim you see i was closern you to where mercedes was hid  when rojas an his last greaser started across laddy went after them but i couldnt laddy did for rojass man then went down himself but he got up an fell got up went on an fell again  laddy kept doin that till he dropped for good  i reckon our chances are against findin him alive i tell you boys rojas was hellbent an mercedes was game i saw her shoot him  but mebbe bullets couldnt stop him then  if i didnt sweat blood when mercedes was fightin him on the cliff  then the finish  only a yaqui could have done that thorne you didnt miss it  yes i was down and out replied the cavalryman  its a shame  greatest stunt i ever seen  thorne youre standin up pretty fair  how about you  dick is he bad hurt  no hes not  a hard knock on the skull and a scalp wound replied dick  here jim let me help you over this place  step by step gale got the two injured men down the uneven declivity and then across the narrow lava bridge over the fissure  here he bade them rest while he went along the trail on that side to search for laddy gale found the ranger stretched out face downward a reddened hand clutching a gun  gale thought he was dead  upon examination however it was found that ladd still lived though he had many wounds  gale lifted him and carried him back to the others  hes alive but thats all said dick as he laid the ranger down do what you can  stop the blood  laddys tough as cactus you know ill hurry back for mercedes and yaqui  gale like a fleet surefooted mountain sheep ran along the trail when he came across the mexican rojass last ally gale had evidence of the terrible execution of the 405  he did not pause  on the first part of that descent he made faster time than had rojas  but he exercised care along the hard slippery ragged slope leading to the ledge  presently he came upon mercedes and the yaqui  she ran right into dicks arms and there her strength if not her courage broke and she grew lax  mercedes youre safe  thornes safe  its all right now  rojas she whispered  gone  to the bottom of the crater  a yaquis vengeance mercedes  he heard the girl whisper the name of the virgin  then he gathered her up in his arms  come yaqui  the indian grunted  he had one hand pressed close over a bloody place in his shoulder  gale looked keenly at him  yaqui was inscrutable as of old yet gale somehow knew that wound meant little to him  the indian followed him  without pausing moving slowly in some places very carefully in others and swiftly on the smooth part of the trail gale carried mercedes up to the rim and along to the the others jim lash worked awkwardly over ladd  thorne was trying to assist  ladd himself was conscious but he was a pallid apparently a deathstricken man  the greeting between mercedes and thorne was calmstrangely so it seemed to gale  but he was calm himself  ladd smiled at him and evidently would have spoken had he the power  yaqui then joined the group and his piercing eyes roved from one to the other lingering longest over ladd  dick im figgern hard said jim faintly  in a minute it ll be up to you an mercedes  ive about shot my bolt reckon youll do best by bringin up blanketswatersaltfirewood laddys gotone chancein a hundred  fix him upfirst  use hot salt water  if my legs brokeset it best you can  that hole in yaquionly ll bother him a day  thornes bad hurt now rustledick oldboy  lashs voice died away in a husky whisper and he quietly lay back stretching out all but the crippled leg  gale examined it assured himself the bones had not been broken and then rose ready to go down the trail  mercedes hold thornes head up in your lapso  now ill go  on the moment yaqui appeared to have completed the binding of his wounded shoulder and he started to follow gale  he paid no attention to gales order for him to stay back  but he was slow and gradually gale forged ahead  the lingering brightness of the sunset lightened the trail and the descent to the arroyo was swift and easy  some of the white horses had come in for water  blanco sol spied gale and whistled and came pounding toward him  it was twilight down in the arroyo  yaqui appeared and began collecting a bundle of mesquite sticks  gale hastily put together the things he needed and packing them all in a tarpaulin he turned to retrace his steps up the trail  darkness was setting in  the trail was narrow exceedingly steep and in some places fronted on precipices  gales burden was not very heavy but its bulk made it unwieldy and it was always overbalancing him or knocking against the wall side of the trail gale found it necessary to wait for yaqui to take the lead  the indians eyes must have seen as well at night as by day  gale toiled upward shouldering swinging dragging the big pack and though the ascent of the slope was not really long it seemed endless  at last they reached a level and were soon on the spot with mercedes and the injured men  gale then set to work  yaquis part was to keep the fire blazing and the water hot mercedess to help gale in what way she could gale found ladd had many wounds yet not one of them was directly in a vital place  evidently the ranger had almost bled to death he remained unconscious through gales operations  according to jim lash ladd had one chance in a hundred but gale considered it one in a thousand having done all that was possible for the ranger gale slipped blankets under and around him and then turned his attention to lash  jim came out of his stupor  a mushrooming bullet had torn a great hole in his leg  gale upon examination could not be sure the bones had been missed but there was no bad break  the application of hot salt water made jim groan  when he had been bandaged and laid beside ladd gale went on to the cavalryman thorne was very weak and scarcely conscious  a furrow had been plowed through his scalp down to the bone  when it had been dressed mercedes collapsed  gale laid her with the three in a row and covered them with blankets and the tarpaulin  then yaqui submitted to examination  a bullet had gone through the indians shoulder  to gale it appeared serious  yaqui said it was a flea bite  but he allowed gale to bandage it and obeyed when he was told to lie quiet in his blanket beside the fire  gale stood guard  he seemed still calm and wondered at what he considered a strange absence of poignant feeling  if he had felt weariness it was now gone  he coaxed the fire with as little wood as would keep it burning he sat beside it he walked to and fro close by sometimes he stood over the five sleepers wondering if two of them at least would ever awaken  time had passed swiftly but as the necessity for immediate action had gone by the hours gradually assumed something of their normal length the night wore on  the air grew colder the stars brighter the sky bluer and if such could be possible the silence more intense  the fire burned out and for lack of wood could not be rekindled  gale patrolled his short beat becoming colder and damper as dawn approached  the darkness grew so dense that he could not see the pale faces of the sleepers  he dreaded the gray dawn and the light  slowly the heavy black belt close to the lava changed to a pale gloom then to gray and after that morning came quickly  the hour had come for dick gale to face his great problem  it was natural that he hung back a little at first natural that when he went forward to look at the quiet sleepers he did so with a grim and stern force urging him  yaqui stirred roused yawned got up and though he did not smile at gale a light shone swiftly across his dark face his shoulder drooped and appeared stiff otherwise he was himself mercedes lay in deep slumber  thorne had a high fever and was beginning to show signs of restlessness  ladd seemed just barely alive  jim lash slept as if he was not much the worse for his wound  gale rose from his examination with a sharp breaking of his cold mood while there was life in thorne and ladd there was hope for them  then he faced his problem and his decision was instant  he awoke mercedes  how wondering wistful beautiful was that first opening flash of her eyes  then the dark troubled thought came swiftly she sat up  mercedescome  are you all right  laddy is alive thornes notnot so bad  but weve got a job on our hands  you must help me  she bent over thorne and laid her hands on his hot face  then she rosea woman such as he had imagined she might be in an hour of trial  gale took up ladd as carefully and gently as possible  mercedes bring what you can carry and follow me he said  then motioning for yaqui to remain there he turned down the slope with ladd in his arms  neither pausing nor making a misstep nor conscious of great effort gale carried the wounded man down into the arroyo  mercedes kept at his heels light supple lithe as a panther  he left her with ladd and went back  when he had started off with thorne in his arms he felt the tax on his strength  surely and swiftly however he bore the cavalryman down the trail to lay him beside ladd  again he started back and when he began to mount the steep lava steps he was hot wet breathing hard  as he reached the scene of that nights camp a voice greeted him  jim lash was sitting up  hello dick  i woke some late this mornin  wheres laddy  dick you aint agoin to say  laddys alivethats about all replied dick  wheres thorne an mercedes  look here man  i reckon you aint packin this crippled outfit down that awful trail  had to jim  an hours sunwould killboth laddy and thorne come on now  for once jim lashs cool good nature and careless indifference gave precedence to amaze and concern  always knew you was a husky chap  but dick youre no hoss get me a crutch an give me a lift on one side  come on replied gale  ive no time to monkey  he lifted the ranger called to yaqui to follow with some of the camp outfit and once more essayed the steep descent  jim lash was the heaviest man of the three and gales strength was put to enormous strain to carry him on that broken trail nevertheless gale went down down walking swiftly and surely over the bad places and at last he staggered into the arroyo with bursting heart and redblinded eyes when he had recovered he made a final trip up the slope for the camp effects which yaqui had been unable to carry  then he drew jim and mercedes and yaqui also into an earnest discussion of ways and means whereby to fight for the life of thorne ladds case gale now considered hopeless though he meant to fight for him too as long as he breathed  in the labor of watching and nursing it seemed to gale that two days and two nights slipped by like a few hours  during that time the indian recovered from his injury and became capable of performing all except heavy tasks  then gale succumbed to weariness  after his muchneeded rest he relieved mercedes of the care and watch over thorne which up to that time she had absolutely refused to relinquish  the cavalryman had high fever and gale feared he had developed blood poisoning  he required constant attention  his condition slowly grew worse and there came a day which gale thought surely was the end  but that day passed and the night and the next day and thorne lived on ghastly stricken raving  mercedes hung over him with jealous passionate care and did all that could have been humanly done for a man  she grew wan absorbed silent  but suddenly and to gales amaze and thanksgiving there came an abatement of thornes fever with it some of the heat and redness of the inflamed wound disappeared next morning he was conscious and gale grasped some of the hope that mercedes had never abandoned  he forced her to rest while he attended to thorne  that day he saw that the crisis was past  recovery for thorne was now possible and would perhaps depend entirely upon the care he received  jim lashs wound healed without any aggravating symptoms  it would be only a matter of time until he had the use of his leg again  all these days however there was little apparent change in ladds condition unless it was that he seemed to fade away as he lingered at first his wounds remained open they bled a little all the time outwardly perhaps internally also the blood did not seem to clot and so the bullet holes did not close  then yaqui asked for the care of ladd gale yielded it with opposing thoughtsthat ladd would waste slowly away till life ceased and that there never was any telling what might lie in the power of this strange indian yaqui absented himself from camp for a while and when he returned he carried the roots and leaves of desert plants unknown to gale from these the indian brewed an ointment  then he stripped the bandages from ladd and applied the mixture to his wounds  that done he let him lie with the wounds exposed to the air at night covering him  next day he again exposed the wounds to the warm dry air  slowly they closed and ladd ceased to bleed externally  days passed and grew into what gale imagined must have been weeks yaqui recovered fully  jim lash began to move about on a crutch he shared the indians watch over ladd  thorne lay haggard emaciated ghost of his rugged self but with life in the eyes that turned always toward mercedes  ladd lingered and lingered  the life seemingly would not leave his bulletpierced body  he faded withered shrunk till he was almost a skeleton  he knew those who worked and watched over him but he had no power of speech  his eyes and eyelids moved the rest of him seemed stone  all those days nothing except water was given him it was marvelous how tenaciously however feebly he clung to life gale imagined it was the yaquis spirit that held back death  that tireless implacable inscrutable savage was ever at the rangers side his great somber eyes burned  at length he went to gale and with that strange light flitting across the hard bronzed face he said ladd would live   the second day after ladd had been given such thin nourishment as he could swallow he recovered the use of his tongue  shorethisshell he whispered  that was a characteristic speech for the ranger gale thought and indeed it made all who heard it smile while their eyes were wet  from that time forward ladd gained but he gained so immeasurably slowly that only the eyes of hope could have seen any improvement jim lash threw away his crutch and thorne was well if still somewhat weak before ladd could lift his arm or turn his head  a kind of long immovable gloom passed like a shadow from his face  his whispers grew stronger  and the day arrived when gale who was perhaps the least optimistic threw doubt to the winds and knew the ranger would get well  for gale that joyous moment of realization was one in which he seemed to return to a former self long absent he experienced an elevation of soul  he was suddenly overwhelmed with gratefulness humility awe  a gloomy black terror had passed by  he wanted to thank the faithful mercedes and thorne for getting well and the cheerful lash and ladd himself and that strange and wonderful yaqui now such a splendid figure  he thought of home and nell  the terrible encompassing red slopes lost something of their fearsomeness and there was a good spirit hovering near   boys come round called ladd in his low voice  an you mercedes an call the yaqui  ladd lay in the shade of the brush shelter that had been erected  his head was raised slightly on a pillow  there seemed little of him but long lean lines and if it had not been for his keen thoughtful kindly eyes his face would have resembled a death mask of a man starved  shore i want to know what day is it an what month asked ladd  nobody could answer him  the question seemed a surprise to gale and evidently was so to the others  look at that cactus went on ladd  near the wall of lava a stunted saguaro lifted its head  a few shriveled blossoms that had once been white hung along the fluted column  i reckon according to that giant cactus its somewheres along the end of march said jim lash soberly  shore its april  look where the sun is  an cant you feel its gettin hot  supposin it is april queried lash slowly  well what im drivin at is its about time you all was hittin the trail back to forlorn river before the waterholes dry out  laddy i reckon well start soon as youre able to be put on a hoss  shore that ll be too late  a silence ensued in which those who heard ladd gazed fixedly at him and then at one another  lash uneasily shifted the position of his lame leg and gale saw him moisten his lips with his tongue  charlie ladd i aint reckonin you mean were to ride off an leave you here  what else is there to do  the hot weathers close  pretty soon most of the waterholes will be dry  you cant travel then im on my back here an god only knows when i could be packed out not for weeks mebbe  ill never be any good again even if i was to get out alive you see shore this sort of case comes round sometimes in the desert  its common enough  ive heard of several cases where men had to go an leave a feller behind  its reasonable if youre fightin the desert you cant afford to be sentimental now as i said im all in  so whats the sense of you waitin here when it means the old desert story  by goin now mebbe youll get home if you wait on a chance of takin me youll be too late  pretty soon this lava ll be one roastin hell  shore now boys youll see this the right way jim old pard  no laddy an i cant figger how you could ever ask me  shore then leave me here with yaqui an a couple of the hosses we can eat sheep meat  an if the water holds out  no interrupted lash violently  ladds eyes sought gales face  son you aint bullheaded like jim  youll see the sense of it theres nell awaitin back at forlorn river  think what it means to her  shes a damn fine girl dick an what right have you to break her heart for an old wornout cowpuncher  think how shes watchin for you with that sweet face all sad an troubled an her eyes turnin black  youll go son wont you  dick shook his head  the ranger turned his gaze upon thorne and now the keen glistening light in his gray eyes had blurred  thorne its different with you  jims a fool an young gale has been punctured by choya thorns  hes got the desert poison in his blood  but you nowyouve no call to stickyou can find that trail out  its easy to follow made by so many shod hosses  take your wife an go shore youll go thorne  deliberately and without an instants hesitation the cavalryman replied no  ladd then directed his appeal to mercedes  his face was now convulsed and his voice though it had sunk to a whisper was clear and beautiful with some rich quality that gale had never heard in it  mercedes youre a woman  youre the woman we fought for  an some of us are shore goin to die for you  dont make it all for nothin let us feel we saved the woman  shore you can make thorne go  hell have to go if you say  theyll all have to go  think of the years of love an happiness in store for you  a week or so an it ll be too late  can you stand for me seein you let me tell you mercedes when the summer heat hits the lava well all wither an curl up like shavins near a fire  a wind of hell will blow up this slope  look at them mesquites  see the twist in them  thats the torture of heat an thirst  do you want me or all us men seein you like that mercedes dont make it all for nothin  say youll persuade thorne if not the others  for all the effect his appeal had to move her mercedes might have possessed a heart as hard and fixed as the surrounding lava  never  whitefaced with great black eyes flashing the spanish girl spoke the word that bound her and her companions in the desert  the subject was never mentioned again  gale thought that he read a sinister purpose in ladds mind  to his astonishment lash came to him with the same fancy  after that they made certain there never was a gun within reach of ladds clutching clawlike hands  gradually a somber spell lifted from the rangers mind  when he was entirely free of it he began to gather strength daily  then it was as if he had never known patiencehe who had shown so well how to wait he was in a frenzy to get well  he appetite could not be satisfied  the sun climbed higher whiter hotter  at midday a wind from gulfward roared up the arroyo and now only palos verdes and the few saguaros were green  every day the water in the lava hole sank an inch  the yaqui alone spent the waiting time in activity  he made trips up on the lava slope and each time he returned with guns or boots or sombreros or something belonging to the bandits that had fallen  he never fetched in a saddle or bridle and from that the rangers concluded rojass horses had long before taken their back trail  what speculation what consternation those saddled horses would cause if they returned to forlorn river  as ladd improved there was one story he had to hear every day  it was the one relating to what he had missedthe sight of rojas pursued and plunged to his doom  the thing had a morbid fascination for the sick ranger  he reveled in it  he tortured mercedes his gentleness and consideration heretofore so marked were in abeyance to some sinister ghastly joy  but to humor him mercedes racked her soul with the sensations she had suffered when rojas hounded her out on the ledge when she shot him when she sprang to throw herself over the precipice when she fought him when with halfblinded eyes she looked up to see the merciless yaqui reaching for the bandit  ladd fed his cruel longing with thornes poignant recollections with the keen clear nevertobeforgotten shocks to gales eye and ear  jim lash for one at least never tired of telling how he had seen and heard the tragedy and every time in the telling it gathered some more tragic and gruesome detail  jim believed in satiating the ranger  then in the twilight when the campfire burned ladd would try to get the yaqui to tell his side of the story  but this the indian would never do  there was only the expression of his fathomless eyes and the set passion of his massive face  those waiting days grew into weeks  ladd gained very slowly nevertheless at last he could walk about and soon he averred that strapped to a horse he could last out the trip to forlorn river  there was rejoicing in camp and plans were eagerly suggested the yaqui happened to be absent  when he returned the rangers told him they were now ready to undertake the journey back across lava and cactus  yaqui shook his head  they declared again their intention  no replied the indian and his deep sonorous voice rolled out upon the quiet of the arroyo  he spoke briefly then  they had waited too long  the smaller waterholes back in the trail were dry  the hot summer was upon them  there could be only death waiting down in the burning valley  here was water and grass and wood and shade from the suns rays and sheep to be killed on the peaks  the water would hold unless the season was that dreaded ano seco of the mexicans  wait for rain concluded yaqui and now as never before he spoke as one with authority  if no rain  silently he lifted his hand    xvi  mountain sheep  what gale might have thought an appalling situation if considered from a safe and comfortable home away from the desert became now that he was shut in by the redribbed lava walls and great dry wastes a matter calmly accepted as inevitable  so he imagined it was accepted by the others  not even mercedes uttered a regret no word was spoken of home  if there was thought of loved one it was locked deep in their minds  in mercedes there was no change in womanly quality perhaps because all she had to love was there in the desert with her  gale had often pondered over this singular change in character he had trained himself in order to fight a paralyzing something in the deserts influence to oppose with memory and thought an insidious primitive retrogression to what was scarcely consciousness at all merely a savages instinct of sight and sound  he felt the need now of redoubled effort  for there was a sheer happiness in drifting  not only was it easy to forget it was hard to remember his idea was that a man laboring under a great wrong a great crime a great passion might find the lonely desert a fitting place for either remembrance or oblivion according to the nature of his soul but an ordinary healthy reasonably happy mortal who loved the open with its blaze of sun and sweep of wind would have a task to keep from going backward to the natural man as he was before civilization  by tacit agreement ladd again became the leader of the party ladd was a man who would have taken all the responsibility whether or not it was given him  in moments of hazard of uncertainty lash and gale even belding unconsciously looked to the ranger  he had that kind of power  the first thing ladd asked was to have the store of food that remained spread out upon a tarpaulin  assuredly it was a slender enough supply  the ranger stood for long moments gazing down at it  he was groping among past experiences calling back from his years of life on range and desert that which might be valuable for the present issue it was impossible to read the gravity of ladds face for he still looked like a dead man but the slow shake of his head told gale much there was a grain of hope however in the significance with which he touched the bags of salt and said shore it was sense packin all that salt  then he turned to face his comrades  thats little grub for six starvin people corralled in the desert but the grub end aint worryin me  yaqui can get sheep up the slopes water  thats the beginnin and middle an end of our case  laddy i reckon the waterhole here never goes dry replied jim  ask the indian  upon being questioned yaqui repeated what he had said about the dreaded ano seco of the mexicans  in a dry year this waterhole failed  dick take a rope an see how much waters in the hole  gale could not find bottom with a thirty foot lasso  the water was as cool clear sweet as if it had been kept in a shaded iron receptacle  ladd welcomed this information with surprise and gladness  lets see  last year was shore pretty dry  mebbe this summer wont be  mebbe our wonderful good luckll hold  ask yaqui if he thinks it ll rain  mercedes questioned the indian  he says no man can tell surely  but he thinks the rain will come she replied  shore it ll rain you can gamble on that now continued ladd if theres only grass for the hosses  we cant get out of here without hosses  dick take the indian an scout down the arroyo today i seen the hosses were gettin fat  gettin fat in this desert  but mebbe theyve about grazed up all the grass  go an see dick  an may you come back with more good news  gale upon the few occasions when he had wandered down the arroyo had never gone far  the yaqui said there was grass for the horses and until now no one had given the question more consideration gale found that the arroyo widened as it opened  near the head where it was narrow the grass lined the course of the dry stream bed  but farther down this stream bed spread out  there was every indication that at flood seasons the water covered the floor of the arroyo  the farther gale went the thicker and larger grew the gnarled mesquites and palo verdes the more cactus and greasewood there were and other desert growths  patches of gray grass grew everywhere  gale began to wonder where the horses were  finally the trees and brush thinned out and a milewide gray plain stretched down to reddish sand dunes  over to one side were the white horses and even as gale saw them both blanco diablo and sol lifted their heads and with white manes tossing in the wind whistled clarion calls  here was grass enough for many horses the arroyo was indeed an oasis  ladd and the others were awaiting gales report and they received it with calmness yet with a joy no less evident because it was restrained  gale in his keen observation at the moment found that he and his comrades turned with glad eyes to the woman of the party  senor laddy you thinkyou believewe shall she faltered and her voice failed  it was the woman in her weakening in the light of real hope of the happiness now possible beyond that desert barrier  mercedes no white man can tell whatll come to pass out here said ladd earnestly  shore i have hopes now i never dreamed of i was pretty near a dead man  the indian saved me  queer notions have come into my head about yaqui  i dont understand them  he seems when you look at him only a squalid sullen vengeful savage but lord thats far from the truth  mebbe yaquis different from most indians  he looks the same though  mebbe the trouble is we white folks never knew the indian  anyway beldin had it right yaquis our godsend  now as to the future id like to know mebbe as well as you if were ever to get home  only bein what i am i say quien sabe  but somethin tells me yaqui knows  ask him mercedes  make him tell  well all be the better for knowin wed be stronger for havin moren our faith in him  hes silent indian but make him tell  mercedes called to yaqui  at her bidding there was always a suggestion of hurry which otherwise was never manifest in his actions  she put a hand on his bared muscular arm and began to speak in spanish her voice was low swift full of deep emotion sweet as the sound of a bell  it thrilled gale though he understood scarcely a word she said  he did not need translation to know that here spoke the longing of a woman for life love home the heritage of a womans heart  gale doubted his own divining impression  it was that the yaqui understood this womans longing  in gales sight the indians stoicism his inscrutability the lavalike hardness of his face although they did not change seemed to give forth light gentleness loyalty  for an instant gale seemed to have a vision but it did not last and he failed to hold some beautiful illusive thing  si rolled out the indians reply full of power and depth  mercedes drew a long breath and her hand sought thornes  he says yes she whispered  he answers hell save us hell take us all backhe knows  the indian turned away to his tasks and the silence that held the little group was finally broken by ladd  shore i said so  now all weve got to do is use sense  friends im the commissary department of this outfit an what i say goes you all wont eat except when i tell you  mebbe itll not be so hard to keep our health  starved beggars dont get sick  but theres the heat comin an we can all go loco you know  to pass the time  lord thats our problem  now if you all only had a hankerin for checkers shore ill make a board an make you play  thorne youre the luckiest  youve got your girl an this can be a honeymoon  now with a few tools an little material see what a grand house you can build for your wife  dick youre lucky too  you like to hunt an up there youll find the finest bighorn huntin in the west  take yaqui and the 405  we need the meat but while youre gettin it have your sport  the same chance will never come again  i wish we all was able to go  but crippled men cant climb the lava  shore youll see some country from the peaks  theres no wilder place on earth except the poles an when youre older you an nell with a couple of fine boys think what itll be to tell them about bein lost in the lava an huntin sheep with a yaqui  shore ive hit it  you can take yours out in huntin an thinkin  now if i had a girl like nell id never go crazy  thats your game dick  hunt an think of nell an how youll tell those fine boys about it all an about the old cowman you knowed laddy wholl by then be long past the divide  rustle now son  get some enthusiasm  for shore youll need it for yourself an us  gale climbed the lava slope away round to the right of the arroyo along an old trail that yaqui said the papagos had made before his own people had hunted there  part way it led through spiked crested upheaved lava that would have been almost impassable even without its silver coating of choya cactus  there were benches and ledges and ridges bare and glistening in the sun  from the crests of these yaquis searching falcon gaze roved near and far for signs of sheep and gale used his glass on the reaches of lava that slanted steeply upward to the corrugated peaks and down over endless heave and roll and redwaved slopes  the heat smoked up from the lava and this with the red color and the shiny choyas gave the impression of a world of smoldering fire  farther along the slope yaqui halted and crawled behind projections to a point commanding a view over an extraordinary section of country the peaks were off to the left  in the foreground were gullies ridges and canyons arroyos all glistening with choyas and some other and more numerous white bushes and here and there towered a green cactus  this region was only a splintered and more devastated part of the volcanic slope but it was miles in extent yaqui peeped over the top of a blunt block of lava and searched the sharpbillowed wilderness  suddenly he grasped gale and pointed across a deep wide gully  with the aid of his glass gale saw five sheep  they were much larger than he had expected dull brown in color and two of them were rams with great curved horns  they were looking in his direction remembering what he had heard about the wonderful eyesight of these mountain animals gale could only conclude that they had seen the hunters  then yaquis movements attracted and interested him  the indian had brought with him a red scarf and a mesquite branch  he tied the scarf to the stick and propped this up in a crack of the lava the scarf waved in the wind  that done the indian bade gale watch  once again he leveled the glass at the sheep  all five were motionless standing like statues heads pointed across the gully they were more than a mile distant  when gale looked without his glass they merged into the roughness of the lava  he was intensely interested did the sheep see the red scarf  it seemed incredible but nothing else could account for that statuesque alertness  the sheep held this rigid position for perhaps fifteen minutes  then the leading ram started to approach  the others followed  he took a few steps then halted  always he held his head up nose pointed  by george theyre coming exclaimed gale  they see that flag theyre hunting us  theyre curious  if this doesnt beat me  evidently the indian understood for he grunted  gale found difficulty in curbing his impatience  the approach of the sheep was slow  the advances of the leader and the intervals of watching had a singular regularity  he worked like a machine gale followed him down the opposite wall around holes across gullies over ridges  then gale shifted the glass back to find the others  they were coming also with exactly the same pace and pause of their leader what steppers they were  how surefooted  what leaps they made  it was thrilling to watch them gale forgot he had a rifle  the yaqui pressed a heavy hand down upon his shoulder  he was to keep well hidden and to be quiet gale suddenly conceived the idea that the sheep might come clear across to investigate the puzzling red thing fluttering in the breeze  strange indeed would that be for the wildest creatures in the world  the big ram led on with the same regular persistence and in half an hours time he was in the bottom of the great gulf and soon he was facing up the slope  gale knew then that the alluring scarf had fascinated him  it was no longer necessary now for gale to use his glass  there was a short period when an intervening crest of lava hid the sheep from view  after that the two rams and their smaller followers were plainly in sight for perhaps a quarter of an hour then they disappeared behind another ridge  gale kept watching sure they would come out farther on  a tense period of waiting passed then a suddenly electrifying pressure of yaquis hand made gale tremble with excitement  very cautiously he shifted his position  there not fifty feet distant upon a high mound of lava stood the leader of the sheep his size astounded gale  he seemed all horns  but only for a moment did the impression of horns overbalancing body remain with gale  the sheep was graceful sinewy slender powerfully built and in poise magnificent as gale watched spellbound the second ram leaped lightly upon the mound and presently the three others did likewise  then indeed gale feasted his eyes with a spectacle for a hunter it came to him suddenly that there had been something he expected to see in this rocky mountain bighorn and it was lacking  they were beautiful as wonderful as even ladds encomiums had led him to suppose  he thought perhaps it was the contrast these soft sleek shortfurred graceful animals afforded to what he imagined the barren terrible lava mountains might develop  the splendid leader stepped closer his round protruding amber eyes which gale could now plainly see intent upon that fatal red flag like automatons the other four crowded into his tracks a few little slow steps then the leader halted  at this instant gales absorbed attention was directed by yaqui to the rifle and so to the purpose of the climb  a little cold shock affronted gales vivid pleasure  with it dawned a realization of what he had imagined was lacking in these animals  they did not look wild the socalled wildest of wild creatures appeared tamer than sheep he had followed on a farm  it would be little less than murder to kill them  gale regretted the need of slaughter nevertheless he could not resist the desire to show himself and see how tame they really were  he reached for the 405 and as he threw a shell into the chamber the slight metallic click made the sheep jump  then gale rose quickly to his feet  the noble ram and his band simply stared at gale  they had never seen a man  they showed not the slightest indication of instinctive fear curiosity surprise even friendliness seemed to mark their attitude of attention  gale imagined that they were going to step still closer he did not choose to wait to see if this were true  certainly it already took a grim resolution to raise the heavy 405  his shot killed the big leader  the others bounded away with remarkable nimbleness  gale used up the remaining four shells to drop the second ram and by the time he had reloaded the others were out of range   the yaquis method of hunting was sure and deadly and saving of energy but gale never would try it again  he chose to stalk the game  this entailed a great expenditure of strength the eyes and lungs of a mountaineer and as gale put it to ladd the need of sevenleague boots  after being hunted a few times and shot at the sheep became exceedingly difficult to approach  gale learned to know that their fame as the keenesteyed of all animals was well founded  if he worked directly toward a flock crawling over the sharp lava always a sentinel ram espied him before he got within range  the only method of attack that he found successful was to locate sheep with his glass work round to windward of them and then getting behind a ridge or buttress crawl like a lizard to a vantage point  he failed often the stalk called forth all that was in him of endurance cunning speed as the days grew hotter he hunted in the early morning hours and a while before the sun went down  more than one night he lay out on the lava with the great stars close overhead and the immense void all beneath him  this pursuit he learned to love upon those scarred and blasted slopes the wild spirit that was in him had free rein  and like a shadow the faithful yaqui tried ever to keep at his heels  one morning the rising sun greeted him as he surmounted the higher cone of the volcano  he saw the vastness of the east aglow with a glazed rosy whiteness like the changing hue of an ember  at this height there was a sweeping wind still cool  the western slopes of lava lay dark and all that world of sand and gulf and mountain barrier beyond was shrouded in the mystic cloud of distance  gale had assimilated much of the loneliness and the sense of ownership and the love of lofty heights that might well belong to the great condor of the peak  like this widewinged bird he had an unparalleled range of vision  the very corners whence came the winds seemed pierced by gales eyes  yaqui spied a flock of sheep far under the curved broken rim of the main crater  then began the stalk  gale had taught the yaqui somethingthat speed might win as well as patient cunning  keeping out of sight gale ran over the spikecrusted lava leaving the indian far behind  his feet were magnets attracting supporting holds and he passed over them too fast to fall  the wind the keen air of the heights the red lava the boundless surrounding blue all seemed to have something to do with his wildness  then hiding slipping creeping crawling he closed in upon his quarry until the long rifle grew like stone in his grip and the whipping spang ripped the silence and the strange echo boomed deep in the crater and rolled around as if in hollow mockery at the hopelessness of escape  gales exultant yell was given as much to free himself of some bursting joy of action as it was to call the slower yaqui then he liked the strange echoes  it was a maddening whirl of sound that bored deeper and deeper along the whorled and caverned walls of the crater  it was as if these aged walls resented the violating of their silent sanctity gale felt himself a man a thing alive something superior to all this savage dead upflung world of iron a master even of all this grandeur and sublimity because he had a soul  he waited beside his quarry and breathed deep and swept the long slopes with searching eyes of habit  when yaqui came up they set about the hardest task of all to pack the best of that heavy sheep down miles of steep ragged choyacovered lava  but even in this gale rejoiced  the heat was nothing the millions of little pits which could hold and twist a foot were nothing the bladeedged crusts and the deep fissures and the choked canyons and the tangled dwarfed mesquites all these were as nothing but obstacles to be cheerfully overcome  only the choya hindered dick gale  when his heavy burden pulled him out of surefootedness and he plunged into a choya or when the strange deceitful uncanny almost invisible frosty thorns caught and pierced him then there was call for all of fortitude and endurance  for this cactus had a malignant power of torture  its pain was a stinging blinding burning sickening poison in the blood  if thorns pierced his legs he felt the pain all over his body if his hands rose from a fall full of the barbed joints he was helpless and quivering till yaqui tore them out  but this one peril dreaded more than dizzy height of precipice or sunblindness on the glistening peak did not daunt gale  his teacher was the yaqui and always before him was an example that made him despair of a white mans equality  color race blood breedingwhat were these in the wilderness  verily dick gale had come to learn the use of his hands  so in a descent of hours he toiled down the lava slope to stalk into the arroyo like a burdened giant wringing wet panting cleareyed and darkfaced his ragged clothes and boots white with choya thorns  the gaunt ladd rose from his shaded seat and removed his pipe from smiling lips and turned to nod at jim and then looked back again  the torrid summer heat came imperceptibly or it could never have been borne by white men  it changed the lives of the fugitives making them partly nocturnal in habit  the nights had the balmy coolness of spring and would have been delightful for sleep but that would have made the blazing days unendurable  the sun rose in a vast white flame  with it came the blasting withering wind from the gulf  a red haze like that of earlier sunsets seemed to come sweeping on the wind and it roared up the arroyo and went bellowing into the crater and rushed on in fury to lash the peaks  during these hot windy hours the desertbound party slept in deep recesses in the lava and if necessity brought them forth they could not remain out long  the sand burned through boots and a touch of bare hand on lava raised a blister  a short while before sundown the yaqui went forth to build a campfire and soon the others came out heatdazed half blinded with parching throats to allay and hunger that was never satisfied  a little action and a cooling of the air revived them and when night set in they were comfortable round the campfire  as ladd had said one of their greatest problems was the passing of time  the nights were interminably long but they had to be passed in work or play or dreamanything except sleep  that was ladds most inflexible command  he gave no reason  but not improbably the ranger thought that the terrific heat of the day spend in slumber lessened a wear and strain if not a real danger of madness  accordingly at first the occupations of this little group were many and various  they worked if they had something to do or could invent a pretext  they told and retold stories until all were wearisome they sang songs  mercedes taught spanish  they played every game they knew  they invented others that were so trivial children would scarcely have been interested and these they played seriously  in a word with intelligence and passion with all that was civilized and human they fought the everinfringing loneliness the savage solitude of their environment  but they had only finite minds  it was not in reason to expect a complete victory against this mighty nature this bounding horizon of death and desolation and decay  gradually they fell back upon fewer and fewer occupations until the time came when the silence was hard to break  gale believed himself the keenest of the party the one who thought most and he watched the effect of the desert upon his companions he imagined that he saw ladd grow old sitting round the campfire certain it was that the rangers gray hair had turned white  what had been at times hard and cold and grim about him had strangely vanished in sweet temper and a vacantmindedness that held him longer as the days passed for hours it seemed ladd would bend over his checkerboard and never make a move  it mattered not now whether or not he had a partner  he was always glad of being spoken to as if he were called back from vague region of mind jim lash the calmest coolest most nonchalant besthumored westerner gale had ever met had by slow degrees lost that cheerful character which would have been of such infinite good to his companions and always he sat brooding silently brooding  jim had no ties few memories and the desert was claiming him  thorne and mercedes however were living wonderful proof that spirit mind and heart were freefree to soar in scorn of the colossal barrenness and silence and space of that terrible hedging prison of lava  they were young they loved they were together and the oasis was almost a paradise gale believe he helped himself by watching them imagination had never pictured real happiness to him  thorne and mercedes had forgotten the outside world  if they had been existing on the burnedout desolate moon they could hardly have been in a harsher grimmer lonelier spot than this redwalled arroyo  but it might have been a statelier eden than that of the primitive day  mercedes grew thinner until she was a slender shadow of her former self  she became hard brown as the rangers lithe and quick as a panther  she seemed to live on water and the airperhaps indeed on love  for of the scant fare the best of which was continually urged upon her she partook but little  she reminded gale of a wild brown creature free as the wind on the lava slopes  yet despite the great change her beauty remained undiminished  her eyes seeming so much larger now in her small face were great black starry gulfs  she was the life of that camp  her smiles her rapid speech her low laughter her quick movements her playful moods with the rangers the dark and passionate glance which rested so often on her lover the whispers in the dusk as hand in hand they paced the campfire beatthese helped gale to retain his loosening hold on reality to resist the lure of a strange beckoning life where a man stood free in the golden open where emotion was not nor trouble nor sickness nor anything but the savages rest and sleep and action and dream  although the yaqui was as his shadow gale reached a point when he seemed to wander alone at twilight in the night at dawn  far down the arroyo in the deepening red twilight when the heat rolled away on slowdying wind blanco sol raised his splendid head and whistled for his master  gale reproached himself for neglect of the noble horse blanco sol was always the same  he loved four thingshis master a long drink of cool water to graze at will and to run  time and place gale thought meant little to sol if he could have those four things  gale put his arm over the great arched neck and laid his cheek against the long white mane and then even as he stood there forgot the horse  what was the dull redtinged horizonwide mantle creeping up the slope through it the copper sun glowed paled died  was it only twilight was it gloom  if he thought about it he had a feeling that it was the herald of night and the night must be a vigil and that made him tremble  at night he had formed a habit of climbing up the lava slope as far as the smooth trail extended and there on a promontory he paced to and fro and watched the stars and sat stonestill for hours looking down at the vast void with its moving changing shadows  from that promontory he gazed up at a velvetblue sky deep and dark bright with millions of cold distant blinking stars and he grasped a little of the meaning of infinitude  he gazed down into the shadows which black as they were and impenetrable yet have a conception of immeasurable space  then the silence  he was dumb he was awed he bowed his head he trembled he marveled at the desert silence  it was the one thing always present  even when the wind roared there seemed to be silence but at night in this lava world of ashes and canker he waited for this terrible strangeness of nature to come to him with the secret  he seemed at once a little child and a strong man and something very old what tortured him was the incomprehensibility that the vaster the space the greater the silence  at one moment gale felt there was only death here and that was the secret at another he heard the slow beat of a mighty heart  he came at length to realize that the desert was a teacher  he did not realize all that he had learned but he was a different man  and when he decided upon that he was not thinking of the slow sure call to the primal instincts of man he was thinking that the desert as much as he had experienced and no more would absolutely overturn the whole scale of a mans values break old habits form new ones remake him more of desert experience gale believe would be too much for intellect the desert did not breed civilized man and that made gale ponder over a strange thought after all was the civilized man inferior to the savage  yaqui was the answer to that  when gale acknowledged this he always remembered his present strange manner of thought  the past the old order of mind seemed as remote as this desert world was from the haunts of civilized men  a man must know a savage as gale knew yaqui before he could speak authoritatively and then something stilled his tongue  in the first stage of gales observation of yaqui he had marked tenaciousness of life stoicism endurance strength  these were the attributes of the desert  but what of that second stage wherein the indian had loomed up a colossal figure of strange honor loyalty love  gale doubted his convictions and scorned himself for doubting  there in the gloom sat the silent impassive inscrutable yaqui his dark face his dark eyes were plain in the light of the stars always he was near gale unobtrusive shadowy but there  why gale absolutely could not doubt that the indian had heart as well as mind yaqui had from the very first stood between gale and accident toil peril  it was his own choosing  gale could not change him or thwart him  he understood the indians idea of obligation and sacred duty but there was more and that baffled gale  in the night hours alone on the slope gale felt in yaqui as he felt the mighty throb of that desert pulse a something that drew him irresistibly to the indian sometimes he looked around to find the indian to dispel these strange pressing thoughts of unreality and it was never in vain  thus the nights passed endlessly long with gale fighting for his old order of thought fighting the fascination of the infinite sky and the gloomy insulating whirl of the wide shadows fighting for belief hope prayer fighting against that terrible everrecurring idea of being lost lost lost in the desert fighting harder than any other thing the insidious penetrating tranquil unfeeling self that was coming between him and his memory  he was losing the battle losing his hold on tangible things losing his power to stand up under this ponderous merciless weight of desert space and silence  he acknowledged it in a kind of despair and the shadows of the night seemed whirling fiends  lost  lost  lost  what are you waiting for rain  lost  lost  lost in the desert  so the shadows seemed to scream in voiceless mockery  at the moment he was alone on the promontory  the night was far spent a ghastly moon haunted the black volcanic spurs  the winds blew silently  was he alone  no he did not seem to be alone the yaqui was there  suddenly a strange cold sensation crept over gale  it was new  he felt a presence  turning he expected to see the indian but instead a slight shadow pale almost white stood there not close nor yet distant  it seemed to brighten then he saw a woman who resembled a girl he had seemed to know long ago  she was whitefaced goldenhaired and her lips were sweet and her eyes were turning black  nell  he had forgotten her over him flooded a torrent of memory  there was tragic woe in this sweet face  nell was holding out her armsshe was crying aloud to him across the sand and the cactus and the lava  she was in trouble and he had been forgetting  that night he climbed the lava to the topmost cone and never slipped on a ragged crust nor touched a choya thorn  a voice called to him he saw nells eyes in the stars in the velvet blue of sky in the blackness of the engulfing shadows she was with him a slender shape a spirit keeping step with him and memory was strong sweet beating beautiful far down in the west faintly golden with light of the sinking moon he saw a cloud that resembled her face  a cloud on the desert horizon he gazed and gazed  was that a spirit face like the one by his side  nohe did not dream   in the hot sultry morning yaqui appeared at camp after long hours of absence and he pointed with a long dark arm toward the west a bank of clouds was rising above the mountain barrier  rain he cried and his sonorous voice rolled down the arroyo  those who heard him were as shipwrecked mariners at sight of a distant sail   dick gale silent grateful to the depths of his soul stood with arm over blanco sol and watched the transforming west where clouds of wonderous size and hue piled over one another rushing darkening spreading sweeping upward toward that white and glowing sun  when they reached the zenith and swept round to blot out the blazing orb the earth took on a dark lowering aspect  the red of sand and lava changed to steely gray  vast shadows like ripples on water sheeted in from the gulf with a low strange moan  yet the silence was like death  the desert was awaiting a strange and hated visitationstorm  if all the endless torrid days the endless mystic nights had seemed unreal to gale what then seemed this stupendous spectacle  oh  i felt a drop of rain on my face cried mercedes and whispering the name of a saint she kissed her husband  the whitehaired ladd gaunt old bent looked up at the maelstrom of clouds and he said softly shore well get in the hosses an pack light an hit the trail an make night marches  then up out of the gulf of the west swept a bellowing wind and a black pall and terrible flashes of lightning and thunder like the end of the worldfury blackness chaos the desert storm    xvii  the whistle of a horse  at the ranchhouse at forlorn river belding stood alone in his darkened room  it was quiet there and quiet outside the sickening midsummer heat like a hot heavy blanket lay upon the house  he took up the gun belt from his table and with slow hands buckled it around his waist  he seemed to feel something familiar and comfortable and inspiring in the weight of the big gun against his hip  he faced the door as if to go out but hesitated and then began a slow plodding walk up and down the length of the room  presently he halted at the table and with reluctant hands he unbuckled the gun belt and laid it down  the action did not have an air of finality and belding knew it he had seen border life in texas in the early days he had been a sheriff when the law in the west depended on a quickness of wrist he had seen many a man lay down his gun for good and all his own action was not final of late he had done the same thing many times and this last time it seemed a little harder to do a little more indicative of vacillation there were reasons why beldings gun held for him a gloomy fascination  the chases those grasping and conscienceless agents of a new force in the development of the west were bent upon beldings ruin and so far as his fortunes at forlorn river were concerned had almost accomplished it  one by one he lost points for which he contended with them  he carried into the tucson courts the matter of the staked claims and mining claims and water claims and he lost all following that he lost his government position as inspector of immigration and this fact because of what he considered its injustice had been a hard blow  he had been made to suffer a humiliation equally as great  it came about that he actually had to pay the chases for water to irrigate his alfalfa fields  the neverfailing spring upon his land answered for the needs of household and horses but no more  these matters were unfortunate for belding but not by any means wholly accountable for his worry and unhappiness and brooding hate he believed dick gale and the rest of the party taken into the desert by the yaqui had been killed or lost  two months before a string of mexican horses riderless saddled starved for grass and wild for water had come in to forlorn river  they were a part of the horses belonging to rojas and his band  their arrival complicated the mystery and strengthened convictions of the loss of both pursuers and pursued belding was wont to say that he had worried himself gray over the fate of his rangers  beldings unhappiness could hardly be laid to material loss  he had been rich and was now poor but change of fortune such as that could not have made him unhappy  something more somber and mysterious and sad than the loss of dick gale and their friends had come into the lives of his wife and nell  he dated the time of this change back to a certain day when mrs belding recognized in the elder chase an old schoolmate and a rejected suitor  it took time for slowthinking belding to discover anything wrong in his household especially as the fact of the gales lingering there made mrs belding and nell for the most part hide their real and deeper feelings  gradually however belding had forced on him the fact of some secret cause for grief other than gales loss he was sure of it when his wife signified her desire to make a visit to her old home back in peoria  she did not give many reasons but she did show him a letter that had found its way from old friends  this letter contained news that may or may not have been authentic but it was enough belding thought to interest his wife an old prospector had returned to peoria and he had told relatives of meeting robert burton at the sonoyta oasis fifteen years before and that burton had gone into the desert never to return  to belding this was no surprise for he had heard that before his marriage  there appeared to have been no doubts as to the death of his wifes first husband  the singular thing was that both nells father and grandfather had been lost somewhere in the sonora desert  belding did not oppose his wifes desire to visit her old home he thought it would be a wholesome trip for her and did all in his power to persuade nell to accompany her  but nell would not go  it was after mrs beldings departure that belding discovered in nell a condition of mind that amazed and distressed him  she had suddenly become strangely wretched so that she could not conceal it from even the gales who of all people belding imagined were the ones to make nell proud  she would tell him nothing  but after a while when he had thought it out he dated this further and more deplorable change in nell back to a day on which he had met nell with radford chase  this indefatigable wooer had not in the least abandoned his suit  something about the fellow made belding grind his teeth  but nell grew not only solicitously but now strangely entreatingly earnest in her importunities to belding not to insult or lay a hand on chase  this had bound belding so far it had made him think and watch  he had never been a man to interfere with his women folk  they could do as they liked and usually that pleased him  but a slow surprise gathered and grew upon him when he saw that nell apparently was accepting young chases attentions  at least she no longer hid from him belding could not account for this because he was sure nell cordially despised the fellow  and toward the end he divined if he did not actually know that these chases possessed some strange power over nell and were using it that stirred a hate in beldinga hate he had felt at the very first and had manfully striven against and which now gave him over to dark brooding thoughts  midsummer passed and the storms came late  but when they arrived they made up for tardiness  belding did not remember so terrible a storm of wind and rain as that which broke the summers drought  in a few days it seemed altar valley was a bright and green expanse where dust clouds did not rise  forlorn river ran a slow heavy turgid torrent  belding never saw the river in flood that it did not give him joy yet now desert man as he was he suffered a regret when he thought of the great chase reservoir full and overflowing  the dull thunder of the spillway was not pleasant  it was the first time in his life that the sound of falling water jarred upon him  belding noticed workmen once more engaged in the fields bounding his land  the chases had extended a main irrigation ditch down to beldings farm skipped the width of his ground then had gone on down through altar valley  they had exerted every influence to obtain right to connect these ditches by digging through his land but belding had remained obdurate  he refused to have any dealings with them  it was therefore with some curiosity and suspicion that he saw a gang of mexicans once more at work upon these ditches  at daylight next morning a tremendous blast almost threw belding out of his bed  it cracked the adobe walls of his house and broke windows and sent pans and crockery to the floor with a crash beldings idea was that the store of dynamite kept by the chases for blasting had blown up  hurriedly getting into his clothes he went to nells room to reassure her and telling her to have a thought for their guests he went out to see what had happened  the villagers were pretty badly frightened  many of the poorly constructed adobe huts had crumbled almost into dust  a great yellow cloud like smoke hung over the river  this appeared to be at the upper end of beldings plot and close to the river when he reached his fence the smoke and dust were so thick he could scarcely breathe and for a little while he was unable to see what had happened presently he made out a huge hole in the sand just about where the irrigation ditch had stopped near his line  for some reason or other not clear to belding the mexicans had set off an extraordinarily heavy blast at that point  belding pondered  he did not now for a moment consider an accidental discharge of dynamite  but why had this blast been set off  the loose sandy soil had yielded readily to shovel there were no rocks as far as construction of a ditch was concerned such a blast would have done more harm than good  slowly with reluctant feet belding walked toward a green hollow where in a cluster of willows lay the neverfailing spring that his horses loved so well and indeed which he loved no less he was actually afraid to part the drooping willows to enter the little cool shady path that led to the spring  then suddenly seized by suspense he ran the rest of the way  he was just in time to see the last of the water  it seemed to sink as in quicksand  the shape of the hole had changed  the tremendous force of the blast in the adjoining field had obstructed or diverted the underground stream of water  beldings neverfailing spring had been ruined  what had made this little plot of ground green and sweet and fragrant was now no more beldings first feeling was for the pity of it  the pale ajo lilies would bloom no more under those willows  the willows themselves would soon wither and die  he thought how many times in the middle of hot summer nights he had come down to the spring to drink  never again  suddenly he thought of blanco diablo  how the great white thoroughbred had loved this spring  belding straightened up and looked with tearblurred eyes out over the waste of desert to the west  never a day passed that he had not thought of the splendid horse but this moment with its significant memory was doubly keen and there came a dull pang in his breast  diablo will never drink here again muttered belding  the loss of blanco diablo though admitted and mourned by belding had never seemed quite real until this moment  the pall of dust drifting over him the din of the falling water up at the dam diverted beldings mind to the chases  all at once he was in the harsh grip of a cold certainty  the blast had been set off intentionally to ruin his spring  what a hellish trick  no westerner no indian or mexican no desert man could have been guilty of such a crime  to ruin a beautiful clear cool neverfailing stream of water in the desert  it was then that beldings worry and indecision and brooding were as if they had never existed  as he strode swiftly back to the house his head which had long been bent thoughtfully and sadly was held erect he went directly to his room and with an air that was now final he buckled on his gun belt  he looked the gun over and tried the action he squared himself and walked a little more erect  some longlost individuality had returned to belding  lets see he was saying  i can get carter to send the horses ive left back to waco to my brother  ill make nell take what money there is and go hunt up her mother  the gales are ready to gotoday if i say the word  nell can travel with them part way east  thats your game tom belding dont mistake me  as he went out he encountered mr gale coming up the walk  the long sojourn at forlorn river despite the fact that it had been laden with a suspense which was gradually changing to a sad certainty had been of great benefit to dicks father  the dry air the heat and the quiet had made him if not entirely a well man certainly stronger than he had been in many years  belding what was that terrible roar asked mr gale  we were badly frightened until miss nell came to us  we feared it was an earthquake  well ill tell you mr gale weve had some quakes here but none of them could hold a candle to this jar we just had  then belding explained what had caused the explosion and why it had been set off so close to his property  its an outrage sir an unspeakable outrage declared mr gale hotly  such a thing would not be tolerated in the east  mr belding im amazed at your attitude in the face of all this trickery  you seethere was mother and nell began belding as if apologizing he dropped his head a little and made marks in the sand with the toe of his boot  mr gale ive been sort of half hitched as laddy used to say  im planning to have a little more elbow room round this ranch im going to send nell east to her mother  then ill  see here mr gale would you mind having nell with you part way when you go home  wed all be delighted to have her go all the way and make us a visit replied mr gale  thats fine  and youll be going soon  dont take that as if i wanted to belding paused for the truth was that he did want to hurry them off  we would have been gone before this but for you said mr gale long ago we gave up hope ofof richard ever returning  and i believe now were sure he was lost that wed do well to go home at once  you wished us to remain until the heat was brokentill the rains came to make traveling easier for us  now i see no need for further delay  my stay here has greatly benefited my health  i shall never forget your hospitality  this western trip would have made me a new man ifonlyrichard  sure  i understand said belding gruffly  lets go in and tell the women to pack up  nell was busy with the servants preparing breakfast  belding took her into the sittingroom while mr gale called his wife and daughter  my girl ive some news for you began belding  mr gale is leaving today with his family  im going to send you with thempart way anyhow  youre invited to visit them  i think that d be great for youhelp you to forget  but the main thing isyoure going east to join mother  nell gazed at him whitefaced without uttering a word  you see nell im about done in forlorn river went on belding that blast this morning sank my spring  theres no water now it was the last straw  so well shake the dust of forlorn river ill come on a little laterthats all  dad youre packing your gun exclaimed nell suddenly pointing with a trembling finger  she ran to him and for the first time in his life belding put her away from him  his movements had lost the old slow gentleness  why so i am replied belding coolly as his hand moved down to the sheath swinging at his hip  nell im that absentminded these days  dad she cried  thatll do from you he replied in a voice he had never used to her get breakfast now then pack to leave forlorn river  leave forlorn river whispered nell with a thin white hand stealing up to her breast  how changed the girl was  belding reproached himself for his hardness but did not speak his thought aloud  nell was fading here just as mercedes had faded before the coming of thorne  nell turned away to the west window and looked out across the desert toward the dim blue peaks in the distance belding watched her likewise the gales and no one spoke there ensued a long silence belding felt a lump rise in his throat  nell laid her arm against the window frame but gradually it dropped and she was leaning with her face against the wood a low sob broke from her  elsie gale went to her embraced her took the drooping head on her shoulder  weve come to be such friends she said  i believe itll be good for you to visit me in the city  hereall day you look out across that awful lonely desert come nell  heavy steps sounded outside on the flagstones then the door rattled under a strong knock  belding opened it  the chases father and son stood beyond the threshold  good morning belding said the elder chase  we were routed out early by that big blast and came up to see what was wrong  all a blunder  the greaser foreman was drunk yesterday and his ignorant men made a mistake  sorry if the blast bothered you  chase i reckon thats the first of your blasts i was ever glad to hear replied belding in a way that made chase look blank  so  well im glad youre glad he went on evidently puzzled i was a little worriedyouve always been so touchywe never could get together  i hurried over fearing maybe you might think the blastyou see belding  i see this mr ben chase interrupted belding in curt and ringing voice  that blast was a mistake the biggest you ever made in your life  what do you mean demanded chase  youll have to excuse me for a while unless youre dead set on having it out right now  mr gale and his family are leaving and my daughter is going with them  id rather youd wait a little  nell going away  exclaimed radford chase  he reminded belding of an overgrown boy in disappointment  yes  butmiss burton to you young man  mr belding i certainly would prefer a conference with you right now interposed the elder chase cutting short beldings strange speech  there are other mattersimportant matters to discuss theyve got to be settled  may we step in sir  no you may not replied belding bluntly  im sure particular who i invite into my house  but ill go with you  belding stepped out and closed the door  come away from the house so the women wont hear thethe talk  the elder chase was purple with rage yet seemed to be controlling it the younger man looked black sullen impatient  he appeared not to have a thought of belding  he was absolutely blind to the situation as considered from beldings point of view  ben chase found his voice about the time belding halted under the trees out of earshot from the house  sir youve insulted memy son  how dare you  i want you to understand that youre  chop that kind of talk with me you     interrupted belding  he had always been profane and now he certainly did not choose his language  chase turned livid gasped and seemed about to give way to fury  but something about belding evidently exerted a powerful quieting influence  if you talk sense ill listen went on belding  belding was frankly curious  he did not think any argument or inducement offered by chase could change his mind on past dealings or his purpose of the present  but he believed by listening he might get some light on what had long puzzled him  the masterly effort chase put forth to conquer his aroused passions gave belding another idea of the character of this promoter  i want to make a last effort to propitiate you began chase in his quick smooth voice  that was a singular change to beldingthe dropping instantly into an easy flow of speech youve had losses here and naturally youre sore  i dont blame you  but you cant see this thing from my side of the fence business is business  in business the best man wins  the law upheld those transactions of mine the honesty of which you questioned as to mining and water claims you lost on this technical pointthat you had nothing to prove you had held them for five years  five years is the time necessary in law  a dozen men might claim the source of forlorn river but if they had no house or papers to prove their squatters rights any man could go in and fight them for the water   now i want to run that main ditch along the river through your farm  cant we make a deal  im ready to be liberalto meet you more than halfway  ill give you an interest in the company  i think ive influence enough up at the capitol to have you reinstated as inspector  a little reasonableness on your part will put you right again in forlorn river with a chance of growing rich  theres a big future here my interest belding has become personal  radford is in love with your stepdaughter he wants to marry her  ill admit now if i had foreseen this situation i wouldnt have pushed you so hard  but we can square the thing  now lets get together not only in business but in a family way  if my sons happiness depends upon having this girl you may rest assured ill do all i can to get her for him  ill absolutely make good all your losses  now what do you say  no replied belding  your money cant buy a right of way across my ranch  and nell doesnt want your son  that settles that  but you could persuade her  i wont thats all  may i ask why  chasess voice was losing its suave quality but it was even swifter than before  sure  i dont mind your asking replied belding in slow deliberation  i wouldnt do such a lowdown trick  besides if i would id want it to be a man i was persuading for  i know greasersi know a yaqui id rather give nell to than your son  radford chase began to roar in inarticulate rage  belding paid no attention to him indeed he never glanced at the young man  the elder chase checked a violent start  he plucked at the collar of his gray flannel shirt opened it at the neck  my sons offer of marriage is an honormore an honor sir than you perhaps are aware of  belding made no reply  his steady gaze did not turn from the long lane that led down to the river  he waited coldly sure of himself  mrs beldings daughter has no right to the name of burton snapped chase  did you know that  i did not replied belding quietly  well you know it now added chase bitingly  sure you can prove what you say queried belding in the same cool unemotional tone  it struck him strangely at the moment what little knowledge this man had of the west and of western character  prove it  why yes i think so enough to make the truth plain to any reasonable man  i come from peoriawas born and raised there  i went to school with nell warren  that was your wifes maiden name  she was a beautiful gay girl  all the fellows were in love with her  i knew bob burton well  he was a splendid fellow but wild  nobody ever knew for sure but we all supposed he was engaged to marry nell  he left peoria however and soon after that the truth about nell came out she ran away  it was at least a couple of months before burton showed up in peoria he did not stay long  then for years nothing was heard of either of them  when word did come nell was in oklahoma burton was in denver theres chance of course that burton followed nell and married her that would account for nell warren taking the name of burton  but it isnt likely  none of us ever heard of such a thing and wouldnt have believed it if we had  the affair seemed destined to end unfortunately but belding while im at it i want to say that nell warren was one of the sweetest finest truest girls in the world if she drifted to the southwest and kept her past a secret that was only natural certainly it should not be held against her  why she was only a childa girlseventeeneighteen years old in a moment of amazementwhen i recognized your wife as an old schoolmatei blurted the thing out to radford  you see now how little it matters to me when i ask your stepdaughters hand in marriage for my son  belding stood listening  the genuine emotion in chases voice was as strong as the ring of truth  belding knew truth when he heard it  the revelation did not surprise him  belding did not soften for he devined that chases emotion was due to the probing of an old wound the recalling of a past both happy and painful  still human nature was so strange that perhaps kindness and sympathy might yet have a place in this chases heart  belding did not believe so but he was willing to give chase the benefit of the doubt  so you told my wife youd respect her secretkeep her dishonor from husband and daughter demanded belding his dark gaze sweeping back from the lane  what  ii stammered chase  you made your son swear to be a man and die before hed hint the thing to nell went on belding and his voice rang louder  ben chase had no answer  the red left his face  his son slunk back against the fence  i say you never held this secret over the heads of my wife and her daughter thundered belding  he had his answer in the gray faces in the lips that fear made mute like a flash belding saw the whole truth of mrs beldings agony the reason for her departure he saw what had been driving nell and it seemed that all the dogs of hell were loosed within his heart  he struck out blindly instinctively in his pain and the blow sent ben chase staggering into the fence corner  then he stretched forth a long arm and whirled radford chase back beside his father  i see it all now went on belding hoarsely  you found the womans weaknessher love for the girl  you found the girls weaknessher pride and fear of shame  so you drove the one and hounded the other god what a base thing to do  to tell the girl was bad enough but to threaten her with betrayal theres no name for that  beldings voice thickened and he paused breathing heavily  he stepped back a few paces and this an ominous action for an armed man of his kind instead of adding to the fear of the chases seemed to relieve them  if there had been any pity in beldings heart he would have felt it then  and now gentlemen continued belding speaking low and with difficulty seeing ive turned down your proposition i suppose you think youve no more call to keep your mouths shut  the elder chase appeared fascinated by something he either saw or felt in belding and his gray face grew grayer  he put up a shaking hand then radford chase livid and snarling burst out ill talk till im black in the face  you cant stop me  youll go black in the face but it wont be from talking hissed belding  his big arm swept down and when he threw it up the gun glittered in his hand  simultaneously with the latter action pealed out a shrill penetrating whistle  the whistle of a horse  it froze beldings arm aloft for an instant he could not move even his eyes  the familiarity of that whistle was terrible in its power to rob him of strength then he heard the rapid heavy pound of hoofs and again the piercing whistle  blanco diablo he cried huskily  he turned to see a huge white horse come thundering into the yard a wild gaunt terrible horse indeed the loved blanco diablo a bronzed longhaired indian bestrode him  more white horses galloped into the yard pounded to a halt whistling home  belding saw a slim shadow of a girl who seemed all great black eyes  under the trees flashed blanco sol as dazzling white as beautiful as if he had never been lost in the desert  he slid to a halt then plunged and stamped  his rider leaped throwing the bridle  belding saw a powerful spare ragged man with dark gaunt face and eyes of flame  then nell came running from the house her golden hair flying her hands outstretched her face wonderful  dick  dick  ohhh dick she cried  her voice seemed to quiver in beldings heart  beldings eyes began to blur  he was not sure he saw clearly whose face was this now close before hima long thin shrunken face haggard tragic in its semblance of torture almost of death  but the eyes were keen and kind  belding thought wildly that they proved he was not dreaming  i shore am glad to see you all said a wellremembered voice in a slow cool drawl    xviii  reality against dreams  ladd lash thorne mercedes they were all held tight in beldings arms  then he ran to blanco diablo  for once the great horse was gentle quiet glad  he remembered this kindest of masters and reached for him with warm wet muzzle  dick gale was standing bowed over nells slight form almost hidden in his arms  belding hugged them both  he was like a boy he saw ben chase and his son slip away under the trees but the circumstances meant nothing to him then  dick  dick he roared  is it you say who do you thinks herehere in forlorn river  gale gripped belding with a hand as rough and hard as a file and as strong as a vise  but he did not speak a word  belding thought gales eyes would haunt him forever  it was then three more persons came upon the sceneelsie gale running swiftly her father assisting mrs gale who appeared about to faint  belding  who on earths that cried dick hoarsely  quien sabe my son replied belding and now his voice seemed a little shaky  nell come here  give him a chance  belding slipped his arm round nell and whispered in her ear this ll be great  elsie gales face was white and agitated a face expressing extreme joy  oh brother  mama saw youpapa saw you and never knew you  but i knew you when you jumped quickthat wayoff your horse  and now i dont know you  you wild man  you giant  you splendid barbarian mama papa hurry  it is dick  look at him  just look at him  ohh thank god  belding turned away and drew nell with him  in another second she and mercedes were clasped in each others arms  then followed a time of joyful greetings all round  the yaqui stood leaning against a tree watching the welcoming home of the lost  no one seemed to think of him until belding ever mindful of the needs of horses put a hand on blanco diablo and called to yaqui to bring the others  they led the string of whites down to the barn freed them of wet and dusty saddles and packs and turned them loose in the alfalfa now breasthigh  diablo found his old spirit blanco sol tossed his head and whistled his satisfaction white woman pranced to and fro and presently they all settled down to quiet grazing  how good it was for belding to see those white shapes against the rich background of green  his eyes glistened  it was a sight he had never expected to see again  he lingered there many moments when he wanted to hurry back to his rangers  at last he tore himself away from watching blanco diablo and returned to the house  it was only to find that he might have spared himself the hurry  jim and ladd were lying on the beds that had not held them for so many months  their slumber seemed as deep and quiet as death curiously belding gazed down upon them they had removed only boots and chaps  their clothes were in tatters  jim appeared little more than skin and bones a long shape dark and hard as iron  ladds appearance shocked belding the ranger looked an old man blasted shriveled starved  yet his gaunt face though terrible in its records of tortures had something fine and noble even beautiful to belding in its strength its victory  thorne and mercedes had disappeared  the low murmur of voices came from mrs gales room and belding concluded that dick was still with his family  no doubt he also would soon seek rest and sleep belding went through the patio and called in at nells door  she was there sitting by her window  the flush of happiness had not left her face but she looked stunned and a shadow of fear lay dark in her eyes  belding had intended to talk  he wanted some one to listen to him  the expression in nells eyes however silenced him  he had forgotten  nell read his thought in his face and then she lost all her color and dropped her head  belding entered stood beside her with a hand on hers  he tried desperately hard to think of the right thing to say and realized so long as he tried that he could not speak at all  nelldicks back safe and sound he said slowly  thats the main thing  i wish you could have seen his eyes when he held you in his arms out there of course dicks coming knocks out your trip east and changes plans generally  we havent had the happiest time lately but now itll be different  dicks as true as a yaqui  hell chase that chase fellow dont mistake me then mother will be home soon shell straighten out thisthis mystery and nellhowever it turns outi know dick gale will feel just the same as i feel  brace up now girl  belding left the patio and traced thoughtful steps back toward the corrals  he realized the need of his wife  if she had been at home he would not have come so close to killing two men  nell would never have fallen so low in spirit  whatever the real truth of the tragedy of his wifes life it would not make the slightest difference to him  what hurt him was the pain mother and daughter had suffered were suffering still  somehow he must put an end to that pain  he found the yaqui curled up in a corner of the barn in as deep a sleep as that of the rangers  looking down at him belding felt again the rush of curious thrilling eagerness to learn all that had happened since the dark night when yaqui had led the white horses away into the desert  belding curbed his impatience and set to work upon tasks he had long neglected presently he was interrupted by mr gale who came out beside himself with happiness and excitement  he flung a hundred questions at belding and never gave him time to answer one even if that had been possible  finally when mr gale lost his breath belding got a word in  see here mr gale you know as much as i know dicks back  theyre all backa hard lot starved burned torn to pieces worked out to the limit i never saw in desert travelers but theyre alivealive and well man  just wait  just gamble i wont sleep or eat till i hear that story  but theyve got to sleep and eat  belding gathered with growing amusement that besides the joy excitement anxiety impatience expressed by mr gale there was something else which belding took for pride  it pleased him  looking back he remembered some of the things dick had confessed his father thought of him  beldings sympathy had always been with the boy  but he had learned to like the old man to find him kind and wise and to think that perhaps college and business had not brought out the best in richard gale  the west had done that however as it had for many a wild youngster and belding resolved to have a little fun at the expense of mr gale  so he began by making a few remarks that appeared to rob dicks father of both speech and breath  and dont mistake me concluded belding just keep out of earshot when laddy tells us the story of that desert trip unless youre hankering to have your hair turn pure white and stand curled on end and freeze that way   about the middle of the forenoon on the following day the rangers hobbled out of the kitchen to the porch  im a sick man i tell you ladd was complaining an i gotta be fed  soup  beef tea  that aint so much as wind to me  i want about a barrel of bread an butter an a whole platter of mashed potatoes with gravy an green stuffall kinds of green stuffan a whole big apple pie  give me everythin an anythin to eat but meat  shore i never never want to taste meat again an sight of a piece of sheep meat would jest about finish me jim you used to be a human bein that stood up for charlie ladd  laddy im lined up beside you with both guns replied jim plaintively  hungry  say the smell of breakfast in that kitchen

to eat mebbe potatoes an gravy an pie an  laddy dick has had no more than i gave youindeed not nearly so much  shore hes had a lot of kisses then for he hasnt hollered onct about this treatment  perhaps he has said nell with a blush and if you think thatthey would help you to be reasonable i mightill  well powerful fond as i am of you just now kisses ll have to run second to bread an butter  oh laddy what a gallant speech laughed nell  im sorry but ive dads orders  laddy interrupted belding youve got to be broke in gradually to eating  now you know that  youd be the severest kind of a boss if you had some starved beggars on your hands  but im sickim dyin howled ladd  you were never sick in your life and if all the bullet holes i see in you couldnt kill you why you never will die

pipe said jim thoughtfully  i reckon i had it empty in my mouth for seven years or so wasnt it laddy  a long time  i can see the red lava an the red haze an the red twilight creepin up  it was hot an some lonely  then the wind and always that awful silence  an always yaqui watchin the west an laddy with his checkers an mercedes burnin up wastin away to nothin but eyes  its all thereill never get rid  chop that kind of talk interrupted belding bluntly  tell us where yaqui took youwhat happened to rojaswhy you seemed lost for so long  i reckon laddy can tell all that best but when it comes to rojass finish ill tell what i seen an soll dick an thorne  laddy missed rojass finish  bar none that was the  im a sick man but i can talk put in ladd an shore i dont want the whole story exaggerated none by jim  ladd filled the pipe nell brought puffed ecstatically at it and settled himself upon the bench for a long talk  nell glanced appealingly at dick who tried to slip away  mercedes did go and was followed by thorne  mr gale brought chairs and in subdued excitement called his wife and daughter  belding leaned forward rendered all the more eager by dicks reluctance to stay the memory of the quick tragic change in the expression of mercedess beautiful eyes by the strange gloomy cast stealing over ladds face  the ranger talked for two hourstalked till his voice weakened to a husky whisper  at the conclusion of his story there was an impressive silence  then elsie gale stood up and with her hand on dicks shoulder her eyes bright and warm as sunlight she showed the rangers what a woman thought of them and of the yaqui nell clung to dick weeping silently  mrs gale was overcome and mr gale very white and quiet helped her up to her room  the indian the indian burst out belding his voice deep and rolling  what did i tell you  didnt i say hed be a godsend remember what i said about yaqui and some gory aztec knifework so he cut rojas loose from that awful crater wall foot by foot finger by finger slow and terrible  and rojas didnt hang long on the choya thorns  thank the lord for that laddy no story of camino del diablo can hold a candle to yours  the flight and the fight were jobs for men  but living through this long hot summer and coming outthats a miracle  only the yaqui could have done it  the yaqui the yaqui  shore  charlie ladd looks up at an indian these days  but beldin as for the comin out dont forget the hosses  without grand old sol an diablo who i dont hate no more an the other blancos wed never have got here  yaqui an the hosses thats my story   early in the afternoon of the next day belding encountered dick at the water barrel  belding this is river water and muddy at that said dick lord knows im not kicking  but ive dreamed some of our cool running spring and i want a drink from it  never again son  the springs gone faded sunk dry as dust  dry  gale slowly straightened  weve had rains  the rivers full the spring ought to be overflowing  whats wrong  why is it dry  dick seeing youre interested i may as well tell you that a big charge of nitroglycerin choked my spring  nitroglycerin echoed gale  then he gave a quick start  my minds been on home nell my family  but all the same i felt something was wrong here with the ranch with you with nell belding that ditch there is dry  the roses are dead the little green in that grass has come with the rains  whats happened  the ranchs run down  now i look around i see a change  some change yes replied belding bitterly  listen son  briefly but not the less forcibly for that belding related his story of the operations of the chases  astonishment appeared to be gales first feeling our water gone our claims gone our plans forestalled  why belding its unbelievable forlorn river with promoters business railroad bank and what not  suddenly he became fiery and suspicious  these chasesdid they do all this on the level  barefaced robbery  worse than a greaser holdup replied belding grimly  you say the law upheld them  sure  why ben chase has a pull as strong as diablos on a down grade  dick were jobbed outfigured beat tricked and we cant do a thing  oh im sorry belding most of all for laddy said gale feelingly hes all in  hell never ride again  he wanted to settle down here on the farm he thought he owned grow grass and raise horses and take it easy  oh but its tough  say he doesnt know it yet  he was just telling me hed like to go out and look the farm over  whos going to tell him  whats he going to do when he finds out about this deal  son thats made me think some replied belding with keen eyes fast upon the young man  and i was kind of wondering how youd take it  i  well ill call on the chases  look here belding id better do some forestalling myself  if laddy gets started now therell be blood spilled  hes not just right in his mind yet  he talks in his sleep sometimes about how yaqui finished rojas  if its left to himhell kill these men  but if i take it up  youre talking sense dick  only here im not so sure of you and theres more to tell  son youve nell to think of and your mother  beldings ranger gave him a long and searching glance  you can be sure of me he said  all right then listen began belding  with deep voice that had many a beak and tremor he told gale how nell had been hounded by radford chase how her mother had been driven by ben chasethe whole sad story  so thats the trouble  poor little girl murmured gale brokenly i felt something was wrong  nell wasnt natural like her old self  and when i begged her to marry me soon while dad was here she couldnt talk  she could only cry  it was hard on nell said belding simply  but it ll be better now youre back  dick i know the girl  shell refuse to marry you and youll have a hard job to break her down as hard as the one you just rode in off of  i think i know you too or i wouldnt be saying  belding what re you hinting at demanded gale  do you dare insinuate thatthatif the thing were true itd make any difference to me  aw come now dick i couldnt mean that  im only awkward at saying things  and im cut pretty deep  for gods sake you dont believe what chase said queried gale in passionate haste  its a lie  i swear its a lie  i know its a lie  and ive got to tell nell this minute  come on in with me  i want you belding  oh why didnt you tell me sooner  belding felt himself dragged by an iron arm into the sittingroom out into the patio and across that to where nell sat in her door  at sight of them she gave a little cry drooped for an instant then raised a pale still face with eyes beginning to darken  dearest i know now why you are not wearing my mothers ring said gale steadily and lowvoiced  dick i am not worthy she replied and held out a trembling hand with the ring lying in the palm  swift as light gale caught her hand and slipped the ring back upon the third finger  nell  look at me  it is your engagement ring listen  i dont believe thisthis thing thats been torturing you  i know its a lie i am absolutely sure your mother will prove it a lie  she must have suffered onceperhaps there was a sad errorbut the thing you fear is not true  but hear me dearest even if it was true it wouldnt make the slightest difference to me  id promise you on my honor id never think of it again  id love you all the more because youd suffered i want you all the more to be my wifeto let me make you forgetto  she rose swiftly with the passionate abandon of a woman stirred to her depths and she kissed him  oh dick youre goodso good  youll never knowjust what those words mean to me  theyve saved mei think  then dearest its all right  dick questioned eagerly  you will keep your promise  you will marry me  the glow the light faded out of her face and now the blue eyes were almost black  she drooped and shook her head  nell exclaimed gale sharply catching his breath  dont ask me dick  ii wont marry you  why  you know  its true that i  its a lie interrupted gale fiercely  but even if its truewhywhy wont you marry me  between you and me love is the thing  love and nothing else  dont you love me any more  they had forgotten belding who stepped back into the shade  i love you with my whole heart and soul  id die for you whispered nell with clenching hands  but i wont disgrace you  dear you have worried over this trouble till youre morbid  it has grown out of all proportion  i tell you that ill not only be the happiest man on earth but the luckiest if you marry me  dick you give not one thought to your family  would they receive me as your wife  they surely would replied gale steadily  no oh no  youre wrong nell  im glad you said that  you give me a chance to prove something  ill go this minute and tell them all  ill be back here in less than  dick you will not tell heryour mother cried nell with her eyes streaming  you will not  oh i cant bear it  shes so proud  and dick i love her  dont tell her  please please dont  shell be going soon  she neednt ever knowabout me i want her always to think well of me  dick i beg of you  oh the fear of her knowing has been the worst of all  please dont go  nell im sorry  i hate to hurt you  but youre wrong  you cant see things clearly  this is your happiness im fighting for  and its my life wait here dear  i wont be long  gale ran across the patio and disappeared  nell sank to the doorstep and as she met the question in beldings eyes she shook her head mournfully  they waited without speaking  it seemed a long while before gale returned  belding thrilled at sight of him  there was more boy about him than belding had ever seen  dick was coming swiftly flushed glowing eager erect almost smiling  i told them  i swore it was a lie but i wanted them to decide as if it were true  i didnt have to waste a minute on elsie  she loves you nell  the governor is crazy about you i didnt have to waste two minutes on him  mother used up the time  she wanted to know all there was to tell  she is proud yes but nell i wish you could have seen how she took thethe story about you  why she never thought of me at all until she had cried over you  nell she loves you too  they all love you oh its so good to tell you  i think mother realizes the part you have had in thewhat shall i call itthe regeneration of richard gale  doesnt that sound fine  darling mother not only consents she wants you to be my wife  do you hear that  and listenshe had me in a corner and of course being my mother she put on the screws  she made me promise that wed live in the east half the year  that means chicago cape may new yorkyou see im not exactly the lost son any more  why nell dear youll have to learn who dick gale really is  but i always want to be the ranger you helped me become and ride blanco sol and see a little of the desert  dont let the idea of big cities frighten you  well always love the open places best  now nell say youll forget this trouble  i know itll come all right say youll marry me soon why dearest youre crying nell  myheartis broken sobbed nell foriicant marry you  the boyish brightness faded out of gales face  here belding saw was the stern reality arrayed against his dreams  that devil radford chasehell tell my secret panted nell he swore if you ever came back and married me hed follow us all over the world to tell it  belding saw gale grow deathly white and suddenly stand stockstill  chase threatened you then asked dick and the forced naturalness of his voice struck belding  threatened me  he made my life a nightmare replied nell in a rush of speech  at first i wondered how he was worrying mother sick  but she wouldnt tell me  then when she went away he began to hint things i hated him all the more  but when he told mei was frightened shamed  still i did not weaken  he was pretty decent when he was sober  but when he was half drunk he was the devil  he laughed at me and my pride  i didnt dare shut the door in his face  after a while he found out that your mother loved me and that i loved her  then he began to threaten me if i didnt give in to him hed see she learned the truth  that made me weaken  it nearly killed me  i simply could not bear the thought of mrs gale knowing  but i couldnt marry him besides he got so half the time when he was drunk he didnt want or ask me to be his wife  i was about ready to give up and go mad when youyou came home  she ended in a whisper looking up wistfully and sadly at him belding was a raging fire within cold without  he watched gale and believed he could foretell that young mans future conduct gale gathered nell up into his arms and held her to his breast for a long moment  dear nell im sure the worst of your trouble is over he said gently  i will not give you up  now wont you lie down try to rest and calm yourself  dont grieve any more  this thing isnt so bad as you make it  trust me  ill shut mr radford chases mouth  as he released her she glanced quickly up at him then lifted appealing hands  dick you wont hunt for himgo after him  gale laughed and the laugh made belding jump  dick i beg of you  please dont make trouble  the chases have been hard enough on us  they are rich powerful  dick say you will not make matters worse  please promise me youll not go to him  you ask me that he demanded  yes  oh yes  but you know its useless  what kind of a man do you want me to be  its only that im afraid  oh dick hed shoot you in the back  no nell a man of his kind wouldnt have nerve enough even for that  youll go she cried wildly  gale smiled and the smile made belding cold  dick i cannot keep you back  no he said  then the woman in her burst through instinctive fear and with her eyes blazing black in her white face she lifted parted quivering lips and kissed him  gale left the patio and belding followed closely at his heels they went through the sittingroom  outside upon the porch sat the rangers mr gale and thorne  dick went into his room without speaking  shore somethins comin off said ladd sharply and he sat up with keen eyes narrowing  belding spoke a few words and remembering an impression he had wished to make upon mr gale he made them strong  but now it was with grim humor that he spoke  better stop that boy he concluded looking at mr gale  hell do some mischief  hes wildern hell  stop him  why assuredly replied mr gale rising with nervous haste  just then dick came out of his door  belding eyed him keenly  the only change he could see was that dick had put on a hat and a pair of heavy gloves  richard where are you going asked his father  im going over here to see a man  no  it is my wish that you remain  i forbid you to go said mr gale with a hand on his sons shoulder  dick put mr gale aside gently respectfully yet forcibly  the old man gasped  dad i havent gotten over my bad habit of disobeying you  im sorry dont interfere with me now  and dont follow me  you might see something unpleasant  but my son  what are you going to do  im going to beat a dog  mr gale looked helplessly from this strangely calm and cold son to the restless belding  then dick strode off the porch  hold on  ladds voice would have stopped almost any man  dick you wasnt agoin without me  yes i was  but im thoughtless just now laddy  shore you was  wait a minute dick  im a sick man but at that nobody can pull any stunts round here without me  he hobbled along the porch and went into his room  jim lash knocked the ashes out of his pipe and humming his dance tune he followed ladd  in a moment the rangers appeared and both were packing guns  not a little of beldings grim excitement came from observation of mr gale  at sight of the rangers with their guns the old man turned white and began to tremble  better stay behind whispered belding  dicks going to beat that twolegged dog and the rangers get excited when theyre packing guns  i will not stay behind replied mr gale stoutly  ill see this affair through  belding ive guessed it  richard is going to fight the chases those robbers who have ruined you  well i cant guarantee any fight on their side returned belding dryly  but maybe therell be greasers with a gun or two  belding stalked off to catch up with dick and mr gale came trudging behind with thorne  where will we find these chases asked dick of belding  theyve got a place down the road adjoining the inn  they call it their club  at this hour radford will be there sure i dont know about the old man  but his office is now just across the way  they passed several houses turned a corner into the main street and stopped at a wide low adobe structure  a number of saddled horses stood haltered to posts  mexicans lolled around the wide doorway  theres ben chase now over on the corner said belding to dick see the tall man with the white hair and leather band on his hat  he sees us  he knows theres something up  hes got men with him  theyll come over  were after the young buck and sure hell be in here  they entered  the place was a hall and needed only a bar to make it a saloon  there were two rickety pool tables  evidently chase had fitted up this amusement room for his laborers as well as for the use of his engineers and assistants for the crowd contained both mexicans and americans  a large table near a window was surrounded by a noisy smoking drinking circle of cardplayers  point out this radford chase to me said gale  there  the big fellow with the red face  his eyes stick out a little  see  hes dropped his cards and his face isnt red any more  dick strode across the room  belding grasped mr gale and whispered hoarsely dont miss anything itll be great  watch dick and watch laddy  if theres any gun play dodge behind me  belding smiled with a grim pleasure as he saw mr gales face turn white  dick halted beside the table  his heavy boot shot up and with a crash the table split and glasses cards chips flew everywhere as they rattled down and the chairs of the dumfounded players began to slide dick called out my name is gale  im looking for mr radford chase  a tall heavyshouldered fellow rose boldly enough even swaggeringly and glowered at gale  im radford chase he said  his voice betrayed the boldness of his action   it was over in a few moments  the tables and chairs were tumbled into a heap one of the pool tables had been shoved aside a lamp lay shattered with oil running dark upon the floor  ladd leaned against a post with a smoking gun in his hand  a mexican crouched close to the wall moaning over a broken arm  in the far corner upheld by comrades another wounded mexican cried out in pain  these two had attempted to draw weapons upon gale and ladd had crippled them  in the center of the room lay radford chase a limp torn hulking bloody figure  he was not seriously injured  but he was helpless a miserable beaten wretch who knew his condition and felt the eyes upon him  he sobbed and moaned and howled  but no one offered to help him to his feet  backed against the door of the hall stood ben chase for once stripped of all authority and confidence and courage  gale confronted him and now gales mien was in striking contrast to the coolness with which he had entered the place  though sweat dripped from his face it was as white as chalk  like dark flames his eyes seemed to leap and dance and burn  his lean jaw hung down and quivered with passion  he shook a huge gloved fist in chases face  your gray hairs save you this time  but keep out of my way  and when that son of yours comes to tell him every time i meet him ill add some more to what he got today    xix  the secret of forlorn river  in the early morning gale seeking solitude where he could brood over his trouble wandered alone  it was not easy for him to elude the yaqui and just at the moment when he had cast himself down in a secluded shady corner the indian appeared noiseless shadowy mysterious as always  malo he said in his deep voice  yes yaqui its badvery bad replied gale  the indian had been told of the losses sustained by belding and his rangers  gome said yaqui with an impressive gesture toward the lofty lilaccolored steps of no name mountains  he seemed the same as usual but a glance on gales part a moments attention made him conscious of the old strange force in the yaqui why does my brother want me to climb the nameless mountains with him asked gale  lluvia doro replied yaqui and he made motions that gale found difficult of interpretation  shower of gold translated gale  that was the yaquis name for nell what did he mean by using it in connection with a climb into the mountains  were his motions intended to convey an idea of a shower of golden blossoms from that rare and beautiful tree or a golden rain gales listlessness vanished in a flash of thought the yaqui meant gold  gold  he meant he could retrieve the fallen fortunes of the white brother who had saved his life that evil day at the papago well gale thrilled as he gazed piercingly into the wonderful eyes of this indian  would yaqui never consider his debt paid  gome repeat the indian pointing with the singular directness that always made this action remarkable in him  yes yaqui  gale ran to his room put on hobnailed boots filled a canteen and hurried back to the corral  yaqui awaited him  the indian carried a coiled lasso and a short stout stick  without a word he led the way down the lane turned up the river toward the mountains  none of beldings household saw their departure  what had once been only a narrow mesquitebordered trail was now a welltrodden road  a deep irrigation ditch full of flowing muddy water ran parallel with the road  gale had been curious about the operations of the chases but bitterness he could not help had kept him from going out to see the work  he was not surprised to find that the engineers who had constructed the ditches and dam had anticipated him in every particular  the dammedup gulch made a magnificent reservoir and gale could not look upon the long narrow lake without a feeling of gladness  the dreaded ano seco of the mexicans might come again and would come but never to the inhabitants of forlorn river  that stonewalled stonefloored gulch would never leak and already it contained water enough to irrigate the whole altar valley for two dry seasons  yaqui led swiftly along the lake to the upper end where the stream roared down over unscalable walls  this point was the farthest gale had ever penetrated into the rough foothills and he had beldings word for it that no white man had ever climbed no name mountains from the west  but a white man was not an indian  the former might have stolen the range and valley and mountain even the desert but his possessions would ever remain mysteries  gale had scarcely faced the great gray ponderous wall of cliff before the old strange interest in the yaqui seized him again  it recalled the tie that existed between them a tie almost as close as blood then he was eager and curious to see how the indian would conquer those seemingly insurmountable steps of stone  yaqui left the gulch and clambered up over a jumble of weathered slides and traced a slow course along the base of the giant wall he looked up and seemed to select a point for ascent  it was the last place in that mountainside where gale would have thought climbing possible  before him the wall rose leaning over him shutting out the light a dark mighty mountain mass  innumerable cracks and crevices and caves roughened the bulging sides of dark rock  yaqui tied one end of his lasso to the short stout stick and carefully disentangling the coils he whirled the stick round and round and threw it almost over the first rim of the shelf perhaps thirty feet up  the stick did not lodge  yaqui tried again this time it caught in a crack  he pulled hard  then holding to the lasso he walked up the steep slant hand over hand on the rope  when he reached the shelf he motioned for gale to follow gale found that method of scaling a wall both quick and easy yaqui pulled up the lasso and threw the stick aloft into another crack  he climbed to another shelf and gale followed him  the third effort brought them to a more rugged bench a hundred feet above the slides  the yaqui worked round to the left and turned into a dark fissure  gale kept close to his heels they came out presently into lighter space yet one that restricted any extended view  broken sections of cliff were on all sides  here the ascent became toil  gale could distance yaqui going downhill on the climb however he was hard put to it to keep the indian in sight  it was not a question of strength or lightness of foot  these gale had beyond the share of most men  it was a matter of lung power and the yaquis life had been spent scaling the desert heights moreover the climbing was infinitely slow tedious dangerous  on the way up several times gale imagined he heard a dull roar of falling water the sound seemed to be under him over him to this side and to that when he was certain he could locate the direction from which it came then he heard it no more until he had gone on  gradually he forgot it in the physical sensations of the climb  he burned his hands and knees  he grew hot and wet and winded  his heart thumped so that it hurt and there were instants when his sight was blurred  when at last he had toiled to where the yaqui sat awaiting him upon the rim of that great wall it was none too soon  gale lay back and rested for a while without note of anything except the blue sky  then he sat up  he was amazed to find that after that wonderful climb he was only a thousand feet or so above the valley judged by the nature of his effort he would have said he had climbed a mile  the village lay beneath him with its new adobe structures and tents and buildings in bright contrast with the older habitations  he saw the green alfalfa fields and beldings white horses looking very small and motionless  he pleased himself by imagining he could pick out blanco sol  then his gaze swept on to the river  indeed he realized now why some one had named it forlorn river even at this season when it was full of water it had a forlorn aspect  it was doomed to fail out there on the desertdoomed never to mingle with the waters of the gulf  it wound away down the valley growing wider and shallower encroaching more and more on the gray flats until it disappeared on its sad journey toward sonoyta  that vast shimmering sungoverned waste recognized its life only at this flood season and was already with parched tongue and insatiate fire licking and burning up its futile waters  yaqui put a hand on gales knee  it was a bronzed scarred powerful hand always eloquent of meaning  the indian was listening his bent head his strange dilating eyes his rigid form and that closepressing hand how these brought back to gale the terrible lonely night hours on the lava  what do you hear yaqui asked gale  he laughed a little at the mood that had come over him  but the sound of his voice did not break the spell  he did not want to speak again  he yielded to yaquis subtle nameless influence  he listened himself heard nothing but the scream of an eagle  often he wondered if the indian could hear things that made no sound  yaqui was beyond understanding  whatever the indian had listened to or for presently he satisfied himself and with a grunt that might mean anything he rose and turned away from the rim  gale followed rested now and eager to go on  he saw that the great cliff they had climbed was only a stairway up to the huge looming dark bulk of the plateau above  suddenly he again heard the dull roar of falling water  it seemed to have cleared itself of muffled vibrations  yaqui mounted a little ridge and halted  the next instant gale stood above a bottomless cleft into which a white stream leaped  his astounded gaze swept backward along this narrow swift stream to its end in a dark round boiling pool  it was a huge spring a bubbling well the outcropping of an underground river coming down from the vast plateau above  yaqui had brought gale to the source of forlorn river  flashing thoughts in gales mind were no swifter than the thrills that ran over him  he would stake out a claim here and never be cheated out of it  ditches on the benches and troughs on the steep walls would carry water down to the valley  ben chase had build a great dam which would be useless if gale chose to turn forlorn river from its natural course  the fountain head of that mysterious desert river belonged to him  his eagerness his mounting passion was checked by yaquis unusual action  the indian showed wonder hesitation even reluctance  his strange eyes surveyed this boiling well as if they could not believe the sight they saw  gale divined instantly that yaqui had never before seen the source of forlorn river  if he had ever ascended to this plateau probably it had been to some other part for the water was new to him  he stood gazing aloft at peaks at lower ramparts of the mountain and at nearer landmarks of prominence  yaqui seemed at fault  he was not sure of his location  then he strode past the swirling pool of dark water and began to ascend a little slope that led up to a shelving cliff  another object halted the indian  it was a pile of stones weathered crumbled fallen into ruin but still retaining shape enough to prove it had been built there by the hands of men  round and round this the yaqui stalked and his curiosity attested a further uncertainty  it was as if he had come upon something surprising gale wondered about the pile of stones  had it once been a prospectors claim  ugh grunted the indian and though his exclamation expressed no satisfaction it surely put an end to doubt  he pointed up to the roof of the sloping yellow shelf of stone  faintly outlined there in red were the imprints of many human hands with fingers spread wide  gale had often seen such paintings on the walls of the desert caverns manifestly these told yaqui he had come to the spot for which he had aimed  then his actions became swiftand yaqui seldom moved swiftly the fact impressed gale  the indian searched the level floor under the shelf he gathered up handfuls of small black stones and thrust them at gale their weight made gale start and then he trembled  the indians next move was to pick up a piece of weathered rock and throw it against the wall  it broke he snatched up parts and showed the broken edges to gale they contained yellow steaks dull glints faint tracings of green it was gold  gale found his legs shaking under him and he sat down trying to take all the bits of stone into his lap  his fingers were all thumbs as with knife blade he dug into the black pieces of rock  he found gold then he stared down the slope down into the valley with its river winding forlornly away into the desert  but he did not see any of that  here was reality as sweet as wonderful as saving as a dream come true  yaqui had led him to a ledge of gold  gale had learned enough about mineral to know that this was a rich strike  all in a second he was speechless with the joy of it  but his mind whirled in thought about this strange and noble indian who seemed never to be able to pay a debt  belding and the poverty that had come to him nell who had wept over the loss of a spring  laddy who never could ride again  jim lash who swore he would always look after his friend thorne and mercedes  all these people who had been good to him and whom he loved were poor  but now they would be rich  they would one and all be his partners  he had discovered the source of forlorn river and was rich in water  yaqui had made him rich in gold  gale wanted to rush down the slope down into the valley and tell his wonderful news  suddenly his eyes cleared and he saw the pile of stones  his blood turned to ice then to fire  that was the mark of a prospectors claim  but it was old very old  the ledge had never been worked the slope was wild  there was not another single indication that a prospector had ever been there  where then was he who had first staked this claim  gale wondered with growing hope with the fire easing with the cold passing  the yaqui uttered the low strange involuntary cry so rare with him a cry somehow always associated with death gale shuddered  the indian was digging in the sand and dust under the shelving wall he threw out an object that rang against the stone  it was a belt buckle he threw out old shrunken withered boots  he came upon other things and then he ceased to dig  the grave of desert prospectors  gale had seen more than one ladd had told him many a story of such gruesome finds  it was grim hard fact  then the keeneyed yaqui reached up to a little projecting shelf of rock and took from it a small object  he showed no curiosity and gave the thing to gale  how strangely gale felt when he received into his hands a flat oblong box  was it only the influence of the yaqui or was there a nameless and unseen presence beside that grave  gale could not be sure  but he knew he had gone back to the old desert mood  he knew something hung in the balance  no accident no luck no debtpaying indian could account wholly for that moment  gale knew he held in his hands more than gold  the box was a tin one and not all rusty  gale pried open the reluctant lid  a faint old musty odor penetrated his nostrils inside the box lay a packet wrapped in what once might have been oilskin  he took it out and removed this covering  a folded paper remained in his hands  it was growing yellow with age  but he descried a dim tracery of words  a crabbed scrawl written in blood hard to read  he held it more to the light and slowly he deciphered its content   we robert burton and jonas warren give half of this gold claim to the man who finds it and half to nell burton daughter and granddaughter   gasping with a bursting heart overwhelmed by an unutterable joy of divination gale fumbled with the paper until he got it open  it was a certificate twentyone years old and recorded the marriage of robert burton and nellie warren    xx  desert gold  a summer day dawned on forlorn river a beautiful still hot golden day with huge sail clouds of white motionless over no name peaks and the purple of clear air in the distance along the desert horizon  mrs belding returned that day to find her daughter happy and the past buried forever in two lonely graves  the haunting shadow left her eyes  gale believed he would never forget the sweetness the wonder the passion of her embrace when she called him her boy and gave him her blessing  the little wrinkled padre who married gale and nell performed the ceremony as he told his beads without interest or penetration and went his way leaving happiness behind  shore i was a sick man ladd said an darn near a dead one but im agoin to get well  mebbe ill be able to ride again someday nell i lay it to you  an im agoin to kiss you an wish you all the joy there is in this world  an dick as yaqui says shes shore your shower of gold  he spoke of gales finding lovespoke of it with the deep and wistful feeling of the lonely ranger who had always yearned for love and had never known it  belding once more practical and important as never before with mining projects and water claims to manage spoke of gales great good fortune in finding of goldhe called it desert gold  ah yes  desert gold exclaimed dicks father softly with eyes of pride  perhaps he was glad dick had found the rich claim surely he was happy that dick had won the girl he loved but it seemed to dick himself that his father meant something very different from love and fortune in his allusion to desert gold   that beautiful happy day like life or love itself could not be wholly perfect  yaqui came to dick to say goodby  dick was startled grieved and in his impulsiveness forgot for a moment the nature of the indian  yaqui was not to be changed  belding tried to overload him with gifts  the indian packed a bag of food a blanket a gun a knife a canteen and no more the whole household went out with him to the corrals and fields from which belding bade him choose a horseany horse even the loved blanco diablo  gales heart was in his throat for fear the indian might choose blanco sol and gale hated himself for a selfishness he could not help  but without a word he would have parted with the treasured sol  yaqui whistled the horses upfor the last time  did he care for them it would have been hard to say  he never looked at the fierce and haughty diablo nor at blanco sol as he raised his noble head and rang his piercing blast  the indian did not choose one of beldings whites he caught a lean and wiry broncho strapped a blanket on him and fastened on the pack  then he turned to these friends the same emotionless inscrutable dark and silent indian that he had always been  this parting was nothing to him  he had stayed to pay a debt and now he was going home  he shook hands with the men swept a dark fleeting glance over nell and rested his strange eyes upon mercedess beautiful and agitated face  it must have been a moment of intense feeling for the spanish girl  she owed it to him that she had life and love and happiness she held out those speaking slender hands  but yaqui did not touch them turning away he mounted the broncho and rode down the trail toward the river  hes going home said belding  home whispered ladd and dick knew the ranger felt the resurging tide of memory  homeacross the cactus and lava through solemn lonely days the silent lonely nights into the vast and redhazed world of desolation  thorne mercedes nell lets climb the foothill yonder and watch him out of sight said dick  they climbed while the others returned to the house  when they reached the summit of the hill yaqui was riding up the far bank of the river  he will turn to lookto wave goodby asked nell  dear he is an indian replied gale  from that height they watched him ride through the mesquites up over the river bank to enter the cactus  his mount showed dark against the green and white and for a long time he was plainly in sight  the sun hung red in a golden sky  the last the watchers saw of yaqui was when he rode across a ridge and stood silhouetted against the gold of desert skya wild lonely beautiful picture then he was gone  strangely it came to gale then that he was glad  yaqui had returned to his ownthe great spaces the desolation the solitudeto the trails he had trodden when a child trails haunted now by ghosts of his people and ever by his gods  gale realized that in the yaqui he had known the spirit of the desert that this spirit had claimed all which was wild and primitive in him  tears glistened in mercedess magnificent black eyes and thorne kissed them awaykissed the fire back to them and the flame to her cheeks  that action recalled gales earlier mood the joy of the present and he turned to nells sweet face  the desert was there wonderful constructive ennobling beautiful terrible but it was not for him as it was for the indian  in the light of nells tremulous returning smile that strange deep clutching shadow faded lost its hold forever and he leaned close to her whispering lluvia doroshower of gold
